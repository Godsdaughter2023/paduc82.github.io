<h2>            Receiving emails for another email address</h2>
                    <p>My inbox is being flooded with emails for another email address. &nbsp;I have never had this problem whilst using my tablet computer at home. &nbsp;It started when I went on a 2 week trip to France. &nbsp;The email address is for a person with the same name as me, though
 theirs has 666 at the end and the domain name is different. &nbsp;All the emails appear to be genuine, coming from a number of different senders, eg British Airways, Hotel Chocolat etc. &nbsp;I find it hard to believe that its a simple mistake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It leaves me feeling very concerned. &nbsp;What if emails addressed to me are going to others?</p>

<p>I have 2 mobile devices. &nbsp;I have an Apple Ipad Pro and a Samsung Galaxy S7 phone. &nbsp;On the Ipad, I am using the standard email software which comes with the device. On the Samsung Galaxy S7, i'm using the outlook app. &nbsp;I have also accessed my emails through
 Outlook.com on the web browser on those devices. &nbsp;I have made no updates recently. &nbsp;The only thing thats changed is my location and the fact that i'm connecting using 4G wi-fi on roaming. I'm also currently still in France, but I live in the UK. &nbsp;I have never
 encountered this problem whilst in the UK. &nbsp;My own emails do appear to be coming through still.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My gut feeling is that it will probably stop when I return back to the UK, but it should not be happening.</p>

            I am shocked that after 1 week, still no response. I have the email holders personal details coming through to my inbox. Their home address, telephone number, details of purchases that they have made. &nbsp;As I have said before, they have the same name as
 me, but their email address is different and that includes the email domain. &nbsp;This clearly isnt being taken seriously.

            This information has not helped. &nbsp;My inbox is being flooded with emails coming from what appears to be the same email address. &nbsp;The email address is displayed in the To: box of the email. The address is similar to mine, but it has 666 on the end and its
 an msn account. &nbsp;When I have looked into the hidden part of the header for these emails, it says the emails have been sent from that address. I have tried blocking them from that address, it doesn't work. &nbsp;My main access for my emails is an iPad. &nbsp;This problem
 started around the beginning of July and shows no sign of stopping. &nbsp;I have been checking the activity on my account and there doesn't appear to be anything wrong.

<p>I have the same problem.</p>
<p>The camera starts up but the capture button does not work with the auto focus selected but does if I select landscape or sport.</p>
<p>I can also take photos with auto if I use the timer on 2 sec's.</p>
<p>The capture button is ok as it activates the camera from standby and it works with video.</p>
<p>I think the software update must have a bug in it.</p>

            Hi, I am replying to everyone's q's about the 6500 slide - the worst mbl I have ever had by far. I have experienced the prob as you - seems you just have to be patient - mine eventually turned on and no matter how much cursing and swearing I did, the problem
 persists intermittently. I had charged mine too and yet it turned itself off. Damn thing. I am sure that as you use it you will notice more tech prob's.

            My 6500s was fine until I got home last night after taking a few pictures. Got home and it decided t freeze up totally, I mean it still switches on...for a few milliseconds...but then decides its better off dead (must have a lot to hide, eh? i.e. technical
 faults)<br />
It's done this before but it always comes back around after a few secons.. whenever I wanted to add any form of punctuation into my text messages it would freeze. Annoying but I could live with it. But not switiching on..that's REALLY annoying!!<br />
Other than the freezing it also does not detect my memory card anymore...why? because the back cover has become slightly bent so it can't push down this tinyy little metal thing next to the memory card in order to be able t read my card, not good.<br />
But yeah, I'm having the same problem as Niamhm and I really don't know what to do!<br />
I think I'll stick to the more simple models from now on to be honest...much more reliable!

<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I rarely have problems with BBC radio (BBC Worldservice and Radio 4) via the Internet Radio app, but Danish radio drops out, usually after max. 2 minutes when on 3G. There doesn't seem to be a problem using WiFi. Could this be a bit rate problem? I have
 a totally stable 3.5G connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideas please?</p>

<p>I have discovered that the widget Nokia Internet radio causes problem with disconnected radio streams, even the shortcut to a start screen could be a problem...sometimes when collecting emails (at least I think so)...</p>
<p>I am right now trying to listen to Nokia Internet radio by not using N I Radio widget or even the shortcut of N I Radio on any of my 3 start screens and so far much better, much much better.</p>
<p>No stuttering audio&nbsp;when for example surfing with Opera...and listening to N I Radio.</p>
<p>Just try it out.</p>

<h2>            Automatic Send, Manually Receive in Mac Outlook 2011&#63;</h2>
                    Maybe I'm crazy in my request, but I thought I would ask. I'm switching over to Microsoft Outlook after months of agony with Apple Mail and my work Exchange Account. However, there are parts of Apple Mail I miss desperately and am trying to recreate in
 Outlook. The main question is this:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>With Apple Mail I was able to send emails out automatically, but could choose to receive mail when I wanted it. That way I'm able to batch process my email, knowing it was being sent out throughout the day for others to respond, but I could choose when
 the replies and other emails came in for me to deal with.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've been messing with the schedules but it seems to one or the other: either automatic send/receive, or manual send/receive (won't send until I tell it to).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I assume there is a way, but I'm just not getting the settings right. Does anyone else have a similar set up that you could advise me on? Thanks in advance for your help.</div>
                </div>

            With&nbsp;Exchange your only option is to put&nbsp;Outlook into Work Offline mode.
<div><br />
<div>Starting with SP2,&nbsp;Outlook moved schedules for&nbsp;IMAP to the Accounts window. I don't believe&nbsp;Exchange offers a setting.&nbsp;It's just on.</div>

    <title>Templates for authors &#38; INDEX CARDS&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eclipse now  say:</h3>
<h2>            Templates for authors &#38; INDEX CARDS&#63;</h2>
                    <div>Hi all,</div>
<div>
<p>I'm wondering if there's any way I can have one Word file&nbsp;as a wiki for novel writing?&nbsp;My novel has all these character and place entries. I'd love it&nbsp;to be&nbsp;easy to&nbsp;navigate around that super-sized document quickly on a Samsung tablet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>'m after a character template that has the usual headings: character appearance, background, motives, etc, that can be customized and navigated easily on a tablet. (Is Outline view not a thing on tablets?)</p>
</div>
<div><br />
Also, is there anything or any mode like Index Cards for plotting? I'd love some kind of index cards template that let me move plot ideas around quickly.</div>

<div>
<p><strong>Wish List?&nbsp;</strong>Lastly, is there any news on adopting a Scrivener or Storyist style of Index cards that actually attach to and can move the text? Scrivener and Storyist use
<strong>Index Cards </strong>to help authors plot longer novels. It's amazing. It lets you bullet point the top 10 moments in each chapter, see the whole book as a series of index cards, and then if you decide to move a scene from the middle to the front of
 the novel, just drag the index card <em>and any writing attached to it moves as well!
</em>It's like Microsoft Word's <strong>Outline View</strong>, but avoids having ugly legalese headings all the way through your text to do it. Instead of moving report-like headings inside the text around, whole index cards can be attached to each chunk of
 text. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Another great benefit of this design is that if you suddenly get a great idea for a
<strong>scene</strong> but only have time to jot down the bare ideas, the Index card is the obvious space for it. It's not even trying to be 'writing'. It's just raw-ideas! The writing comes later when you're in the zone. It's such an incredibly powerful way
 to write, I can't believe Microsoft Word and Google Docs don't have it yet. See video here about Scrivener (Storyist's is similar). Authors are expecting this now. Any news?</p>

<h2>            eMail client for E72-1 with S&#47;MIME-function</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>with the latest Softwareupdate i think the eMail client of the phone is quite good,</p>
<p>but i do also want to use the S/MIME to en-/decrypt eMail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In several forums i find a lot of eMail clients, but none with S/MIME.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does any one of you know such an client?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much!!</p>

<p>FrontPage has been replaced by Expression Web (EW).&nbsp; Note that this is a replacement, NOT an upgrade.<br />
EW is designed for crosss browser, standards compliant web sites - FrontPage was designed for websites where IE5 (notice - not IE6) is the most popular browser.<br />
There is also SharePoint Designer (SD) - this is designed for Office workers using SharePoint based websites. Sharing Office documents between workers is a fundamental idea behind the program - but it can be used for ordinary web sites.<br />
SD 2007 was a mixture of FrontPage 2003 and Expression Web v1.&nbsp; SharePoint 2010 is now out, but I think it is targetted even more at SharePoint than at general websites.<br />
SharePoint Designer is Free, EW is available (with Expression Design and Expression Encoder) for $79 upgrade price (any version of Office, FrontPage or Dreamweaver qualifies for the upgrade price.)<br />
A 60 day trial of Expression products is available from <a href="http://microsoft.com/expression." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://microsoft.com/expression.</a><br />
You will have to learn HTML and CSS to get the best out of EW and SD.</p>

    <title>help Needed With Hacked Microsoft Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonscott1  say:</h3>
<h2>            help Needed With Hacked Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I was unlucky enough to have my Microsoft account accessed by Russian hackers. They changed my password, removed my mobile number and put their email address as the 2nd recovery step. The then turned on 2 step verification. After 8 calls to customer
 service I have been told this forum is the only place I can get help from. I have filled out the acrs form but this didn't help as it says it wont be looked at as 2 step verification has been turned on. Not only can I not log into my Hotmail account but I
 can't log into my Skype which I have purchased a Skype number with for my business so no-one can contact my business. I received emails to my alternate account informing me the password had been changed, my personal information had been removed and that 2
 step verification had been turned on. all emails had a link to click if this "Wasn't me that made the changes" but the first thing I am asked is to log in which I cant do as I don't know what they changed the password to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone that can offer help or advise please on how I can recover my account or point me in the direction of a department or somebody I can speak to at Microsoft to resolve this situation as its been 2 weeks of being pushed from pillar to post and
 I still don't seem any closer to re-gaining access to my accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

<h2>            Imported vectors SVG&#47;EMF not displayed properly in Powerpoint 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Powerpoint 2016 version 1802 build 9029.2167</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inserted EMF and SVG files (multiple tested from various sources) not displayed properly - if scaled they lose resolution and become blurry and pixelated. They are properly visualised as vectors ONLY if you click on Format&gt;&gt;Convert to shape and treat it
 like an object (but this should not be necessary and is a real problem for me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previous versions of Powerpoint had no SVG support, but did have EMF. So, using Powerpoint 2010, I tested exactly the same EMF files (that had not worked in 2016), same process of Insert Picture,&nbsp; select an EMF, and they are displayed properly (never pixelated,
 infinitely scalable etc), without any need to convert to an object first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some setting or option I am missing here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All best,</p>
<p>Matthew</p>

<p>Hi Matthew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is possible that the vectors are being compressed due to size restrictions resulting in them losing precision or resolution. In line with this, we suggest that you disable compression. Here's how:<br />
<br />
1. Click on File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced.<br />
2. Under "Image Size &amp; Quality" section, check "Do not compress images in file".</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest that you share your feedback and experience on the<a href="https://powerpoint.uservoice.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> PowerPoint UserVoice</a> page.&nbsp; This will help our team provide a better user experience in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need additional assistance.</p>

<h2>            How do I &#34;Subtotal&#34; a &#34;SUMIF&#34; calculation&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I have a spreadsheet which filters out certain types of projects. &nbsp;I then need to separate out types of project, based on their code (PA in the following example), and add together the value in a cell (AM) to create a sub-total at the top of the page.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Using SUMIF includes all the hidden (filtered out) cells so I think I need to use the subtotal command but unsure how to get it to work. &nbsp;Searched the forums but can't find exactly what I'll looking for. &nbsp;They all seem to be referring to counting cells
 rather than adding values together.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My calculation is:
<div>=SUMIF($C$7:$C$999,"PA*",AM7:AM999)</div>

Can't get this to work. &nbsp;I've unfiltered everything to check it. &nbsp;Can I clarify that I'm looking for a row with "PA" in the cell on column C. &nbsp;The Cell is always in the form PA1234 or W1234 or a text term. &nbsp;(They are all project codes). &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I want to add together all the values in cell AM associated with these cells. &nbsp;The formula also has to subtotal when I filter the table. &nbsp;Hope that makes sense.
<div>
<div><br />
<div>Sticking to the PA one, the results is not coming back an error, just that it's zero. &nbsp;I've just evaluated it and it has taken every line to be FALSE. &nbsp;Hence why its zero. &nbsp;So I think it's looking for cells which only has PA in them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried doing "PA*" which I thought was wildcard, but that hasn't solved it. &nbsp;Any ideas?</div>
<div><br />
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I've understood correctly you want to sum <strong>visible</strong> rows in column AM where the corresponding row in Col C begins with PA. If that's correct then that's what my formula does. I uploaded a working workbook to my skydrive; link below, and
 the file is called GerryBrannigan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT. A couple of thoughts:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you sure the cells in Col C beging with PA? Maybe you have some rogue spaces at the beginning.</p>
<p>Are you sure there are real numbers in Col AM and not text that looks like numbers?</p>

            <p>Yes, I unlinked the account and relinked it working from the Live web-based&nbsp;email.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Did it with a time span of maybe 10 or 15&nbsp;minutes. Perhaps I should wait longer for the Live system to recognize unlinking, although it seemed to work correctly right away after relinking.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I just did reboot as I have dot net on my pc now for different purposes, but thought maybe, hmm. nope. As of latest pc reboot and logging in to Live email. I am showing only the previous day email up to midnight for linked email. At the lavabit.com website
 I can log in and see everything is updating normally. I see at lavabit email I have 15 emails so far for today. Most emails tend to show up in AM for me. All was working fine until a week or two ago.

<p>I have a similar problem. I have two linked yahoo email addresses, an initial one (which I never send or receive from) and a second one that links to the initial one and is the one that I always use and get replies to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second one has worked perfectly for years, but as of yesterday night it can no longer receive emails.&nbsp; The initial one still can, but it's now effectively useless because I never use it.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Can anyone help?&nbsp;As of late yesterday I&nbsp;now&nbsp;receive&nbsp;no incoming mail at all!</p>

                    Who gave Microsoft the right to tell me what I can load on MY WP7 phone?&nbsp; I bought and paid for it.&nbsp; It is mine.&nbsp; but no.... MS in thier infinite wisdom thought it would be a good idea to lock people out (unless you pay them a so called developer fee).&nbsp;
 It's like I buy a red Chevy and I want to get it painted blue.... but GM says I don't have permission to paint MY car blue.&nbsp; Congratulations MS.... You have successfully downgraded your product to 2002 levels.&nbsp; You can now start losing money like the iPhone.&nbsp;
 Except that you dont have the iPad to prop you up or the short term fad of the iPhone.&nbsp; ANDROID is now the best thing going.&nbsp; Watch and see..

</blockquote>
<br />
Well, since you purchased the phone, then I'd say you should have known what you were getting before you made the purchase.&nbsp; Sounds to me like you assumed the phone would be similar to windows mobile and didn't read many reviews of the phone before you dropped
 your cash for one.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I'm sorry you are disappointed with your purchase.&nbsp; It is true that Android is probably the most flexible phone out there in terms of user options and user hackability, so if that's what you're looking for in a phone, you probably need to return your windows
 phone and get whatever Android phone suits you.&nbsp; Hopefully, you haven't waited too long and you can make an exchange at your carrier (unlike cars, most carriers have a 30 day return policy)<br />

<h2>            Optima font issue</h2>
                    Our small newspaper is equipped with four identical PC compatible stations, with Adobe InDesign for page layout. Identical fonts are used on all four - or so we thought. All of a sudden one of the four stations, according to its user, says that Optima
 (truetype) no longer functions correctly. Our IT department has worked in an effort to try and fix it. Any ideas, suggestions, clues?&nbsp;

            Optima is a commercial font (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optima" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optima</a>). &nbsp;Microsoft licenses a number of fonts to provide with its products, but Optima does not seem ever to have been one of them (see
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/</a>). Nor is it one of the fonts often included with HP laser printers. It may have been supplied by InDesign.

                    I saw the thread from 2010 and 2013 about opening old PowerPoint files.&nbsp; None of the suggested solutions seem to work very well.&nbsp; Has there been any update in the interim?

            <p>Hi Don</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be surprised if MSFT offered a fix for this. They have stated that the 95 format is a security risk and I would guess they are unlikely to help people use it. (I'm not agreeing just stating the likely facts)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.pptalchemy.co.uk/convert_PPT_95.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">The Zamzar method
</a>is fairly reliable as long as the files are not corrupt (old files can be) but you cannot convert in batches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you acquire a copy of 2002/ 2003 office it is fairly easy to code a batch converter. Old versions often appear cheaply on ebay but you need to watch out for scams and I'm not sure they run in W10.</p>

            <p>Yes, 2003 is "old" enough, close enough to the older versions to probably still be able to open them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also try using LibreOffice to open the files then SAVE AS to DOCX format.

<h2>            Automatically switch from touch to mouse mode and vice versa</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my former Surface Pro 3, Outlook was automatically switching from touch to mouse modes, and the other way around. Now I got a Surface Pro 4 (wow!) and installed Office, insider 64bit as on the other machine, and the mode doesn't seem to switch automatically.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me whether there's a setting somewhere I'm overlooking?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>A question,</div>
<div>
<p>Is this issue specific with Outlook or have you noticed similar thing happening with other application?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Ensure to turn on touch mode in Outlook using quick access toolbar in top of the ribbon. Also, check if the modes switches with all the features in Outlook.( like replying, quick delete, move/copy folder etc.)</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>You may also try repairing Office application on Surface Pro 3 and see if it helps.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried and it's the same with Word, for example. To be clear:</p>
<p>- The Touch mode, when I manually switch to it, is working as expected.</p>
<p>- What I expect to happen is that when I disconnect the keyboard from the Surface, and the Tablet mode switches ON automatically, the touch mode in office apps should also switch ON automatically. This is not the case. It was the case on my Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea?</p>
        </p>
