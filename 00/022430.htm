<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Samsung i830 (which is awful) which I'm trying to sync to outlook.&nbsp; I've got appoinment records from years back I want to be sure I don't lose.&nbsp; When I set up my partnership and did my sync, it only brought in appointments from one month back.&nbsp;
 Is there any way to get all my old stuff sync'd in?</p>
<p>Thanks for anyone's help!</p>

<h2>            Shared mailbox and multiple domains</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have 2 domain names assigned to my Office365 account and already have a shared info (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) mailbox setup on my first domain. When I try and create a shared mailbox with the same name on domain 2 (info:domain2.com) I get an error suggesting
 that the mailbox already exists</p>
<p>Does Office365 not allow me to create 2 seperate shared mailboxes on different domains with the same name?</p>
<p>Hope someone can help and provide me with some option as I need to have 2 seperate info@ accounts for both my domains.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>I have done a test from my side. I also have 2 addresses appearing in my SMTP address list and I cannot delete the unwanted one either.</p>
<p>Actually, it doesn’t matter whether the unwanted SMTP address can be deleted or not. To create 2 shared mailboxes on different domains with the same name, you can follow the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Set one of the domains as the default one in the Office 365 admin center. </p>
<p>2. Create a shared mailbox whose email address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, then create another shared mailbox whose email address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.
</p>
<p>3. Double click the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** shared mailbox, then click email address. There you can see 2 SMTP addresses in the SMTP address list. The one that is in bold is the default SMTP address. Double click it and change it to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>4. Click OK to save the changes.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you encounter any problems when performing the steps above. We further assist you.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mouran</p>

<h2>            Inserting Sub-Project - &#34;Already linked through another task chain&#34; error</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to insert an unlinked sub-project into a master project and I am receiving the following error "these tasks can't be linked because they're already linked through another task chain".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done some investigating essentially stripping down the (sub-)project into a small number of tasks and have found that the source of the error is due to the fact that I have more than one task with the same predecessor (i.e the project kick off milestone
 task).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way-around to prevent this error? If I ignore this error when I link the sub-project kick-off milestone task to the master project kick-off milestone task the tasks in the sub-project do not update to follow sequentially and remain with the same
 dates in the sub-project.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My intention is to add a number of large sub-projects consisting of multiple tasks within summary tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou in advance</p>

</p><p>Thankyou for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was in the process of replying and trying to figure out what I was doing wrong as it seemed such a simple thing. However, coincidentally I have had an MS office update this morning and now everything seems to be running normal. Exact same files - no issues.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>VLookup returning the &#35;N&#47;A error and I can&#39;t figure out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomaswilletto  say:</h3>
<h2>            VLookup returning the &#35;N&#47;A error and I can&#39;t figure out why&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I've used the VLookup function successfully in one workbook - it is a coding of expenses for 2016. I enter a account number, Excel runs off to compare to my list of accounts and returns the name. Works GREAT!







I then saved the workbook via the "Save As..." for a new 2017 work book.








NOW, when I modify (or reenter manually) the VLookup function for to search the data, I get the dreaded
#N/A error returned. Formatting of data array searched is the same. Format of the cell to which the answer is returned is formatted the same as in the original
 workbook. 








Any ideas of what has happened? Here is the actual formula:






=VLOOKUP($D14,'NS Accts for VLookup'!$A$6:$B$220,2,FALSE)







The formula looks for the information on the worksheet tab "NS Accts for VLookup". I've triple and quadruple checked that the data array is described correctly.









Any help is much appreciated, thanks!

<p>Between the two workbooks, are the data in D14 the same?&nbsp; What is in D14: a constant or a formula?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you did "Save As...", what extension did you use: xls, xlsx (xlsm), csv, etc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mention an account "number". A common mistake is to enter a numeric value in the lookup table (A6:A220) and a text value (that looks numeric) in lookup value cell, or vice versa.&nbsp; What does ISTEXT(D14) return? What does ISTEXT(Ax) return, where Ax is
 the cell reference with the value that you believe should match?</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick reply, Joe! It's either a formula "=$M$13" which refers to an account number that returns the same account name, OR it is a number value copied from another worksheet. BOTH are formatted as 'General', both in the original (2016) workbook
 and the new (2017) version.<br />
<br />
Both files are saved as .xlsx<br />
<br />
ISTEXT(D14) returns "FALSE" for both the $D14 AND Ax<br />

<p>Thanks for all the feedback and thoughts. I was able to secure help on a more local level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last thought though - the issue isn't/wasn't getting VLookup to work properly. It did in my original workbook, which by the way had been generated via a "Save As..." from yet an earlier version for the year 2015. So, I was confident it would be a good method
 for starting on 2017. Alas, somewhere in the process, the VLookup stopped working. So it's not an issue with the formula, but something is happening when I save and revise for the new workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for all the feedback. IF my local help and I figure out what happened, I shall return to post that info.</p>
<p>

                    <p>I have a ~2GB Outlook 2016 (Windows) .pst file that has about 8 email accounts (all POP/SMTP), as well as my calendar, contacts, etc.&nbsp; I have been paying for the monthly Office 2016 (full suite) but really don't think I need to anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my question: Is there a way to import the .pst into Outlook Online (outlook.com) with ALL email accounts (e.g. Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.) as well as calendar and contacts just like you would do from one Outlook client to another?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The articles I've read only talk about importing into an Outlook.com email address, which is not what I want to do.</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player on Vista</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have my music collection, 411 GB , all WAV, on a Vista computer, without support and slowly dying.</p>
<p>I would like to transfer Windows Media Player contents, to a WMP on Windows 10.</p>
<p>I had manually typed in thousands of artists, song titles into WMP, gave them ratings, classified them into genres.</p>
<p>I have tried opening my music files with WMP on Windows 10 but the result is a complete mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can copy exact WMP contents from my Vista unit to a WMP Windows 10 PC?</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi - the problem here is that you have maintained your library in wav. format. I am assuming that when you say you have manually added information this has been done by using the
<p>Unfortunately with wav. files this information is only logged in WMP and does not attach itself to the individual files as it would with wma or mp3. The only possibility that might work (and I have never seen this suggested, or tried it myself!) is copying
 over the library data files from your app data folder (which is a hidden folder in 'Users') and see if that can be read in your new pc. I'm by no means certain it will, but it won't hurt to try. Want to experiment? Let me know and I'll show you what you need
 to try copying... - Ric.</p>

<p>It bis exactly that. My descriptions were entered through "edit".</p>
<p>I do not know where the folder with WMP descriptions is. Could you please point me to it?</p>
<p>Also, I presume my music on a new PC would have to be on the same letter drive for the new WMP to find the location of music files.</p>
<p>I can experiment as otherwise it may be months before I rewrite fie descriptions, ratings and custom genres.</p>

<p>I had a quick look around in another forum and found the above link (fifth item - How do I move my library?) - which unfortunately seems to suggest my idea will not work. I was concerned that the links would be broken and that seems to be the case... This
 has always been a drawback with wav. files - the sound quality is great but the metadata capability is non-existent - disappointing when you have done all that work. Apologies for apparently falsely raising your hopes.</p>
<p>We could look at some other options that could reduce the amount of work you need to do to put things right... firstly - do you have the majority of your library contents on CD? - R.</p>

            <p>There would be limitations on what you could do with XP (and very soon) Vista on a new machine because of the lack of MS support. Using one of the lossless formats (wma. or flac) would give better tagging support and you really should not be able to hear
 any difference between those and wav. files and they are both supported in W10 (tagging is limited on flac) - but if you really prefer to stick with wav. you could re-edit your files using the free 'Audacity' program which does give you the ability to add
 some information to the re-saved files. It would take a little longer than renaming in WMP but at least you'd never need to do it again! It's a safe download (from the official site) and I have been using it for years with no problems. When opening wav. files
 in Audacity it advises you to make a copy first just for safety. I have only ever had it corrupt a file once but that shows it can happen! Here's the 'about' link for you to peruse...</p>

    <title>Why are foreign characters in U.S. program description&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> newsflash40  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why are foreign characters in U.S. program description&#63;</h2>
                    Why are foreign characters appearing in the sub-heading (underneath the title) in many programs in the U.S. version of Marketplace?<br />
<br />
For example, a string of what appear to be Japanese characters appear&nbsp;Shakespeare-Othello: 曉騰國際股份有限公司<br />
<br />
On my phone, where the default font doesn't have these characters, it appears as a string of boxes.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should reserve judgment on how something like this can happen, but it appears to be an incredibly stupid, rookie mistake on the part of the MS Windows&nbsp;Marketplace Mobile folks.&nbsp;&nbsp;And given the idiocy we're seeing in not having any flexibility on where
 to install programs,&nbsp;it doesn't&nbsp;surprise me in the least.

<blockquote>So does the publisher's name have an English translation? Why would they put foreign characters on a US website?</blockquote>
<p>When registering for the Windows Marketplace for Mobile a publisher selects the name by which they will be known and that name will be used for all countries to which the the publisher makes their software available.
<br />
<br />
Proper names usually don't have true translations. For example,&nbsp;how would you translate the name "Alejandro" to&nbsp;Arabic?&nbsp; While there are portions of a proper name that may be translated the name as a whole may not have a representation in another language.
 In the above case the only part of the name that I translated was the end (international co, LTD). The rest of it is a transliteration&nbsp;(a rerepresentation of the phonetic components of the name) but not a translation.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If an entity wants to have a name that is more suitable for those in another culture then it is usually up to that entity to decide on what that representation will be.&nbsp; Some times the names&nbsp;are uniform&nbsp;across cultures (ex: if I same the word&nbsp;name "Toyota"
 or "Nintendo" in various countries people will know to what I am refering, though there are multiple written representations for those names). Other times those names may be localized (ex: If I say "ringo" (アップル)&nbsp;in any place other than Japan most people won't
 recognize I am talking about Apple computer, though Apple uses both both theirn English and Japanese names on their site).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
</p>
<blockquote>We'll just have to disagree on this, because it is stupid and shows the lack of polish in Microsoft's Marketplace.</blockquote>
It seems to be standard practice to list the name of an entity with the name that was chosen by that entity. It is done this way in the Windows Marketplace for Mobile, Apple App store, and Android Marketplace.&nbsp; The distinguishing difference in what you encountered
 (the squares being displayed instead of the characters that represent the entity's name) is a side affect of most Windows Mobile OEMs are selective in which fonts that they include on a device. They tend to keep the device localized for a single market&nbsp; and
 on occasions for multipleEuropean markets. The operating system itself supports it if the proper fonts are installed. Since your device doesn't have a Chinese font installed it is unable to properly display the name of the entity. It's possible to install
 fonts from your computer to your device so that it could display these characters but there would be little advantage in doing so. In addition to consuming around 30 Megs of space if you don't know Chinese then you would have a properly displayed but otherwise
 unreadable name on the screen.
<blockquote>And what the mods here propose as answers---aren't.<br />
</blockquote>
<p>I want to make sure there is no confusion here. Since no moderators have proposed any answers in this thread as answers and since I had proposed my initial reply as an answer I want to make sure that you don't think me to be a moderator. I propsed my initial
 reply as an answer because best I can tell you were seeking an explanation as to why there are
<em>foreign characters</em> displayed in an English marketplace.&nbsp; The explanation that I gave was that the character's were the name of the publisher. If that doesn't sufficiently&nbsp;answer your question or if I misunderstood your question then could you provide
 more information on what it is that you are seeking to know?&nbsp; </p>

            What I'd really like is for Microsoft to have a consistent and professional look in the Marketplace.&nbsp; Displaying apps on my phone where some&nbsp;show the name of the developer, and some show only boxes because the (English) phone doesn't have a Chinese font,
 is completely ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I'm not an Apple fanboy by any means.&nbsp; But I can guarantee it would never look that way in Apple's app store.<br />
<br />
Marketplace is poorly designed and this is just one example.&nbsp; If you need another, just check the thread on apps that can only be installed to main memory.

<p>The large orange blocks on the first page contain content controls that are inserted from Insert &gt; Quick Parts &gt; Document Properties. The box labeled Title is the Title document property, but the Subtitle box was originally the Status document property (its
 name was changed later).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The orange text in the header also consists of Document Property content controls inserted the same way, using the same document properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each of the items in the Document Properties list is linked ("mapped" in Microsoft jargon) to a bit of XML in the document's file. When you update any one of their content controls, all the controls mapped to the same XML automatically update with the same
 value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The appearances of the various content controls are set by applying different paragraph styles to them.</p>
<p>

            I did eventually figure this out, but by using custom XML and the XML Mapping feature in Word 2013. That doesn't seem to be an option in Word 2010, but it functions the same in the end.

</strong>I've tried deleting the playready folder. I've refreshed my desktop and did a hard reset on my phone but the problem persists. At this point I'm not sure how to proceed but since I have Xbox music pass I'd like to be able to download music.

<h2>            My Nokia 7705 won&#39;t let me sync music from my computer&#33;</h2>
                    I've been looking for help with this for weeks now and i can't find a bit of it anywhere. I wanted to put music on my phone so i went out and bought a micro sd card and tried to load music onto it using a usb to connect to my phone. I've tried literally
 just about everything. I switched over to USB Mass Storage mode and created a music folder and etc, etc,. But even after i put a couple of songs on the thing my phone still says there's nothing there. I also tried doing the Nokia Ovi Suite thing and apparently
 my phone model isn't compatible with it. I'm completely surprised by the lack of support from the manufacturing website. Am I the only one having this problem?<br />
PLEASE HELP! ):

            y ARE MAKIN ME LAUGH NJ_7:D, ITS NOT THAT SHAKING HANDS!<br />
Welcome logo can be changed through the settings of any SERIES 60 1ST,2ND or 3RD EDITION PHONES.<br />
I often change my welcome logo and did never face such bad incident that even after the latest fw upgrade the N73 faces!<br />
tO KDJD:WHERE ARE Y DUDE?<br />
I mean each time y change yr welcome pic it tends to reboot or it only occured once?<br />
If it repeats then do a soft reset.

            nj_7 .. there is an option to change the welcome logo by :<br />
<br />
menu --&gt; tools --&gt; settings --&gt; phone --&gt; general --&gt; welcome note / logo<br />
<br />
it gives me three options (default, text and image) .. when I choose specific image, the mobile phone stop responding then I should reboot it (by my self), even my N73 has the last version of firmware ...<br />
<br />
so any ideas would be greatly appreciated ..<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

            Okay, a soft reset may help to reorder the disordered ones.<br />
And a hard reset does quite like a disk error checkin' like in winXP although it also cleans up phone memory.

            Did you buy the phone with the SIM card? Or was it SIM free? Note that you need to have a SIM card inserted in order to use telephony services. Basically there is no way to find out your number from your phone itself. See your documents. If not and if
 the SIM is inserted and is active, call a friend who has CLI facility, then your number will be shown up in his/her phone. Or simply send a text message to a friend with a mobile and see what's the number. Your network might provide with alternative solutions
 to find your number too.

            If the number is stored on the SIM card (very few network operators put it there), you can, at least in S60 based phones see it via: Contacts -&gt; Options -&gt; SIM contacts -&gt; SIM directory -&gt; Options -&gt; My numbers<br />
<br />
But as stated, the number is rarely there (I've never had a SIM card from any operator where the number would have been on the card, and I've used GSM mobile phones since 1994).

            If your SIM was in a separate package the number is sometimes on this package itself. Search near the barcode.

<p>Which app did you go for?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some apps try to authorize you through a mobile phone number (they send and SMS back and forth) for legal reasons or to spy on you, and therefore need a SIM inserted. However, if you go for a VoIP/SIP based apps like Linphone or Zoiper, you are able to use
 an existing SIP account.</p>

    <title>HELP Outlook.com contacts deleted after Android update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve maytum  say:</h3>
<h2>            HELP Outlook.com contacts deleted after Android update</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 a few weeks ago.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The next day I noticed some Outlook.com contacts were missing on my phone (my wife's mobile for example).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Outlook on my phone for email and contacts and have two accounts mapped O365 Home and also O365 E3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ignored the problem for a few weeks because it has happened before and last time was fixed by deleting and re-adding one of my O365 accounts.&nbsp; But this time not the case.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worryingly the contacts have completely vanished from my O365 account. When I logon to outlook.com from a browser and go into the People app there are some missing contacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also notice that many photos in my contacts have gone. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am worried, very worried.&nbsp; Have I lost 10 years of contacts?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I restore these?&nbsp; I cannot find anything in deleted items or deleted contacts!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Roberta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying, the links didn't really help.&nbsp; No deleted contacts unfortunately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's some more information;</p>
<p>- the web based People app behind Outlook.com </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; still has missing contacts</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; many of these contacts appear to have lost phone numbers but still have email addresses</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; could this be why my phone is not showing a name when some people call</p>
<p>- the People app installed on Win10</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; This DOES have more contacts and the contacts have phone numbers</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Why the inconsistency from the online and installed people app?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Below shows that People app is synching with the online version</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4205f5c2-890f-4db0-8f42-2e5eca6af47c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4205f5c2-890f-4db0-8f42-2e5eca6af47c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Skype online&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; many contacts appear in Skype with phone numbers </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I never store contact in Skype, so how did they get here? </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's as if Microsoft have split my contacts up and moved the phone numbers into Skype and left the other information in the People app online and the install People apps is merging back together?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's either Microsoft of Samsung who have broken this and it's annoying. &nbsp; May be a "merge duplicates" algorithm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I merge all these contacts back together because outlook.live.com and skype.com and my installed People app and Outlook on my mobile are all an inconsistent mess?</p>

 to copy it out of source, even trying to copy it out of the email crashes outlook)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this specific code is in the mail, outlook can't handle it and crashes.</p>
<p>It is from a communication with fedex, we don't no how and why the original image got relinked/changed to this url. So now we have to delete all Images with the X in the mail so that it works again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any workaround other than disable automatic image download or plain-text send?</p>
<p>Outlook should be able to handle such broken links.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 archive.pst constantly shows that it&#39;s being modified</h2>
                    I recently updated to Outlook 2010.&nbsp; I've been using archiving for my pst file forever, but am having a strange problem with it recently.&nbsp; Every time my primary pst file changes, the archive.pst file appears to get updated.&nbsp; I'm talking about every few
 minutes.&nbsp; I tried turning off auto-archiving, so I could just do it manually every month.&nbsp; But the archive file still shows a constantly updating "modified" date/time.<br />
<br />
In doing some more checking on this, I'm now suspicious that the archive file isn't actually changing at all, since its size isn't changing.&nbsp; The reason I thought it was being updated is that when I check it in the Windows file explorer, the "Date Modified"
 column always shows a date/time within the last few minutes.&nbsp; Why would it show as "modified" in this situation if archiving is not actually happening?<br />
<br />
Help, please.<br />

Do you have the Outlook Automatic Backup tool installed on the system?</p>
<p>
If not, try creating a new Profile in Outlook and check if it helps:</p>

<h2>            How do I remove spyware from my windows 7 phone&#63;</h2>
                    I have a couple of phones for my small business. One of my phones was stolen and recovered with spy ware attached. now it is affecting other phones in my modest business.

            <p>Sounds more like the Windows Live account (or any account on the phone that syncs contacts) was comprimised since you really can't install spyware without hacking the phone.</p>
<p>Again, hard reset the phone and change passwords.</p>

<h2>            Access Row source not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have an Access form. This form has one field called CR Raiser, which uses a table called Contacts to get a persons name, and uses the following code in the row source. The table is populated using another form to enter personal details, name, number
 etc. It also asks for workgroup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SELECT Contacts.ID, Contacts.[First Name] &amp; " " &amp; Contacts.[Last Name] AS Expr1 FROM Contacts ORDER BY Contacts.[Last Name];
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second field is called Assignee Group. I want this field to use the same contacts table, but instead of using the above code, i just want it to list the entered workgroups. Is there a code i need to enter in the "Row Source" field similar to the above
 code?</p>

            If the Assignee Group is functionally determined by CR Raiser, then you should not have a column for it in the table to which your form is bound.&nbsp; That introduces redundancy; the table is not normalized to Third Normal Form (3NF) and is consequently open
 to the risk of update anomalies.&nbsp; Instead you should include an unbound text box control in the form to show the value from the Contacts table.<br />
<br />
Firstly amend the RowSource property of the CR Raiser combo box to:<br />
<br />
SELECT ID, [Assignee Group],[First Name] &amp; " " &amp; [Last Name] FROM Contacts ORDER BY [Last Name];
<br />
<br />
and amend its ColumnWidths property to 0cm;0cm;8cm (Access will automatically convert to inches if you are not using metric units).<br />
<br />
Then set the ControlSource property of the unbound text box to:<br />
<br />
=[CR Raiser].Column(1)<br />
<br />
where CR Raiser is the name of the bound combo box.&nbsp; The Column property is zero-based, so Column(1) is the second column, Assignee Group.<br />
<br />
If the Assignee Group is not functionally determined by CR Raiser, i.e. its value can legitimately be amended form that in the form's table from that for the selected contact in the Contacts table, then set up the CR Raiser combo box in exactly this way, but
 this time include a text box bound to an Assignee Group column in the form's table, and in the AfterUpdate event procedure of the CR Raiser combo box assign a value to the Assignee Group control with:<br />
<br />
[Assignee Group] = [CR Raiser].Column(1)<br />

            <p>I feel i should already have mentioned this, but my Access knowledge is very very basic. I did it many years ago but have now forgotten most of it, so what you have put above i do not understand. Sorry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try to explain the issue in more detail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a table called Contacts. Within this table there are multiple fields. These include First Name, Last Name and workgroup, amongst others. To enter information into this table i have a form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then have a seperate table called "Issues". Again i have set up a form to complete the data entry for this. The fields required are as follows</p>
<ol>
<li>CR Number </li><li>CR Raiser - this is based on the names entered into the Contacts table and uses the code mentioned above
</li><li>CR Workgroup&nbsp;- this i cannot get to work. I want it to use the Contacts table to show a list of possible entries, or allow the user to over type and enter anything
</li><li>Change Date </li><li>Task Number - * </li><li>Status </li><li>Issue </li><li>TT Impacted - * </li><li>Time - * </li><li>Comments</li></ol>
<p>Now the 3 entries with * - when i enter the data into these fields, it does not copy across to the table "Issues".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps a bit. Happy to discuss further or to try and send a copy of the form to show you</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Let's first deal with the problem of the values entered into the Task Number, TT Impacted and Time controls in the form not being inserted into the columns in the Issues table.&nbsp; The form should have as its RecordSource property either the name of the Issues
 table or a query which returns al the columns from the table.&nbsp; Using a query is generally better as it allows you to order the records on one or more columns so that they appear in a logical order in the form.<br />
<br />
Within the form you should have controls, text boxes in this case, whose ControlSource property is in each case the name of the relevant column in the table, i.e. Task Number, TT Impacted or Time.&nbsp; Note however that naming a column Time is not a good idea as
 Time is the name of a built in function, so as a 'reserved' word should be avoided as an object name.&nbsp; Something more specifically descriptive like CR_Time or similar would be better.<br />
<br />
You should then have no difficulty entering data into the controls and it being assigned to the relevant column in the current row in the table when the form is close, you move to another record or otherwise explicitly save the record.<br />
<br />
As regards the CR Workgroup column in the Issues table, the first question to be addressed is whether that column is either necessary or desirable.&nbsp; As I said in my first reply this depends on whether it is functionally determined by the contact or not.&nbsp; What
 this means is that when you select a contact as the CR Raiser should the value of CR Workgroup in the Issues table always be the value of Workgroup in the row in the Contacts table for the selected contact?&nbsp; Or is it legitimate for the value of CR Workgroup
 in the Issues table to differ from that value?&nbsp; If the former then you don't need the column in Issues and should return the value from Contacts in a computed control as I described in my earlier post, changing the column names in the combo box's RowSource
 property to the actual names.&nbsp; BTW I should have mentioned that the CR Raiser's combo box's ColumnCount property should be changed to 3 in this scenario.<br />
<br />
If on the other hand the value can legitimately differ from the value in Contacts you will need to address a fundamental design issue in your database.&nbsp; You will firstly need to introduce a Workgroups table if you do not currently have one.&nbsp; This will be a
 table with one row for each possible workgroup, so would be set up like this:<br />
<br />
WorkGroups<br />
....WorkgroupID (PK)<br />
....Workgroup<br />
<br />
The primary key WorkgroupID column can for convenience be an autonumber.<br />
<br />
Before doing anything further back up the database.<br />
<br />
You then need to fill this table with the names of all workgroups currently listed in Contacts, using the following append query:<br />
<br />
INSERT INTO Workgroups(Workgroup)<br />
SELECT DISTINCT Workgroup <br />
FROM Contacts<br />
WHERE Workgroup&nbsp; IS NOT NULL;<br />
<br />
You next need to add a WorkGroupID column, of long integer data type, to Contacts and insert values into it with the following update query:<br />
<br />
UPDATE Contacts INNER JOIN Workgroups<br />
ON Contacts.Workgroup = Workgroups.Workgroup<br />
SET Contacts.WorkgroupID = Workgroups.WorkgroupID;<br />
<br />
Once you are happy that the new WorkgroupID column in Contacts has the correct values you can delete the redundant Workgroup column from Contacts.&nbsp; Then create a relationship beteen Contacts and Workgroups and enforce referential integrity.<br />
<br />
Whether or not you need a Workgroup column in Contacts as discussed above, you should do the above in any case; it's just a matter of good database design.<br />
<br />
If on the basis of the discussion above you conclude that a CR Workgroup column is legitimately required in the Issues table, this should be of a long integer data type and its bound control in the issues form should be a combo box set up as follows:<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT WorkgroupID, Workgroup FROM Workgroups ORDER BY Workgroup;<br />
<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp; 0cm<br />
<br />
If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert the last one.&nbsp; The important thing is that the dimension is zero to hide the first column.<br />
<br />
For selecting a workgroup in a contacts form you'd use a combo box set up in the same way.<br />
<br />
To enter a workgroup not currently represented in the Workgroups table you can out the following code in the NotInList event procedures of the workgroup combo boxes in both the issues and contacts forms:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim ctrl As Control<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strSQL As String, strMessage As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set ctrl = Me.ActiveControl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strMessage = "Add " &amp; NewData &amp; " to list?"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSQL = "INSERT INTO Workgroups(Workgroup) VALUES(""" &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NewData &amp; """)"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If MsgBox(strMessage, vbYesNo + vbQuestion) = vbYes Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CurrentDB.Execute strSQL, dbFailOnError<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response = acDataErrAdded<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response = acDataErrContinue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ctrl.Undo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
When the user types a new workgroup name into the combo box and confirms it at the prompt, a new row will be inserted into the Workgroups table and the combo box's list updated to show the new workgroup.<br />
<br />

            Firstly let's get the terminology right so that we are all singing from the same hymn sheet.&nbsp; Tables have fields (more strictly speaking columns), forms have controls.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; What is the Issues form bound to? &nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp; If the issues table does not have a CR Workgroup column what is the CR Workgroup control in the Issues form bound to?&nbsp; Or is it unbound?&nbsp; And if so what is its purpose.<br />
3.&nbsp; Is the SM7 Workgroup control in the Contacts form bound to the SM7 Workgroup column in the Contacts table?<br />
4. Is the SM7 Workgroup column in the Contacts table a foreign key which currently references any other table?<br />
<br />
The purpose of the UPDATE query n my last post is to insert values into a new numeric foreign key column in the Contacts table which references the primary key of Contacts, thus dispensing with the need for the SM7 Workgroup column.&nbsp; This results from the Contacts
 table having been given an autonumber 'surrogate' primary key, so the foreign key column in Contacts which references it must also be a numeric data type, a long integer number.&nbsp; The alternative would be to leave the SM7 Workgroup column in the Contacts table
 as the foreign key, not adding a WorkgroupID column, and remove the autonumber primary key column f5rom workgroups, then make the Workgroup column the 'natural' primary key.&nbsp; A relationship between Workgroups and Contacts can then be created, with&nbsp; SM7 Workgroup
 in the latter&nbsp; referencing Workgroup in the former.&nbsp; There is no reason why a natural key should not be used, though there are some advantages in using a surrogate autonumber key.&nbsp;&nbsp; If a natural key is used, however, then cascade updates should be enforced
 in the relationship as well as referential integrity.<br />
<br />
What you do in the Issues form depends on the question, as yet unanswered,&nbsp; I originally posed as to whether CR Workgroup is functionally determined by the contact or not.&nbsp; However, the waters have been muddied on this as you now say there is no CR Workgroup
 column in Issues, hence my first two questions above.<br />
<br />
As well as addressing these issues it would be helpful if you could describe what you are trying to do in real world terms.&nbsp; What is the database modelling overall?&nbsp; What is an 'issue'?&nbsp; How does an issue relate to a contact?&nbsp; What is a 'workgroup'?&nbsp; How does
 a contact relate to a workgroup?&nbsp; A database is a model of an underlying reality, and the better an understanding of that underlying reality you can give us the better we'll be able to advise you.<br />

            <p>Ok i will start with the questions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>The Issues form is bound to a query called Open Issues </li><li>Currently the CR workgroup has a control source of table Workgroups, whilst also not restricting the entries to just the table.
</li><li>Yes i believe they are bound. </li><li>No it is not. I have added this column so it is not currently used by anything else.</li></ol>
<p>In terms of what i am trying to do here goes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am setting up a database to log and track issues colleagues experience with different teams. An issue can be anything from missing information in a request, to causing a major problem. When completing the issues form the user completes a comments section
 to give details. The issue is logged against an individual, so the contacts table has a list of everyones name. The workgroup is basically the area within the company that they work, so that i can get reports to highlight the worst areas.

            <i>&gt;&gt;2.&nbsp; Currently the CR workgroup has a control source of table Workgroups, whilst also not restricting the entries to just the table. &lt;&lt;</i><br />
<br />
Are you sure you are not referring to its RowSource property here?&nbsp; The ControlSource property of a bound control is usually a column (field) in the table or query to which the form is bound.<br />
<br />
<i>&gt;&gt;3.&nbsp; Yes I believe they are bound. &lt;&lt;</i><br />
<br />
You don't sound very certain, but I think you are probably correct.<br />
<br />
Your description of the real life situation helps.&nbsp; Let's look at things in terms of the real world entity types and how they'd be modelled by tables and relationships between them, and what the attributes, represented by columns, of each entity type would
 be.&nbsp; The entity types as I see it are Employees, Workgroups, and Issues.&nbsp; So we start with tables like this:<br />
<br />
Employees<br />
....EmployeeID (PK)<br />
....FirstName<br />
....Lastname<br />
....etc<br />
<br />
WorkGroups<br />
....WorkgroupID (PK)<br />
....WorkGroup<br />
<br />
Issues<br />
....IssueID (PK)<br />
....Issue<br />
<br />
This table records the categories of issues, not specific instances of an issue.<br />
<br />
An employee might of course move from one workgroup to another during their period of employment with the company, so the relationship type between employees and workgroups is a many-to-many one, in this case it's a 'binary' (2-way) relationship type.&nbsp; A many-to-many
 relationship type is modelled by a table which resolves it in to a set of one-to-many relationship types, in this case, it being a binary relationship type, a set of two:<br />
<br />
EmployeeWorkgroups<br />
....EmployeeID (FK)<br />
....WorkgroupID (FK)<br />
....StartDate<br />
....EndDate<br />
<br />
The primary key of this table is a composite one made up of the EmployeeID and WorkgroupID&nbsp; columns.&nbsp; The StartDate and EndDate columns represent non-key attributes of the relationship type, when an employee joins and leaves a workgroup.&nbsp; I'm assuming for the
 moment that an employee will not be a member of the same workgroup for more than one stretch, but if it's possible that they could move from group A to group B and then back to group A the primary key of the table should also include the StartDate column.&nbsp;
 Data entry would be via a continuous subform in an Employees form.<br />
<br />
Now we come to the crux of the database, which is where the specific instances of an issue are recorded.&nbsp; This is another many-to-many relationship type, so is modelled by a table.&nbsp; In fact a relationship type is really just a special kind of entity type, so
 the table is still modelling an entity type.&nbsp; The table will be like this:<br />
<br />
IssueIncidents<br />
....EmployeeID (FK)<br />
....WorkgroupID (FK)<br />
....IssueID (FK)<br />
....Comments<br />
....IssueDate<br />
....etc<br />
<br />
The primary key for this table is a composite one of EmployeeID, WorkgroupID, IssueID and IssueDate, assuming that there can be no more than one incident per EmployeeID per WorkgroupID, per IssueID per day.<br />
<br />
In creating a form for this table, which is where the incidents of an issue will be entered, we need to ascertain whether the workgroup logged for the incident will be the current workgroup at the time of the incident, or whether an issue can be logged for
 an employee but with a different workgroup from that of which they are or have been the member.&nbsp; This is crucial to how the relationships are set up.&nbsp; If the former than an enforced relationship should be set up between EmployeeWorkgroups and IssueIncidents
 and would be on the two columns EmployeeID and WorkgroupID, i.e. the composite primary key of EmployeeWorkgroups is referenced by a corresponding composite foreign key in IssueIncidents.&nbsp; If the latter then there should&nbsp; separate relationships between IssueIncidents
 and Empoyees and between IssueIncidents and WorkGroups.<br />
<br />
Whichever is the case then the form would be set up in the same way with only one small difference, which I'll come to.&nbsp; There should be combo boxes bound to the EmployeeID, WorkgroupID and IssueID columns with RowSource properties drawing the data from SQL
 statements referencing the Employees, Workgroups and Issues tables respectively, hiding the first ID column in the usual way in each case.<br />
<br />
When an employee is selected in the EmployeeID combo box you can automatically select their current workgroup in the WorkgroupID combo box by putting code in the AfterUpdate event procedure of the EmployeeID combo box:<br />
<br />
Dim strCriteria As String<br />
Dim dtmDate As Date<br />
<br />
strCriteria = "EmployeeID = " &amp; Me.EmployeeID<br />
<br />
' get latest workgroup start date for selected enployee<br />
If Not IsNull(Me.EmployeeID) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dtmDate = DMax("StartDate", "EmployeeWorkGroups", strCriteria)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' get current workgroup for employee and assign to WorkgroupID <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strCriteria = "EmloyeeID = " &amp; Me.EmployeeID &amp;_<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " And StartDate = #" &amp; Format(dtmdate,"yyyy-mm-dd") &amp; "#"<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.WorkgroupID = DLookuP("WorkgroupID ","EmployeeWorkGroups", strCriteria)<br />
Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.WorkgroupID = Null<br />
End if<br />
<br />
If you need the ability to change the logged workgroup from the employee's current workgroup then leave the WorkgroupID combo box as set up so that it can be edited by selecting from its list.&nbsp; Otherwise set its Locked property to True (Yes) and its Enabled
 property to False (No) to make it read only.<br />
<br />
One final point: you might have noticed that I've not used any spaces in table or column names.&nbsp; While Access inadvisably allows spaces in object names these should be avoided.&nbsp; You can use CamelCase or represent a space by an underscore character Like_This.<br />

<h2>            Yahoo Email with Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a new desktop with Windows 10 and bought Office 2016 Home and Business.&nbsp; I previously had Outlook 2010.&nbsp; My Go Daddy email address converted no problem.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I cannot get my Yahoo email address to work.&nbsp; I have copied all of the
 settings from my 2010 version, including ports.&nbsp; When Outlook tests the account settings, I get an error message indicating that Outlook cannot connect to my outgoing (SMTP) e-mail server.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand how it can work in Outlook 2010 and not in Outlook 2016.&nbsp; Help!!!</p>

 I set up the profile in the "Mail (32-bit) and the test email went through.&nbsp; But, that profile did not exist in Outlook 2016.&nbsp; When I repeated the steps for Outlook 2016, i received the original error message again.</p>

            <div>The only place I see an Eraser tool is on the Table Tools | Design tab. This is the same tool that was on the Tables and Borders toolbar in earlier versions, used primarily in combination with the Draw Table tool (which is a terrible idea IMO; some of
 the worst messes I've ever seen were tables that were "drawn" using this tool).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What this tool does is erase or merge table cells. If you click on a table cell boundary, you "erase" the division between the two adjacent cells. In recent versions of Word, this is the only practical way to merge two columns row by row instead of creating
 a single giant cell. If you drag the eraser down the cell boundary between the two columns, the cells are merged horizontally but not vertically.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There is, AFAIK, no eraser tool that can be used in connection with the drawing tools. To "erase" a line or shape in Word, you click on it and press Delete. You mention Writing Tools, however, and these may be something specific to use of a tablet; if
 so, then I will have to declare ignorance on that score. </div>

<p><span><span><span>Dear Suzanne</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You can add Writing Tools by customizing Quick Access Toolbar and/or add tabs and groups to the Ribbon. In order to locate Writing Tools
 navigate to “Choose commands From” window, select “All commands”, and locate Writing Tools, erasers, pen tools, etc. You can add it also as tabs to the Ribbon. I don't have a tablet, everything works fine here exept the free line eraser tool. (not a table
 line eraser I suppose). With these tools you can keep hand writen notes on pictures, highlight a line on a photographed book page, etc. I bought&nbsp;word 2010 exactly for this feature, but&nbsp;I am not able to locate a relative tutorial. If you find anything please
 inform me.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

            When I look for the "writing tools" the OP described, I see that they are all from the
<strong>Pens Tab</strong>, which I don't have, so I assume that they don't work unless you have a tablet. That would apply to the
<strong>Eraser </strong>that belongs to the Pens tools. It has an eraser icon. The
<strong>Table Eraser </strong>tool (which shows an eraser on a table) is on the contextual
<strong>Table Tools | Design </strong>tab and behaves as I described; it can be used only in a table and only to "erase" cell boundaries.
