            A Factory Restore is probably your best option but the experts in a Vista forum might have some better ideas. You are currently posting in a Windows 7 forum.<br />

<h3> vladimir ejikhine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Security Center does not detect the third-party anti-virus software </h2>
                    
<p>I have problem with windows Security Center.</p>
<p>Recently I reinstalled widows on my two notebooks.<br />
After reinstallation Windows Security Center does not detect any more my third-party anti-virus software on both notebooks, in spite before I never had this problem.</p>
<p>The OSs are Windows XP home SP3 on one notebook and Windows XP pro SP3 on another notebook.<br />
The anti-virus software is CA anti-virus v.9.0.0.194, which I use already for 2 years.</p>
<p>In windows XP home the Security Center always shows that anti-virus is switched-on, even if CA anti-virus is disabled or even completely deleted.<br />
In windows XP pro the Security Center does not detect any anti-virus software, in spite CA is installed and functioning.</p>
<p>I tried to solve the problem by repairing the repository:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/944175/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/944175/en-us</a><br />
This, however, does not give any effect.</p>
<p>I have also tried to rename or delete the repository, in order to let a new one be created.<br />
In cmd:<br />
&nbsp; net stop winmgmt<br />
&nbsp; cd /d %windir%\system32\wbem<br />
&nbsp; ren repository repository.old<br />
&nbsp; net start winmgmt<br />
OR<br />
&nbsp; net stop winmgmt<br />
&nbsp; cd /d %windir%\system32\wbem<br />
&nbsp; rd /s repository<br />
&nbsp; net start winmgmt</p>
<p>This action, however, always fails, as repository cannot be renamed or deleted because it is used by other software.<br />
I have tried to perform this in safe modus - the same result.<br />
By the way, when I give command “net start winmgmt" - it says that winmgmt is already working, in spite it has to be switched off.</p>
<p>Could you pls. suggest how to solve the problem ?<br />
Thank you very much in advance !</p>

    <title>Windows 8 photo corruption - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frfouger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 photo corruption</h2>
                    <p>It would appear that Windows 8 is corrupting some of my jpeg files. Can anyone confirm if they've experienced the same type of corruption and do I have to buy photo recovery software to restore the files? I've tried renaming the file and&nbsp;saving to another
 drive. We lost a lot of photos, some were still on our memory card and are not corrupt. The corrupt files were usable at one time as they were downloaded to facebook. I really don't want to pay for recovery software when windows 8 has caused the problem. I'm
 looking for confirmation of other reported problems and if there's any solutions.</p>

    <title>sound problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> normanstein  say:</h3>
<h2>            sound problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Once again I'm having problems with the sound from my speakers in Win 10. For a long time things were working well but every once in a while I start getting crackles in the sound while listening to music. I've looked at lots of discussions on the internet
 about problems of this sort and I've tried all the suggestions I found but continue to have the problem. Nothing has been changed on my system that I'm aware of other than the updates automatically installed by Microsoft. My sound card is a Creative Sound
 blaster and the driver is said to be up to date. I've tried the generic driver that comes with Windows and it makes no difference to the distortion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help me. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I don't really think I've got the right "Windows Topic" but I honestly don't think any of the ones offered fits.</p>

<p>Hi Norman, </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are times that sound problems can be caused by damaged drivers, incompatible drivers, sound settings, and problems with your sound card. We can run the audio troubleshooter because it might fix the audio problems automatically.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To run the troubleshooter, kindly select the <strong>Start</strong> button, type
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>, and then select Troubleshoot from the list of results. Select
<strong>Playing Audio</strong>&gt; <strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Let's install the audio driver in compatibility mode.&nbsp;</span></span></span>Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows. Here are the steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right-click on the setup file of the driver and select Properties.</p>
<p>2. Select Compatibility tab.</p>
<p>3. Place a check mark next to Run this program in Compatibility mode and select previous the version of Windows (Windows 8) from the drop down list.</p>
<p>4. Let the driver install and then check the functionality. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This is an addition to the previous rather than a reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No changes have been made to the computer since I wrote in originally but two things appear to have changed. One is that the speaker icon on the task bar which formerly had a volume control associated with it which appeared when you clicked on it, no longer
 has one and in addition the volume it displays, which I usually have at around 50% is now at 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second is that I just played a piece of music which is between 30 and 35 minutes long and through much of it the sound was OK and only near the end did I start getting the static or clicks or muddiness of sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this clarifies the situation for somebody although for me it just adds to the confusion.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. Have you tried to use the speakers on a different computer? Kindly plug it into a different device and test the sound to see if it will show the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the audio quality on your output device can solve some problems. To check your audio quality, right-click the speaker icon in the notification area next to your clock and select “Playback Devices”. Try these steps:
</p>
<p>1. Go to <strong>Start</strong> , enter
<strong>Sound</strong>, and select <strong>Sound Control Panel </strong>from the list of results.</p>
<p>2. On the <strong>Playback </strong>tab, right-click (or press and hold) the
<strong>Default Device</strong>, and then select <strong>Properties</strong>. </p>
<p>3. On the <strong>Advanced </strong>tab, under <strong>Default Format</strong>, change the setting, and then retest your audio device. If that doesn't work, try changing the setting again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps and let us know if it works.</p>

<p>Thanks for your replies. I've tried all the things you suggest and the sound problems persist. I did uninstall and then reinstall the driver and that has corrected the problem with the speaker icon on the task bar but the sound itself is as bad as ever.
 When I use the same speakers but with sound directly from the amplifier there's no problem at all but with the signal from the computer it's so scratchy as to be unlistenable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help me find a solution to this problem.</p>

<p>Hi Norman - Just for info, I had a similar problem to this years ago with Windows7 and it
<em>was</em> driver related...</p>
<p>Is the Creative Sound Blaster system something you have added or did it come pre-installed by the maker? In the case of my W7 Dell, it was the maker's supplied soundcard that had been affected by a faulty driver included in a Windows update. Another Dell
 user had figured out the discrepancy and posted the correct driver details in the Dell forum - this fixed the problem for me straight away. If&nbsp;your CSB card was supplied by the manufacturer that may be your best place to look. Good luck with finding a resolution
 - I know just how irksome this is! - Ric.</p>

<p>Hello Ric,</p>
<p>Thanks for your comment. There's both bad news and good news to report. The sound card in question comes from Creative and was installed separately from win 10. Also, it's no longer supported by Creative.
</p>
<p>The good news is that for some reason today it's working properly. I also found that my computer had been turned off (by Microsoft) during the night. I haven't been able to determine what they did but it seems to have helped.</p>
<p>I have to say that I hate the fact that they frequently tinker with my computer without my knowing about it or permitting it but I'm just one of the probably millions who feel that way.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
<p>Norman</p>

<h2>            Want to make my Avatar into a Firebender from The Last Airbender</h2>
                    
<p>With the new avatar series on Nick I was thinking it would be cool to try and make my avatar into a firebender from the show. In the ninja collection there are Flaming Tiger Fist and in the Assassins creed Universe section there is a Shao Jun outfit.</p>

<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.imgur.com%2fLBTPO.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is the combo I was thinking. Anyone see anything better or think this is my best bet?</p>

<p>1) Have you made any changes prior to this issue?<br />
</p>
<p>2) Have you tried checking with other USB ports?<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Assign Drive letter to the hard disk</strong></p>
<p>You can try open the Disk Management and check whether a valid driver letter is assigned to the external hard drive. If not, assign the drive letter and check if the issue still persists.</p>
<strong>Change, add, or remove a drive letter</strong>

            Hi, BryanValladares
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try entering Safe Mode to repair
<br />
<br />Turn off your computer; then, turn it on. 
<br />As soon as you see the Windows logo with the spinning dots, press and hold the power button until your computer turns off. Do this process twice.
<br />.-Turn on your computer for the third time, and let it load.
<br />.-You should get this message: Preparing Automatic Repair.
<br />.-On the next screen that would appear, click on Advanced Options.
<br />.-Select Troubleshoot.
<br />.-Go to Advanced Options.
<br />.-Click on Startup Repair.
<br />.-Wait for the repair to finish.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            Hi Bryan
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

<h2>            Task scheduler is not starting..</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I wanted to do disk defrag on my drive and noticed it's not working. It says it cannot run while your
<strong>Task scheduler</strong> is off. I tried to start Task scheduler (TS) but it's all grey out. I managed to change it to manual and started it but I got this message immediately : "<strong>TS started and stopped, some apps stop after no other program use
 them</strong>" . I did read some solutions that people put online and applied them but non of them worked for me. Please let me know if you have a solution, thanks.

            Hello NetSysAdmin,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You can search the Windows registry for the invalid character that is displayed in the 1324 error message and replace all instances of the invalid character with the correct character. For example, if the 1324 error message refers to "system32/", you should
 search for "system32/". If you find any instances in the registry, modify them, so that the registry values correctly reference the System32 folder.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Run</strong>. In the <strong>
Open</strong> box, type <span>regedit</span>, and then click <strong>
OK</strong>. </li><li>On the <strong>Edit</strong> menu, click <strong>Find</strong>. </li><li>In the <strong>Find What</strong> box, type the character string reported in the 1324 error message, and then click
<strong>Find Next</strong>. </li><li>If you find the problematic string, make any necessary changes, and then press F3 to find the next occurrence.
</li><li>Repeat step 4 until you locate and change all incorrect references. </li><li>On the <strong>Registry</strong> menu, click <strong>Exit</strong>. </li></ol>
<p><br />
Hope this helps you. Let us know either way. Make it a great day!<br />
<br />

    <title>XBox repair support - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> captinmoosey01  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBox repair support</h2>
                    
<div>I have been trying to get my son's xbox 360 repaired for two weeks now. &nbsp;I submitted the request online, was billed on my checking account, and an hour later it cancelled and refunded my money. &nbsp;Thinking it was a glitch in the system I resubmitted the
 same day (26 Sept). &nbsp;It was accepted and billing was completed. &nbsp;I waited for mailing instructions and mailing label. &nbsp;Nothing was received. &nbsp;The next day I talked on line to a representative who researched it and said because there was an open request from
 2011 the account was locked. &nbsp;Im not sure why there was an order from 2011...that is when the device was bought and registered and we have not had problems up until now. &nbsp;, and I would have to wait until the system was cleared of the old service request, up
 to two weeks before any action could be taken. &nbsp;She also told me that they would probably send a refurbished unit to replace it because of the problem (open tray). &nbsp;</div>

<div>Today, Oct 2, I called the service center. &nbsp;No action had been taken on this. &nbsp;While discussing options with the rep, I was told to take the console to FedEx, give them the SO#, and the order would be processed. &nbsp;I asked him if I could be sent a refurbished
 unit in the meantime given the time spent and the turn around time for repair (which apparently would not be done on my console given the open tray problem). &nbsp;His answer was no, they must have the old console before they could send a replacement. &nbsp;I explained
 that the old console would be sent to them as soon as I received the replacement. &nbsp;They have my billing info and authorization in case the console is not sent back, not to mention the payment for repair.</div>

<div>All I am trying to do is get a functioning console for my son sometime this year. &nbsp;I have wasted $1000 + in XBox Live, $1500 + in games, $500 + in hardware...and a deposit on XBox One. &nbsp;If this is how you treat your loyal customers you can bet this one
 will no longer need the deposit on the XBox One.</div>

<p>I understand your frustration but the repairs center would never send out a console without receipt of the one in need of repair first. You would need to set up a repair, send your console in to the repairs center and then you will be sent either your fixed
 unit or a replacement.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/en-US/Pages/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">You can register the device and check your warranty status online here</a>.
<br />
If you are out of warranty it might be cheaper to just purchase another unit rather than pay for a repair. Also bare in mind the warranty period for a repaired/replaced console from the service center is only 90 days.
<br />
<br />
So if things go wrong after that period you would be required to pay for another repair. So as I say it could be cheaper to just buy either a pre-owned console from a reputable dealer or a new one.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have used this service twice and never had an issue, I got the consoles back both times in under 14 days which I thought was quite reasonable. Sorry to hear your experience has not been so smooth. &nbsp;</p>

<p>you got to send to them, first trust them, i do because they give me a 1 month free gold card.. and i understand why..they don't want people scamming the repair center for free Xboxes ...and from what i understand u must copy out a shipping scan bar for
 free shipping, which could be used at ups or fed ex shipping center..i hate most people dont hear &nbsp;about shipping scan bar that needs to be copy out and put on a box before taking it to ups or fedex</p>

<p>All of you have good advice and I thank you for it however like I should have explained, the problem is getting something done. &nbsp;I needed a scan bar sent by xbox to ship the device. &nbsp;They have been paid for the repair/replacement however they have not corrected
 THEIR mistake and sent me what I need to get the device to them! &nbsp;I am NOT a scam artist! &nbsp;I am a business man trying to get my son's console repaired. &nbsp;I have been a loyal customer as long as XBox has been in business. &nbsp;I feel that something has been lost
 over the past couple of months in customer service and I think its time to go another venue. &nbsp;Sad...</p>

<p>no one saying your a scam artist, i just saying this is why they won't send u one before they have your console as well they need to test it too before sending you one back..i understand your trying to get your son Xbox repair, and yes the support fail to
 tell you because they were stuck in the past that when Xbox 360 started having problems, they would send you a box that would take care of everything, u just put your Xbox in the box and ship it fast,but now few year later they stop doing that and making us
 do the work in finding a box, paste a scan bar on the box and ship it..I'm sorry u have to though all that trouble &nbsp;</p>

<p>What you're describing is expedited service, which may not be something the repair department offers at this time. &nbsp;Yes, it's a very desirable service, to have the replacement console delivered to you before you send back the one in need of repair. &nbsp;But
 desirable as that service may be, if it's not on the menu, the issue simply can't be forced. &nbsp;And you don't have to wait for a shipping label in the mail. &nbsp;They can email it to you so you can receive it immediately, tape the label to a plain brown box with
 the console secure and safe inside (yes, it must be protected in there even if it's broken), and then shipped to their repair center.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Having used their repair process myself, it really doesn't take them long to determine if it's something that requires a replacement. &nbsp;If it does require a replacement, it'll be shipped to you as quickly as possible. &nbsp;If it's repairable in a timely manner,
 they'll fix it up and get it back to you. &nbsp;If it's repairable but it'll take a while, they'll replace it. &nbsp;And for the trouble of being without your console for a few weeks, they'll likely give you a month of Gold, in the box with your working console.</p>

<p>You are silver? I would think if it was a technical issue , you would still be gold.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Is it possible that your account has just expired, or possibly just renewed and had some issues. i once had them come back a few weeks after I renewed my subscription and tell me the payment didnt go through. I called and they were billing some credit
 card that I have no clue how they got, but it wasnt mine. anyhow, they fixed me right up.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe try calling support.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Apps Problem</h2>
                    I recently updated windows 10 to version 1511 and my start menu button wasn't working anymore. So I've ran that powershell command( the one with registering apps ) and it fixed the start menu button issue but now my apps aren't working anymore. Their icons
 are gone and they have a name like : Microsoft.WindowsCalculator_10.xxxxx. Can you help me please? Thank you!&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Upload the zip containing the .DMP files to Onedrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply. Prefered sites: Onedrive, Mediafire, Dropbox, etc. Nothing with wait-timers.<br />
<br />
<strong>4 (optional):</strong> The type of .DMP files located in the Minidump folder are known as Small Memory Dumps. In %systemroot% there will be what is known as a Kernel-Dump (if your system is set to generate). It is labeled MEMORY.DMP. The difference
 between Small Memory Dumps and Kernel-Dumps in the simplest definition is a Kernel-Dump contains
<em><strong>much </strong></em>more information at the time of the crash, therefore allowing further debugging of your issue. If your upload speed permits it, and you aren't going against any strict bandwidth and/or usage caps, etc, the Kernel-Dump is the best
 choice. Do note that Kernel-Dumps are <em><strong>much larger </strong></em>in size due to containing much more info, which is why I mentioned upload speed, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/add-photos-files-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upload photos and files to Onedrive.</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete .DMP files upon use.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />
<br />

                    <p>Original title: Windows 8.1 video playback</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am having a problem that occurs with YouTube, Netflix Instant Watch and DVD playback:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes just the subtitles stop displaying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of the time the video will freeze for a few seconds, then rush forward to catch up.&nbsp; Then normal speed for seconds or minutes, then video will freeze for a few seconds, then rush forward to catch up.&nbsp; Subtitles don't work when this is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked around at discussions here.&nbsp; I think I was able to determine that there are no conflicting programs by going to search, msconfig...disabled everything&nbsp;listed one at a time, then all at once.&nbsp; When I hit this advice, I thought I might've found
 the answer because restarting the computer can make it work better--can as in sometimes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This computer is only two weeks old.&nbsp; Last week I did a system reset.&nbsp; Today I took it back to Best Buy where it seemed as though they basically did the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's almost like it's a car running on gas with too low an octane level.&nbsp; It functions, just not properly.&nbsp; Tested internet speed: download 11.29 mbps upload 1.17</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mic &#38; Headset Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> msftbrickingpcsince1995  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mic &#38; Headset Problem</h2>
                    <p>This is getting pretty damn absurd.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Listen, your updates mess(would love to be vulgar) things up left and right.&nbsp; everytime i get an update you destroy my pc.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>You dont need my specs and spare me your automated response of run this dinky troubleshooter.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The hardware works albeit Via. </p>
<p>No driver on earth, at least that ive come across in the past year+, recognizes my headset let alone the mic itself.&nbsp; Always says speakers, doesnt recognize external.
</p>
<p>Prior to this last garbage update, i could get an external mic to work by disabling the drivers, unplugging the mic, reboot, plug mic in, enable drivers and it would work.&nbsp; if unplugged, poof, had to repeat process</p>
<p>after this last update even that doesnt work anymore.</p>
<p>Ive done everything from try and install every set of drivers for every version of windows from via, ran in every compatibility mode, used modified drivers,&nbsp; used your horrid codec, edited reg to prevent your auto installs of drivers and will restrict the
 device once this is fixed, if ever.&nbsp; LMFAO.&nbsp; incredible. </p>
<p>Ive ran the dinky troubleshooter and yeah ive right clicked the little speaker icon in the tray.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This is my desktop, the same thing happened to my gaming lap top which is a year old and ive used 3 times.&nbsp; 4 if you include me checking to see if it happened on the laptop after the update.&nbsp; and those are realtek drivers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;whats the fix? Seriously, fix it. Thats insane...and just one little problem our of several major ones.
</p>
<p>I am thoroughly surprised no class actions have been filed, i never read your disclaimer so might not be possible, but thoroughly surprised.&nbsp; I shouldnt need to spend that much time attempting to fix your broken OS every time you force an update.
</p>
<p>Provide the fix, thanks. </p>
<p>
</p><p>PS, forgot to mention, after this update I can no longer hear teammates in pubg.&nbsp; Yeah, spare me,&nbsp; did all the stupid useless crap recommended in forums and clickbait youtube videos. didnt work.
</p>
