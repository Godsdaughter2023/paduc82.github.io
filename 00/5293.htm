    <title>Header linking problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Header linking problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi. So I'm working on a large document with multiple sections. I have been able to create new headers for each of the sections without too much difficulty.<br />
<br />
Now, in the last two sections, I am having problems. In the last section, I want to turn off the link to previous header, but the when I click in the header, my cursor jumps to the first page of the previous section (actually the second because I'm using different
 even and odd page headers.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the cursor jumps to the first page of the previous section&nbsp; I am unable to edit the header in the first page of the last section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Also, perhaps because of the problem, I have been frustrated with the dialog box that appears when I click the Link to Previous Button. It asks: "Do you want to delete this header/footer and connect to the header/footer in the previous section?" I must
 chose Yes or No.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I don't want to delete the header and I don't want to connect to the header in the previous section. It seem like the Link to Previous button should just be a simple toggle, but it does not seem to be so.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be appreciated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>That is true, whether or not there is any content in the header or footer in which the selection is located.</p>

<h2>            OUTLOOK RECEIVING BUT NOT SENDING EMAILS</h2>
                    <p>For a week now, ALL Outlook users in my office can receive emails, but are unable to send emails. Please see the details on this issue below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) This is affecting all Outlook users in our office and is NOT isolated to 1 computer - The versions are different (2010 &amp; 2013) and are not on the same licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) We can receive all emails. The outgoing mail appears to be sent and shows up in the sent folder, no failed to send messages are rec'd back, but none of the recipients are receiving the emails. This is every single person, not just a few emails - no one
 gets the outgoing mail we send.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) We can sign on to our ISP's webmail and send &amp; receive emails, no problem. We confirmed with the ISP (Time Warner) that all the account settings are as they should be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) I set up a Thunderbird account and again, have no problem sending and receiving emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are at a loss and need a solution for this issue. I have seen similar posts as mine, but see no fixes to the problem. Help! Thanks.</p>

            <p>If the messages are in the Sent Items folder, then they are being sent, from Outlook's perspective. Outlook does not move the message to that folder until it receives an acknowledgement from the receiving server that the server has accepted the message for
 delivery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if you have some scanning add-in configured in Outlook, Outlook may believe that software is the SMTP server and is receiving the acknowledgement from that software. It is then the software's fault that the messages aren't delivered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, it is a problem in the delivery chain after Outlook is done with the message and Outlook has been told the message was accepted for delivery. Outlook itself is not the problem. If this were to happen to me, I'd enable Outlook's diagnostic logging
 to look at the conversation between Outlook and the receiving server and then I'd look at the equivalent server-side log to make sure the handshake all went as it should. I'd them trace the message through the server (if I could) to make sure it went to its
 next destination. If you have a good relationship with Time Warner, they should be able to examine those logs on their end.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It is possible that the email which you have received could be a Spam email. Spam is any kind of email that you don’t want and that you didn’t sign up to receive. Some spam is annoying but harmless, but some might be part of an identity theft
 scam or other kind of fraud. You can get spam in instant messages, text messages, and on your social networking sites. Refer to the link below for more information about spamming and how to deal with it:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/abuse-phishing-junk-email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/abuse-phishing-junk-email</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also refer to the Microsoft help Article for more information and check if this helps:</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Also, I would suggest you to set your Junk email filter to Exclusive. If the Exclusive level was set, messages from senders not on your Contacts or Safe Senders lists will be sent to the Junk folder. By default, the Junk folder will automatically delete
 messages after 10 days. This is more convenient as we don't have any control if senders are randomly changing their address. Follow the steps below on how to set to Exclusive and check if this helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Sign in to your Outlook.com account.</li><li>Click cog or gear icon then select Options.</li><li><span>Under preventing junk email, click Filters and reporting.</span></li><li><span>Under Choose a junk email filter, select Exclusive.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Hope this answers your query and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I have checked the properties of this email and it is a genuine email from a major international internet retailer, not any kind of spam, phishing, or other fraudulent communication.</p>
<p>I cannot block the address or mark it as junk because I myself already have an account with this retailer and need to continue to receive the emails intended for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My concern is with the fact that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">the email address in the To: section is not mine</span>,
To be specific it has exactly the same letters as mine in the same order but mine has an additional . separating two sections of letters whereas this email does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why has an email intended for a different email address arrived in my inbox?</p>
<p>I do not wish to receive email intended for others. </p>
<p>I do not wish to block communications from website which both myself and this other user access.</p>
<p>And I am sure that this other user would like to receive their own emails rather than have them disappear into my inbox!</p>

            <p>The address that shows in the To field has, believe it or not, nothing whatsoever to do with the actual recipient address. It's just a string of characters used for convenience. Just like paper mail, only the address on the envelope matters, not the words
 on the paper inside the envelope. You cannot see the address that was on the electronic envelope. It is used only by the message transports that pass the email from one system to the next. So, if you received the message, it was definitely intended for your
 address no matter what shows in the To field.</p>

            <p>I am well aware that both the sender and recipient addresses shown on the front of the email can be altered and I also recognise that this is a common tactic employed by phishing scams to draw in potential victims.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reiterate that I have checked the coding of the message source for each message I have wrongly received. Within the source coding there is no mention of any sender address but that of the retailer. This is how I know the messages are genuine. Within the
 source coding there is no mention of any recipient except the address which is not my own. This is how I know the messages were not intended for my email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have therefore ruled out that these messages come from a scam of any kind, I have also ruled out that the other user has mistyped his email address when signing up to this retailer</p>
<p>It would be helpful if the next reply acknowledges that I had ruled out both these scenarios after receiving the initial message and we now need to investigate how this error has occurred.</p>

            The error MUST have happened on the sending side. Your address was in the envelope of the SMTP handshake. This is done on the sending side. There is no other way you could have received the message. So, your sender's automated system screwed up somehow
 and it is they who must repair it.

            <p>I have tried contacting the sender. Due to data protection laws they could not confirm to me exactly which email address is used to send emails to another user. They were however able to confirm that my own email address is only associated with one&nbsp;account
 held with them, mine. </p>
<p>Therefore there is nothing <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">they</span> can do to rectify the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Judging from your reply therefore, I am expected to continue to receive this other user's emails and Microsoft will make no attempt to investigate what is, in truth, a very serious situation.
</p>
<p>The emails I am receiving are from a major online ticket sales site. Further emails which I receive in error are highly likely to contain e-tickets to events which this other user has paid for. I'm sure that if I were in the position of the other user, I
 would like to think that Microsoft took the potential loss of goods I had paid for seriously.</p>

                    Hi, I'm currently using Google chrome (I forgot the version) as my web browser. Recently when I'm surfing the web and came to a page that has a video inside the page, I can't hear any sound when I play the video. I have tried to change the volume on my
 PC and the settings on the web controls &amp;customization but that still won't solve the problem. Any advice?
<div>Any kind of help will be much appreciated. Thank you</div>

<h2>            Make an image non-printing in Publisher 2007&#63;</h2>
                    Is there a way to place a graphic image in a Publisher 2007 document and code it as non-printing?<br />
<br />
I can do this in Visio either by placing it in a non-printing layer or by marking the object itself as non-printing. But Visio doesn't provide the capability to flow text around another object. I have some pre-printed stationery. I would like to place a scanned
 image of the page in the document so I can flow the text around the images, but I don't want that image to print.<br />

You can recolor an image to white and it will still act as a placeholder&nbsp;and text will still flow around it. Right click the picture &gt;&nbsp;format picture &gt; Picture tab &gt; recolor button &gt; down arrow by color and choose white or whatever the background color of the
 text box is.&nbsp;You will also remove any borders on the image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even easier is to just insert a rectangle shape...or any&nbsp;shape for that matter and drag it into/onto the text and the text will wrap around it.</p>

If I recolor it white, then I also won't be able to see it, right? Also, if the text background is not white (or a simple color), then I have to match that.<br />
<br />
Yes, I can place shapes that are the same as the objects on the paper, but then I won't be able to see the image on the paper.<br />
<br />
I want to see the actual image. It sounds like that is not possible in Publisher.<br />

I don't understand why you want to see the picture, have the text wrap around the picture but not have the picture print. Please explain. I don't think you can have all three.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could put the picture on the master page and then ignore the master page when you print, but then the text will not wrap around the text. You might be able to add an empty rectangle shape on the text box to correspond with the picture on the master page,
 but this sounds difficult...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my Canon printer under advanced printer setup I have the option to not print any pictures, or lower resolution. Look for a similar control on your printer.</p>

<p>I don't know of any other way of getting the results you want. Sorry.</p>

(sigh) Why is this so difficult to understand?<br />
<br />
I have some stationery and envelopes with preprinted images, such as snowmen and Santas for the holidays. I want to create templates that I can use to print on these without printing over the images.<br />
<br />
I want to place scanned images of the actual stationery to use as guides. I need to see the images because I want to coordinate the text with the images. If I can't see them, they are not much use as guides, are they?<br />
<br />
I also may want to place other images that I do want to print and I want to position them in relation to the preprinted images, so changing them to empty blocks wouldn't be much help.<br />
<br />
If this forum would allow attachments, I'd attach one. But, of course it does not.<br />
<br />
I don't want the image to print because it is already printed on the stationery. I also don't want to suppress printing all images, because there may be others that I do want to print.<br />
<br />
Is that such a difficult concept to understand?<br />
<br />
This is a simple task is most desktop publishing programs. In Visio, I can tag the image as non-printing or I can put it in a non-printing layer. Similar capabilities are available in many other programs.<br />
<br />
Now, can someone just answer my question instead of telling me some other way to do it or, worse, telling me that I really don't need to do it at all? Can I make an image non-printing in Publisher?<br />

I have some stationery and envelopes with preprinted images, such as snowmen and Santas for the holidays. I want to create templates that I can use to print on these without printing over the images.<br />
<br />
I want to place scanned images of the actual stationery to use as guides. I need to see the images because I want to coordinate the text with the images. If I can't see them, they are not much use as guides, are they?<br />
<br />
I also may want to place other images that I do want to print and I want to position them in relation to the preprinted images, so changing them to empty blocks wouldn't be much help.<br />
<br />
If this forum would allow attachments, I'd attach one. But, of course it does not.<br />
<br />
I don't want the image to print because it is already printed on the stationery. I also don't want to suppress printing all images, because there may be others that I do want to print.<br />
<br />
Is that such a difficult concept to understand?<br />
<br />
This is a simple task is most desktop publishing programs. In Visio, I can tag the image as non-printing or I can put it in a non-printing layer. Similar capabilities are available in many other programs.<br />
<br />
Now, can someone just answer my question instead of telling me some other way to do it or, worse, telling me that I really don't need to do it at all? Can I make an image non-printing in Publisher?<br />

Perhaps Insert &gt; Picture &gt; Empty picture frame. Make it the same size as the picture you don't want to print and&nbsp;place it where you want non-printing picture to go. Use it as a placeholder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, no, you cannot make a single&nbsp;image as non-printing in Publisher 2007&nbsp;to my knowledge.</p>

OK, I did that. I inserted an empty picture frame, as you suggested above. I got a rectangle with a dotted border. I then selected Insert Picture from the Picture toolbar. My image was placed in the box. I then printed that document. The image was printed.
 So I'm not sure what the Empty Picture Frame accomplishes.<br />
<br />
I've uploaded the scanned image of one of my envelopes to Dropbox. Here's the link:<br />

<br />
It's a #10 envelope. I want to make this image some kind of background layer that is visible when editing the document, but will not print.<br />
<br />
It sounds like this is not possible.<br />

Your link does not work for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You skipped part of my instructions. Insert an empty picture frame and make it the same size as the picture you do not want to print. Do not insert the picture.&nbsp;Then you can move that empty picture frame around and design around that empty&nbsp;space which correlates
 with where the picture is on the stationary. This is why an empty picture frame is frequently called a picture placeholder...to hold a place on the document without actually inserting the picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If for some reason you must see the picture during the design phase then insert your picture, size and position the picture and picture frame as you want it. Create a second empty picture frame of the same size and put it in the scratch area. Now after you
 have finished designing your publication simply swap the empty picture frame for the filled pictured frame and print.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are having problems making an empty picture frame the exact size of the inserted picture then after inserting the picture and sizing it, right click it &gt; format picture &gt; size tab and read the exact height and width of the picture. You can even even
 look at the layout tab and that will tell you the exact postition on the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, but as I said above you cannot make a single&nbsp;image as non-printing in Publisher 2007&nbsp;to my knowledge.</p>

OK, that is more of a border and I don't see you needing to wrap&nbsp;text around an image. In fact you are just inserting text boxes and other design elements in the 'white space' in the middle of the envelope. With this said then use a master page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears that you have a size 10 envelope. </p>
<p>Create a new publication &gt; envelopes &gt; scroll down until you find a blank size 10 (9.5 X 4.125) and create it. Go to View &gt; Master Page. Insert Picture &gt;from file and browse to your image and insert it. In my case it inserts at 90% scale so right click the
 image &gt; format picture &gt; make sure to lock aspect ratio and then increase the scale to 100% and ok out. Drag or use the arrow keys to center the image on the master page. At the bottom of the left hand pane called Edit Master Pages click 'View publication
 page'. This puts you back on the main publication page where you can insert text boxes, other images or any other design element you want, with the stationary picture in the background. Just drag those elements around and place them where you want them. Then
 when you have everything the way you want and are ready to print just go to View &gt; Ignore master page and you can print without the image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are better directions for using a master page: <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/publisher-help/create-edit-or-delete-a-master-page-HA001234040.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[edit] After posting I thought of yet another way to approach this. Insert the picture as a background and then don't print the background. This approach is dependent upon your printer options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Format &gt; Background &gt; More backgrounds &gt; Picture tab &gt; select picture - browse to your picture on your local drive. Design the rest of your publication and then when you print look for the option to 'print page backgrounds' and uncheck. Your printer may
 not have that option, in which case you can use the Master Page approach.</p>

                    <p>Hello. I've always been curious - why do we need double quotes around an argument such as &gt;=50 or &lt;100, in the second argument (criteria) of the COUNTIF or SUMIF function? Usually this implies text, but this is logical/numeric not text.

<p>I think the double quotes prevent the expression from being evaluated (and returning an error) before being passed to the function, since you can use a formula in the place of the argument to create the string, like

                    <p>I have been hacked, badly. This has been going on for close to three years now. I finally I have been able to gather enough knowledge to know the various ways they are going about things, but I am not versed enough to figure out everything. One thing I am
 curious about however, is my hotmail account. I am worried about my OneDrive files being altered, so I need to know some basic information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My email address is actual a ".msn" address that I have had for ages. I really don't want to have to delete it, but I will if I have to. When I type "https://www.hotmail.com", I am redirected to "https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;rpsnv=12&amp;ct=1451229139&amp;rver=6.4.6456.0&amp;wp=MBI_SSL_SHARED&amp;wreply=https:%2F%2Fmail.live.com%2Fdefault.aspx&amp;lc=1033&amp;id=64855&amp;mkt=en-us&amp;cbcxt=mai".
 If I delete everything past the login.live.com, I am still stuck in the "shared" mail.live.com account.&nbsp;</p>

            Your answer applies to just a hacked email account, while my hacking is my entire computer. They are using a WinPE install, WindowsNT management, along with a Kernel core using virtual machine elements as well. This goes WAY beyond my email account. I
 just have this simple question about what exact addresses are correct and what java scripts are necessary, and honestly I would like to know if Microsoft has any cookies so that I know what is there necessarily and what is added by my intrusive coward. Thank
 you.

<h2>            Upgraded to Win10 but where is my start button&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Not to sure what catergory to put this in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I did an upgrade over an existing 8 or 8.1 install (honestly don't remember) that had Start8 installed for a start button. I'm sure many of you know the program but here it is anyway...&nbsp;http://www.stardock.com/products/start8/</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the install was finished I excitedly clicked the start button only to find it was me ol' faithful start8 still. In response, I stopped the start8 service and then turned it manual start followed by a restart. This was successful in getting rid of the
 start8 button, but clicking the windows icon now simply brings me to the Windows Start Screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've poured through the obvious settings looking for an option but unless I'm missing something...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts or input?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, for what it's worth, the install was done unattended. I agreed to EULA, went to bed and this morning I setup my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what it's worth, I'm digging the task view and snap features. But really hope I can get the Start menu as that was my main reason for trialling Tech Prev</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards, R.</p>

<h2>            Is it possible to copy a Word table into a Powerpoint slide&#63;</h2>
                    <div><b>Original Title:&nbsp;</b>"Copying tables from Word to PowerPoint"</div>
Is it possible to copy a Word table into a Powerpoint slide? &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Seems simple, but whenever I copy a table from Word and paste it into PowerPoint, it is pasted as a Word Object. &nbsp;And when I select Paste Special, I am presented with six options, none of which result in a PowerPoint table. &nbsp;And by the way, what's the
 difference between pasting "Styled Text" and "Formatted Text"?</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any assistance would be appreciated.&nbsp;</div>

            @ Bob: You're right -- there is indeed a difference between Word tables and PowerPoint tables, but I don't understand why that is, particularly given the similarity of the formatting and styling options.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>As for why I am not satisfied with the result: just give it a try. It looks strange on the screen, it requires a double click to edit, it launches Word when editing and it
<b>massively</b> inflates the file size, compared with a native PPT table. It also frequently cuts off columns on the right. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<div><br />
<div>BTW, I meant to note the workaround that I have used: &nbsp;copy the table from Word to Excel, then copy the excel table into PowerPoint. &nbsp;The result is a PPT table that retains much of the original formatting, including colours, fonts and merged cells. Not
 sure how this is possible, but it works.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Zooming with multiple Sheets in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Zooming with multiple Sheets in Excel</h2>
                    <p>User noticed an issue. When selecting multiple sheets in Excel, then attempting to zoom in or out (using the zoom level in the bottom right corner), it will cause Excel to crash. I verified this on my machine as well as another machine. It occurs even on
 a new Excel Document with no data.&nbsp; Can anyone verify this?&nbsp; Using the Click-2-Run installation with network updates. Current version install is 16.0.6769.2040 (Office 2016). Thanks.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We tried reproducing the issue, and Excel is working as expected.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before we proceed, I would require more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Are you connected to domain or network?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Do you get any error message? If yes, what is the complete error message?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s open Excel in application Safe Mode and check how it works.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do that, press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard. </span></p>
<p><span>In the Run open box type in ‘Excel /safe’ and hit ok. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note: There is a space between Excel and /.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If application safe mode works, try disabling the add-ins associated with Office applications and check.</span></p>
<p><span>To do that, do the following.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Open Word or Excel Click on File and then click on options.</span></p>
<p><span>2. In the Options Window click on Add-ins.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Select Com Add-ins in the Manage list in the Add-ins section and click Go. Now uncheck the all the add-ins and click Ok.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope it helps. Try the suggestion and let us know the result at your earliest convenience.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            The latest update to Office seems to have solved the issue. Not sure why as it is not mentioned in the release notes.

            Then there is nothing to worry about it simply means in the last 24 hours your phone stating up has used most of the power consumed nothing to worry about it's perfectly normal if you don't turn your phone off at all you will find something else will use
 most of the battery turning your phone on does use a bit of power I rarely turn mine of instead I put it on flight mode at night that way I can use the alarm to wake me up and I find it uses les power than turning it of and on every day

    <title>Nokia E52 Contacts Failure - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia E52 Contacts Failure</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using a Nokia E52 phone for some time. Yesterday after a switch on after a flight I loose all my contacts. They are stored in phone memory. None of the contacts are shown. But … if someone who is on my contact list (which a can not see) is calling me
 or when I manually phone someone which already exist in the contacts list, on the phone screen the name appears. So obviously the contacts are still there, but it is not possible to see them from the contacts list or from the list in messaging system. I have
 tried to sync my contacts whit Ovi Suite, but I receive an error saying that it is not possible to access phone memory. I tried to copy phone memory to SIM card but nothing happens. Anyone with solution?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>You must have changed the memory from which to display contact. If your contacts are already saved on phone memory go to Contacts&gt;Options&gt;Settings&gt;Contacts and in the first option " Contacts to Display" set it right.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

            This might work:<br />
<br />
Shut down the phone.<br />
Remove the sim card.<br />
Restart the phone WITHOUT inserting the simcard. Again shut down the phone.<br />
Re-insert the simcard &amp; start up phone.<br />

            This has been reported a few times, but not sure what causes it.&nbsp; I would think that leaving the Insider Program on that device and Restarting will reset things back to normal.&nbsp; I think that there is a Registry setting which may show Disabled when this
 happens.&nbsp; After leaving Insider Program and Restarting, try joining it again and Restarting.

<h3> phil day  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleting old emails from Inbox</h2>
                    <p>Should be an easy fix - but not so easy to find. I would like to delete all emails in Inbox only that are older than say 3 months&nbsp; - other folders that I have created to remain untouched &amp; for manual deletion only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doesn't work well in the Office 365 program - says it will autoarchive items older than 3 mnoths &amp; send to deleted files but the old emails remain there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't see an option in the web based version to do this either. Surely there are alot of people out there that would like to easily delete their older emails to stop Inbox clogging up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Phil D,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting here. Based your description, you want to auto delete emails&nbsp;in Inbox only that are older than older than 3 months. And if you have installed Outlook desktop client in your PC, it is supported in Outlook client and you can do as following
 steps to achieve it:</p>
