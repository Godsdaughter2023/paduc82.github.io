<p>Windows 7 - wireless broadband was working perfectly but suddenly stopped - and now I have only a message "not connected - no connections are available".</p>
<p>The network, router etc are all fine - our other computers all connect without problem. Have tried a brand new USB wireless adapter and confirmed latest drivers are installed - still nothing.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>UPDATE</p>
<p>Thanks for the advice - we have now got things working by taking a chance and disabling the firewall</p>
<p>* disabled the firewall (Miscrosoft's own and a third-party one)</p>
<p>* re-installed drivers</p>
<p>* opened up control panel - hardware and sound - devices and printers&nbsp; and clicked on&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">add a device</span></p>
<p>hey presto! Wireless networks now identified.</p>
<p>* firewalls re-established.</p>
<p>* connection resumed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn't explain why it stopped working in the first place ...&nbsp; Ah, well...</p>

<h3> cs2612  say:</h3>
<h2>            0x00000133 DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION Blue Screen of Death</h2>
                    <p>My computer just updated itself yesterday morning and ever since then, every few hours, i get a DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION bluescreen that freezes my computer for a few minutes and then crashes it. This has happened repeatedly and i don't know what the cause
 is. I've updated numerous drivers, attempted to scan my drives and see if anything was wrong, but all of this doesn't seem to have helped. All i know is that this latest Windows 8.1 update caused this to start happening and i have no clue as to why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to avoid re-installing Windows if necessary, but it it comes to that, i won't argue. If there's another solution, or someone can tell me what might be causing this at the very least, then i'd be incredibly appreciative.</p>

            It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen crashes. 
<br />
<br />Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

</p><p>Heres the minidump files, straight from my Windows folder. As you can see, the crash has happened four times over the past three days: three times on 1/14 and once yesterday, on 1/15.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try Andre de Costa's method of uninstalling the update if all else fails, but hopefully someone can use those minidump files to see what the root of the problem is.</p>

            No issues but at least try reinstalling it which might fix BSODs. The reason I recommend WD is because of the fact that 3rd party AVs would always have problems considering the Windows 10 servicing model of 2 major upgrades per year.<br />Logitech might be what I was looking for because their recent driver update is known to cause BSODs.

            Here's the thing: I'm in Windows 8.1 though. Every solution i've tried before coming here was focused on Windows 10, not Win8.1. Give me a bit to reinstall all the drivers you mentioned (save for Norton) and i'll&nbsp; get back to you. I've used the computer
 for about a day now with no issue, but i uninstalled Skype because it updated along with Windows and seemed to be the issue at first.

<h2>            Where is the lgc key on my keyboard&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I keep getting a blue screen on my HP desktop computer that says <em>"Press the LGC key for start-up menu".&nbsp;
</em>But I can't find a key on my Logitech keyboard that says LGC.&nbsp; I'd sure appreciate some help, thank-you.&nbsp;

            Thanks for getting back to me so fast, Zackary.&nbsp; Yes, I've tried pressing the ESC button several times with no luck.&nbsp; I've pressed many keys on my keyboard and did the unplugging thing but nothing has worked so far.&nbsp; Right now I'm using my other computer
 so am able to at least be online.&nbsp;

            I'm oddly confused as to why it is asked you for the LGC button. LGC is Logitech Gaming Center/Software. 
<br />
<br />I would uninstall all instances of this software, then try again. I have a logitech board, and also do not have this button. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise, to open a start-up menu, you just press the windows key.

Does your keyboard have a command key?&nbsp; I'm just wondering if that is what its meaning.

<p>I don't know what the heck is going on, Zackary!&nbsp; I've never done any gaming, mostly use my computer just for emailing and Google searching.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how to uninstall all instances of this software as you suggested.&nbsp; I can't even get into that computer, it just shows the blue screen saying to press the LGC key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I did try pressing the <em>Windows </em>key as you suggested here but nothing happened, the screen remained lock on the blue screen saying to press the LGC key.&nbsp; I became so exasperated that I unplugged it and have decided to give it a rest for the weekend
 ;-)&nbsp; Thanks ever so much for all your suggestions, I really appreciate it.&nbsp; </p>

            You may provide a photo of the exact message for us to see. There is 100% no such thing as an LGC key as you may have also guessed.

<p>Thanks, Zackary, so kind of you to keep trying to help me out.&nbsp; This morning my screen finally unlocked and I was able to get into the HP diagnostic site and do a thorough diagnosing thus getting me back online. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I no longer have a picture of that LGC message.&nbsp; And yes, I did guess there is 100% no such thing as an LGC key ;-) &nbsp; I even checked 2 new keyboards I have, a new Logitech and a new Microsoft keyboard and neither have an LGC key.&nbsp; Strange, eh ~ welcome
 to modern technology :-) &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks ever so much again, Zackary, and have a great 2019! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Here's what happened, Zackary.&nbsp; I kept the computer unplugged for a day, it's an HP 2211x Desktop, I have Windows 10, and it usually works like a charm.&nbsp; When I plugged it back in, that LGC notice was gone and I had an HP popup to do a diagnosis which
 I did and that got me back online.&nbsp; Previous to that my screen was frozen &amp; keyboard locked so I was unable to do anything.&nbsp; It looked to be something to do with running a S.M.A.R.T test which passed after a few min's and then I was back online.&nbsp; I don't even
 know what a S.M.A.R.T test is so I'll jot down a note to Google search it.&nbsp; Thanks ever so much for all your help. &nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>HighMAT&nbsp;is obsolete now and there are very few <br />
DVD Players that will recognize the format.<br />
<br />
If you wish to create a Video CD (VCD) or a Video<br />
DVD...you will need DVD Authoring software.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
First step would be to save the Movie Maker project <br />
in the .WMV movie format to a folder on your hard drive. <br />
Then you could play it in Windows Media Player and <br />
share it with others.<br />
<br />
Windows XP Movie Maker 2.1.....<br />
To save as a .wmv movie file...<br />
Type...Ctrl+P (or go to...File / Save Movie File)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to open the Save Movie Wizard /<br />
Choose...My Computer /<br />
Next /<br />
Enter a Name and a Save Location /<br />
Next /<br />
Tick...'Best Quality For My Computer'<br />
Next/<br />
Wait while the movie is saved /<br />
Finish...<br />
<br />
If you wish to create a Video CD (VCD) or Video DVD...<br />
for use in a freestanding DVD Player Import the Movie <br />
file into DVD Authoring software...the following freeware <br />
may be worth a try.<br />
<br />
(FWIW) It's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore Point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
DVD Flick<br />
<a href="http://www.videohelp.com/tools/DVD_Flick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videohelp.com/tools/DVD_Flick</a><br />
(the file you need to download is : 'dvdflick_setup_1.3.0.7.exe')<br />
(Download from (direct link) is the fastest.)<br />
<br />
Save the file to your desktop or a folder on your<br />
hard drive and install from there.<br />
<br />
Be sure to read the Guide:<br />

AVI to DVD using DVD Flick Guide<br />

<br />
To create a basic Video DVD that should play in most<br />
free standing DVD players...try the following...<br />
<br />
First...read the DVD Flick Guide to familiarize yourself<br />
with the program.<br />
<br />
Open DVD Flick and insert a blank CD or DVD in your<br />
burner.<br />
<br />
If your computer's Autoplay window opens....just close it.<br />
<br />
Click the Project Settings button and go to...Video /<br />
Target format...residents of USA...choose...NTSC /<br />
Accept.<br />
<br />
(Also...if you wish to create a Video CD (VCD) go to...<br />
Project Settings / General / Target Size...and select...<br />
CD-700 (700MB).<br />
<br />
Left click the Add title button and browse to your<br />
Movie Clips and select the ones you want on the DVD.<br />
<br />
You can arrange them by selecting one and then use<br />
the Move Up and Move Down buttons.<br />
<br />
To allow a longer duration on the DVD...left click the<br />
Project Settings button / select Video / open the Target<br />
Bitrate drop window. Choosing a smaller number will<br />
result in longer duration on the DVD. Press...Accept.<br />
<br />
The vertical bar on the left of the screen will indicate<br />
how much compression you need.<br />
<br />
Left click the Create DVD button / OK / Yes / Yes.<br />
<br />
Wait while the DVD is created.<br />
<br />
When the text "Finished Successfully" appears you<br />
may close DVD Flick. Now you can eject your DVD<br />
and play it in your DVD player.<br />
<br />
At some point you may wish to purchase more<br />
advanced software like Sony, Cyberlink, Nero, Roxio,<br />
Adobe, Ulead, etc...but at least this is a start.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</p>

                    <p><strong>Original tilte:</strong> I keep getting an invalid IP address. </p>
<p>I have an ASUS Notebook K43E on which i am running Windows 7 Home Premium. </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am connected to my home wireless network but every few hours I lose internet connectivity. when i run the troubleshooter after it resets my network adaptor it says that i have an invalid IP address.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem is fixed when i reset my router/modem but it happens all over again in an hour or two. i have looked everywhere in all sorts of forums for a fix but to no avail. These are the things i have tried</div>

</div>
<div>- ipconfig/renew</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- Disabling other network adaptors</div>

</div>
<div>- Updating network adaptor drivers</div>

</div>
<div>- Changing from auto detect IP address then changing back</div>

<div>I read something about the same problem but on Vista and the apparent solution was to change a registry key but the location doesn't exist on my computer and i don't want to go messing with the registry</div>

            <p>Dear Manasa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The printer works in windows 8 but not the scanner. I have been to the Epson site, as suggested, but buried away on the site is a statement that the Epson RX 620 is not supported for scanning in windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The work around which is a bit tedious is to insert a card in the printers card slot and manually scan to "card" , windows 8 recognises the card as a removable drive so you can then move the scanned images into my documents. as I said it's&nbsp;tedious!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Richard.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The questions is about Skype for Windows.</p>
<p>In the previous versions of Skype, each (or almos each) of contact have a status sign: 'in network', 'not in network', 'not disturbed'. However, after updating to 12.1811.248.0, I don't see wether the abonent is connected.&nbsp; This feature is rather important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody have any idea?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the Skype version you're currently on, the three statuses we have are: <strong>
Active</strong> (green dot), <strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> (red dot) and <strong>
Invisible </strong>(greyed out).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you prefer to see old Skype statuses like<em> Online</em>, <em>Away</em>,<em> Do Not Disturb</em>,
<em>Invisible</em> and<em> Offline</em>, you can download the official classic Skype version 7.41.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Go to <strong>www.skype.com</strong></li><li>Click on <strong>Downloads</strong> tab</li><li>From the blue drop-down button, select <strong>Get classic Skype</strong></li></ul>

<h2>            I accidentally deleted a registry and now I&#39;m unable to access the internet</h2>
                    I was updating my iphone and it got stuck.&nbsp; I found a solution and it asked me to delete a file within this registry:
<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters<br />
<br />
However, I misread the article and I deleted the whole registry folder, not a file within it.&nbsp; As of now, I'm unable to access the internet.&nbsp; I deleted this registry on both a desktop that runs on Vista 32bit (I think) and on a laptop that runs on Vista 64bit.&nbsp;
 I tried to use system restore, but I can't even do that.&nbsp; Please help me find a solution for this problem.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thank you.

            Hello toeknee1029,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Vista Forums.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I would suggest to first try a System Restore to a point in time prior to changing registry.&nbsp; Using the System Restore tool may not necessarily help you determine the issue. The System Restore tool uses restore points to return system files and settings to
 an earlier point in time. You can use it to restore the operating system to a point in time in which you did not experience the issue. When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.&nbsp;<br />

<p><strong><span>Important Notice</span></strong><strong><span>:

            Hello! I have not heard of any widespread problems with Edge since the update. I’d recommend doing a system file check by opening a command prompt (right click on the start menu and click command prompt (admin,) typing sfc /scannow and hitting enter.

            Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />A. Reset / Repair Edge 
<br />Type Apps in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Apps &amp; features &gt; Click Default Apps &gt; Go down, Select Microsoft Edge and click Reset
<br />If Reset doesn't work, press Repair

<br />
<br />If you don't want to disable, do following to make it work (this is from reply of johnmoorehead in the above thread)
<br />
<br />1. Open Rapport's Console by choosing - Start Menu &gt; Programs &gt; Trusteer Endpoint Protection &gt; Trusteer Endpoint Protection Console
<br />2. Advance to the next page by clicking on the green arrow at the bottom-right.
<br />3. Under 'Security Policy' at the top left corner, click on 'Edit Policy'.
<br />4. Enter the letters as they are shown in the image and click OK.
<br />5. Locate 'Early Browser Protection' and select 'Never' in the drop-down menu.

<h2>            BSOD after one of your updates</h2>
                    Saturday as my Toshiba yet again tried ( and failed) to download the latest Windows 10 update, I went to turn off my computer and guess what, all the sudden my computer started acting funny, not shutting down as usual but acting like it wanted to restart,
 only I didn't hit restart, I hit SHUT DOWN. after the little circle went round and round, nothing,&nbsp; a lovely blue screen with a sad face telling me I had an error code of OXC000021a. Over and over again, it cycled, doing the same damn thing. The computer is
 only about 2 years old, it came with Windows 10 when I purchased it. I use 3rd party software to protect my computer because I trust them, I do not trust your company, nor will I. You can't even fix the stupid updates that ruined my computer. I had work on
 my computer, photo's I hadn't yet backed up because I spent my Christmas sick as a dog with Influenza A. You took that all from me because of a stupid update that you didn't care much about being sure of before rolling it out

<p>Hi Wiley,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that you're having usually happens if the computer encountered some corruption or mismatched system files. We would like to know what troubleshooting steps have you done so far. Have you tried downloading an ISO file to perform a repair?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, we recommend that you download the Windows<span> 10 ISO and create an installation media using Media Creation Tool. Kindly click this&nbsp;
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and check the information under

</strong>for you to know the proper requirements before downloading it. After you've accomplished the appropriate requirements, click on
<strong>Download tool now</strong> tab and follow the on-screen instruction.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After the installation media is created, follow the steps provided below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to
<strong>“Press any key to boot from DVD,”</strong> do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the
<strong><span>Install Windows</span></strong> page, tap or click <strong><span>Repair your computer</span></strong> to start the Windows Recovery Environment.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the Windows Recovery Environment, on the <strong><span>Choose an option</span></strong> screen, tap or click
<strong><span>Troubleshoot.</span></strong></p>

<p>I have Windows XP Media Center Edition.&nbsp; Internet Explorer 8.0.6001.18702.&nbsp; 1024 MB system memory.&nbsp; 100GB hard drive.&nbsp; AMD Turion 64 Mobile Processor.</p>

<p>What does this message mean?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may not be related but my speakers have an echo effect also.&nbsp; </p>

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Did you make any software or hardware changes on the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Let’s follow these steps &amp; check if it helps:<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>a) You may boot the computer into ‘safe mode’ and check if the issue re-appears. It will start Windows XP with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed,
 follow the steps to boot the computer in safe mode:</span></p>
<p><span>i. Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>ii. Start tapping F8 key.</span></p>
<p><span>iii. You will get advanced boot option window.</span></p>
<p><span>iv. Select the option “Safe mode”.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, refer this link:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>A description of the Safe Mode Boot options in Windows XP</span></a></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
b) If the issue does not re-appear in safe mode, you may configure the computer in clean boot state and check if the issue persists. It will start Windows XP by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs and helps to eliminate software conflicts.
</span></p>
<p><span>The following link has steps showing how to perform clean boot: </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</span></a><span><br />
<br />
<b>Note:</b> Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following the section ‘Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state’ from the article: How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state:

<p>In system config utility I followed all of the directions but when pressing ok at the end receive an error.</p>
<p>It appears related to checking the Hide all Microsoft services box and hitting ok.</p>

<p>If we reboot following the error, on the general tab, we need to try and reclear the load startup items checkbox, then on the system tab,, we need to reselect hide all Microsoft

<h2>            LOCKED&#58; I have been robbed</h2>
                    
<p>Recently I purchased a three month subscription to a gold membership of xbox live. &nbsp;After trying to connect to live, I was prompted to download an update. &nbsp;The update, however, was unable to be completed and an error screen appeared. &nbsp;To make a long story
 short, I called into the xbox support 800 number and they said that my xbox had been "modified" and was booted out of the system. &nbsp;I do not understand how this could have happened. &nbsp;I do not play a lot of xbox, but when I do, I play either Call of Duty or
 Rainbow 6, and that's about it. &nbsp;I am not half as smart as I would have to be in order to "modify" anything. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
After explaining this to the support people, they said that they were sorry and that they could do nothing about my situation. &nbsp;I asked if I could send my xbox in so that they could see that it hadn't been modified. &nbsp;They said that the xbox is out of warranty
 so I would have to spend 120 dollars. &nbsp;They also advised that I don't do that because it was an old system and I should just buy a new one. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Fine. &nbsp;I decided not to push it any further and just bend over. &nbsp;I ended up needing to spend 300 dollars for a new xbox because the 250 gb hard drive that i have for my arcade xbox obviously isn't compatible with the newer xboxes. &nbsp;Great. &nbsp;Three hundred dollars
 later, I finally have my new xbox and I'm trying to get onto live. &nbsp;Surprise surprise, when I try to play on live it says that my PROFILE is no longer allowed to use xbox live. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now I am upset. &nbsp;Not only did I have to spend 300 dollars that I never should have had to because I have no idea how to "modify" my xbox, but now I have hours of saved information that I lost because my PROFILE is also banned (something that system failed to
 mention until AFTER my 300 dollar purchase).<br />
<br />
I called into support again explaining all of this and asking if they can reverse the ban on my profile. &nbsp;Apparently this isn't possible. &nbsp;But they did tell me that "a long and thorough investigation of a console goes on before it is banned." &nbsp;It would have
 been nice to be notified about this investigation so I could have stopped whatever I might have been doing (which was just simply playing two games that I bought). &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Anyway, they said that if I post my complaint on the support forums, someone can look into the whole situation and explain to me what it is that I was doing that got my xbox, and my profile, banned from the system. &nbsp;So here I am. &nbsp; &nbsp;
<br />
<br />
My gamertag was&nbsp;<b>[mod removed]</b><br />
<br />
Thank you&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Re-Enable BitLocker on Windows 10 Home - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Re-Enable BitLocker on Windows 10 Home</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to seek assistance in re-enabling BitLocker on a Lenovo Yoga with Windows 10 Home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A bit of history.&nbsp; The laptop was purchased with Windows 10 Home.&nbsp; I would need to re-partition the drive (SSD) to the owner's request of 200GB for System and the the rest for data drive.&nbsp; Using disk management, I can only shrink the system drive to over
 400GB (I would need it to be 200GB) due to unmovable files.&nbsp; Both C: and D: drives has been identified by disk manager as
<em>BitLocker Encrypted</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Disk Manager, I was able to shrink the partition to over 400GB but I would need more so I reverted it back, no problem there.&nbsp; I have tried to disable the
<em>hibernation</em>, <em>paging files</em> and <em>system protection</em>, reboot then defrag.&nbsp; Still can not make it to work.&nbsp; Re-enabled the the services reverting it to default values.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I have used AOMEI Partition Assistant Standard to do the partitioning for me.&nbsp; However, upon running it, the Resize feature is disabled even after a restart.&nbsp; I remembered that the drive is BitLocker protected and disabled it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that the system is running happily, I would want to revert back and re-enable the drive encryption.&nbsp; However, I can not find the settings to do it.&nbsp; Additionally, I have read in multiple sources online that BitLocker is not available in Home edition.&nbsp;
 How come that from factory settings, it was enabled by default so I'm pretty sure that I can re-enable it, thus I am seeking your assistance on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong>BitLocker</strong> security feature is available only in

<p>Hi Johann Eva,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; The unit was purchased with Windows 10 Home on SSD and Disk Manager has identified drives C and D to be encrypted.&nbsp; I have not gotten any screenshot but the it looks similar to the image (from http://i.stack.imgur.com/n8C5E.png):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7ffedbf-34ef-4b73-aae1-46110afddf44?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7ffedbf-34ef-4b73-aae1-46110afddf44?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to go to System and turn off the drive encryption.&nbsp; However, I can not undo this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and regards,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may have bee mistaken.&nbsp; Maybe what was previously enabled was device encryption (InstantGo).&nbsp; Have done some readings today about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
In cmd prompt, typing "powercfg /a" does not include "<em>Standby (Connected)</em>" value but rather "<em>Standby (S0 Low Power Idle) Network Connected</em>"</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
The device was perhaps encrypted before so it should have been supported.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Do you have any idea on how to re-enable it?</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Thanks in advance!</p>

<h2>            Wireless Driver repeatedly uninstalls itself</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I've been having problems with my laptop recently where the wireless driver uninstalls itself. This happens sometimes when it's been in standby, hibernation or off. It doesn't happen every time but it's getting more frequent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use HP Recovery manager each time to reinstall Intel 7260/3160 Wireless LAN driver for Microsoft Windows which solves the problem until it disappears again. This is on a Windows 10 laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this problem or know how to fix it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>This means that you are moving around.&nbsp; Do you have all of the different networks set to connect automatically?</p>
<p>If you are in the range of the router does it drop?</p>
<p>Are there places that you go that are not in range of one of the networks?</p>

    <title>Bring back Windows xp. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joekind58  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bring back Windows xp.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Simply I DO NOT care for the look and functionality of Windows 7 or 8!&nbsp; </p>
<p>I am not new to computers as I have been around since the beginnings of Windows 95. Each operating system up to Windows XP brought changes that were logical and easy to use. After all a operating system is just that, a operating system. Windows is a great
 name because if you can picture yourself in a room with many windows, each window takes you where you need to go. Possibly opening a program, going on the internet or checking your mail.&nbsp; In a simple form that was perfect for the average user Windows XP was
 perfectly laid out. Simple, functional and easy to use, seems those words have been forgotten.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Windows Vista had some logical improvements but it contained to much "bloat" that slowed down computers. It was the start of extra "eye candy" that was really not needed and these were the same things that would slow down a computer that worked just fine
 with XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now we jump to Windows 8. It's obviously a system that was designed by computer geeks for computer geeks without any thought given for the casual computer user. This is where the words "simple, functional and easy to use" got thrown out of the virtual window!
 Windows 8 might make perfect sense to a trendy new age computer geek that spends most of his/her day on a smart phone, but to the person who was and still is happy with the simple functionality of XP, they are now lost and left in the dust.</p>
<p>&nbsp; We are now faced with laptop touch pads that have so many functions that if you slightly move your finger in the wrong direction the screen will do all sorts of crazy things. When you try and do a simple search to locate something like your touch pad properties,
 the search box brings up all the wrong items. Tile boxes for many things that I will never use. A photo program that does not allow you to go to each photo by pressing the arrow keys. So many other things that were once easy to do have been "over geeked" to
 try and appeal to the younger crowd. </p>
<p>&nbsp; I have a very simple idea for Microsoft that will avoid people from getting upset and not liking all these newer trendy changes to a operating system. I know there is a program compatibility mode in Windows 8 that will try and allow a older program to
 run in a Windows 8 environment. How about having a user compatibility mode? Just simply select the operating system that you liked using , XP ,Vista or even Windows 98 for those nostalgic computer users and that is what your home screen will look and function
 like. Have the option to booting to that home screen and everyone will be happy again. Bring back the days of a simple and functional operating system. Back when a touch pad just moved the pointer and scrolled the screen.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Logical, functional, simple....please bring it back!</p>

            <p>Sadly enough, Microsoft isn't the one that makes the touchpad do all those crazy things.&nbsp; The OEM system builders add in that junk. And since every system builder like Dell, HP, Compaq, Acer, Asus... they all do it differently, I can't even tell you definitively
 how to turn it off.&nbsp; Toshiba laptops even require you to go to the Toshiba website and download a separate program to turn off the touchpad swipes.&nbsp; But again, not Microsoft's fault on that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately most laptop builders make it easy to turn off. Dell specifically, but others too.</p>

            To be obsolete means to not be used regularly. 60% of windows users still use windows XP, and it still functions with most modern programs, Including every program used by most people including, But not limited to, Photoshop (Usually), Mozilla Firefox,
 Chrome, Microsoft office, Steam, And all web pages function perfectly. OLD is not a good excuse, If even an excuse, don't try to use it. DEAD means that it does not function at all, and windows XP functions perfectly, and can continue to function perfectly
 if an anti-virus is installed.<br />

            <p>GOOD POINT</p>
<p>and i got to tell you that i am NOT impressed with Windows 8.1 or Windows 8 at all, microsoft can shove the Modern\metro UI up the A$$! I installed Windows 8.1 OEM System builders disk on a PC with only 512 MB of ram, and it laged so bad that i reinstalled
 Dell OEM Windows XP on that machine!, i also tried to "Upgrade" windows XP to Windows Vista, on a PC with2 gigs of ram, it was slower an less stable than Windows Melenium Edition in VMware, with 2 gigs of ram. It seems as if the "modern" Operating Systems
 are using MORE ram and More&nbsp;CPU resources than the OSs did, I understand windows XP is&nbsp;12 YEARS old,&nbsp;and I also understand that modern OSes&nbsp;use more system resources. but the STABILITY, and USABILITY of the new&nbsp;oses is lacking, too.&nbsp;Microsoft specificly made
 Windows 8 for Tablets, even though it&nbsp;<strong>Works,</strong> that is <strong>all it does, it barely works and is functional on a Desktop PC.</strong></p>

</p><blockquote><strong>Windows XP is Old, Obsolete and not to mention DEAD as far as Microsoft is concerned. It will Never "come back".</strong>

What is DEAD is Microsoft to me. I refuse to continue buying newer versions since XP. I am 57 and have been a loyal customer dating back to the 90s. But no more. If Microsoft chooses to leave me behind, then I choose to leave Microsoft behind. What is really
 puzzling to me is the "all or nothing" mentality. Microsoft should (by all means) geek up all they want. There is a market for that. But there is also a market for people like me, who like the Old and Obsolete (to some) and are perfectly happy and comfortable
 with XP. Why would Microsoft want to lose this percentage of loyal customers? Your best customer is a repeat customer. Well... this one is no longer repeating!

<p>But I have used other OS, including Vista, Windows 7 and 8.1. A lot is lost.&nbsp; I am not being ignorant. I have used, compared and have made a preference. Many XP functions which are important to me&nbsp;are missing starting with Vista. One is the ability to know
 in which Email Group someone in my email list may belong,&nbsp;without having to go through all groups to discover maybe the answer is none and I need to add that person to a group. May sound irrelevant to you but it is not to me. I still use an XP as of today.
 Actully make that 3. 3 XP, one Vista, and the wife has an 8.1 which is frustrating as can be for both of us.</p>

            <p>That's not true, the ability to create groups in your address book has never been removed and remains in every OS Microsoft has made since and after XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After XP, in Windows Vista, they took the Outlook Express program, renamed it as "Windows Mail" and added some blue colors to the toolbar.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 7, that same email program remains available as an optional program (and also in Windows 8, 8.1, and 10).&nbsp; They've never discontinue because so many people use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could use it to if you want to, they never took anything away from you.&nbsp; If you want email groups, you got it
<a href="http://get.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">right here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure, Windows 8 and after might come with a bonus tablet email app, but you don't have to use it. You can keep using what you used in Windows XP/Vista/7.&nbsp; That's why they've kept updating it, just for people like you that want it.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the replies. I appreciate them. Regarding "the ability to create groups in your address book has never been removed" that is not what I said. What I said is "the ability to know in which Email Group someone in my email list may belong, without
 having to go through all groups to discover maybe the answer is none and I need to add that person to a group." If it is in Vista, 7, 8, please let me know. I would love to be proved wrong. So, go to anyone in your address book, and see if you can determine
 if they belong in a group.&nbsp;I can in XP. I cannot in Vista, 7 or 8. When you go to the properties of any person in your Address Book, XP has a tab which says Other, which shows Group Membership. Please please, let me know where this tab is&nbsp;or any other ability
 is in Vista, 7 or 8.&nbsp;I email to 1,500 people in different groups, therefore, it helps me tremendously if I can keep track. Currently I&nbsp;use an XP laptop just for this purpose.</p>

            <p>As long as you use the same program, it will be the same.&nbsp; Other than the toolbar being made to look like Office, this is still "Outlook Express" you had 15 years ago. There's been no change of viewing who is in the group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know exactly where you are looking, but if you get or write a new message to a group, you can click the plus sign to see who is in the group.</p>

</p><div>You'll notice when you open the dialogs, options, or account screens that this is the same program as XP had. Indeed even the DLL files are still called MSIMN (which is what Outlook Express was before it was renamed). In fact this same program has been
 known by many names.</div>
<div>Windows 95: Microsoft Internet Mail and News (MSIMN)<br />
then in Windows 98 until Vista: Outlook Express<br />
then in Windows Vista only: Windows Mail<br />
then in Windows 7 after: Windows Live Mail<br />
(this last one continues for 7, 8, 8.1, and now Windows 10.. it's a new record for longest the name has stayed the same).</div>
<div>But regardless of name, it's the same program with the same functions. And even though the last rename was in 2007, it's been updated many times and continues to be supported for all users that want better email (but don't want to pay for full Microsoft
 Office Outlook).</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 Version 1511 KB 3163018 will not install</h2>
                    Update KB 3163018 for Windows 10 Version 1511 has tried and failed to install a dozen times or more. I have downloaded the install file separately and executed, but it fails as well. Gets to update screen, indicating 1% complete, stops, says it cannot
 install and is reverting to the prior state. Have searched many threads and found that hundreds if not thousands of others are having the same problem, but no clear path to fixing it. Running Windows 10 Pro on a Lenovo i7 with 8GB memory, Avast Anti-Virus
 (although I have shut that down and tried to&nbsp;install without it, to no avail). Machine was upgraded from Windows 8.1 Pro in&nbsp;July, 2015 without difficulty. Generally seems to work OK, but I want the security updates packaged in KB 3163018.

            Well, not so helpful. On one of the failed update efforts the machine would not reboot. I did an entirely fresh Windows 10 reinstall. I spent perhaps 10 hours reinstalling all my programs, their updates, data files, tweaking settings in fifteen apps, etc.
 Now, the likelihood that I will do another re-install and face that torture again is low, less even&nbsp;than the likely that I will finally do what so many others have concluded must be done - go Apple.

            Most of the problems are due to Windows firewall being turned off.<br />
<br />
Open services by typing in services.msc in Run,right click Windows firewall service and set it to automatic.Start it if it is stopped<br />
<br />
Make sure the service named security center should also be the same.<br />
<br />
Go to windows update and retry the install.

Still won't install. I suspect that there is something in the update that is incompatible with an app on my machine. I have nothing but standard apps, so I can't imagine what the incompatibility is. Very frustrating.
