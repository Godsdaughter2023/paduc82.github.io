<p>How does one use the "Copy Link to Paragraph" function?&nbsp; It's something that I have never been able to figure out.</p>
<p>When I select a word, sentence, paragraph, or container, and right-click, I see the option.&nbsp; However, if I select it and then go to another page, select some text and then try to link to it, it does not work.</p>
<p>So, it does not work as expected, and the Help file seems completely useless when I search for "Copy Link to Paragraph".</p>

<p>1.) If one wants to see the linked word on the target page one can just<br />
use "insert" (icon in the Ribbon, Shift+Ins, Ctrl+V).</p>

<h2>            Cracked screen microsoft band 2</h2>
                    only had my band since christmas as today out of nowhere the screen cracked. I did not drop or hit it on anything. I checked via the paperwork and says only covered for 90 days which i find unusual, and to see so many posts with the same thing. And now
 you want almost as much as a new band 133.00 gbp to not fix but replace and by the time i add postage its more than a new one costs in the shop. Is there anywhere that i can take it for repair for alot less money. ? &nbsp;Very upset as i love my band 2 .

    <title>Short lag if flicks turned on Monoprice 10594 drawing tablet. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danger noodle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Short lag if flicks turned on Monoprice 10594 drawing tablet.</h2>
                    <p>So since last year, drawing tablets have had issues with windows ink in which there will be a short lag if you have flicks turned on (imagine the first 1/2 a second of your stroke not being there, it makes it hard to draw). But, the fix was to turn off flicks
 and you're golden. But now that setting is gone, and i assume it has been fully integrated into windows ink. I use the app FireAlpaca to draw if that helps, and I'm using a monoprice 10594 drawing tablet. I've fixed this issue on both of my other computers
 but this new one doesn't seem like I'll be getting a fix soon. Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(P.S: If any microsoft employee sees this, PLEASE make this an easier setting to fix, it's quite a headache to fix for anyone having the issue!)</p>
<p>

<h2>            Office 365 subscription keeps telling me I need to renew it even though I just did</h2>
                    <p>To my knowledge, my subscription to Office 365 renewed itself in January because I signed up for the yearly renewal thing. And that's what it does, it renews every year.&nbsp;Then 3 months later I get emails five to ten times a day saying it expired and I need
 to pay again to renew it, even though there is no option to renew it every 3 month. Confused, I come here and of course get no help from these lovely "tech support" people. Anyway, now it's saying it expired and need to be "reinstalled." So I did, come back,
 and of course it still doesn't work. Go figure. I don't know why I even bother with Microsoft anymore. I've come to these "support" forums many times before and half the time they're just scammers.&nbsp;I even caved in and tried to pay for it again just so I could
 stop getting emails and use my account, but no, of course that won't work either. :) Can someone help? Like actually help? I need this for school...</p>

<p>
</p><p>So I've had this for a year now, no problem. Renewed it back in Jan or Feb, no problem. Paid my 100+ bucks for it (fee to be yearly renewed) too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it's saying I need to renew it again for the same price. Why? I already got it renewed. They've been sending me billing emails like 3 times a day too, recently. It's very annoying... I don't have the money to pay for something I already should have!
 I already paid for it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>They said it was a credit card problem. I checked and there is no problem. Now I'm worried they'll take it off because of this... I need this program for classes!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even checked billing records and it says I have one purchase complete, which I'm assuming is the one I renewed back in Jan, and this "new" current one pending. But for some reason both bills have today's date. Wth?</p>

            flashlite 3 is builtin the e71 firmware, just open your browser and go to the youtube website but make sure youre not in the mobile version of the site. there, you can watch youtube videos directly in the browser.

            I was having this problem. I could watch YouTube at home from WiFi but not out and about through the 3 network. The following fixed it for me:<br />
<br />
Menue - Media - Real Player - Options - Settings - Streaming - Network - Default Access Point.<br />
<br />
On my phone it had defaulted to my home WiFi router so I changed this from the drop down menu to 3 (my provider) and it works great now.

<p>This worked for me and my E71. Good luck with yours.</p>
<p>1.On your phone, get on google and search <strong>youtube.sisx</strong></p>
<p>2. Of the search list items, this should be first one you see:<strong> youtube.sisx - mobile9&nbsp;</strong> if it's not first, scroll for it...<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>3. Once at the site, choose <strong>download. </strong>It may take a few minutes for the site to load up. *When asked, pick your country, accept license stuff, user agreements, yaddayaddayadda.</p>
<p>4. Once downloaded, get off internet and go to the phone's main menu. Look for and choose the "<strong>Installed" icon</strong>.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>5. Once in the Installed area, choose<strong> APP Manager. (</strong>You're going here to check to see if the download is there). Scroll down until you see a puzzle piece looking thing entitled YouTube w/ a small red square. If it's there, good. If not,
 go back to 1. and retry the download.</p>
<p>6. Once you see the youtube puzzle piece, exit your way out to the main menu again.</p>
<p>7. Now choose <strong>MEDIA</strong></p>
<p>8. Now choose<strong> YOUTUBE </strong>(puzzle piece)<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>9. This should open YouTube<strong>.&nbsp; DO NOT WORRY </strong>that the screen says "starting up". It's ready to go. Just go to the top bar and type in whatever you want.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it works for you too!</p>

            <p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best solution is complete troubleshooting which may include an uninstall and reinstall of MSE from scratch as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></b><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a><span>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE.This means not only current ones but any EVER
 (including free trials you may never have used) or done years ago and possibly forgotten. See the following compliments of Dave__M:<b>If you aren't sure of what may still be on your system as remnants, which could be interfering with the MSE install, try a
 scan of your system with this security application detection and removal specialist:</b></span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://www.appremover.com/</span></b></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install McAfee Security Scanner, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally installed
 McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the PC and
 like any battery can eventually run down).</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify if MSE is already installed that Windows Defender is disabled (Vista or W7) or uninstalled (XP).If not, please do so as this is a classic cause of conflict-related problems.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Then, if anything changed, restart your PC.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, try the following:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try a clean boot (Vista and W7) </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span> (except for MSE). If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down
 the culprit causing the problem. Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it. Once done be sure to reset your system back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode
 then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work. If using XP, see</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</span></a><span> and</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, uninstall and re-install MSE. To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</span></a><span>
 or try </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</span></a><span> I suspect some problem with uninstalling the prior version after being upgraded is behind this (though if not the
 case, these articles still provide instructions to uninstall and going manual often does a more complete job), so you may need to focus more on the manual procedures in the first link or the second link with the Mr. Fixit in aggressive mode AND manual procedures
 to be sure it is completely removed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To install or re-install MSE, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures:</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</span></a><span>-
 but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed after downloading MSE but before you install. To fully remove them, check out this
 listing of removal tools</span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</span></b></a><span>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product. You cannot just uninstall these programs - you MUST also use the removal tool - even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn't use a removal tool at the time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To install, go to </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></a><span> and click on more languages and versions and then
 choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running it). When finished, uninstall and remove any remaining AV program you retained for protections during the download and
 then reboot.Then right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you're logged in as an administrator) as I've found this sometimes helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is
 as safe as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine
 and save.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to the Settings Tab and click on MAPS and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining
 the infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the MAPS database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>*************************************************************</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:</span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><span>
 and SuperAntiSpyware:</span><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a><span> and then run a full ESET online scan:</span><a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</span></a><span>.
 This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either).</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didnâ€™t know at the time).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem. If that doesn't work, the preferred support path is via this entry point:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/ph/15931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/ph/15931</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you choose assisted support, you will be given the choices available for your region. Further MSE assisted support in the US and Canada is no longer available. It *<strong>is</strong>* still available in many other regions of the world.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps. If other support is not available to you, post back with as much information as possible about what happened at every step along the way and how you are trying to do this and where you are now stuck and any error messages and/or
 codes word-for-word (especially any that look like 0x80077064 or some other alpha-numeric code) and we'll see if we can figure it out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<h3> techguy27  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook&#58; Search People Issue</h2>
                    <p>Where does Outlook pull the results from when you use Search People under Find on the ribbon? Is it your Contacts, Address Book, Skype or all the above? For my organization the results looks a lot like Skype for Business however some of our users are not
 getting the options like Schedule a Meeting when you click the 3 dots like I do in the screenshot below. They have that option when using Skype for Business, but it does not show up under Search People in Outlook.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi TechGuy27,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The sources of the search are Global address list - GAL and added contacts. GAL &nbsp;is a list of all end users and groups with email addresses within Exchange server environment. To open it, click on Address Book under the
 Search People tab.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regarding the Schedule Meeting option, Iâ€™d like to suggest you to Repair Office â€“ Control Panel&gt; Programs&gt; Programs and features&gt; Office 365&gt; Change&gt; Repair&gt; Quick repair. After this step, please test the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persist, please feedback me with version details for Office 365 installed on the machines with the issue. Also, please send me the detailed Windows version. It would be useful to compare the affected and unaffected
 users, so please send me the same information for unaffected users too. After these information, Iâ€™ll try to recreate the issue and help you with further suggestions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please feedback me with the results.</span></p>

<h2>            Powerpoint Notes pages corrupt when PPT file uploaded to Sharepoint</h2>
                    When I create a local PPT slide deck and put notes in the notes area, I am able to print the Notes page and the Notes page master is fine. However, once I upload to Sharepoint, the notes page master gets corrupt and I can no longer print the notes page.
 Once it gets corrupt, I cannot fix it.&nbsp; Is there a fix for this?

<p>This is a known bug in PowerPoint Online, but this is the first time I've heard of the same thing happening in SharePoint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first step is to fix the Notes Master by editing the XML:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ00811_Notes_pages_are_odd-sized.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pptfaq.com/FAQ00811_Notes_pages_are_odd-sized.htm</a></p>
<p>Then the Notes Master has to be reset by unchecking and rechecking all 6 of the Notes Master Placeholder checkboxes.</p>
<p>Finally, you usually have to visit every Notes Pages and reapply the Layouts by right-clicking on the page background and choosing
<strong>Notes Layout&gt;Reapply Master</strong>.</p>

    <title>purchasing map connection error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pratzz---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            purchasing map connection error</h2>
                    Hey guys, when i first got my N82 phone about 2 months ago i purchased purchased navigation for a week and downloaded the Australia maps. Everything pretty much worked fine.. at the time i purchased the navigation license using a WLAN connection.<br />
<br />
Now when i try to purchase further navigation, and it tries connecting to the server, i keep getting connection errors, after the 'updating software' screen. I've tried using WLAN, mobile internet connection, and pretty much any other one possible.<br />
<br />
Anyone got the same problem or a solution?<br />
Cheers

            Hi pratzz<br />
<br />
One solution may be to try out Nokia Maps 2.0 here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/betalabs/maps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/betalabs/maps</a><br />
<br />
It is a new installation so will require setting up a network connection afresh.<br />
<br />
Another solution might have been to hard reset your N82 so returning to "factory settings" provided essential phone data is backed up first.

            I have been having similar probs with n95 and n82. On start up i get a request go online-i select yes and for some reason it cant find the wi fi connection. i close the application and then it connects without any request or authorisation. I know its connected
 as it locates where i am and i'm indoors so it can't be the internal gps. i know its not the device at fault as i only have connection probs with maps 2 beta application and not other.

            Thanks scoobyman for the help. Worked fine and now i can select adding the navigation again, in Beta Nokia Maps 2.<br />
<br />
However when it came to connection method, wi-fi didnt work, and so i tried using internet via my operator, and that gave me the purchase options. How weird. Cheers again

    <title>Using short-date format to define x-axis range - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> agparks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using short-date format to define x-axis range</h2>
                    
<p>When working with data in a time series, occasionally you want to hone into a certain period of time. In Excel 2003, users could define the Min and Max axis range by just typing in the desired dates (ex 2/28/2010) and it would appropriately convert it to
 the number for you (ex 40237). <br />
<br />
In Excel 2007, Format Axis-&gt;Axis Options, users can also define the range of the x-axis, but only in the number format (ex 40237). If you type 2/28/2010 into the Max/Min range, it reverts to the orginal number of the Max/Min range (ex 40238). Is there a way
 to type in the short date (2/28/2010) and have it understand this to be "40237"? It is a serious time burden to determine the number formats of your dates for the format axis options.<br />
<br />
Help! Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Meetings based on emails give &#34;HTTP error. the server cannot fulfill the request&#34;</h2>
                    Hi - I use outlook with an Exchange server.
<div>Very often, but not always, if I open an email and then try to set up a meeting by hitting the Meeting icon/button and sending out the resulting&nbsp;invitation&nbsp;email, the&nbsp;invitation&nbsp;is not sent to recipients and I get a&nbsp;"HTTP error. the server cannot fulfill
 the request". The meeting appears in the calendar on my computer but not on Exchange as it is not there in OWA or mobile devices.</div>
<div>Anyone have any ideas of the problem and solutions?</div>
<div>Many thanks.</div>

            Hi Cody
<div>I wondered about that but, no, it does not appear to be recipient specific and happens even if I am the only recipient. It does appear to be email specific. I've tried changing recipients (and other things) and still a certain emails will not work. It
 is a common problem for me. Most emails give this problem and I use this&nbsp;strategy&nbsp;a lot to set up meetings (or I would like to!).</div>
<div>I would also note that I have recently switched to Outlook from Entourage which coincided with my workplace&nbsp;upgrading&nbsp;to Exchange 2010.</div>
<div>Thanks for your help.</div>
<div>Cheers</div>

<p>Hi AndrewPrevost,</p>
<p>Have you tried the direct download link in the previous thread: 
https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/156/t/430217&nbsp;?</p>
<p>Besides, since you've found the DNS could be root cause, have you tried using a different DNS server, such as Google's DNS server 8.8.8.8?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<h3> vc1956  say:</h3>
<h2>            Random email addresses attaching themselves in Office&#47;Outlook but Outlook online shows proper emails</h2>
                    <p>There are really 2 major problems and both occurred on 10/20 with an office/outlook update I installed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) My web outlook has retained all of my sent mails, but my office/outlook is not showing any&nbsp;sent emails between Jan 2016 and 10/22/16. &nbsp;So the sent emails through web version are not synching to my installed office/outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Any emails I now create on Office/Outlook (vs. Web Outlook) have random email addresses 'affix' themselves as sent, and old attachments affix themselves as well -- at least in my version of the mail on Office/Outlook. &nbsp;Web Outlook seems to have the 'properly
 generated' email version in its sent file. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example: On my computer I open my installed Office/Outlook and type an email (with no attachments) to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and send it. &nbsp;Then I look at my sent mail and see an email to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. &nbsp;Additionally there is
 an attachment to the email that would have been part of a very old email to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>THEN I open web outlook at outlook.com and there the Sent Mail shows properly only to janedoe and without any random attachment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could use ANY help with this because I am at a loss! &nbsp;(running Win7)</p>

            <p>I am having exactly the same problem, i didn't pinpoint it as being related to an Outlook update, bu today is Oct 26th and I have just noticed this problem and was not experiencing it a few days ago. &nbsp;Will add the following:</p>
<p>- i am on Windows 10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>- More importantly, went through a process with MS Support Chat yesterday, who of course predictably suggested that my outlook profile might be corrupt, so we created a new one and re-added the account and re-downloaded all the emails from the server. &nbsp;THE
 PROBLEM STILL EXISTS, but note the following:</p>
<p>- the emails i sent yesterday as test emails in the old profile, upon being re-downloaded on the new profile, no longer have a random affixed email address, however this does happen on any new emails I send in the new profile</p>
<p>- still experiencing random attachments in both my sent items and received emails (e.g. an old email in my inbox with medical test results now also contains several family pictures as attachments).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very serious and concerning and I hope Microsoft addresses it ASAP.</p>

            <p>Thank you Palcouk for the instructions. &nbsp;All successfully accomplished with the exception of the "<span style="color: rgba(3, 22, 52, 1)">uninstall the Microsoft Office Outlook Connector " which was not listed my programs for removal.</span></p>
<p>Very happy to have my full sent items back and to be able to send messages without random email addresses and attachments from other messages affixing themselves to my sent message in Office/Outlook. (So far so good and hope it continues).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck to HFA, I hope this solves their issue as well.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks. &nbsp;It helped somewhat but missed a step. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When re-adding the account, you must do so by exiting outlook, going to control panel, Mail, then in there, select the profile you use, click properties, and then add the email account. &nbsp;This will result in a full exchange account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you try to do so as I did at first within outlook, it will just recreate an &nbsp;EAS (exchange active sync) connection, rather than an exchange account. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has full solved my issues which i now realize were 3 problems:</p>
<p>1) Random email addresses affixed to historic sent emails and received emails</p>
<p>2) Random attachments attached to historic sent emails and received emails</p>
<p>3) And 5000 missing emails (I had suspected my email count was lower but wasn't sure as i recently did a cleanup).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am amazed that Microsoft / outlook.com is doing this without explaining or pre-empting the migration issues. &nbsp;They must really not give a toss.</p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to disable it for a few months, you just can remove the account from your Outlook clients. If you just want to disable it for several minutes, you can go to
<strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Accounts</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced</strong> to modify this setting "Sync all IMAP folders every x minutes" if you are using IMAP account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, for the feature you would like, I suggest you to vote via <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293343-outlook-for-mac/suggestions/31409239-add-a-button-or-checkbox-to-disable-an-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>To follow up on Hans post....<br />
<br />
If you had cells formatted as Text and had a mixture of "1" and " 1" in the cells&nbsp;(no quotes, of course) that you wanted to count individually, you can't use either of the formulas you showed nor Hans' formula with just the number; however, if you put an asterisk
 in front of the text, you can count each separately...<br />
<br />
=COUNTIF(A1:A2,"* 1")<br />
<br />
=COUNTIF(A1:A2,"*1")<br />
<br />
Of course, this comes with a BIG CAUTION... you now have to be careful of numbers ending in "1" or " 1", although as a side benefit, using the asterisk appears to make the formula ignore "real numbers".</p>
