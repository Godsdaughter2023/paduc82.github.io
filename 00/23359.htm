<h2>            outlook seems so much slower and more unreliable than hotmail - will this improve or should I choose another email now&#63;</h2>
                    I dont much like the new outlook style but I expect I will get used to it. But the new service is SO unreliable - it takes ages to open; I delete various spam emails - then they reappear again (this has happened so often it is boring). I can't see many
 emails and often I just get a message saying that outlook isn't working.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This morning I tried sending an important email that I have written - repeatedly tried - then lost it and had to write it all again. Then it would not send again. And when I went back to the inbox - all my deleted emails had reappeared AGAIN! If this were
 an employee it would have been 'let go' and replaced a long time ago! I still haven't sent the email and I am out all day now. I expect I will lose business as a result.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is this how it is going to be now? Hotmail was not perfect but, apart from server outages sometimes, it was reasonably efficient and I have been using it for business quite a bit. If outlook does not improve I will HAVE to change just to keep my business
 going!</div>

            Make sure the font hasn't been set to superscript or subscript by mistake.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, are you referring to the size of the screentip text? In that case, I'm afraid you're out of luck, because it can't be customized.

<h2>            Simultaneous Editing - Same Account, Same File, Two Different Computers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone. &nbsp;I have what seems like a simple question that I just can't find an answer to through the forums or through Google (can I say that word here, or is that blasphemy?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go between home and work all the time; At home, I have a PC with the Windows Suite installed, and at work, I use my personal laptop - again, Suite installed. &nbsp;I purchased an annual license to use the suite on five computers and five mobile devices (aka,
 the suite is legal). &nbsp;I've also started integrating (as I believe is Microsoft's purpose) my Windows machines and devices and have started making use of OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I edit the same file at both locations. &nbsp;At home, I'll edit and save (but not close out); when I get to work, I want to continue working on the same file, but it always opens as "Read-Only." &nbsp;Is there a method that I can have this file opened in two different
 Excel Programs, logged in under the same account, and have changes made that populate in the file and are then viewable on the other screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the simple answer is to close out of the file before I leave home/work, but that's too much work (lol jk).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice or quick fixes? &nbsp;I purchased Office because Office really gives us what we need, and Google Docs and Office Online, while nice, are mere shadows to the real Microsoft Office Suite, and I need to utilize the full applications. &nbsp;Thanks anyone! :)</p>

<p>Hi Gabe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be guided that only the <em>last 30 days</em> of your Skype conversation histories are saved on the cloud, which you can access across all supported devices as long as you sign in to the correct account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, histories older than 30 days are saved on your device's local hard drive for a period of time depending on your history settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you previously upgraded your <em>hard drive </em>without backing up your Skype folder which stores your main database file that contains your conversation histories, then I'm afraid that there is no option to recover it.​</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not hesitate to post back if you have questions and clarifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Powerpoint Table Not Moving When I Adjust Text, Hit Return, etc.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've inserted a small table in the middle of my powerpoint slide. I want the table to move up and down as I insert new text above or below the table. Currently,&nbsp;as&nbsp;text is added (or deleted), the table doesn't move. The result is that&nbsp;as text is added, the
 text&nbsp;goes&nbsp;behind my table and it isn't visible. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I make my table adjust accordingly as I insert (or delete) new text? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, </p>

            <span>Hi Scott,&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting the question in Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there is no option available within PowerPoint to automatically adjust table to avoid overlapping of the text.<br />
<br />
</span><span>If you think this feature is important and want Microsoft to include this in the future versions of the software, provide your feedback in the link below:<br />

            <p>This is one of the differences between PowerPoint and Word.&nbsp; In Word, everything is normally in one big long stream of words/graphics/etc.&nbsp; Add something at the top, everything below moves downward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PowerPoint is more of a freeform collection of shapes on each slide.&nbsp; There's no overflow from slide to slide (as there would be in Word, from page to page) and when you move one shape around or change its size, the other shapes (e.g. your table) don't move.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll have to move the table manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, if you're pretty good with VBA and don't mind killing off a few weeks of your life ... but no.&nbsp; It's too cruel even to suggest such a thing.&nbsp; ;-)</p>

<h2>            Nokia 808 - Camera Shutter Timer</h2>
                    
<p>Hi I am an avid photographer and bought this phone a few days ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far the images are quite good in quality. I am still waiting for Nokia accessory for Camera Tripod Mount to arrive in my country, Malaysia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some feedback for you Nokia guys, it will be nice to have a Camera Shutter Timer so that the photographer can be part of a group photo as well don't you think?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to software updates on the Camera app soon.</p>

<p>Hi steveboey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post and welcome to the forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should have the timer feature on your phone already, so it is not necessary to wait for an update. You can set your Nokia 808 to use self-timer by pressing settings icon on the top of the screen and selecting
<strong>Creative &gt; Capture mode &gt; Self-timer</strong>. When the self-timer mode is on, the phone will make a ticking sound to indicate when the photo will be taken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Caller identification using your Skype Number is available in the following countries:
</p><ul>
<li>USA</li><li>UK</li><li>Chile</li><li>Denmark</li><li>Estonia</li><li>Poland</li><li>Sweden</li><li>Switzerland</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If the caller identification doesn’t work it might be because it’s not available in your country or it’s not currently supported by the local telecommunication provider for the country you’re calling. We're working hard to make caller
 identification available in other countries, too so that everyone can recognize you're calling them from Skype.</p>

    <title>Representing velocity in Word Equation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> herbroseman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Representing velocity in Word Equation</h2>
                    The standard way of representing velocity in physics is a letter with a dot over it, a-dot. I can find a-dot in the symbol list it but the font is Times Roman. The problem is that the font in the equation editor is Calibri math. The "a" in the equation
 editor looks different than the a-dot that comes from the symbol list.&nbsp;I am unable to change the a-dot from the symbol list to the font in the equation editor.&nbsp; Is there a way to fix this?

<h2>            IE9 Won&#39;t Install on Windows 7 x64</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>I cannot get IE9 to install on a Windows 7 x64 Pro machine on a domain. &nbsp;I've ensured Administrator privileges, attempted installing as multiple users. &nbsp;We never had the beta installed beforehand. &nbsp;I've tried installing through windows update, 500KB installer
 download, and the full standalone installer, all fail with the same error. &nbsp;The IE9 installer simply says it could not install and gives me a link for troubleshooting and to close the dialog window.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've already used CCleaner to remove temp files and manually removed the IE9 sub-folders that got left behind in c:\windows\temp. &nbsp;I also renamed c:\windows\softwaredistribution forcing Winodws update to reset itself.</div>

            <p>Hi Chester,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the exact and entire error message word-for-word including any codes?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I'm not sure how you installed or where you downloaded from (or what you downloaded), so before we go blaming IE9 (which may indeed be part of the problem, but we're not certain why or how yet), let's first make sure everything is done the proper way
 and see how that goes. If there still are problems, I've included some other troubleshooting steps near the end to see if they help with the issue.&nbsp; From the above, it appears that the installation can't find the download file though I'm not sure why not (but
 that looks like feedback from an attempt to download and install from Windows Update).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let's forget Windows Update if that's how you did it (it may have used the wrong version for your system or had other problems more to do with updates than with IE9) and do it manually instead (though it sounds like you tried several methods) - but
 let's try the following.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>First, reboot so we know we're starting fresh.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Next, let's uninstall IE9 (or verify it isn't there needing to be uninstalled because at some point it was partially installed enough to be causing problems with new installations). Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie9-windows_7/how-do-i-uninstall-internet-explorer-9/0ee63a61-fd4e-e011-8dfc-68b599b31bf5"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie9-windows_7/how-do-i-uninstall-internet-explorer-9/0ee63a61-fd4e-e011-8dfc-68b599b31bf5</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Next, lets make sure we've covered any problems such as missing prerequisites and such. Follow ALL the instructions in this article:<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2409098" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2409098</a>. Ignore
 the recommended download locations in the article and use the one that follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to:<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/downloads/ie-9/worldwide-languages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/downloads/ie-9/worldwide-languages</a> and select languages and locales under
 the download now button and then choose your language and then your version of Windows (possibly you were getting the wrong version in WU or wherever you got it from). Do not use any prior downloads - get a fresh one from here.&nbsp; When it prompts to download,
 select "Save As" and browse to your Desktop and save it there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Once the download is complete, go to your desktop and the installation program icon should be there. Right click on it and click on Run as Administrator (even if you are already logged in as an administrator) and it should proceed with the installation
 (this process sometimes helps with installations). Reboot when done and when you return, hopefully IE9 will be installed and working.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you still have problems but it at least installed, try starting IE9 without add-ons (Start / Accessories / Internet explorer (no add-ons)) and see if that helps. If so, then enable the add-ons one-by-one until you find the one causing the problem
 and update it or keep it disabled and that should solve the issue. Also check the following troubleshooting guide:</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2409098" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2409098</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>&nbsp;and run the installation from there. If it works, great.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the problem occurs
 in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope this helps. If none of this works, post back and we'll see if we can try some other steps - but please don't skip the uninstallation and re-installation and just try the troubleshooting options. The cause may be in the uninstallation or installation
 process and unless we rule that out, we'll never be sure if we missed the source of the problem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Marshal,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></b><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a><span>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE.This means not only current ones but any EVER
 (including free trials you may never have used) or done years ago and possibly forgotten. See the following compliments of Dave__M:<b>If you aren't sure of what may still be on your system as remnants, which could be interfering with the MSE install, try a
 scan of your system with this security application detection and removal specialist:</b></span><a href="http://www.appremover.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://www.appremover.com/</span></b></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install McAfee Security Scanner, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally installed
 McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the PC and
 like any battery can eventually run down).</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Verify if MSE is already installed that Windows Defender is disabled (Vista or W7) or uninstalled (XP).If not, please do so as this is a classic cause of conflict-related problems.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Then, if anything changed, restart your PC.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, try the following:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Uninstall and re-install MSE. To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4</span></a><span>
 or try </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2483120</span></a><span> I suspect some problem with uninstalling the prior version&nbsp;is behind this (though if not the case, these articles
 still provide instructions to uninstall and going manual often does a more complete job), so you may need to focus more on the manual procedures in the first link or the second link with the Mr. Fixit in aggressive mode AND manual procedures to be sure it
 is completely removed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To install or re-install MSE, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures:</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4</span></a><span>-
 but also check out the next paragraph before you begin the download.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed after downloading MSE but before you install. To fully remove them, check out this
 listing of removal tools</span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</span></b></a><span>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product. You cannot just uninstall these programs - you MUST also use the removal tool - even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn't use a removal tool at the time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To install, go to </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></a><span> and click on more languages and versions and then
 choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the desktop (rather than running it). When finished, uninstall and remove any remaining AV program you retained for protections during the download and
 then reboot.Then right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you're logged in as an administrator) as I've found this sometimes helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is
 as safe as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine
 and save.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to the Settings Tab and click on MAPS and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining
 the infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the MAPS database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>*************************************************************</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:</span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><span>
 and SuperAntiSpyware:</span><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a><span> and then run a full ESET online scan:</span><a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</span></a><span>.
 This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to create a dropdown cell with options graphical options in Word</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to create a simple dropdown menu in a cell in a table in Microsoft Word. Want the choices to be one of 3 icons (circle, triangle, diamond). I don't know how to write macros and for the life of me I can't figure out the Picture Content Control
 in the DEVELOPER tab.</p>
<p>

<p>The method described in my post is all about "building blocks". Word divides its building blocks into groups, which it calls "galleries". There's one for built-in headers, one for footers, and so on. This is described in more detail at&nbsp;<a href="https://gregmaxey.com/word_tip_pages/building_blocks_autotext.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://gregmaxey.com/word_tip_pages/building_blocks_autotext.html</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you select something in your document and press Alt+F3, it opens a dialog box:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1fcec771-132c-4487-a4d8-bb0da310d284?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1fcec771-132c-4487-a4d8-bb0da310d284?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The second item in the dialog is a dropdown where you can select which gallery you want to add your new building block to. The default is AutoText, but there are lots more in the dropdown:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/726d3c27-0cab-4891-8aad-a5c0e2124b5d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/726d3c27-0cab-4891-8aad-a5c0e2124b5d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The bottom half of that list is a series of "custom" galleries that you can use for whatever you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point of this is that when you insert a Building Block Content Control in your document, you set one of its properties to the name of the gallery where you stored your building blocks, and then that content control will offer only the building blocks
 that are in that gallery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't need a group of special graphics, you could instead use a regular dropdown content control with characters from the Segoe UI Symbol font or another symbol font. For example,</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/426f068d-356f-43fa-a23f-4f746734ff5d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/426f068d-356f-43fa-a23f-4f746734ff5d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>These symbols were inserted in the content control's Properties dialog by typing each symbol's Unicode number and pressing Alt+X. These are the numbers for the symbols shown:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>○</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span>25CB</span>
</p>
<p><span>△</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span>25B3</span>
</p>
<p><span>◇</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<span>25C7</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find these numbers, or those for other symbols or other fonts, in the Insert &gt; Symbol &gt; More Symbols dialog.</p>

<p>Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is extremely thorough and exactly what I need, down to the figures in the drop down menu, but I can't even get started because every time I press ALT+F3, nothing happens! I need to complete this today and I can't get any traction...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when I go through DEVELOPER &gt; BUILDING BLOCK GALLERY CONTENT CONTROL, nothing happens when I click on the icon shown in the attached picture "Dropdown 1.jpg".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do the same thing but go through DEVELOPER &gt; DROP DOWN LIST CONTENT CONTROL, I get what you see in the attached "Dropdown 2.jpg" but again, I can't choose or input anything into that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in desperate need to learn how to do this ASAP but I thank you for all your help and ideas, Jay!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most that I've managed to do is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>DEVELOPER &gt; REPEATING SECTION CONTENT CONTROL and then just input the three icons I need. See attached "Dropdown 3.jpg"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if I can only put this so that only one shows at a time and I'm able to select which one from a dropdown menu.</p>

<p>To make the Alt+F3 keystroke do anything, you must first select the image or text that you want to save as a building block. Then you'll see the Create New Building Block dialog box that I showed in my previous post. Fill in a name for the building block,
 and choose a gallery (I suggest using the Custom 1 gallery, as shown here); leave the Category as "General".</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88d5af21-aec7-45d6-abce-6d6d7a5a90b0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88d5af21-aec7-45d6-abce-6d6d7a5a90b0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Important: Leave the "Save in" set to Normal.dotm if this form will be used only on your computer. If it will be used on other computers, then you must save the form as a template (*.dotx) and store the building blocks in that template. Users will create
 new form documents based on that template, and the building blocks will be available to them. (Building blocks in your Normal.dotm aren't available to any other computer.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you've created the three building blocks, each with a unique name and all in the same gallery, then you can use the Building Block Content Control. Insert the control in the table and, while the control is still selected, click the Properties button
 on the Developer tab. That will open this dialog, where you select which gallery the control will display:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca2ac30f-5703-471d-8be7-5eebf0a2d60c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca2ac30f-5703-471d-8be7-5eebf0a2d60c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Entering a Name for the control is optional; it will replace the "Quick Parts" label. If you don't enter a name, the gallery name will display in the label instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the down arrow on the control's label and choose the icon that you want users to see first.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Outlook &#47; Hotmail not working properly using Google Chrome</h2>
                    <p>I am having problems with some actions in my Hotmail (Outlook) when using Google Chrome. Everything appears to work OK but certain actions just don't respond.</p>
<p>For example, I can Reply to an email, but cant Forward or Reply All as the drop down box does not appear.</p>
<p>The drop down arrows are not expanded for any of the functions New, Reply, Junk, Move to, Categories.</p>
<p>This means that for example, I cant move emails to folders as the folder list does not display.</p>
<p>I get the 'More ways to reply' message displayed when I have the cursor over the Reply box, but the drop down list does not show.</p>
<p>Similarly 'More Junk Commands' with Junk, 'Move to (V)' with Move to and 'Add Categories to messages (C)' with Categories, but no drop down list appears with any of them.</p>
<p>This makes it difficult to use and I cant use many of the features that I used to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It appears to work better with MS Edge, but Highlight &amp; Copy from email text on to other emails or Word documents does not work.</p>
<p>The area selected does not highlight or get selected when using (CtlC, CtrlV).</p>
<p>All a bit odd &amp; frustrating.</p>
<p>I would prefer to use Chrome as MS Edge seems to add lots of unwanted actions not related to the email &amp; gets slow.</p>
<p>Is there any way of resolving these issues in Outlook, as if not I may have to consider moving to something like gmail &amp; as I have been a Hotmail user since it started this would be a huge investment in my time.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

            I am having the same problem and it is really annoying as I much prefer to use chrome as my browser. If I restart my laptop and open it up again it seems to work, but it then reverts back and the dropdowns do not show. Hotmail please sort this rather basic
 display issue!

            Also experiencing this very frustrating problem. The tool bar doesn't work, beyond opening and deleting emails, and my name is not visible top right, so I cannot view my settings or sign out and then in again to try and fix it. Have tried removing my adblocker
 for this site but that hasn't solved it. As "New" doesn't work I can't send Microsoft an email.

<h2>            WinDows 10 - eWeek Article</h2>
                    <p>I just read eWeek's article entitled "<em><strong>Windows 10's Release Will Be Unlike All Earlier Microsoft OS Debuts</strong></em>".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reading number 11 left me wondering over a section of the following statement: "Windows 10
<strong>will require</strong> ... and <strong>a Microsoft account</strong>."<br />
<br />
1. What if you do not have, or do not want a 'Microsoft account' attached to your OS?<br />
<br />
2. Will Windows 10 still be usable, as other versions, without the use of a 'Microsoft Account'? or limited in some fashion?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can someone verify this?</strong> or provide me a link to the information?

<h2>            Lumia 950 all app tiles missing from both start and app menu</h2>
                    All the app tiles have disappeared from the start menu <strong><em>and</em></strong>&nbsp;the app menu - no way to phone, message, email or connect to websites. The only apps I can access directly are new ones which I have installed since this problem occurred.
 If I access apps through settings I can see that apps are still there but there is no way to repin them to the start menu or get them back on the apps menu. Very puzzling and extremely inconvenient!&nbsp;

<p>Hi Gerald</p>
<p>Thanks for responding.</p>
<p>Phone is up to date - I checked the other night when the fault occurred, I have performed a soft reset with no change.</p>
<p>All apps are up to date and a soft reset had no effect.</p>
<p>I'm curious what the "several possible reasons" why the app tiles are missing could be?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've searched the web to find similar user experiences but have found nothing that relates to the complete disappearance of&nbsp;<em><strong>all</strong></em>&nbsp;the app tiles from both the start screen&nbsp;<em><strong>and&nbsp;</strong></em>the app menu screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any chance you could offer up some possible explanation for this occurrence?</p>

<p>This is more of a software concern. In this case, we recommend that you create a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17232/windows-10-mobile-back-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">backup</a></strong> and perform a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10768/windows-10-mobile-reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">hard reset</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Performing a hard reset on your phone will not revert the operating system installed. It will remove everything including your apps, games, texts, call history, music, and photos. However, you will be able to retrieve those if you created a back up before
 performing the hard reset. It will also the delete the Wi-Fi password on your phone so you'll have to enter the password manually when you set up your phone again after resetting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            Mine did the same thing yesterday. I kept getting an error when trying to forward an email and then it kept acting weird so I turned my phone off. When i turned it back on almost all my apps were gone and my start screen was completely different. I found
 I can launch apps if i search for them in the store. My calendar app works, but email opens and will close itself either immediately or if I try to sync it. I've done a soft reset numerous times and that hasn't fixed it. I haven't done a hard reset because
 i haven't been on wifi to backup my phone and pics yet.&nbsp;

<p>The boffins at Microsoft concluded that I had a software issue on the phone and my only option was to go down the hard reset route. Fortunately the majority of my data was backed up so I didn't lose much.</p>
<p>Phone works fine now and solved a problem I'd been having with auto syncing photos to One Drive.</p>
<p>If you can connect your phone to a computer&nbsp;you should be able to back up your pics at least.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, I was hoping for a different solution since the problem was so random, but I'm apparently out of luck.&nbsp; My phone showed it had an update after this happened and I hoped it would fix it, but it didn't.&nbsp; Thanks for your reply and the initial post.&nbsp; I'm
 glad to see that resetting fixed it.&nbsp; Luckily, the two apps I use the most stayed on the phone.&nbsp; Pulling up the others through the store has been pretty inconvenient though, so I'm hoping to be on wifi long enough this weekend to do the reset and get back
 to normal.</p>
<p>

<p>So I did a hard reset and it did fix the problem with apps not showing as installed, but it did cause other problems.&nbsp; My start screen was not restored to how I had it set up nor were my quick actions.&nbsp; There were also certain apps that their data did not
 get backed up when I backed up my phone.&nbsp; I wish there had been some kind of notification or list of those that I would need to go into individually to back up.&nbsp; I lost a lot of information with that.&nbsp; Even though I had backed up my messages right before I
 reset my phone, some messages were not saved so I lost about a week's worth of messaging which is upsetting because I had received some photos that I hadn't saved yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other problem I noticed was that I now have two message threads for the exact same contact.&nbsp; I even went in to my contacts to see if I needed to link/unlink contacts, but nothing has fixed it.&nbsp; My battery doesn't last anywhere as long as it used to either
 since the reset.&nbsp; This has been so frustrating especially since I have no idea what caused the problem to start with.</p>

<p>Hi Gerald,</p>
<p>
</p><p>this problem appeared on my Lumia 950 last night:&nbsp; I logged on with my pin and instead of the normal start page with the tiles showing all that appeared was the background picture and a search box.&nbsp; I could not access any other page or menu until I pulled
 down the menu from the top of the screen and then I had access to 'all settings'.&nbsp; I completed the steps above and from the Store, 4 apps were updated.&nbsp; They now appear but I still can't see anything else.&nbsp; I can however open some apps, e.g. Windows Maps,
 Word, by finding them in the Store, when it tells me that the product is installed and I can click launch. This doesn't work for all apps though it seems e.g Endomondo, which I can't find. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any recent development that would bring me back to having tiles again, without backing up and restoring everything?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Gerald,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had the same problem - no home screen tiles.</p>
<p>Most of my apps have disappeared from the app menu (when you swipe left) The apps that remain eg camera and whats app can be pinned to home screen thus returning a home screen.</p>
<p>I have tried the hard reset but the exclamation mark didn't come up... Can you give me the sequence&nbsp;to perform a hard reset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also where can I check my warranty?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anywhere I can take the phone to get someone to look at it. I live in&nbsp;Ireland.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>If you drag/drop a PDF file into a Word document or click the main part of the Insert &gt; Object button in Word, you will get an "object" in the Word document that acts like a link to the file (you can choose whether to embed the object in the document or
 just link to it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, click the down arrow on the right end of the Insert &gt; Object button and click Text from File, then select the PDF file. Word will then "open" the PDF and convert it to text if possible, just as it would if you used the File &gt; Open command to open
 the PDF. The Insert &gt; Text from File command adds the content of the file to the current document at the cursor location.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Home &#47; Outlook 2016&#58;     Can&#39;t move emails between accounts</h2>
                    <p>
I recently subscribed to Outlook 365 Home and installed it on my fast Windows 10 desktop PC, with the Office 2016 suite that it offers. I was previously using Office 2013 and over the years I have used virtually every Windows version of Office back to 1999.<br />
<br />
I have also had quite a few email account to my name over that period, both personal and business. Last year I set up a number of outlook.com addresses for different purposes, all accessed from (among other devices) my desktop and configured for IMAP.</p>
<p>
I knew that Microsoft had started to move all the outlook.com accounts to the Exchange protocol, but it seems that subscribing to Office 365 and installing Outlook 2016 accelerated that process. When I came to enter my various accounts, they were all automatically
 configured for Exchange.</p>
<p>
I have a lot of old .pst files, including archives, on my system. For several reasons, I need to access them all and delete things that are really irrelevant now and keep things that still relate to parts of my life. So, I imported them into Outlook 2016 through
 the file import process. I can read all the emails, but when it comes to trying to refile them into other accounts, the system won't let me. I constantly get the message: "The folders you are trying to change do not support this operation. Could not complete
 the operation because the service provider does not support it."</p>
<p>
Even when I forward them as attachments to the receiving account and then try to "unload" them into the account, I get this message: "Cannot copy the items. The folders you are trying to change does not support this operation. Sorry, Exchange ActiveSync does
 not support what you are trying to do."</p>
<p>
Does anybody know how to get round this, please, without going through the tedious and unsatisfactory process of forwarding all the emails individually?</p>

            <p>Adding a outlook.com mail account to MS Outlook sets it as an EAS/Exchange mail account, it doesn't necessarily set it as a Full Exchange type, that process is governed by MS and whether they have migrated the a/c to full exchange.</p>
<p>If you view, in outlook, File&gt;Account settings, if full exchange it will state Exchange for the type, otherwise the type will be IMAP/SMTP.</p>
<p>In outlook you should ideally have simply opened any pst data files, as the import process loses various data and settings</p>
<p>You cannot move folders, but you can move individual msgs, simply via drag/drop, but is it really necessary to move them from the pst data files to an outlook.com data file, as you can still access and search all data files as required.</p>

            Thank you, Palcouk. The three accounts that I use in Outlook 2016 are all shown to be "Exchange ActiveSync".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Opening the .pst data files creates a new set of folders in the side bar, but I still can't move them to the new accounts.

    <title>keeping set zoom level in internet explorer 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> teresa_tinker  say:</h3>
<h2>            keeping set zoom level in internet explorer 10</h2>
                    I am using Win 7/IE 10 and I keep accidentally changing zoom level when I move my mouse around.&nbsp; How do I pick a zoom level and set it permanently to that level ( say 100% or 125%) so that the movement of my mouse doesn't change it?&nbsp; This is VERY annoying
 to me but I've found no answers online as of yet on how to stop it.&nbsp; It can change from 100% down to 50% or up to 200%+ with just the move of the pointer to some text I want to click on or view etc.&nbsp; I've tried "customize" and setting the zoom level to my
 preference but both appear to be temporary fixes.&nbsp; I am constantly having to go back in and reset the zoom level to one that I can read &amp; function with.&nbsp; Please help if you know how to set it permanently.&nbsp; I am using a laptop with touch screen.&nbsp; Thanks

    <title>Excel is extremely slow with very high CPU after the latest update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> morshemesh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel is extremely slow with very high CPU after the latest update</h2>
                    <p>The title pretty much says it all. My excel was automatically update a few days ago to version 1803 build 9126.2259 (Office 365), and ever since then almost every time I open the program it responds extremely slowly, and is totally unusable. The task manager
 teaches that at such cases the program uses lots of CPU. The only solution in this case is to shut down the process through the task manager and to reopen it, because apparently it won't speed up on itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I googled for this problem and found many people with a similar problem, but with no solution at all. So I'm trying my own luck here, before going nuts about this issue.</p>

<h2>            Interrupted installation and Uninstall taking far too long</h2>
                    Hi, I purchased Office 2013 online (The Home and Student Edition)). I downloaded and commenced installation of the 32bit version. During the installation decided to install the 64bit version &nbsp;and therefore had to uninstall the 32bit version. I tried the
 uninstall, it has been in step 3 of 4 for the last 4 hours. Is something wrong. Help !!!

            <p>Hi Neelu,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue may occur if the installation is not responding. Let us follow the steps from the link below to completely remove all traces of Office Home and student 2013 files:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart the computer and install Office Home and Student 2013 64 bit and check if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the suggestion is helpful.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            can&#39;t activate office</h2>
                    <p>On an HP laptop running Windows 10 version 1703.</p>
<p>I bought Office 2016 when I bought the computer two years.&nbsp; I let the subscription expire a month ago, and purchased the new subscription today.</p>
<p>In the applications list, there are icons for Excel 2016, Word 2016, etc.&nbsp; When I open them, they say it's an unlicensed product.</p>
<p>I purchased the renewal, downloaded the setup x86 executable and ran it.&nbsp; the dialog box said it was downloading the files, and then required a reboot, which I did.&nbsp; then it said it was updating the files.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the update was complete, Word and Excel still say it's an unlicensed product.</p>
<p>I downloaded the&nbsp;<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/0/5/505878EB-FFC4-4DF0-A526-B1165BFA6C35/officeact.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">officeact.diagcab</a>&nbsp;troubleshooter, which ran and said office is activated.</p>
<p>I opened the programs and they still say unlicensed.&nbsp; I continued running the troubleshooter, which collected files, etc, but still said everything was fine.</p>
<p>I rebooted.&nbsp; Still not licensed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm out of ideas.&nbsp; The only other option is to enter a product key, but the online renewal doesn't provide one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help?</p>

            If you open a Word document and choose File then down on the bottom left "account" does it show the account you made your online purchase with? If not, try signing in with the account you purchased the renewal with. <br /><br />Chances are you may have to run a repair install. Or clear your credential manager then try signing into your account.

<p>hi daniel,</p>
<p>i understand you would like to disable the new email, calendar alerts and notifications for the second office 365 account set up in your outlook 2013 client and keep those of the primary mailbox. please feel free to correct me if there is any misunderstanding.</p>
<p>if that’s the case, you may try to set up inbox rules via the following steps to achieve this:</p>
<p>1. the first step of the process is to <strong>disable</strong> the generic option to always
<b>display</b> the new mail desktop alert. <b>file</b>&gt; <b>options</b>&gt; <b>mail</b>&gt; section:
<b>message arrival</b>&gt; option: <b>display a desktop alert</b>&gt; uncheck this and save your change.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=ef88be95-4d82-463a-8757-dd8b4a21f126" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3def88be95-4d82-463a-8757-dd8b4a21f126" /></a><br />
</b></p>
<p>2. creating a new mail desktop alert rule for specific accounts:</p>
<p>1) navigate to <strong>file</strong>&gt; <strong>info</strong> &gt; <strong>manage rules &amp; alerts</strong>. ensure this address is set to your primary email address.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=793be3d1-d906-4397-b3cd-fa6462beafab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d793be3d1-d906-4397-b3cd-fa6462beafab" /></a></p>
<p>2) click <strong>new rule</strong>&gt; <strong>apply rule on messages i receive</strong>&gt;
<strong>next</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=8797248d-a341-43ef-a7e7-8f9d7a5beeb5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d8797248d-a341-43ef-a7e7-8f9d7a5beeb5" /></a></p>
<p>3) select <strong>through the specific account</strong>&gt;enter your primary account in the bottom part&gt;
<strong>next</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=4fb333c4-1c87-449c-889a-7803b9325d8f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d4fb333c4-1c87-449c-889a-7803b9325d8f" /></a></p>
<p>4) choose <strong>display a desktop alert</strong>&gt; <strong>next</strong>&gt; <strong>
next&nbsp;</strong>(without selecting any option in the next window)&gt; <strong>finish</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=b12cc1c1-992e-4316-8ae1-bbad249e244b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3db12cc1c1-992e-4316-8ae1-bbad249e244b" /></a></p>
<p>5) the&nbsp;entire rule will now read as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=881a7d12-811f-458c-9644-8e3b41b1c182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d881a7d12-811f-458c-9644-8e3b41b1c182" /></a></p>
<p>check if they work for you.</p>
<p>in addition, these settings mentioned above are more related to the outlook client instead of our office 365 online service. and as we are not masters at that field, we recommend you turn to our

<h2>            How do you change the width of charts columns&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In the most recent chart I've made the columns of my chart look like pin strips. I'd like to make them much wider.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My previous chart does not have this problem.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The difference between the two is the previous chart only has 1 unit for the horizontal axis while the current chart has 5 units. I have no idea how to change the number of units as neither has chart has x-axis coordinates.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'd appreciate any help you can offer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            The usual way to change the width of the vertical bars in a Column chart type is to change the gap width (in all versions of Excel, Windows and Mac).<br />
<br />
Select the data series by clicking on one of the bars (just to be sure the data series is selected).
<br />
<br />
Right-click or control-click, and choose Format Data Series from the context menu.
<br />
<br />
In the Format Data Series dialog box, select Options. <br />
<br />
Then change the Gap width.<br />
<br />
For wider bars, make the gap width smaller. <br />
<br />
For narrower bars, make the gap width larger.<br />

            As is often the case, your problem is being caused by <span style="font-style: italic">
merged cells</span>. Fortunately, this is one of the lesser evils inflicted by that abominable "feature" :-) If you unmerge the cells &amp; recreate the chart you should be fine.<br />
<br />
As an alternative, you could create formula links elsewhere that refer to cells C50, C51, E50 &amp; E51 then generate the chart based on the cells containing the formula links. Just be sure to switch the Rows/Columns plotting.<br />
<br />
