<h2>            The future implications of having antivirus software built into Windows</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've been pondering this for a while.....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>With the advent of Windows 8 &amp; RT, there is now, for the first time ever,&nbsp;full antivirus software providing real-time protection (Windows Defender) built-in to Windows. Consider what will happen if the
<em>proportion</em> of users using this built in antivirus increases significantly compared to 3rd party (i.e. non-Windows Defender).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The broad diversity of currently available 3rd part antivirus products means that malware authors have to work&nbsp;hard to try and get their nasty malware&nbsp;to work on multiple systems. If most or nearly all users were to be using the same built-in anti-virus
 software they would be able to concentrate more of their efforts on bypassing just one anti-virus product.&nbsp;This would have some disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Malware authors are likely to become more successful as they concentrate their efforts.</li><li>When/if malware is successful in overcoming a built-in antivirus program more users are likely to be affected - Zero Days in the future might be massive compared to previous times.</li><li>There would be a reduction in worldwide anti-malware expertise as the no. of 3rd party publishers reduces (a team concentrated at Microsoft), but with no equivalent expectation in the number of malware authors and the evil they spawn - in fact their numbers.
 might increase as it becomes a more tempting proposition for them,</li></ul>
<p>I realize that Windows Firewall has been pretty successful as a built-in firewall programs over the years. I believe that for antivirus products the situation is different as they have to be quicker to react and are usually the&nbsp;line of defence before the
 firewall.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am not discussing in this thread the specific merits of Windows Defender vs specific 3rd party programs. Its the general principle of the
<strong>dangers of having all your eggs in one basket</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Agreed. This graph tells the true story:<br />

But I think it will increase competition, thus quality of 3rd party products which a user would like to prefer.<br />

            <p>Hi Jetta48,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You've asked an important question, but as is typical in such cases are&nbsp;mixing in other attributes that are less related than they might seem and ignoring others that are far more important.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>First, we must break down the differences between the various operating systems you've mentioned and other only slightly related items like the firewall.&nbsp; Note that your statements are lumping both the Windows 8.x and Windows RT based operating systems together,
 while these systems are both&nbsp;far different&nbsp;from anything Microsoft has produced in the past.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Windows 8.x are still a general purpose operating system like those before them, though in terms of security they are also far more inherently secure than these earlier versions.&nbsp; As with Windows 7 and Vista before it, Windows 8 has taken great strides
 in securing some of the major attack vectors used against these older versions, as discussed in the following "Protecting you from Malware" article in the Building Windows 8 series.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/15/protecting-you-from-malware.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/15/protecting-you-from-malware.aspx</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Though this can't close all of the holes that exist for malware and nothing can, it goes a long way towards shutting down some of the common techniques used by current malware or at least limiting the ability to exploit them effectively.&nbsp; Also note that
 this version of Defender can be easily disabled by a properly designed and installed 3rd-party antimalware product, so there's really nothing changed here other than the fact that Defender doesn't require a separate&nbsp;installation.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Addressing the Windows RT (Run-Time) version requires a completely different set of criteria, since this operating system is radically different in several ways.&nbsp; First, it operates on a completely different hardware platform (ARM)&nbsp;than the original Windows,
 so none of the native code written for the earlier platforms can operate on it.&nbsp; Next, it doesn't provide support for either the Win32 or .NET application platforms, so none of this code can be easily ported either.&nbsp; Finally, it limits the core applications
 like video and music to those already built-in, so this reduces the chances that 3rd-party applications can create gaping holes that bypass core protections of the operating system.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As for the security in Windows RT, the version of Windows Defender used there is as radically different as the operating system, since it must support an entirely different ARM processor and tiled applications.&nbsp; Both Windows RT and Defender are stored in
 firmware/SSD and Windows Update is always on, so nothing including user installed applications is allowed access to or control over either the operating system or Defender.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This limits the ability for malware that can directly attack the operating system, though in theory a vulnerability in a key component like Internet Explorer or Windows RT itself might be used to attack it, though obviously there are similar protections
 for things like buffer overflows, etc. that Microsoft has ported to Windows RT and doesn't talk about, so these might mitigate many of these attacks as well.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Tiled (were METRO) applications are only installed via the Windows Store, which gives Microsoft a choke point to examine and disable distribution of any rogue applications found to be acting like malware.&nbsp; I should also mention that these applications are
 all sandboxed which limits what they may do to each other, though the user can increase these abilities to some extent, so social engineering could still be at least a partial problem for privacy.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The firewall is really a completely unrelated item, since it exists only to block traffic either based on port configurations or possibly upon certain malicious detections by Defender, since both use the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) in Win32 based Windows
 8 to monitor networking traffic as virtually all 3rd-party firewalls do as well.&nbsp; We know less about the WinRT platform firewall, since these components would only require some basic level of user control but otherwise be under operating system control for
 most typical purposes, so I won't try to discuss that here.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Do note though that antivirus or antimalware are not the first line of defense, they are the last and only need to act when all other forms of protection; firewall, patching, security features or other methods have failed and the malware has gotten past
 them.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Finally, as for your primary concerns relating to the diversity of 3rd-party&nbsp;antivirus and the potential for an increased risk as these products disappear, your initial premise seems reasonable.&nbsp; However, some quick examination of the facts indicates that
 there are extenuating circumstances for most of these.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>First we need to understand that Microsoft initially produced first Windows Live&nbsp;OneCare and then Microsoft Security Essentials to solve the problem that many (approximately 70% was the original estimate) of the consumer and small home&nbsp;business users were
 not running a functional antivirus for reasons such as cost.&nbsp; This has been largely resolved by offering a free "basic" protection program in MSE that removed this issue.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2008/nov08/11-18nocostsecuritypr.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/2008/nov08/11-18nocostsecuritypr.aspx</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Next, the simple fact is that other than the above users who never paid for their antivirus, many of the consumer and small business users have already moved on to more mobile devices like tablets or smartphones, leaving their PC use much reduced if not
 non-existent as time wears on.&nbsp; This is a part of the reduction in PC sales in the US and the world at large, as the decreased cost and increased mobility provided by these devices is offset by their increasing utility for light-duty applications like email,
 music, video and anything web browser based.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So the reality is that MSE and now Defender on Win8&nbsp;isn't the only and is likely one of the least of the pressures on the various 3rd-party security vendors.&nbsp; Anyone smart enough to see this coming would see the necessity for Microsoft to prepare for the
 eventuality that most if not all of the 3rd-party vendors will exit the business when it becomes unprofitable.&nbsp; So having a decent antimalware product already in place on the current systems which those wanting alternatives can easily replace only makes sense.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are likely other factors at play here that I'm missing, but these seem like the most obvious that may have been involved in the current situation.</p>
<p><br />

            <p>As for Microsoft putting full antimalware protection permanently into Windows: I did see that coming, although I didn't expect it to be called "Windows Defender".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Although I, at first, expected Windows Defender to be targeted above all else, I didn't consider until later the fact that some people may absolutely hate Microsoft Antivirus, or they may foolishly like a third party antivirus, or, most importantly of all,
 factory junkware (such as Norton or McAfee)</p>

            I agree with most of the part you said. About Windows RT, I totally agree. Its completely different thing and require much more efforts to be crossed. But question here is about Windows 8. In upcoming time, majority will use Windows 8 and later versions,
 they will have Windows Defender in it. And I think most of them will prefer to use Windows Defender.<br />
<br />
I know many like MSE/WD, many hate them also (and many hate them because they think since MSE/WD don't provide 'Pro' features it is weaker in protection, and that's what annoys me). But the graph I posted show the picture of future. If Windows Defender succeeds
 to get even 45% of market share, a malware author that can bypass WD can target a major audience. It still is enjoys a major market share and I think it will increase further.<br />
<br />
But one thing that go against this is that a user would like a competition. He would not like to stick with single product for whole time. I here in my locality see a vast variety of antiviruses. Honestly speaking, before joining this community I wasn't aware
 of the fact that Windows Defender even exists on PCs. I had never seen MSE either. I was just aware that there is a free antivirus offered by Microsoft for genuine Windows (and I came to know that from television ad). There is still a vast variety. This variety
 may reduce but will never get vanished. If a malware author bypasses WD (and I am assuming he already got past all the other security measures) and it succeeds in infecting majority then 3rd party will get a boost and people will prefer 3rd party then.<br />
<br />
This competition is what is stopping me from thinking of worse situations.<br />

            <p>Hi PrasantKumar96,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I agree there are extenuating circumstances within the Windows 8.x specific sub-set as well, some of which might distort the trends in either direction, but I think you may be missing some of the more important ones.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>First I do agree that there is a group of people who will never trust a Microsoft anti-malware product for reasons such as&nbsp;those you've mentioned as well as simply "hating" the Microsoft security products for whatever reason.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also want to point out that Jetta48's original concern about diversity is no doubt why Holly Stewart&nbsp;made her original comments to a testing group that got badly quoted in that article a few months ago, so this likely concerns Microsoft as well.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, the trends have already shown that many users won't accept the cost for an additional antimalware product and expect or require that it be free, possibly for individual economic reasons and this percentage appears to be growing over time.&nbsp; The OPSWAT
 graphs you displayed above seem to reinforce this fact, since the first 4 products on the left side are all either free or at least begin that way.&nbsp; I've personally wondered how many still pay for the various "free" products such as Avast! or Avira once they
 start displaying their ads, but I know I never did for the few years I used one of these on an old Windows 2000 system, since nothing else worked well on that outdated hardware.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Note that the reduction in PC purchases is placing pressure on the overall numbers of systems available for installation of any security product.&nbsp; Also note that the largest number of PCs in the world using Windows XP are in Asia and more specifically China,
 which are also the most commonly pirated versions of Windows for the same economic and payment systems based reasons.&nbsp; This is likely where many of these 3rd-party free products are installed as well for the same reasons and since we don't yet know what will
 replace these systems we'll need to wait, but I suspect it will&nbsp;largely be&nbsp;cheap or free operating systems&nbsp;such as Andriod based tablets or phones.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The problem for all antimalware vendors is that they need a fairly large base of user systems in order to collect their malware data as well as enough paying customers to continue the operations necessary to support all of these, paying or not.&nbsp; At some
 point the cost of supporting the free customers will outweigh the amount of revenue being provided by those who do pay.&nbsp; If that threshold is reached or even approached, most companies will need to consider dropping the permanently free versions, so then we'll
 learn if customers will pay to keep their favored products alive.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The larger question is will Microsoft keep producing Windows once the numbers of units sold start to decline in a more severe way.&nbsp; It's quite clear that the computing world is changing, but less so how quickly and for what exact reasons.&nbsp; Though Microsoft
 could continue to produce and support&nbsp;an existing product with declining numbers, at some point they'd need to determine whether they want to produce it as a niche product and can sustain the development efforts necessary to do this.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are too many variables in all of this to make any clear predictions, but nothing here isn't already known or quite obviously already occurring to some extent.&nbsp; The declines due to the shift towards mobile devices primarily by younger users are already
 happening more quickly than expected, so this really depends in large part on the middle-aged and older populations in the US and around the world, who are already under economic stress due to the recent severe recessions and have thus made significant shifts
 in spending patterns as a result.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Again, I don't know exactly what and how this is all going to happen, but typically the economics and&nbsp;the popularity of the specific products (thinking hardware here; e.g. PC, smartphones, tablets) have more of an effect than the technologies or current
 product mix, so we'll see how fast the PC and thus Windows and its supporting products become the next "buggy-whip".&nbsp; Especially since unlike the buggy-whip, the PC can't exist without a fairly massive support infrastructure of hardware&nbsp;manufacturers, operating
 system manufacturers, software developers and sales channels.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I only mentioned, in passing, RT for completeness by way of my introductory sentence - if I had left it out, no doubt someone would have tried to correct my error of omission. I own a Surface RT so I am aware of its reduced vulnerability. RT's user base
 is very small compared to other OSs and its unclear what its future will be - the internet rumour mills seem to saying it may die completely or subsume/be subsumed into some other platform. Guess work at the moment (unless I've missed an announcement somewhere!).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I take your points about the improvements in Windows 8 over earlier versions.&nbsp;My main qualification would be though that whilst it all looks rosier, we don't know what the next security/malware issue is going to be. When Vista/7 came out people raved about
 how much more secure than XP be there were, but there have still been plenty of unforeseen issues since they launched.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I&nbsp;am not criticising Microsoft for&nbsp;launching the free MSE or for including WD as a antivirus program in Windows 8+. Its better for everyone if more users&nbsp;have some form of antivirus running.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I wonder lack of diversity issues&nbsp;mentioned in my OP (built-in antivirus programs being targeted more by malware authors because of their popularity) will be self-limiting. If users see that&nbsp;such issues are happening&nbsp;then they may demand 3rd party alternatives
 and create a market for 3rd party antivirus. The size and diversity of that market may be different to what we have today though.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Another potential issue that I didn't mention is anti-competition law. Although, AFAIK, built-in antivirus hasn't been raised as an issue yet, there's always a chance that we could see something like the existing browser choice menu being implemented for
 antivirus programs. I find the law boring and&nbsp;don't know enough about it,&nbsp;so I won't belabour/overstate this point.</p>

 to a more representative, “real-world”, testing methodology.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Of course there’s always going to be a disparity in the relative rankings of the AV participants because the products themselves are in a constant state of developmental flux, and also because the threat landscape is continuously evolving.
 Each individual test is just a snapshot of an ever-changing scenario, and the different outcomes are to be expected as a result of the changing environmental factors – although, obviously, using a different camera will also color the results to some extent.
 But there really is a “minefield of opinions and subjectivity” out there, and it’s always to be found in the opinions of people who reject scientific testing methods, and insist that their own personal observations and/or the firsthand accounts of others (these
 are “subjective” in the accepted definition of the term) are the best source of information on the subject. Unfortunately, if your opinion of AV products is still dominated by that awful&nbsp;experience that you had with Norton Internet Security 2008, then you’re
 living in the past. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">When we look at an individual data set, we also observe a “clustering factor” due to broad similarities in detection methodologies and mutually shared data. But we always observe a highly significant spread in the effectiveness spectrum
 (distribution of detection/remediation scores varying from worst to best), just because the differences in detection and remediation strategies are substantial, and are highly significant factors in determining the effectiveness of each individual AV product.
 Logic and common sense will only tell us that divergent methods will always result in divergent levels of effectiveness, but the empirical test data tell us where those different detection/remediation strategies actually fall on the “effectiveness” scale at
 any specific point in time. Not with perfect accuracy, to be sure; but with nothing like the “minefield of opinions and subjectivity” that we see in opinions that are dominated by anecdotal accounts from a world that no longer exists.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The key to appeasing the competition, and also to promoting a diverse and sustainable AV marketplace, was Microsoft’s apparent willingness to pull its AV entries out of the competition. Hence the direct relevance of the question of
 how well Microsoft AV products perform under test: If the built-in AV product performs exceptionally well, then it would be expected to have a disruptive effect on the marketplace. If it performs very badly, then it would be expected to have a disruptive effect
 on consumer confidence. Maybe performing at a “baseline” level seems to provide the proper balance between these two rather unpleasant alternatives.</font></p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I only mentioned, in passing, RT for completeness by way of my introductory sentence - if I had left it out, no doubt someone would have tried to correct my error of omission. I own a Surface RT so I am aware of its reduced vulnerability. RT's user base
 is very small compared to other OSs and its unclear what its future will be - the internet rumour mills seem to saying it may die completely or subsume/be subsumed into some other platform. Guess work at the moment (unless I've missed an announcement somewhere!).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I take your points about the improvements in Windows 8 over earlier versions.&nbsp;My main qualification would be though that whilst it all looks rosier, we don't know what the next security/malware issue is going to be. When Vista/7 came out people raved about
 how much more secure than XP be there were, but there have still been plenty of unforeseen issues since they launched.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I&nbsp;am not criticising Microsoft for&nbsp;launching the free MSE or for including WD as a antivirus program in Windows 8+. Its better for everyone if more users&nbsp;have some form of antivirus running.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I wonder lack of diversity issues&nbsp;mentioned in my OP (built-in antivirus programs being targeted more by malware authors because of their popularity) will be self-limiting. If users see that&nbsp;such issues are happening&nbsp;then they may demand 3rd party alternatives
 and create a market for 3rd party antivirus. The size and diversity of that market may be different to what we have today though.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Another potential issue that I didn't mention is anti-competition law. Although, AFAIK, built-in antivirus hasn't been raised as an issue yet, there's always a chance that we could see something like the existing browser choice menu being implemented for
 antivirus programs. I find the law boring and&nbsp;don't know enough about it,&nbsp;so I won't belabour/overstate this point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Keeping the focus on Windows 8.x (no RT), as I mentioned above I believe Microsoft is concerned about this as well for similar reasons.&nbsp; I'll take your self-limiting thought a bit further here with a twist.&nbsp; What if the much longer term concerns about the security
 of Windows, justified or not, drive more people away from the platform itself and keep the overall numbers of systems low?&nbsp; Wouldn't this have a similar effect of making the platform less interesting to the malware purveyors, especially if those still purchasing
 Windows generally&nbsp;happen to be those more attuned to proper security practices like larger businesses?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What you also missed with your recent statements is that many of the successful attacks against the more recent Windows Vista and 7 platforms have really been via applications or other platforms such as Adobe &amp; Apple&nbsp;products and Java.&nbsp; Only as these doors
 have begun to close somewhat have the attacks come back around to focus on generally&nbsp;more difficult to exploit vulnerabilities in the OS itself.&nbsp; The notable exception is Windows XP, which is so badly riddled that it's a wonder that anyone is still using it
 at this point.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So though I agree with your basic premise about potential&nbsp;diversity issues, I think these other extenuating circumstances and self-limiting effects are just as likely to create significant effects that mute the potential&nbsp;of the&nbsp;diversity issues to some extent.&nbsp;
 If most of those still buying Windows at this point are the more skilled "techie" users and/or businesses with proper protections in place, the softness of the Windows target may be reduced and it's already clear that the numbers will be to some extent.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I personally think that the malware purveyors will follow the "soft targets" such as consumers and in fact already have into the less well protected smartphone and tablet markets, which I believe is why Microsoft took the direction of including protection
 on these platforms up front rather than waiting for it to become a problem.&nbsp; I simply think that the Microsoft marketing did an extremely bad job of explaining Windows RT to the masses at release in 2012 and only in mid-2013 started to have ads which explained
 the product is terms that users could understand.&nbsp; Whether they can recover from these early missteps and become a force within the tablet and phone markets is yet to be seen.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In any case, I know that I looked hard at the possibility of switching to some sort of tablet platform for my use late last year and only the lack of certain specific business applications kept me from making the change at the time.&nbsp; By the next time I purchase,
 it appears most of these applications will have migrated to web based and&nbsp;thus I'll need very few directly installed on the device itself, so I may have a much wider choice of operating platforms in a tablet or convertible&nbsp;form factor&nbsp;from which to choose.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is why I think that Microsoft has much larger concerns than whether the 3rd-party AV vendors continue to provide their products, since it won't really matter if they are no longer selling the Windows in the first place.&nbsp; The only real hold that Microsoft
 has on the market any longer is Office, which is why it is included with the Surface, but even that has been weakening with office app&nbsp;alternatives and the generally reduced need for these applications outside of business.</p>

<p>The problem solved now. Actually root cause was faulty key pad, I replaced the key pad. All working fine now- no shaky screen, no other problems.&nbsp; Thank you for your efforts and suggestions.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I think this is genrally caused by and error in one of the functions (Macros) which appears when the template is loaded on startup.</p>
<p>You could test thiss by create a template then adding one function at a time in the template, saving and testing..</p>
<p>I hope this give some sort of help</p>

<p>It would make more sense to leave the company template alone and create a separate new template to contain the macros you want to share.<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/installing_macro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/installing_macro.htm</a><br />
Without knowing what code you have created, it is impossible to determine what is wrong with it.</p>

<p>Two templates will be fine.</p>
<p>The reference in the web page refers to the fact that until recently support was provided by newsgroups and it was common to post snippets of code for the benefit of users. While many of us who answer questions still use newsreading software to access the
 forums, most users now access via the web interface. Thus the reference is simply referring to copying code in text format from wherever it is obtained. I will update the page when I have a minute or two.</p>

            Well, again, it would be amazing if I could get all of the macro stuff from the existing work template, add a few macros that I have created so that everyone else has them, and then when new people join all they have to do is put one template file into
 their startup folder. Is this going to be possible?

<p>With your apparent level of expertise, do NOT alter the company template. Not only will your colleagues revile you if you screw it up, but you could run into problems with the company itself. In many companies, unauthorised screwing around with IT applications
 is grounds for dismissal.</p>
<p>Create a NEW template, as I suggested earlier, to contain the macros that you want to add. Save it as a macro enabled template (the default is dotx, which will wipe the macros) and provide it as an additional add-in.</p>

<p>Hi Alan,<br />

Based on my test, if you have been signed-in to the account before, you will not be prompted to renew your password when you reset the password of said account.<br />
<br />
However, <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg982959.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">every 30 days Office will attempt to renew the license status</a>, and as the account information stored on the user’s computer is the old info, Office may prompt the user to refresh
 the login info.<br />

<h2>            collapsing specific rows in column without affecting the same rows in other collumns</h2>
                    Is there a way to collapse specific cells in a column without collapsing the same rows in adjacent columns? (e.g., collapse row 1-3 only in column 1 but not column 2?). Are there other programs/apps on google that more easily allows this capability? Any
 help would be much appreciated. Thanks!

</blockquote>
No, Excel only "hides" entire rows. I think the reason is so you or your users don't end up accidentally referring to the wrong data. Think about it... the data on, for example,&nbsp;Row 5 deals with a particular item. If you collapse some of the&nbsp;information, then
 the rows below the "collapse" will move up to fill the gap (I'm guessing that is the functionality you are talking about) and&nbsp;that moved up data&nbsp;will then&nbsp;look like it belongs with the already existing data on Row 5... seems to me like an accident (reading
 the wrong data) waiting to happen.

                    when i enter with a simple formula inside the cell. the program doesn't &nbsp;show me the result, but the own formula that i entered.

<div>for example, I enter &nbsp;=C1*2 (C1 contains the number 55). The result is 110 (55*2=110). But the result shown is =C1*2.</div>

            At least two possibilities:
<div><br />
<div>1) Your cell is formatted as Text - so XL's parser doesn't try to evaluate it as a formula. Make sure the cell is formatted as General or any format other than Text and reenter the formula.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2) You have XL set to show formulas rather than values. Type CTRL-` (the key with the tilde, above the tab key on US keyboards).</div>

<p>Thanks to all but neither of the techniques works.&nbsp; My "menu" in tasks does not have "new task" in it, nor do I have an edit softkey&nbsp;in task.&nbsp;That's why I'm &nbsp;having a hard time figuring this out.&nbsp; I just have a window
 to enter a new task and there is no&nbsp;place where it&nbsp;allows me to enter due date or priority.&nbsp; My softkeys are only "complete" and "menu" for a task.&nbsp; Brand-new Q phone I just got last week.</p>

<p>This is weird. I'm sure I'm missing something but connot figure out what is is. I got the same device to play with yesterday. I was able to create a task and edit it to include a start and end date using the steps I've outlined above. I think
 Jack probably has another ROM on his device. Are you using the default Microsoft Tasks application?</p>

<p>When you are in that screen, that is when you are creating a NEW task ... correct?&nbsp; The right soft key says CANCEl .... correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you press cancel, you should be at the screen where all tasks occur.&nbsp; The top would say ENTER NEW TASK HERE and below are Tasks that have already been created ... correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press Menu and then New Task.&nbsp; Each area should now be visible for entering the appropriate information.&nbsp; BTW, the Done Key should ONLY appear when you in this screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you move to a task that is already created, click on the center button it will open the Task.&nbsp; The Edit key should now appear on the lower left</p>

            <p>FYI - don't know if&nbsp;SUA will install, but that might do ya.&nbsp; Also Cygwin, but&nbsp;SUA is a Microsoft add-on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was called SFU prior to Vista.&nbsp; now it's SUA.&nbsp; I think this may be windows 7 and 2008 server&nbsp;only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=2391</p>
<p>
</p><p>the name has changed from 'Interix' to 'Services for Unix' (SFU) to 'Subsystem for UNIX-based Applications'.&nbsp; yeah, NO confusion here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like it to be a BUILT-IN myself.&nbsp; The original intent was to MIGRATE FROM UNIX-like OS's.&nbsp; What it's used for, most likely, is making Windows more UNIX-LIKE [as it should be, heh] and also more compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't forget, OSX is UNIX, 'droid is Linux, and everything "not windows" seems to follow the "*NIX" way of doing things [not sure about iOS but I have my suspicions].&nbsp; So it's probably VERY VERY VERY good indeed if Windows can "play with others".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, you'll just have to install Cygwin.&nbsp; It's more compatible with the GNU world anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>added:&nbsp; I'm going to attempt to install SUA in 'compatibility mode' for Windows 7 and we'll all get to see what happens.&nbsp; THIS IS IMPORTANT because if someone is running this on their 7 box already, and they decide to "take the offer" and UPGRADE TO 10,
 it *BETTER* still work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>added 2:&nbsp; unable to install SUA.. reported as a problem via 'windows feedback'.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 incoming reply messages truncated</h2>
                    <p>I have received several messages--replies to me--that do not include the message or messages that are being replied to in a string below the most recent reply. Same reply message shows up fully, with all previous messages in string, on iPad and on Android
 phone--just not in Outlook on desktop. This is maddening. How can I fix this?&nbsp; "Conversations" is not it. Thanks.</p>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I received an E-mail with subject&nbsp;"welcome to your new outlook.com mobile experience"&nbsp;and it starts by thanking me for connecting my device to the new outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It then mentions about using the app. I have not downloaded the app, I&nbsp;have an iPhone and&nbsp;I use the&nbsp;standard mail app linked to my&nbsp;hotmail with that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks&nbsp;to be from a&nbsp;genuine sender, 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** though there is no green shield on the E-mail when I login on my desktop. Is this real or a scam? Could it mean someone has used the app and is on my E-mails?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is it just I have used the website to login? I use the website for some alternate E-mail addresses, but not the one that has received this message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Turning off the author&#47;time stamp for comments&#47;track changes</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to edit a paper for an anonymous peer review, and I want to turn off the author/date stamp function on the comments and track changes (for Office 2016, Mac). I know that was possible in Office 2011, but I can't for the life of me figure out how to
 do it in the new version. I can change my name temporarily by going to "Word"-&gt;"Preferences"-&gt;"User Information," but that's a messy workaround, and I feel like I'm missing something more obvious/useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Ungroup toolbar button - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seant130967  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ungroup toolbar button</h2>
                    <p>I always like to customise my toolbar on a new version of windows - particularly Excel which I use most.</p>
<p>on the latest version I cannot find a button to "Ungroup selection". &nbsp;There is however one to Group selection? &nbsp;What are Microsoft playing at? &nbsp;Do they not actually have any users amongst the idiots that keep tinkering with the way Excel works for the user?<br />
</p>
<p>Also - I have several specific macros that I have written over the years which I always add to the toolbar via the custom buttons. &nbsp;I can;t find the option to do that anymore? Is it available? I don't care if Windows 10 is actually able to do it anyway now
 - I want to be able to click on the button I have used for the last decade. &nbsp;I haven't got time to re-learn menu navigation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This latest version of Windows appears to be a step back to pre-windows 95 in terms of usability.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone help?</p>
<p />

            <p>Just to be clear, the version of Excel is not related to the version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming you are trying to customise the Quick Access Toolbar, and that you already know how to get to that dialog, if you change the first dropdown to "All commands" you should be able to locate the Ungroup command. Similarly, if you change the dropdown
 to Macros, you will see a list of all the macros currently available.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply Rory</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are linked insofar as when you upgrade to windows 10, you get the version of Office that goes with it - no doubt you can over-ride that and re-install an earlier version of Excel, but I'm sure that would be fraught with compatibility issues. &nbsp;Anyway
 - I had already done as you suggested and searched "all commands" - there is no Ungroup button - but there is a Group button.<br />
There are no macros available under the Macros heading. There is also no "Custom" button, which in the past you would have used to attach a macro too.</p>

            <p>No, they aren't linked. You only get a new version of Office if you buy one (either separately or as part of an OEM deal when you buy a new computer) or if you have an Office 365 subscription which will upgrade you to the latest version automatically - but
 again that isn't linked to your windows version. It is entirely possible - and standard - to upgrade Windows without changing Office version - I've done it many, many times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, which version of Office do you have currently? 2016 or 2013?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have no Macros available it would tend to suggest to me that you got a new computer (which could also explain the new version of Office) and haven't copied any macros you previously had across to it?</p>

            One quick thought - are you sure it's not now a toggle, so one button does both depending on whether the selection is already grouped?

<p>Do you really need to clutter the QAT?</p>
<p>Just&nbsp;right click the mouse on the grouped item and select Ungroup</p>

            <p>Hi Bernard</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>No - I'm just talking about grouping columns in a normal spreadsheet - It used to be called promote and demote.</p>
<p>The Group button is denoted by a solid Right Arrow, and the Ungroup used to be a solid left arrow. &nbsp;I'm not sure if any of the above options serves that purpose does it? &nbsp;If so, why not just use the left arrow as before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time anyway</p>

<p>Did you check the visibility status of the other device you are trying?&nbsp;does it&nbsp;set to visible? for example in your PC go to bluetooth settings and check "Allow other devices to find this computer" similarly blue tooth headsets are usually in hidden state,
 you should make it visible by looking at the headset manual. If your headset is with only one call/end key usually a long press (form off) will put it in visible mode (usually an active light (rather than a blinking light) is an indicator for visible mode)
 Let me know if it was a help.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/4b145976-7b13-40e4-9753-0d5b0701655a" title="Mariavracic">
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the message, you have a calling subscription since you are seeing the next payment date.
<a href="http://www.skype.com/go/subscriptions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<br />
<a href="http://www.skype.com/go/skypecredit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Skype Credit</span></a>, on the other hand,&nbsp;allows you to pay-as-you-go. Purchase some Skype Credit, and then call whoever you want at very low rates.
 Skype Credit is a good option if you need to make a few calls and only want to pay for what you use each month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your subscription will not show up on the Skype application as Skype Credit (which shows as&nbsp;amount in monetary value)&nbsp;since they are two different products. But you can always see it by going to the
<a href="https://secure.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype website</a>, sign in and your subscription will show up under your profile picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some reason as we are having issue calling landlines and mobiles: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>You are not logged in to the correct account.</strong> I suggest you try to sign out of the Skype application and sign back in using your usual sign in details.
</li><li><strong>You're calling a country which is not part of your calling plan.
</strong>Please check that your calling subscription covers the country you're calling.</li><li><strong>You have run out of minutes on your subscription, or you ran out of Skype Credits.
</strong>Check that you have enough Skype Credits or subscription minutes by going to the
<a href="https://secure.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype website</a>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
        </p>

            No. Onenote for all mobile platforms use SkyDrive as storage and OneNote 2007 does not support SkyDrive. You need OneNote 2010 to sync between PC and mobile device

            No.<br />
<br />
Orange asked the BBC not to serve content to people using their packet data service so it's reasonable to expect that they've asked the same of Sky.<br />
<br />
The solution is to use a WiFi connection.

            Could you give me a link to the place you got the application from? I can hardly imagine them saying you have to use 3G for this. That you'd have to use it (rather than GPRS) if no WLAN is available is conceivable.<br />
<br />
If you're using WLAN then the GSM/UMTS setting is irrelevant since you're not using a cellular connection.

<p>Sorry I'm not quite sure what the 'GSM/UMTS setting' is; when I got the phone, under applications the Sky app was already on the phone. When I click on it when I'm not connected to my WLAN it says no connection, error, etc. When I'm connected to the internet
 via the WLAN it says 'sorry your connection is not supported', which is really confusing, and there's no guide as to what I'm supposed to do that I can find anywhere! Any ideas on how to get this working? Update the Nokia firmware? Or maybe download the app
 off the internet somewhere and then put it on the phone via usb?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

</p><p>I am not able to login to my Hotmail account. I get the message "Account doesn't exist" when I try to login. May be its because the account was not used for a few years. But I really need to login to my account, as I need to reset my password for Picassa
