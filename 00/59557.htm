            If you are trying to remove an application (aka <i>program</i>), use the Control Panel's
<i>Programs and Features</i>&nbsp;applet to uninstall it. If this is a stubborn uninstall,&nbsp;try the Revo Uninstaller. The&nbsp;program comes in either freeware or professional and the freeware is by no means a 'crippled' piece of software. The software quickly and completely
 uninstalls&nbsp;software that doesn't want to leave your computer.

 to get new apps or update the ones that I do have. I am getting so fed up that if it is not fixed by the time my tax return comes I will buy a new computer that does not have windows or microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>From: </b>Gary VanderMolen</p>
</span><span>I assume your problem is with receiving, since the error message you supplied pertains to receiving.
<br />
Ports 25 and 587 do not affect receiving, since they are for sending. <br />
<br />
The error message is difficult to evaluate since you X'd out part of the server name. Perhaps the error is in the 'xxxxxxxx' part of the server name.

                    On 03/21/2018 I receiver verbal warning from Microsoft and locked screen on my laptop that I had a serious attack and was instructed to call Microsoft at 1-855-979-6447. A person answered from a company in North Carolina stating that my computer is blocked
 and that my IP address had been affected by people trying to take over my IP access in order to obtain my personal and financial information. He stated that I needed network protection of my IP address and that Win Security would fix the problem for $500.00.
 As I was very concerned about my information, I agreed. They remotely took control of my computer and after a lot of discussion on my phone and a couple of hours of me sitting at the computer watching the rep said that the problem was cleared. The rep stated
 that I needed ongoing network protection and needed to purchase network protection for all of my electronic devices computers, printers and cell phones . He stated that the $500.00 repair may not last and that his technical co

            Same issue. They locked screen with a Red Screen Alert, gave phone number to resolve issue. Once on phone they asked for control of computer, then asked for $299.00 for service. Once the sales pitch started we looked up phone number and saw it was reported
 as a scam.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>"Obsolete" is a bit too vague and is often in the eye of the beholder (or software user).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There used to be a program called Secunia Personal Software Inspector (PSI) that would analyze all (most) applications installed on a computer and let you know which ones needed to be updated (and sometimes why).&nbsp; Unfortunately, as is often the case in the
 software business, the company was sold and the new owner eventually discontinued the product.&nbsp; There are a few potential replacements, but I have no personal experience with them.&nbsp; You might take a look at these articles:</p>

<h2>            JETech 0884</h2>
                    Hello, I have a JETech 0884 Bluetooth mouse. I've had it for a few months so far and haven't had any problems until now. When I try to pair it with my Microsoft Laptop, it asks for a pin number. Its a mouse and doesn't have a pin number. I don't know what
 to do and I spent $35 on this mouse.

<h2>            How can I change the color of the Windows 7 Start Menu&#63;</h2>
                    How can I change the color of Start Menu?&nbsp;&nbsp;The Start Menu opens to a left and a right pane. I want to change the color of the left pane which by default is&nbsp;a bright white. I want to do this independently of the Windows Personalization options.&nbsp;Those options
 change all of the folders. I only want to change the left pane of the start menu. Is this possible?

            Hi Steve 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />General troubleshooting steps
<br />A. Reboot your computer. Generally, rebooting solves many problems.
<br />B. Try a different USB port
<br />C. In case of wireless mouse, pair it again with the computer
<br />D. In case of wireless mouse, check if batteries are not weak.
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1 - Use the Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search Box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt;  Click Hardware and Devices &gt; Click Run the troubleshooter and follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />2 - Take actions related to mouse (Check after each step A, B and C)
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show hidden devices &gt; Expand Mice and Other Pointing Devices  &gt; Right click on the mouse listed there &gt;
<br />
<br />A.  Roll back - Click Properties &gt; Roll Back  - Under Drive tab, if Rollback Driver is enabled click it &gt; Reboot
<br />
<br />B. Uninstall - Uninstall &gt; Reboot and the driver will be automatically installed
<br />
<br />C. Update - Update Driver &gt; Click Update Driver Software &gt; Click Browse my computer for driver software &gt; Click Let my pick from a list of device drivers on my computer &gt; Choose the driver &gt; Click Next to update &gt; Reboot
<br />If this does not work, select Search automatically for the updated driver in place of Browse my computer for driver software &gt; Reboot

<h2>            Xbox live app can&#39;t login Error 0xbba</h2>
                    I have nothing but trouble with the x box app. I can't login because of the error above. The weird thing is that my friend can see me online an I get the notification that I am login but on the app the error appears and I should try it later again. I did
 some research and no one seems to have found out how to fix this problem really. I tried a lot of "solutions" already but nothing works. The xbox app is an insult to all players.&nbsp;

 error appears and I should try it later again. I did some research and no one seems to have found out how to fix this problem really. I tried a lot of "solutions" already but nothing works. The xbox app is an insult to all players.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Barb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your reply, I going to a friends place today to use their internet to give this a try.&nbsp; I got a refurb two weeks ago after I had dropped mine and it was going as you would expect it to and then suddenly this blue screen critical process message
 started coming all the time.&nbsp; So glad it hadn't happened to my old one as I would have lost everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going to the store again isn't the best option as they only have one store in Australia and it is four and a half hours away :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting to regret paying the $800+ to get the replacement for mine and should have gone with a different brand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will let you know how I go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>doesnt matter the rating of a game you have to follow the rules and yes cursing isnt allowed on psn someone just may not have reported you yet doesn't they wont or will not in the future .</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It's not rocket science if you want to spend 1000s again on a new system just to test your theory go right ahead see how fast your will waste your money</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And FYI no online service has phone numbers for enforccment team it's normally done by forums for a reason</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Phones can be spammed and **** never get thru&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's best to use a moderated approach like forums or private chats so a question can only be asked rather them spammed till they release your account&nbsp;</p>

<br />
As in XP, Vista and now Windows 7, the Read-only attribute of a FOLDER does not affect the contents.<br />
Why are you trying to change the attributes of a folder?

<br />
No it doesn't UNLESS you are trying to add files to a folder to which your user account does not have read/wrire permissions, which is nothing to do with the Read-only attribute of folders.

    <title>Refund Refusal With No Explanation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrquix0tic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Refund Refusal With No Explanation</h2>
                    <p>I have requested a refund for a game I purchased. I mistakenly purchased the incorrect version and called to have my refund. They ensured me my request was going to go through. I purchased the same game, different&nbsp;copy that included everything I needed and
 thought nothing of it. After a week I reviewed my CC and the refund had not made it back. Since then I have received&nbsp;14 emails with no explanation&nbsp;of refund refusal, and called and have been told the refund team email would be the only, and best way to deal
 with the issue. Each email has never given me a reason for the refusal, and I am stuck with two versions of nearly the exact game.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, the one I purchased on accident was two dollars cheaper than the one I wanted and that was the main reason behind the mistake. The version I finally&nbsp;got included everything, even base game, where the other was only missing the base game. After everything
 I have done, I am stuck with two games, one unplayable, and an exact copy of the other, other than the base game the exact same content.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent 140+ dollars for a single game and Xbox has done nothing to fix the issue. I have called, emailed, emailed some more, called&nbsp;to the point Xbox support has actually blocked my number and I still haven't received a refund for a duplicate accidental
 purchase. I doubt anyone here will fix this, but I am&nbsp;hoping to bring light to the horrible system you have in place for refunds that make an otherwise great company, look like they could care less about their customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi MrQuix0tic,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for bringing this issue to the forums. Sadly, as you already discerned, we here on the forums do not have the tools available to assist with refunds directly; however, this begs the question: When you called and contacted Xbox Support to inquire about
 a refund, were you directed to the refund request webform to ask for the refund, or were you provided a refund over the phone, or simply assured via the phone call that an incorrect purchase would be refunded?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To explain the refund process a bit more, the normal time frame that you can expect a refund (after you receive notification of its approval) is 3-10 business days. This is the amount of time that it can take for the funds to go from Microsoft back to your
 card backed by your financial institution. From there, the time that it takes for the funds to hit your account is determined by the financial institution and you may wish to contact yours for an estimated time frame if you do not currently have that information.
 You can double check your Microsoft account to ensure that a refund was provided by logging in to view yourOrder Historyat
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.microsoft.com</a> and going to the Payment &amp; Billing area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have filled out the refund request form and received an email from the agent that processed the refund, you can reply directly to that email for any questions or concerns that you may have. The same may be said if your refund was denied after
 filling out the web form. If you called in for your refund (this is only available in certain regions), then you should have received an email from the phone agent who processed the refund to confirm that it was done. If no information on the refund is forthcoming
 in your case, it is recommended that you make the attempt again.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/xbox-subscriptions/digital-goods-subscriptions-refund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Request an Xbox digital product or subscription refund</a></p>
<p>

<p>I was directed to xbox.com/refund where I filled out the form and submitted it. I then received&nbsp;a reply by the email refund team where they denied my request with no information on why. I resubmitted as per-request by Xbox support and received&nbsp;yet another
 reply about denying my refund with no reason. On 14 multiple emails&nbsp;between Xbox, support, and refund support I have yet to get a single positive response&nbsp;aside from an automated system. At no point have I spoken to a single person who knows who to call, or
 who to message outside the broken email system your company has in place. There is zero accountability for anyone and when I ask to speak to someone to file a complaint I am directed to more places where the staff or support has no idea how to deal with my
 inquiry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took over a week to even receive&nbsp;the first response from the refund department email system, and then another few days before I realized&nbsp;I wasn't going to get a response from an actual person that cared. It has been 26 days since the initial refund request
 and no reason for the denial has been given. I don't think they actually care and if they aren't required&nbsp;to actually do their jobs then they just submit the same automated response to every email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only reason to post here is to hope someone reads this and pushes it up the ladder. I've had every Xbox since day one of the original Xbox. I have had Xbox Gold for over Ten years and this is how I am treated. Love, the Love...</p>

<p>Hey there MrQuix0tic!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you ended up in the situation that you explained. </p>
<p>As stated by Amber and the other representatives earlier, the only means for you to dispute or inquire about why the refund was denied would be to reply to that refund department through email as customer service no longer have the ability to affect that.
<br />
If they determine&nbsp;that you're&nbsp;ineligible, the only thing that I can suggest is to get in contact with your financial institution and file a dispute for an accidental purchase with them.

<p>
</p><p>If.it was you wont get anymore&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have to wait for your bank if.it was proccessed</p>
<p>It.can takr.upto 90days for a refund depending on what you used</p>
<p>International.paypal takes upto 90days</p>
<p>International bank transactions can take upto 30days depending on when your bank deals with batch proccessing international transactions</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 14 emails wouldnt hsve been rejected without notes unless you already received the refund at ms level</p>
<p>Rather then your bank</p>
<p>The only instant refund is.from xbox live currency credit which goes back onto your account since its.not restricted by banks</p>

<p>It's probably a weird glitch. You bought the game, realized it wasn't right and then bought the correct version. Only problem is, is it probably shows that you've played that game for more then 2 hours and support, or whatever system they use, cannot tell
 which version of the game you played.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>They may be looking and thinking, "he's played over 2 hours so no refund" which is their policy.</p>

<p>What it is, is incompetence from Microsoft and their complete lack of transparency for this "new" system that is literally set up to refuse refunds. I have even been blocked by them for calling and complaining. They could care less and it shows by the lack
 of information about the refund. It was an immediate refund request, within an hour of the initial purchase and they still refuse to even give me the time of day and give me an automated response. I haven't received&nbsp;even an ounce of information, just plain
 and simple rejection. Not even a sorry we can't help you, at this point, I would take a "You got ripped off" message and be somewhat happy by that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is way past money anymore, they have literally set up a system to defraud their customers by simply not responding. It is as bad as EA, and PS4. I can see this backfiring on them in the near future, however, they won't fix it until someone starts
 a class&nbsp;action lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the first law they broke. In the marketplace, the first purchase I made was in the game section, not a DLC section which is what caused this issue in the first place. The "Game" was all DLC and on sale, without the base game, making it an unplayable
 game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Law States -&nbsp; "<span>Right to Information—the consumer should be protected against dishonest or misleading advertising or labeling and has the right to be given the facts and

<p>
</p><p><span>They also broke this law -&nbsp; "</span><span>Right to Redress— the right to be compensated
 for misrepresentation, shoddy goods or unsatisfactory services."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here is one of around 16 emails they have sent me about my refund request.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>

</p><p>How am I suppose to know what they refused it for, or if a person actually handled this in the first place? If they have read the email they should have at least given me an answer to why I was refused, but they are actually not giving me any information
 at all, just case closure. This is breaking these consumer protection laws, outright.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 mobile PROBLEMS</h2>
                    Windows 10 mobile has a big problem that is the number of apps. Most of popular games and apps in IOS and Android are not here. Also, after I update the new Windows 10 mobile update on December 14 2016, I&nbsp; can't choose photos for uploading on Facebook.
 Also, Facebook messenger is not enough functions, we ( WINDOWS USERS) needs more, such as VOICE call and VIDEO call. Also, why is the Office free in IOS and Android while in Windows 10 we need to buy OFFICE 365 to use? I try to use Excel on Lumia but hopeless.
 What happens? So sad! We love Windows and we chose to buy Lumia and use Windows mobile, so we hope that Windows is more completion, not just in Windows 10 mobile system but also the quality of applications. Love Windows!
