<h2>            Windows 7 shutdown very slow sometimes</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I recently got a new computer with a 120gb ssd and a core i3 4150. I installed Windows 7 on it. and shutting the computer down is taking over 3 minutes sometimes. Boot-up speed is not a problem; the system boots-up in less than 20 seconds, and once in
 a while, shuts down in less than 20 seconds. The slow shut-down only happens sometimes, but other times it is very fast. I have tried registry edits, but those did not help.</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>

            <p><span><span>You should not press the Power button to shut down the computer or to resolve a freeze. Click on the Orb in the bottom left of the Desktop and select
<strong>Shutdown</strong></span><span>. If you encounter problems shutting down then select the keyboard shortcut
</span><strong><span>Ctrl+Shift+Esc</span></strong><span> to bring up Task Manager and click on the Applications tab. Place the cursor on a running application to select it and click on the
</span><strong><span>End Task</span></strong><span> button. As the application is removed from the list repeat the procedure on the next application in the list until all are gone from the list. If you use the

<h2>            System Restore does not stay De Activated&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I have chosen not to allow Windows to save any System Restore Points. I use a daily backup program to make an image of my drive and don't need Windows to do a System Restore, besides System Restore is not that good.</p>
<p>And yet I find, from time to time, that System Restore has been mysteriously re-activated???</p>
<p>Why does this happen and how can I permanently keep System Restore off.</p>
<p>Is there a way to completely remove this feature from Windows?</p>

<div>What is your system make and model?</div>

<div>What is your XP Version and Service Pack?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation: &nbsp;McAfee, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Defender, ZoneAlarm,&nbsp;PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Some antivirus/antimlware programs will interpret SR being turned off as an affliction and either flag it as an issue requiring your response, or they may just fix it for you automatically. &nbsp;The AV software can't tell if you turned it off on purpose or
 not.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For example, some folks will disable the Windows XP Security Center warnings that some up when they purposely turn off certain XP features and Malwarebytes (MBAM) will flag as a potential problem that on a scan:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>It will look like this in the MBAM report:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Registry Data Items Infected:</div>
<div>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Security Center\AntiVirusDisableNotify (Disabled.SecurityCenter)&nbsp;</div>
<div>-&gt; Bad: (1) Good: (0) -&gt; Quarantined and deleted successfully.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It looks like it might be some kind of infection, but it isn't really and nothing gets deleted or changed until&nbsp;you say so. &nbsp;If you let MBAM "fix" all the problems it finds, it will undo your desired configuration.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is frustrating for folks that don't want to see the warning, disable it on purpose, run MABM,&nbsp;they don't read the message, let MBAM fix everything and then they start seeing the warning messages&nbsp;again. &nbsp;Therefore, the conclusion is their system is
 afflicted.</div>
<div><br />
<div>With your&nbsp;acknowledgement&nbsp;and permission, MBAM will change the registry entries back to 0, enabling the warning again&nbsp;&nbsp;and then you will wonder why your changes seem to disappear when in fact, everything is working perfectly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Of course, you can usually configure your antiwhatever software to not&nbsp;interpret&nbsp;those things as errors.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That may not be the case for your system, and you should certainly be able to turn of SR and it should stay off.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you are making a daily image, are you ever restoring your daily image? &nbsp; What imaging software are you using (just curious).</div>

<p>I see...</p>
<p>When you "activate SR, how you are doing it and where do you look to know that it has been reactivated?</p>
<p>Are you doing this on all drives, some drives, slave drives, externally attached drives, etc.</p>
<p>I don't use any of those and don't feel like installing them, but I think those AVs must have something to do with it.&nbsp; I think they may interpret not monitroing a drive as a threat.</p>
<p>Do you think it SR is enable only after running one of those AVs?</p>
<p>The installation of Automatic Updates does want to create a RP called "Software Distribution Service 3.0".&nbsp; It would have to turn on SR in order to make that Restore Point.&nbsp; Do your RPs look like that?</p>
<p>Enabling/Diabling SR also puts an Event in the Event Viewer System log that looks like these:</p>
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />

<p>If you sort the Events by Source, perhaps you can see the date/time when SR is being switched back on and tie it into some other operation.</p>
<p>I would think that if you disable the SR Service, that would surely stop it on all drives, but you will have a hard time getting rid of the obligatory System Volume Information folder(s).&nbsp; The presence of the SVI folder does not mean SR is running.</p>
<p>ZA version 9.1.507.000 has some issues involving SR, where it would delete all but the latest RP on systems.&nbsp; Allegedly, ZA fixed it in their 9.1.603.000 and later verisns (or you could have downgraded).&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't use ZA so I will be unable to test your
 environment.&nbsp; I wonder if it as other "features" as well.</p>
<p>Also (not the problem) but if you are using the ZA firewall, hopefully you disabled the XP firewall.&nbsp; You should have at least one or the other, but never both at the same time unless you want performance problems.</p>
<p>I read in the CNET that (perhaps older versions of) Webroot Spy Sweeper is "truly terrible"&nbsp; Maybe those opinions have changed!</p>
<p>I have not used Eset NOD32 either.</p>
<p>I read that AVG has some feature (don't use it) that it might be configured to initiate a new RP creation at the end of a scan (optionally).&nbsp; If that is the case, it would have to turn on SR at least long enough to do that - maybe i t never turns it off
 again.&nbsp; It probably expects SR to be on anyway.</p>
<p>I am most reluctant to start to troubleshoot any peculiar problem on any system until after this has been done:</p>
<p>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs then troubleshoot any remaining issues.<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes (MBAM):&nbsp; http://malwarebytes.org/ <br />
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS):&nbsp; http://www.superantispyware.com/ <br />
<br />
They can be uninstalled later if desired.</p>
<p>So, the short answer is I don't know, but maybe you will have some ideas or post up some more clues ... like what drives, how are you deactivating and how do you know it is reactivated.</p>
<p>Or somebody else may know exactly what the deal is.</p>

<p><strong>All I do is open Control Panel and click on System. Then I click on the System Restore Tab and click the Turn Off System Restore on All Drives. It then shows that all drives are no longer activated for SR. Then I click Apply and close the control

<p><strong>If that were correct, then why wouldn't the AVs immediately see the issue and re-enable SR? I run scheduled scans on Eset and Webroot twice a week so if one of them was concerned about SR not being active, then I would think that they would have

<p><strong>If that were true then my AV should be turning SR on twice a week...since that is what I have set the scheduler to run. As you can see in the Event info...the last time SR was Re-activated was 9/30. It had been off for over a month prior to that.</strong></p>

<p>Then you can see that somehow the SR service was started on 9/30/2010 at 8:35:08 PM.</p>
<p>Perhaps you can scout the Event Log further around that time and try to see what else was going on.</p>
<p>if you click Start, Run and in the box enter:</p>
<p>services.msc</p>
<p>Click OK and the Services applet will open. &nbsp;Find the System Restore service and check the Properties, Startup type. &nbsp;If you can't figure out who is starting it like on 9/30/2010 at 8:35:08 PM, the Disabled sounds like it might be the option for you (what
 is it now?). &nbsp;If you set it to Manual, something else could successfully start it.</p>
<p>Before Disabling the Service, turn off SR to clear out any accumulated RPs. &nbsp;I would check the SR calendar, etc. to be sure there are zero RPs if you think they are taking up too much room in your backup, then disable SR. The default for RPs is 12% of the
 total HDD space and/or 90 days worth, but you can make it whatever you want. &nbsp;It doesn't make sense to monitor other than the system drive either. &nbsp;XP will want to make a new RP every 86,400 seconds (24 hours), but you could have more in a day or zero for
 several days in a row depending on many factors. &nbsp;It is all adjustable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I will never use SR either to solve any XP problem, but keep it going on my C drive for tinkering and to understand other folk's problems. (you never know though...). &nbsp;Never used it in 6.3 years and don't plan on using it! &nbsp;Except for practice of course.</p>
<p>I don't know what XP will do if you get a Windows Update and SR is disabled... &nbsp;Windows update will want to make a new RP, so I wonder how it will handle it. &nbsp;Could that have been your situation on 9/30/2010 - a Windows Update?</p>
<p>You can run MBAM and SAS without uninstalling anything. &nbsp;SAS will usually find a bunch of tracking cookies, but the combination of the two is a good way to establish a known starting point for troubleshooting peculiar problems.</p>

<p>Interestingly...SR was set to Automatic, however it was <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not</span> Started. I wonder if, instead of disabling SR in Services if I should just set it to manual. My reason is because of your concern that disabling SR in Services might create a problem for Windows Update and when I checked the properties, the Dependency
 tab showed that SR depended on Remote Procedure Call (RPC).</p>
<p>I'm wondering if what ever the reason that SR re-activates could be the same reason that the Global settings in the Recycle Bin get changed to re-establish recycle bins on each of the slave/external drives even though I have set them to no recycle bins.</p>
<p>I can't help but think that somehow, Windows Updates are the cause....not every update, just every so often.</p>
<p>Has no one ever reported that before me?</p>

<p>Interestingly...SR was set to Automatic, however it was <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not</span> Started. I wonder if, instead of disabling SR in Services if I should just set it to manual. My reason is because of your concern that disabling SR in Services might create a problem for Windows Update and when I checked the properties, the Dependency
 tab showed that SR depended on Remote Procedure Call (RPC).</p>

<br />
<div>A more common problem is where SR gets switched OFF - usually by malware, or an anti-virus - and the user doesn't notice until too late.</div>
<div>Switching the service to manual would make very little difference to its normal operation, I suspect.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you simply want to limit the size of the SR store, the best thing to do would be to reduce the space allocation to the minimum - this will allow (I think) 300MB to be used. This is done using the hack</div>
<div>vssadmin resize shadowstorage /on=[drive]: /for=[drive]: /maxsize=[MaxSizeSpec]</div>
<div>MaxSizeSpec must be 300MB or greater and accepts the following suffixes: KB, MB, GB, TB, PB and EB. If a suffix is not supplied, MaxSizeSpec is in bytes</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be a hardware problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the steps in the article given below and check if that helps.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/reset-my-phone</a>
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is nothing such as <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Soft Reset
</span>mentioned in any Windows 10 articles. Hence, the word soft reset should be avoided altogether. Instead we can use try pulling the Battery out and reinserting after few seconds (on devices where&nbsp;that is possible). This method will not remove anything
 at all from the phone and is completely safe to attempt in any problem situation. On devices where battery cannot be removed, we can refer “<strong>Reset an unresponsive phone</strong>” section in the above mentioned new article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</p>

    <title>windows 7 important updates and windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            windows 7 important updates and windows 10</h2>
                    <p>In the optional updates, I unchecked&nbsp;windows 10.&nbsp;For the important updates, I checked several security updates for windows 7 (updates are from October; there are 42 updates total now).&nbsp;I click&nbsp;ok and&nbsp;then download. The next screen that comes up has "Downloading
 windows 10 getting setup files"&nbsp;on it.&nbsp; I cancelled the update. The message on the resulting screen is "some updates were not installed cancelled 2 updates". It also has "two important updates selected."&nbsp; When I click "Try again," the downloading windows 10
 getting setup files appears again. I selected one small update to see if the file would actually download and the next screen is the screen with the, Windows 10 message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on with updating windows 7 security and other files?&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I get the important downloads and not any of windows 10?</p>
<p>Why does they system keeping trying to download windows 10 although I have unchecked the box for it in optional updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching for updates is also an issue as the wheel just keeps spinning. Is something going on with updates for windows 7 and 8?</p>

Prevent Windows 10
</p><div>
<p>December 22, 2015</p>
<p>Microsoft has turned a decades-long respected process — Windows Update —&nbsp;into a malware distribution system.&nbsp; It is for all intents and purposes forcing innocent and content&nbsp;Windows 7 computer users into “upgrading” to its new Windows 10 version.&nbsp; It promises
 to allow return to Windows 7 within 30 days.&nbsp; That return process is flawed and leaves your computer virtually unusable and requires re-installation of Windows 7.&nbsp; For some owners without a re-usable Microsoft product key or a factory restore partition on
 their computers, it results in a useless thing that used to be a computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is a completely new and very different Windows.&nbsp; Nothing like anything you have used before.</p>
<ol>
<li>It is primarily an advertising/sales vehicle.&nbsp; That’s the keen motivation and reason it is free.</li><li>By adopting Windows 10, you sacrifice any privacy — essentially, anything on your computer is Microsoft’s and its partner’s to use as they see fit.</li><li>Windows Update becomes non-optional.&nbsp; You, as owner of your system no longer have control over what happens to your computer.&nbsp; Microsoft will re-make Windows (on your computer) into what serves its purposes without asking your permission or opinion.</li><li>Windows 10 as a system is still full of un-fulfilled promises and bugs.&nbsp; Many of your programs will not run on Windows 10.&nbsp; In fact, the “upgrade” process removes some.</li></ol>
<p>So, if you like Windows 7, and most do very much so, I advise you to reject Windows 10 for the foreseeable future.&nbsp; Be advised that Microsoft has committed to support Windows 7 until at least January, 2020.&nbsp; Most of your current computers will last that
 long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You must adopt a protective stance to prevent your Windows 7 system from becoming something you do not want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have advised my clients to&nbsp;change the Windows Update Setting to <em><strong>Never check for updates</strong></em>.&nbsp; Once a month, about a week after&nbsp;the 2nd Tuesday, they will get an email from me advising to manually start WU and then to reject (right-click,
 hide) specific updates <strong>KB3035583, KB2952664, KB2977759, KB3021917, KB3075249, KB3080149, KB3083710, KB3083324,&nbsp; KB3022345, KB3090045 and&nbsp; KB3068708</strong>.&nbsp; This list may change over time.&nbsp; In fact, the December, 2015&nbsp;update brought a new one:
<strong>KB3112343&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Some may scoff at this idea.&nbsp; Well they are incorrect.&nbsp; Never means you are never giving Microsoft a chance to decide what you download and install.&nbsp; It does NOT mean you will never update.&nbsp; The difference is that now you take control and the responsibility
 of updating of Windows and Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some may believe that Microsoft would not do such a stupid thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You must read Woody Leonhard (one of the most respected writers in the trade)&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2983777/microsoft-windows/how-to-clean-the-windows-10-crapware-off-your-windows-7-or-81-pc.html?nsdr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 have Windows 7, keep it, you are better off by far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see the Windows flag on the bottom right of your screen, chances are pretty high, your computer already has the Win10 file.&nbsp;Even if you do not, it may be on your computer&nbsp;shortly anyway. &nbsp;Here are instructions on how to rid yourself of it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First download and run GWX Control panel.&nbsp; A free app:&nbsp; <a href="http://ultimateoutsider.com/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2979572/microsoft-windows/gwx-stopper-an-easy-way-to-permanently-delete-get-windows-10-nagware-in-windows-7-and-81.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)">http://www.infoworld.com/article/2979572/microsoft-windows/gwx-stopper-an-easy-way-to-permanently-delete-get-windows-10-nagware-in-windows-7-and-81.html</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It will allow you to prevent any future operating system upgrades and&nbsp;delete downloaded Win10 files, but it will
<em><strong>not</strong> </em>remove any of Microsoft’s installed or attempts to install spyware.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>This process works, but it only works if you do all the steps and do them in order.</em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Take Windows Update off automatic — <strong><em>Never</em></strong> <em><strong>check for updates</strong></em></li><li>Windows Update, Installed updates, WAIT a long time till you see the green bar complete its long trip to the right</li><li>Now, search for each of the listed updates, uninstall them.&nbsp; You must wait until the list is re-created each time.</li><li>If there are others you want to uninstall, click Later</li><li>Then, clear the search box and after the list is again displayed, enter another KB number.</li><li>Restart the PC</li></ol>
<p>If you choose “check for updates, but let me choose whether to download and install them”, Microsoft will download an “important” updates like KB3035583 to your computer.&nbsp; It will be pre-checked — selected.&nbsp; Unless you check Windows Update (WU)&nbsp;and discover
 this BEFORE you shut down, it will install it during the shut-down process.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hiding accomplishes nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is more than annoying.&nbsp; It goes way beyond that.&nbsp; It is underhanded, dishonest and just plain wrong for Microsoft to do this.&nbsp; There is no offer to accept or refuse.&nbsp; There is no informed consent.&nbsp; There is not even an idea of what it is&nbsp;your getting
 and what the result is if you change your mind.</p>

<h2>            How do yo send a message to another LAN user in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I need to send a message to other users on the LAN in Windows 10 environment but "net send" or "msg" commands have been removed in Windows 10. Are there other alternatives? Thank you. AD (NJ, USA).

<p>I can't remember from the original batman, but do you only see the riddle clues after you solve them? &nbsp;I go to where it says the riddle is and randomly scan all around until it find something and then it gives me the clue to the riddle. &nbsp;Isn't it supposed
 to give me the clue first, so I can try and work it out?</p>

<p>this was brought up in another thread.</p>
<p>if your riddles are not showing,the green text on screen when you enter a particular area,you need to go back to the area where you saved all the medical staff very early in the game.</p>
<p>the staff will have gone and the riddler will appear on the wall and this should activate the riddle part of the game.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for your response. &nbsp;I did search for the answer but couldn't find anything. &nbsp;I still can't find where this was posted previously, could you put up the link.</p>
<p>I see about two or three green texts across the whole map, but no more than that. &nbsp;If I go to where a riddler's secret says riddle on the map, then there is no text.</p>
<p>When you say "got o where you saved the medical staff", do you mean the church or somewhere else? &nbsp;I went to the church, but no video there.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I've found that thread. &nbsp;I don't think i am having the same issue. &nbsp;I see a couple of the riddles, but that's it. &nbsp;There are many areas I go to where the map says there is a riddle, but none appears on the screen.</p>

<p>yes i meant the church,where harley quinn was holding them hostage.</p>
<p>the medical staff should be gone and the riddler will be projected on to the wall.</p>
<p>on your map the riddles show up as a symbol like this,[ ].</p>
<p>i am not sure though if they show up before you interogate the green goons,which happens it the second half of the game.</p>
<p>i am not sure where the thread is anymore it may have been removed.</p>

<p>I've opened the same &nbsp;thread , I had exactly the same problem.</p>
<p>U just need to go to church (where Riddler will show up on the big screen) and to solve 1st side mission how U would be able to detecting and solving the riddles all over the game.

<p>The user might be sailing on some remembered credentials. You should start with a clean slate, e.g. like so:</p>
<p>
</p><p>net use * /del /y</p>

    <title>Pen input only, Microsoft 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pen input only, Microsoft 8.1</h2>
                    I am a lecturer and like to record lectures using screen capture. &nbsp;I notice that when I use my digitizer (stylus, pen) for input, the computer will often pick up the palm of my hand as I write. &nbsp;To fix this in Windows 7, I turn off "touch input" but I
 do not see this same feature for Windows 8.1. &nbsp;Apparently, there is not solution for this. So my question is really for Microsoft, Will you please bring back the ability to turn off touch input for touch screen enabled computers? &nbsp;There are situations in which
 use of the digitizer (wacom or ntrig) only is preferable. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Try uninstall then reinstall Skype to see if it helps. 
<br />
<br />If you already have Skype 8 installed, you can uninstall it from Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features &gt; scroll down
<br />
<br />Select Skype, click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type:
<br />
<br />%appdata%\
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Rename the Skype folder Skype_old
<br />
<br />If you don't see the Skype folder, move on to the next step:
<br />
<br />Restart then download and reinstall Skype:

                    <p>I have had my desktop background set to Windows Spotlight pictures for some time. Apart from the fact that Microsoft won't tell us what/where the images are it has been working fine. However in the last few days this has changed, and now all I get on resume

<p>I have had the same problem. The initial spotlight screen will be black. The lock screen has the picture. It can be corrected by changing a setting in Advanced Settings having to do with animating windows on minimizing and maximize, but this is only temporary.
 At some point, it will go back to the original problem.</p>

            Hi Moose, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />Error 1628 indicates that the installation or uninstallation didn't complete successfully due to an error, possibly missing files or registry keys.
<br />
<br />In a case like this, an uninstaller app such as Revo Uninstaller may help. Here's a link for you to look at and see if you'd like to try it:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstalle...</a>
<br />
<br />It might help you to uninstall the printer software. Let me know how you go and I can provide other options if needed! Thanks!

<p>Hey mate.&nbsp; I'm having pretty much the exact same problem.</p>
<p>Windows automatically made a few updates yesterday and installed them fine.&nbsp; I restarted the computer and had it on for a few hours more.&nbsp; I selected to shut it down and it began to install updates again (it's probably nothing big but for some reason the
 shutdown button did not have the "windows update" icon next to it).&nbsp; It said it had to install 19 updates and because i was tired and wasn't going to wait up for it to complete I just held the laptop power button down to switch it off the naughty way.&nbsp; Anyway
 tried switching it on today and I had the same problem as KPerk above me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Switch on laptop, ASUS logo appears, small windows loading bar appears and then it restarts.</p>
<p>After this it will load up with the 5 options (safe mode, safe mode with networking, safe mode dos prompt etc) but none of these do anything.&nbsp; Sometimes a blue screen flashes up but it disappears too quickly to read what it says.&nbsp; I've used F8 key sometimes
 to get that expanded menu to try and clicked on every option here but again nothing works.&nbsp; It just restarts the computer.</p>
<p>When I used the disable automatic restart thingy so I can view the blue error screen it says:</p>
<p>A problem has been detected on your computer and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.&nbsp; If this is the first time you've seen this screen restart your computer.&nbsp; If this screen appears again, follow these steps:</p>
<p>Disable or uninstall any anti-virus, disk defragmentation or backup utilities.&nbsp; Check your hard drive configuration, and check for any updated drivers.&nbsp; Run CHKDSK /F to check for hard drive corruption, and then restart your computer.&nbsp; Technical information:</p>
<p>*** STOP: 0x00000024 (0x0000000000190444, 0xFFFFFA8006DA6140, 0xFFFFFFFFC0000102,0x0000000000000000)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Im using an ASUS G1Sn with Vista OS.&nbsp;&nbsp; It overheats a lot (i use it for gaming a lot) which this model&nbsp;is notorious for and i have a slight feeling this has damaged somethign inside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway any advice would be much appreciated cheers.</p>

            Nope, can't even get to the log in screen.&nbsp; Computer restarts itself after maybe 10-15 seconds of trying to load windows.&nbsp; The only way to stop it reloading is by bringing up one of the start up menus i.e. pressing F2, F8 but none of the options from these
 menus seem to help.

<h2>            Windows cannot resume from hibernation</h2>
                    After I updated to the latest Insider Preview, I did some work on my laptop and I shut it down. Before it got into a complete shut down, I closed the lid and after a while I found out that my laptop fan was still on so I opened the lid but it only showed
 a blank screen with the backlight on. I did a hard reboot but every time it starts, it shows only blank screen with backlight, not even the Asus loading screen. However, I can boot into Ubuntu installed on my second hard disk so I reckon it's not caused by
 hardware problem. Please help

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Use whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to try System Restore, Startup Repair or get into Safe mode with networking, so you can Update your Display Driver to the latest:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of those work see if you can Go back to old Build.  
<br />
<br />If not then I'd create the latest stable media to do the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            The problem is likely the Insider Preview.
<br />
<br />I recommend you download Windows 10 1709, make a bootable copy then perform a custom install to the Windows Insider partition:

            In that case if possible I'd unplug the other drive before reinstalling Windows, then boot the choice of OS's via the BIOS Boot Menu key.

<h2>            Connected to the internet but not to xbox live.</h2>
                    
<p>so after taking an ethernet cord out because i wanted to move my xbox upstairs and I connect to the internet fine, no problems there, but on my home screen it says to the right " Connect to Xbox Live &nbsp;" I press it, it doesn't do anything, I am definitely
 connected to it because I can see my friends but I cant play my games on my account because of this home xbox thing so it obviously thinks that i'm not connected. I can go into my friends list but when trying to send an invite it says " Sorry,this is blocked.
 [0X8000FFFF] I can download games ( Downloading Gta right now ) I cant scroll to the store or social, I have tried Hard restart and just unplugging it nothing has worked</p>

<h2>            Stuck on time and date screen</h2>
                    Yesterday I was on the computer, when the screen went black. At first I thought the power went out. Lights and stereo where still on. Checked modem, everything ok there. I rebooted, the computer came on and won't go any further than the time and date screen.
 Now I'm online with PS4. I have Windows 8, updated to 8.1, just shy of 2 years old (the compute that is). Ran a diagnostic, ok there. I'm not a computer person.

            Thank you for your reply. I ran a diagnostic from the F12 key, no issues. No error codes either. As far as method 2 goes, will that over write or delete anything? I have a lot of pictures and music I don't want to lose.Thank you.

            <p>Hello Lace,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apology for delayed reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per description, you mentioned "I ran a diagnostic from the F12 key". Which diagnostic you ran on your system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The method 2 mentioned in previous reply by&nbsp;Jayant Gupta is an Automatic repair using the disc. Automatic does not affect any of your date on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Automatic Repair will start automatically when Windows is unable to start properly. Once started, it will scan various settings, configuration options, and system files for corrupt files and settings.&nbsp; If it detects anything, it will automatically attempt
 to fix them for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More specifically, Automatic Repair will look for the following problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Missing/corrupt/incompatible drivers.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Missing/corrupt system files.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Missing/corrupt boot configuration settings.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Corrupt registry settings.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Corrupt disk metadata (master boot record, partition table, or boot sector).</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Problematic update installation.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>If it detects any of these types of problems, it will automatically attempt to fix them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to perform Method 2 from previous reply. And update us with the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful. Please do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.
</span></span></p>
<p>

            Thank you for your reply. I could not correct the problem. So I took it to a computer store. To back up the info on a external drive. Then reset the computer. Then back to Costco for a refund. To many problems for computer shy of two &nbsp;years old. Thanks
 for the response, have a nice day.

<h2>            File sharing problem between windows reader &#38; windows mail</h2>
                    Hi, I'm hoping someone can help, I have been bounced back and forth from microsoft to adobe and back to microsoft, so feeling a little frustrated.<br />
I have been trying to email a pdf document to my husbands work from our home computer, there are two ways of doing it that I can figure out, one is to create and email in windows mail and attach the pdf file and the other is to share it straight from windows
 reader. But either way I try to do it, I just get an error message 'Couldn't share windows reader with mail'&nbsp; I eventually worked out that if I logged onto my email via the webmail server I could send the file but that really doesn't solve the file sharing
 issue.&nbsp; I don't understand why two microsoft products are having trouble talking to one another.&nbsp; Is there someone out there who can help this very frustrated Windows 8 user? Pretty Please<br />

            Hi David, <br />
as I'm new to the forum I'm not entirely sure of all the acronyms which may be used on here, so not sure what your post meant, is there any chance you can put it in longhand so that this noob can understand, sorry to seem a little behind the times<br />

            Tried that, downloaded the app trouble shooter and the message is still coming up, oh boy this is frustrating, it's no longer essential that I get the email through as I did end up finding a way around the issue, but it's not really the point anymore,
 I just can't fathom what is the matter with it.&nbsp; Am I the only person this particular problem has ever happened to?<br />
