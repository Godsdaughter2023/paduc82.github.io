<h2>            Outlook E-mail Not Accessible&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I am not able to gain access to my personal outlook e-mail account that I've been using since 2015 upon marrying my current spouse. I have tried to reset it numerous times with the codes, and it now tells me I am going through a waiting period from Microsoft.
 You need to open back up access for me as I have no way to contact everyone to let them know I have had to setup a new e-mail address due to this issue.

<h2>            Windows Insider Build 15025. Edge poor performance.</h2>
                    <p>Insider Program Windows 10 Build 15025.</p>
<p>Edge has been a slow performer. I have come across many pages that take far too long to load. I have tried many different sites to ensure the performance was not due to the site I was&nbsp;accessing. The discussion finally loaded&nbsp;after several minutes.</p>
<p>2/27/2017 - Just&nbsp;locked at https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/mail/inbox. Locked for about 1 minute then refreshed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>03/02/2017 - More performance issues over the last several days. At times just trying to load a page. The following screen shots show my attempts to tweet an article. First&nbsp;try I needed to recover the page. On the second try, the tweet&nbsp;interface came up
 but I could not type any comments. 100% hung. I could have tried to recycle Edge itself but what's the point, I should not need to&nbsp;do that on a repeated basis.&nbsp;Performance&nbsp;is not my strong suit. Looks like I need to break out the performance tools from the
 SDK. Have some learning to do. Always a good thing. Let's get this browser up to speed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Depending on what "100% hung" really entails, I have noticed that there are quite a few instances where I "could not type" without doing strange things such as starting a Find which would highlight a sufficient number of items that I would then be able to
 scroll up or down.&nbsp; I have no idea what causes that symptom.&nbsp; I notice it most frequently on the TechNet forums but that might only be saying more about how often I am there than about whether there is something particularly odd about those forums.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply&nbsp;Robert. I appreciate the heads up regarding the Edge performance tab in the Developer Tools. I'll keep on checking&nbsp;for anomalies.&nbsp;Performance is new territory for me so it should be a great skill to add to the toolbox.</p>
<p>100% meant the tab was unrecoverable. No possible way to interface with&nbsp;it whatsoever (Enter data, Right click for print/select all, Enter a new url in the addres bar, etc.&nbsp;Trying to refresh the tab did not help either. Closing and re-trying and waiting
 for a longer period than I am accustomed <strong>occasionally </strong>obtained results.</p>

<p>I install some applications (Level Touch, Attitude, AccDisplay), which uses accelerometer, but they all did not show proper horizontal or vertical line.</p>

<p>I installed level touch too. On the horizontal found that the phone was pretty much spot on. On vertical however found that it seemed to be a few degrees off. A friend of mine also told me he got the same results. However not so far off as to be a problem.
 No idea I am afraid on how to recalibrate the accelerometer if it is possible at all</p>

<p>It looks like level touch is designed to be used with the phone lying flat with the camera facing down. That way the bubbles centre when placed on a flat surface. They've compensated for the camera lens the protudes slightly from the case.</p>

    <title>Custom Sort does not work properly for me - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joie miriam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Custom Sort does not work properly for me</h2>
                    I hope it is OK to start a new thread so that I can be sure my question is noticed. &nbsp;I will try to describe my process in hopes that someone can help me understand why my custom sort does not work.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a database that has headings, 6 columns, and 20 rows. All cells have data. &nbsp;In order to sort 3 columns, I highlight one cell of data (B5). &nbsp;Then I click on Data, then Sort. &nbsp;I fill in the 3 columns I want to sort (city, then street, then store).
 Each column being sorted is set to "Sort on Values" and&nbsp;"Order A to Z". Then I click OK. The first 2 columns are sorted correctly but the 3rd is not. &nbsp;I have also tried highlighting more than one cell of data, and even highlighting all cells of data in the
 columns I want sorted, but the sort still only works for the first 2 columns and not the 3rd. I believe I am doing everything correctly but it still doesn't work. I am completely bewildered.
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
If this explanation is not sufficient, perhaps you could describe the sort process step by step and that might work.</div>
<div>
<br />

<div>
Thank you.<br />

            It indeed sounds like you are doing everything correctly. However, you still need to give an example of the data and the sorted result showing why you think only 2 columns are sorted.<br />
<br />
When you click on Sort, is the entire 6 columns and 20 rows highlighted? If so the sort will work properly.

            Dear Bob,
<div><br />
<div>Yes, I have tried highlighting all 6 columns and 20 rows, and it still doesn't work.
<div><br />
<div>The data are all text and therefore are being sorted alphabetically. &nbsp;The first two columns (in this case city and street) sort correctly. &nbsp;The third column (store) does not -- so in other words, the stores are all mixed alphabetically.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm going to send a copy of the sorted worksheet in a separate email and maybe you will be able to see what the problem is.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks.</div>

            The answers forum don't accept attachments.<br />
<br />
You will need to upload the file to some where such as SugarSync,DropBox, or SkyDrive. OR if your using OSX.7 (lion) or newer iCloud and provide a link to the file.<br />
<br />
I have tried last night on a sample file in a similar question and I could only get the first 3 to sort. So I decided against trying to answer that particular question.<br />

Well, since you asked :-) no, it isn't -- at least that is not what is preferred. This isn't meant to chastise in any way but merely to inform... Unfortunately a decrepit curmudgeon such as myself doesn't always take the time to purify every word so if it seems
 like I'm stepping on your toes I apologize in advance.<br />
<br />
For one reason, having posted this issue 3 separate times you now have multiple responders providing the same answers in duplication of what's been answered already by others. Those who volunteer their time here can only do so on an as available basis, so the
 more duplication of effort the fewer users get attention.<br />
<br />
It also makes it more difficult for others who are seeking help or trying to provide assistance&nbsp; to keep track of what's going on... It's just as scattered about for you as it is for anyone else so keeping the discussion&nbsp; contained in one conversation is more
 beneficial to everyone.<br />
<br />
If you want verification, put a check in the box below the message for Notify me when someone responds to this question. It causes an email to be sent to the address you furnished when setting up your Profile. It also doesn't hurt to check back periodically
 just in case the email service isn't doing its job. You can click your name in the upper right corner of the page to have access to a complete list of links to your questions<br />
<br />
The only reason your first message got no more attention is that you clearly stated that the issue was resolved even though the reply wasn't marked as Helpful or as Answered.<br />

<h2>            Unable to open attachement from the email</h2>
                    <p>My computer with Windows 7 used to allow me to open attachments without a problem. It has now stopped. It does not matter whether it is a word or pdf file. It does not matter which e-mail address I use (aol or outlook). It does not give me an error message,
 just says downloading and then does not download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also appear to have lost all my 'recent places' on&nbsp; the screen names I am using. In fact I cannot get into any documents from the document folder. I can get in if I go via users etc. I have complete access to all my files and folders, but it will not show
 what I have been working on in recent places.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to uninstall anti-virus&nbsp; software in order to do this and it would not allow me to do that...message was windows installer Dll problem?</p>
<p>I tried system recovery to take me to an earlier restore point - message could not complete system recovery,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A bit stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Thank you. This is kind of you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will answer your queries in detail.</p>
<p>You may guess from my reply that I am not tech savvy when it comes to terminology. I am however quite good at doing what I need to do on a computer when I have to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I access e-mail in 2 ways. I go onto internet explorer and then onto aol.co.uk and sign in, (my broadband is aol, although the account I access in this way&nbsp;is not a screen name on my aol account. It predates it and I can just access it through any search
 engine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a separate means of access. Again using internet explorer I access what is my old Hotmail account, then became windows live&nbsp;and now is outlook.com. I have not done anything to actively change it. The sign-in screen just seems to change and I simply
 sign in as I always used to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a university address which appears to have an outlook sign in page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Recent places is weird. The documents exist and I can work on them if I go to C drive, users, pick my user name, go to documents, files, folders etc. But when I click on the recent places icon for the documents I am using there is nothing in there, where
 previously it used to be full.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>Following&nbsp;advice when I had&nbsp;a previous user profile/not recognising my password&nbsp;problem, some months ago, which I could not solve on an old screen name, I had created new screen names as an administrator. Today I went into my computer using&nbsp;one of these
 unused screen names and 'recent places' worked. There was nothing in it but File names&nbsp;started saving as I used them Also through this screen name when I went onto IE and then signed into e-mail I was able to download the attachment&nbsp;that I could not download
 when accessing e-mail&nbsp;via&nbsp;IE and&nbsp;signing into my computer on the screen names I had the trouble with.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all of this means I simply have to start using the new screen name I do not have a problem, but I am doing a thesis and if there is any deeper problem with my computer then I am seriously worried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rgds,</p>
<p>

    <title>When you create a macro in a word 2010 form, can it be embedded in the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wrierson  say:</h3>
<h2>            When you create a macro in a word 2010 form, can it be embedded in the form so the macro travels with it when on the server and used on multiple machines&#63;</h2>
                    I created a macro on a form created in Word 2010 which inserts a picture. I want our staff to be able to download this form from the cloud and have the macro work. When I load it to the cloud, the macro is not present. How can I get the macro to travel
 with the word doc so that it will work when downloaded on another machine?

            There are two parts to getting this to work. <br />
<br />
The first is that the code must actually be stored in the form (document or template, whichever you're using). In the macro editor, make sure the module containing the code appears under the form's project in the Project Explorer pane, not under the Normal
 project.<br />
<br />
The second is that the file must be saved as a macro-enabled type (.docm for a document or .dotm for a template). If you save as a .docx or .dotx, Word will remove the code because these formats are explicitly
<b>not </b>macro-enabled as a security measure.<br />
<br />
Once the macro is actually present in the file as downloaded, there is still the question of whether the individual user's security settings in Word will permit the macro to run. There are macro enable/disable settings, trusted locations, and the possibility
 of digitally signing the macro project.<br />

<p>Thank you for keeping in touch with these information. Just to check, is it also happening when you run
<strong>Internet Explorer</strong> with the extensions off? If you haven't tested that, you can do it by doing these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On your keyboard, press the <strong>Windows button + R</strong>.</li><li>Once the <strong>Run</strong> box shows, key in <em><strong>iexplore.exe -ext off</strong></em> and click
<strong>Ok</strong>.</li><li>If you get a prompt asking you if would you like to manage your extensions, ignore it and test if the issue would re-occur.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In the event that this still persist, I advise that you have a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">new user profile created</a></strong>
 naming it as <strong>test</strong>. This to check if the issue is more of a user profile issue or if the problem is with
<strong>Internet Explorer</strong> itself. If this isn't happening on the new user profile, then this would only mean that the current user profile's
<strong>PowerShell</strong> is already corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If in case that it still persists, it would be best to perform a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17441/windows-internet-explorer-change-reset-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset</a></strong> on your
<strong>Internet Explorer</strong>. Prior to doing this, please ensure that you've

 after the doing a reset. You can perform the procedure for <strong>Internet Explorer 8</strong> as these steps is still applicable for
<strong>Internet Explorer 11</strong> for both <strong>exporting and importing</strong> favorites.</p>

<p>Thank you evon_976 for keeping us posted. I would like to clarify if are the results the same when
<strong>creating a new user profile</strong> when updating and also checking if <strong>
Internet Explorer</strong> still gets stuck or not? Because if you've already created a new user profile and still the issue is the same, then the next step that we'll need to perform is running the

<p>That's good to hear that your concern with your updates on your Windows has been addressed. Now for continued troubleshooting, at this point we need to uninstall and reinstall your
<strong>Internet Explorer 11</strong> installed on your <strong>Windows 10</strong>. To be able to do this, you can follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create a New User Profile</a></strong> and name it as
<strong>test</strong>.</li><li>After a <strong>new user profile is created</strong>, on your keyboard press the
<strong>Windows button + R</strong> to open the <strong>Run</strong> box.</li><li>Type <em><strong>appwiz.cpl</strong></em> and click on <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Once the <strong>Program and Features</strong> window is opened, on the left pane click on
<strong>Turn Windows feature on or off</strong>.</li><li>On the list, look for <strong>Internet Explorer 11</strong>.</li><li>If <strong>Internet Explorer 11</strong> is ticked, have it <strong>unticked</strong> and click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Restart your computer.</li><li>After restarting your computer, repeat the steps 1 to 5.</li><li>Once you're on the list, tick <strong>Internet Explorer 11</strong> again and click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Restart your computer once more.</li><li>Lastly, check and see if the issue persists on <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>These steps performed, would be equivalent to <strong>
uninstalling and reinstalling</strong> Internet Explorer. In the event that the issue still persists, I would suggest to perform a
<strong>manual update</strong> to be done on your <strong>Windows</strong> with using the
<strong>test user profile</strong>. You can do this by performing this troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Check first if what <strong>System type</strong> is your Windows running. By pressing the
<strong>Windows button + Pause</strong> button.</li><li>Once confirmed what system type is installed, your <strong>Microsoft Edge</strong> and go to the
<strong><a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4093105" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Update Catalog website</a></strong>.</li><li>Download the update that fits your system. (If your computer is running on <strong>
64-bit</strong>, choose the one that's labeled as <strong>x64-based System</strong>. If what you're running is a
<strong>32-bit system</strong>, download the&nbsp;<strong>x86-based Systems</strong> instead).</li><li>If the download has completed, before running the file, secure first a <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">system restore point</a></strong>.</li><li>Once a <strong>system restore point</strong> is created, next would be running the file we downloaded to install the
<strong>update manually</strong>.</li><li>Restart the computer after the installation.</li><li>Check your Internet Explorer if the slowness still persists.</li></ol>
<p>

    <title>Problem of read email marked as unread after a few seconds in shared - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem of read email marked as unread after a few seconds in shared mailbox</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Whenever I read through all my messages in my shared mailbox inbox, after a few seconds, those messages come back as&nbsp; unread. For example, if I read 28 emails, after I'm done going through them a few seconds later, I have Inbox
<strong>28</strong> showing up in the shared mailbox. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I know there is a <span>“<em>Maintain per</em>-<em>user read</em> and
<em>unread</em> information for this folder” checkbox for Public Folders, but since that doesn't apply to shared mailboxes, is there an alternative fix?</span><br />
</p>
<p><span><br />
</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>I tried removing and then re-adding my outlook profile, and scouring the web for solutions, but this still didn't fix the issue.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Has anyone else encountered a similar issue and if so, how was it resolved? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Hello Raju,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account configured in Outlook is an IMAP account. If the email were POP, would there be any difference in fixing the problem of the read emails from the shared mailbox being displayed as unread after a few seconds.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried changing the "Mark items as read when viewed in Reading Pane" to 10 seconds, 5 seconds, and then 0 seconds, but I'm still experiencing the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this provides further information. </p>

<h2>            Word Field Code calculation</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a word form doc that has two check boxes and I want to assign a value if ticked (box 1 ticked would be 5 and box 2 if ticked 15). In a separate field I want to total the result of the check box selection. So the answer could either be 0, 5, 15
 or 20.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the easiest way to do this in word as it's driving me potty.</p>
<p>

<p>Word field codes cannot perform calculations based on checkbox values. Rather than using checkboxes, you might consider using dropdown formfields with Yes/No answers and their 'calculate on exit' property set in a document will 'filling in forms' protection
 applied. You could then do the calculation with a formula field coded like:</p>
<p>{={IF{REF Dropdown1}= "Yes" 5 0}+<span>{IF{REF Dropdown1}= "Yes" 15 0} \# 0}</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>The field brace pairs (i.e. '{ }') for the above example are all created in the document itself, via Ctrl-F9 (Cmd-F9 on a Mac); you can't simply type them or copy &amp; paste them from this message. Nor is it practical to add them via
 any of the standard Word dialogues. The spaces represented in the field constructions are all required.

<h2>            Windows 10 keeps installing Get Office, but I already have Office</h2>
                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new'ish PC with Windows 10 and an existing Microsoft Office 365 subscription. I used the MS website to install and authorize Office, but when I access documents I get the "Get Office" program. So, I uninstalled it and things were good. Then the
 computer updated and GetOffice is back. So I uninstalled it again and then changed the Automatic Update settings to not give me other Microsoft product updates. Then I updated Office manually and GetOffice is back. So, does anyone have an answer to either
 of the questions below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How can I get Office or Windows 10 to give me a choice of which updates to install?</p>
<p>2. How do I block GetOffice from getting updated with either Windows or Office? Why does an update to Office install GetOffice anyway?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a minor annoyance, but when I have been a good customer for 20 years and have paid for the products it's a pain to have a program automatically installed that keeps telling you to get it when it's already on the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Andrew.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.<br />
<br />
</span><span>There is no setting or option in Windows 10 to choose between updates. However you can stop notification&nbsp;from Get Office by following the below steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Press
<strong>Windows </strong>+ <strong>S</strong>, type in notification and select </span>
<strong>Notifications &amp; action settings.</strong></p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Find <strong>Get Office </strong>under <strong>Show Notifications from these apps
</strong>and turn it <strong>Off</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope the above information helps. Reply if you need more assistance and I'll be happy to help you.<br />

Thank you.</span></p>

                    I honestly don't know what the **** is wrong with you people. 



You can't export TEXT BOX TEXT from Powerpoint into Word. I can export the TITLE TEXT, which repeats on every page and I DON'T NEED, but text box text? NO. 



Why? 



Because Microsoft products are entirely written by idiots.

            I would suggest to switch back to your old region, download the songs again that you purchased (you shouldn't have to purchase them again as they are in your purchase history) and then switch again to your new region.

    <title>How do I attach an excel file to a mail merge through Word&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgehawk  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I attach an excel file to a mail merge through Word&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I have 500 emails to send out and was looking to leverage mail merge within Word 2016. The mail merge function is working fine with the list of recipients, no worries there. But my question is related to including an attachment. I have one attachment
 that needs to be applied to each of the individual&nbsp;500 emails. Is&nbsp;there a way to attach the file with the mail merge process or do I have to open each "draft" email, attach and hit send?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, I appreciate the communities help. </p>
