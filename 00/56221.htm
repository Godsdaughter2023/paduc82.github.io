            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><span>Yes, you can use device encryption in Windows 10 Pro. </span>Device encryption helps protect your
<span>Windows </span>PC by encrypting your data—or "scrambling" it —to help keep it secure. Only someone with the right
<span>encryption key</span> (like a password) can unscramble and read it. Device encryption helps block hackers from getting the files they need to steal your password. If your PC itself is lost or stolen, device encryption also helps keep other people from
 accessing your data by physically installing your locked drive in a different PC. Even if your PC is encrypted, you can still sign in to Windows and use your files as you normally would.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device encryption is available in&nbsp;<span>Windows&nbsp;</span>PCs that support InstantGo. InstantGo allows your PC to wake up instantly from sleep with your apps and data up to date. For more details about whether you can use device encryption with your PC, check
 the info that came with your PC or go to the manufacturer's website. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you to refer&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/turn-on-device-encryption" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Turn on device encryption&nbsp;on windows 10</a>&nbsp;and see if it helps.</p>

<h2>            USB device not recognized &#40;Code 43&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So, I bought this laptop, a Lenovo Z50-70, in January and I found out some months ago that a USB port is not working and every time I plug in anything it gives me this error.</p>
<p>In the Device Manager if I open the properties for the "Unknown USB device" under the device status it says "Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)</p>
<p>A request for the USB device descriptor failed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one not working is a USB 2.0, the other two (a 2.0 and a 3.0) are working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping that upgrading to Win 10 I would have solved the problem (I was on 8.1 before) but it's still there.</p>

    <title>Problems with Conexant HD audio drivers on a Dell notebook - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with Conexant HD audio drivers on a Dell notebook</h2>
                    <p>My (brand new) Dell notebook (Inspiron P57G - http://www.dell.com/us/p/inspiron-13-7368-2-in-1-laptop/pd) is giving me a &nbsp;bit of a hard time with this audio thing. The audio keeps coming and vanishing without any understandable reason. I saw that was not
 alone having problems with this conexant HD audio driver, tried almost every trick that I read, uninstalled and installed original audio driver (downloaded from Dell site -&nbsp;Audio_Driver_H044Y_WN32_8.65.122.0_A03). Sometimes it works and I have audio, then
 I stop using for some reason and when I come back the audio is gone. I check device manager and everything is fine. I check Win10 sound troubleshooter and it tells me that there is no problem and yet, still no sound (neither through phones nor through speakers).
 I don't get it and it's driving me insane. I saw a lot of people having the same problem and none of the shown solutions worked for me. I ran windows update and it seems to find a driver BUT it systematically fails to install it (why not, it's beyond me).
 I tried all this with different connections just to make sure that it isn't network related to no avail.</p>
<p>Any pointers?</p>

            I've got the same issue on the exact same hardware. It started after a Microsoft update today so I uninstalled it. That still didn't fix it but I know it had to be the catalyst.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender in Vista/windows 7 is an Anti-Spyware Program, not an Anti-Virus Program.</p>
<p>You should have an Anti-Virus installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using <strong>Norton, AVG, Avira, Microsoft Security Essentials, McAfee, etc</strong> the default action is for&nbsp;Windows Defender to be disabled, as those AntiVirus Programs have their own Antispyware Applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is nothing to be worried about.</p>
<p>Using the two Programs at the same time can cause System conflicts, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a different Anti-Virus, please read this:</p>

    <title>Every 5-10 seconds, my laptop will stutter, causing the cursor to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicholas.miller  say:</h3>
<h2>            Every 5-10 seconds, my laptop will stutter, causing the cursor to jump, audio to buzz, scrolling to lag, etc.</h2>
                    <p>I run Windows 10 on a Dell Precision M6400, a rather old PC that I have been able to upgrade throughout the years with little to no problems. Recently, I've been experiencing sudden bursts of lag, causing pretty much anything on the PC to halt any operator.
 These bursts of lag last for a really short time (less than a second), but they make audio/video playback quite annoying since I have to hear a disruptive buzzing sound every 5 to 10 seconds.</p>
<p>When this happens, I also have noticed that scrolling in any application will lag/jump, the mouse cursor will tend to jump, and I presume any operation is being halted through the short interval of lag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried uninstalling/reinstalling mouse drivers, sound drivers, graphics drivers and uninstalling some windows updates, but it is not clear to me what the cause is. I event ran a system file check to be sure it wasn't a corrupted system file. I've been
 experiencing this for a few months now (I suppose starting back in May 2018).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My conclusion is that there is something wrong central to my system as the impacts are very far reaching. Aside from this stutter, my PC is fully capable to its normal capacity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I intend to reinstall the operating system if I cannot find another solution first. Does anyone have any ideas as to what could be causing this disruptive behavior?</p>

            Hi Nicholas.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What was done just before this started?   If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also Test your RAM overnight to stress it with a more reliable bootable test, following these steps which test both the sticks and the slots:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram-test-memtest86.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram...</a>
<br />
<br />Test the hard drive with diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.  Best is Seatools bootable Long Test which works on all models: <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>.
<br />
<br />Follow that up with a full Disk Check, from the Command Prompt if necessary:   <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

Yaqub, that is the laziest response ever. &nbsp;If he is using ActiveSync it is safe to say yes it's obviously Exchange, and therefore yes it's obviously Active Directory passwords he's talking about.

<h2>            Slow Window Redraw</h2>
                    Starting yesterday 2/24/10, the redraw on my computer is extremely slow. It started after I ran Disk Cleanup and I'm wondering if I deleted somethng that caused the problem. On reboot I now get an error message that says "New hardware found" however it
 cannot find any associated software.<br />
<br />
I am running Windows XP, I have 109 GB of Free Space on my C Drive. Several months ago I had additional RAM installed. The computer is a Gateway 550 GR

            It sounds like Windows (for whatever reason) has decided to change the video or monitor driver it is using. The "Found New Hardware" message that comes up could be for your video card or for your monitor. I'd try going to manufacturers' web sites&nbsp;and downloading
 the latest drivers for your video card and monitor. Alternately, you could try to roll back the driver. Right click on My Computer, select "Properties" from pop-up menu that appears.&nbsp;Click on the "Hardware" tab, and the click the button that says "Device Manager".
 You should see an entry in the list that has either an exclamation point or question mark next to it. Right click on this entry, and click properties. From the "Driver" tab, click on the button that says "Roll Back Driver".

            These games appear to be flashed based. 
<br />
<br />If you happen to be using Edge and you get and error when you load a site requiring Flash, it's possible it's just disabled.
<br />
<br />To change that, open the More actions menu in the top right corner of the Edge browser, scroll down, click the View advanced settings menu then toggle on Adobe Flash Player. Refresh the web page or close Microsoft Edge then open it again. In rare cases, you might need to restart your computer
<br />
<br />If there's no overt signs on the page that Flash needs to be enabled, but you still sense that there is some missing content, then it's possible that Flash content isn't loading.  This may be by design; as a security measure, Microsoft is limiting the use of Flash where ever it can. So, if you are greeted by a web page with only a puzzle symbol, don't be puzzled. Instead, look in the address bar, then click the puzzle icon. From here, you can choose whether you want to allow the website you are viewing to always run Adobe Flash or Allow it once.
<br />Update Adobe Flash Player in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Since Microsoft bundled Adobe Flash in Windows, you also get Adobe Flash updates via Windows Update. So, if you have tried all the above and Flash still refuses to load in Microsoft Edge, you likely need to install an update.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for updates. Download and install the latest update for Flash if it's available.
<br />
<br />Sometimes even Windows Update might prove problematic when installing updates for Flash Player updates. What you can do is download the update for Flash Player manually from the Microsoft Update Catalog. We showed you how to do that in our previous article on how to install Windows updates manually.

<br />
<br />If you still continue to experience problems viewing Flash content, then you might want to try to repair or reset Microsoft Edge.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-repair-microsoft-edge-web-browser-windows-10-1709/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-repair-m...</a>
<br />
<br />What About Other Web Browsers?
<br />
<br />Windows 10 bundles Adobe Flash for use with the Edge browser. If you use Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or other web browsers, you will need to either enable or download then install Adobe Flash manually. In Chrome, when you visit a website that requires Flash, click the Secure menu in the left of the address bar then click Site settings.
<br />
<br />Scroll down, click in the list box for Flash then select Allow.
<br />
<br />If Flash still does not work, you likely need to update it. In the Chrome address bar, type chrome://components then hit Enter. Scroll down then click Check for the update under Flash Player.
<br />Mozilla Firefox
<br />
<br />In Firefox, first, check if Flash is enabled. Click the Open menu , then Add-ons, Plugins then click on Preferences for Shockwave Flash. Click on the Choose Change when this add-on runs list box then choose Always Activate.
<br />
<br />Updating Flash on Firefox requires users to visit Adobe's download page where they can download and install the latest versions for their respective web browser.

                    <p>I upgraded both of my PC's to W10. The desktop works fine but the laptop refuses to give me access to files on the WD external hard drive. It says I haven't got authority to access these files. I've tried changing the security settings to "Everyone" not
 nothing changes!&nbsp; When I plug the WD into the desktop computer I can access all the files, no problem. I have signed in with the same Microsoft Account on both.</p>
<p>I also tried to access the files via my Homegroup but it no longer works but I'm unable to set up a new Homegroup! Help!</p>

<h2>            Print Spooler Error 1068&#58; The dependency service or group failed to start.__</h2>
                    
<p>I have tried - without success - restarting the print spooler on an XP box with SP3.&nbsp; I have read the previous posts for this error and this box refuses to restart the service.</p>
<p>Is there an easy way to resolve this issue without reverting to a system wipe?&nbsp; Can&nbsp;I run a repair?&nbsp; If so, will it fix the issue?&nbsp; I have tried to run a system restore to an earlier date and that failed to do anything for me either.</p>

            <p>When trying to start the Print Spooler Service, Error 1068 means "The dependency service does not exist. or the dependency service or group failed to start."&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Depending on your environment and your type of printer installed, your Print Spooler Service will have other dependent services that must be running before the Print Spooler Service will start.&nbsp; If the dependent services are not running, you will see an error
 1068 or similar message about dependent services when trying to start the Print Spooler Service.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Some Lexmark printers will add their own services to XP and the starting of the Print Spooler Service lists them as dependencies and therefore those Lexmark Services must be running before the Print Spooler service will start.&nbsp; It may be listed as the LexBce
 Server.<br />
<br />
Do you now or have you ever had have any Lexmark printers installed?&nbsp; If yes, are you still using the Lexmark printers?<br />
<br />
Depending on your printing environment, if you are using another kind of printer, you may have other Service listed in the Dependencies tab of the Print Spooler Service.<br />
<br />
Use the XP Services Applet to check the Print Spooler dependencies and options.<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
services.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to open the Service Applet.<br />
<br />
Locate the Print Spooler Service, right click it, choose Properties and then look at the Dependencies tab.&nbsp; The services listed there must be running before the Print Spooler Service will start.&nbsp; If they are not running, you will get an error 1068 or similar
 message about dependent services when trying to start the Print Spooler Service.<br />
<br />
You should always see the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service and maybe some others depending on the type of printer you have installed (Lexmark printers can add some Dependency Services to your XP configuration).&nbsp; All dependent services must be running before
 the Print Spooler Service will start.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The dependent Services may vary depending on the type of printers you have installed.<br />
<br />
The RPC service is also necessary for a lot of other things to work properly and is usually always running and set to Automatic start.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the RPC Service is not running and does not start Automatically, you may have some other problems, but start with the easy stuff first.<br />
<br />
From the Services Applet, locate the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service and if it is not running, right click it and start it and set it to Automatic.<br />
<br />
Then locate and start any other Print Spooler dependency services listed in the Dependency tab of the Print Spooler Service.&nbsp; Set the Startup type for those Services to Automatic so they will start automatically the next time you reboot your system (if that
 is your desire).<br />
<br />
When everything is running the way you want, reboot and check your Services again to be sure they start up properly and resolve any further<br />
issues.<br />
<br />
If the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) service is not listed as a dependency for your Print Spooler Service, you need to inform XP that the Print Spooler service depends on the RPC service.<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter (including the important space after the equals sign):<br />
<br />
<strong>sc config spooler depend= RPCSS</strong> <br />
<br />
Click OK to assign the RPC service to the Print Spooler service, then be sure the RPC Service is running and start your Print Spooler Service.<br />
<br />
If you still cannot figure it out, respond with the items you see under the Dependency tab of the Print Spooler Service.<br />
<br />
Be sure to reboot and check to be sure everything is working properly after making any adjustments.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please note that using the above command will effectively remove all the current (and perhaps old) Print Spooler Dependencies assigned to the Print Spooler Service and assign only the RPC Service dependency.&nbsp; That would be "normal".<br />
</p>
<p>The RPC Service dependency&nbsp; would be typical for most installations or after permanently uninstalling some (Lexmark) printers, but your printer may have some other dependencies.&nbsp; If it still doesn't work, we'll fix it!<br />

            The "Windows/System32/config/system missing" message indicates that your system Registry file has been corrupted or otherwise can't be read.&nbsp; This file is personalized to your particular system and the only two ways you can recover without completely re-installing
 Windows is to <br />
<ol>
<li>Perform a "chkdsk" operation on your computer C drive with the "/R" or "Repair" option</li><li>Restore this file from a backup</li></ol>
With a recovery disk set, you can possibly perform the first option.&nbsp; Success will hinge on whether chkdsk can restore the system file to its prior state.&nbsp; It will/can also take hours to perform.<br />
The second method is more deterministic and can be performed rather quickly as backups to your system registry are stored with your system Restore Points.&nbsp; The safest/quickest way to recover your Registry files from backups is to create a freeware "Hirens Boot
 CD" on another computer and then boot your computer from this CD.&nbsp; At the first prompt, select "Mini Windows XP" and allow the computer to finish booting.&nbsp; After it boots to the Hirens CD, go to the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hirens Boot CD Menu -&gt; Registry -&gt; Registry Restore Wizard<br />
Run the Wizard, choosing a restore point from before your problem, then shut down, remove the CD, and reboot your computer.<br />
<br />
Hirens Boot CD:&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a> &gt;<br />
&nbsp; don't be fooled, the correct link is the .zip file at the bottom in the light green rectangle.<br />
If you aren't experienced in creating a boot CD from a .iso file, then follow the instructions here:<br />
<br />
Burning Hirens CD:&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/burning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.hirensbootcd.org/burning/ </a>&gt;<br />
<br />
When you recover, to make sure your system is copacetic, you should perform a System Restore using the same restore point you used with the Registry Restore Wizard<br />

<br />
And finally, since corrupt registry files are usually caused by file system corruption, you should perform a complete chkdsk operation with the "/R" or "Repair" option when you can spare a few hours (overnight recommended)<br />

            <p>JW:</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. I did the Hirens Boot CD. I downloaded the zip to the another computer, extracted the image file and burnt only that file to the CD.&nbsp; To me the instructions saod to extract the ISO and burn to the CD. Was that the incorrect method?</p>
<p>I re arranged the re boot sequence so that&nbsp;the machine could be re booted from that CD but it did not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should give more details: </p>
<p>The machine is a VAIO VGN A270. I retired it. However, I had some photos that I wanted so I powered it up, copied the pictures but it was running very very very slow. I cleaned the hard drive, which in my mind was the best solution. Before doing that though,
 I made a copy of the re start disc set (6 CDs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;I followed the wizard and left the partition in place.</p>
<p>After the process was completed, the machine re started and asked for the discs in the specified order and re loaded all in turn. The machine still did not re boot. The XP logo will come&nbsp;up then the VAIO logo then it will go staright to the DOS like screen
 with the options to start in 'safe mode, safe mode with net working, safe mode with command prompt.... etc'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I selected each of the modes but the machine still will not re boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon further exploration, i came to a screen that said: <strong>Windows\system32\config\system</strong>\.. and use the original set up CD ROM. I do not have that set of disc and cant remember getting them with the machine either.</p>
<p>Another screen&nbsp;gave me the following information:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;STOP: 0X000000A , (0X017F0304, 00000002, 0X00000000, 0X804D9F68)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Another message: A problem&nbsp; was detected and windows has been shut down to prevent further damages to your computer: IRQL-NOT-LESS - OR _EQUAL</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a back ground in consumer electronics repairs.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and for your advise.</p>

            <p>A ".iso" file is a disk image file and you can't just simply burn it to a CD.&nbsp; If you have a program on your machine that burns CDs, then you must use the "Burn Disk Image" feature of your disk burning program and point it to the ".iso" file as the source
 file.&nbsp; If you don't have a&nbsp;CD Burning program, you can download the freeware "<a href="http://cdburnerxp.se/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">CDBurnerXP</a>", start it up, then click on the "Burn ISO Image" button and go from there.&nbsp; Otherwise, you should follow the instructions at
 the "Burning Hirens CD" link that I provided earlier.&nbsp; After reading what you have done, I'm not sure&nbsp;that recovering your registry&nbsp;will be enough to enable you&nbsp;to recover your system, but it will allow you to boot your system and hopefully access your hard
 drive so that you can back up any important files before what might be inevitably become&nbsp;a re-install of Windows on your system.</p>

    <title>Nothing happens when I click on &#34;Set up&#34; under Face - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> granitestatecolin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nothing happens when I click on &#34;Set up&#34; under Face Recognition in Sign-in Options &#40;after enabling PIN for Hello&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have properly setup Hello to work with a pin. I have a Hello capable camera (Logitech BRIO 4k). On their web site, it says simply that there is no Logitech software, that everything needed for Hello is part of Windows. (http://support.logitech.com/en_us/article/Use-BRIO-webcam-with-Windows-Hello?product=a0q3100000BNfaFAAT)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also confirmed that the BRIO camera is connected and works fine -- I've used it just fine in Skype and Slack video calls. Also, the Microsoft Camera app sees it and works properly with it and Logitech's own "Logitech Camera Settings," which allows
 me to set the default Zoom and other settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Account -&gt; Sign-in options page, Face Recognition has an active (not grayed out) "Set up" button below it, but when I click on it, nothing happens. It animates the click, but no window opens, nothing. It's exactly the same as if I had not clicked
 on anything, other than the small button animation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked in the Event Viewer, and there are no problems listed and no indication that it's having a Hello problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? I don't know if this is a BRIO issue or a Windows issue, but clearly Logitech believes it's a Microsoft problem. Also, because it's a Microsoft button and not producing an error or opening the Microsoft window that should scan my face, this
 sure seems like Microsoft problem. I'm running Windows 10 Pro 1709 (Fall Creators Update). This was a recent clean install of 1709, not an upgrade.</p>

<p>To help with diagnostics, I also added a USB fingerprint scanner. It has exactly the same response -- there is now a Fingerprint option on the Sign-in Options page, but pressing "Set up" under Fingerprint does nothing. Exactly like hitting Set up under Face
 Recognition. So this is clearly a problem with Windows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi GraniteStateColin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information you provided, I do agree that this could be a Windows problem. There might be something wrong with the app. As initial troubleshooting, I suggest the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Run the troubleshooter for Windows apps from <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2 </strong>- Perform a clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From <strong>Start</strong>, search for <strong>msconfig</strong>.</li><li>Select <span><strong>System </strong><strong>Configuration</strong></span> from the search results.</li><li>On the <strong><span>Services</span></strong> tab of the <span>
<strong>System </strong><strong>Configuration</strong></span> dialog box, tap or click to select the
<span><strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong></span> check box, and then tap or click
<span><strong>Disable </strong><strong>all</strong></span>.</li><li>On the <strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab of the <span>
<strong>System </strong><strong>Configuration</strong></span> dialog box, tap or click
<span><strong>Open </strong><strong>Task </strong><strong>Manager</strong></span>.</li><li>On the <strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab in <strong>
Task </strong><strong>Manager</strong>, for each startup item, select the item and then click
<strong><span>Disable</span></strong>.</li><li>Close <strong>Task </strong><strong>Manager</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab of the <span>
<strong>System </strong><strong>Configuration</strong></span> dialog box, tap or click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>, and then restart the computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that reset the PC to start normally afterwards:</p>

<p>Patricia, thanks for providing those steps. The Troubleshooter did reset the Windows Store cache, but after that, disabling all the startup tasks, restarting and trying again to click on Set up under Fingerprint or Face Recognition, no change. Nothing happens
 when clicking those buttons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you suggested, I did add another account to the computer, and tried the same from that account, but also no change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I'm not aware of any other problems with this computer. Everything else seems to work fine. The ONLY problem I see is that I cannot enable Fingerprint or Face Recognition for Windows Hello. This is a recent clean install of Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have to turn on the Convenience Pin in Group Policy Editor: Computer Configuration -&gt; Administrative Templates -&gt; System -&gt; Logon -&gt; Turn on convenience PIN sign-in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could that be a clue? I had a laptop I set up at around the same time and did the same thing and Hello works fine there including Face Recognition. If I turn off the Convenience PIN sign-in, it just prevents me from setting up the PIN.</p>

<p>@Doomeddisaster, I think that was for the older version with the original firmware. I believe that's no longer needed. Do you see that they still offer that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>But also note that I have the same exact issue with a fingerprint scanner. It doesn't appear that the devices have a problem, because Windows offers to set them up (meaning it sees them and believes they are Hello-capable), but never lets me set up either.
 When I plug these same devices into my laptop, they work as expected without installing any additional software.</p>

<p>OK, I have solved the problem, but it's not great solution -- I used the "Fresh start" option in Defender.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I have a few other observations:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. It wasn't just the "Set up" buttons under Fingerprint and Face Recognition. I also couldn't click on the "Get started" button under Settings -&gt; Update &amp; Security -&gt; Reset this PC (nothing happened, like I'd never clicked the button). So maybe there was
 something wrong with the UI for Store apps, and this problem was not Hello-specific.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. After the Fresh start, Hello worked great... until I installed Hyper-V. It still works, but now I can't do the Improve Face Recognition (when I click on that, it instead starts setting up Face Recognition for the first time all over again). Last time,
 I had installed Hyper-V before I tried to set up Hello. I wonder if that's related. Perhaps Hello has problems if Hyper-V is installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those seem like separate explanations and they're probably not both related, but maybe one is. I hope these can help someone else or help Microsoft track down the cause and improve this is the future.</p>

<p>After three weeks of phone calls to Dell Support&nbsp;trying to fix my computer;&nbsp;attempting to replace/reinstall&nbsp;the Windows 7 Operating System&nbsp;and&nbsp;Drivers/Utilities from discs sent by Dell, having two Dell Techs simply disappear during the reinstall procedure
 phone calls, receiving inaccurate setup directions when&nbsp;someone did stay on the line [except for the last guy], and having a supervisor speak to me--Dell decided to replace my hard drive.</p>
<p>Are you sure your virus is really gone?</p>
<p>The replacement Operating System disc did not include all of&nbsp;my original&nbsp;applications; but the new hard drive probably has more stuff.&nbsp; I am still exploring, troubleshooting, and diagnosing...</p>

                    <p>So google chrome worked fine on windows 10 for the first few days and now it doesn't even open. Supposedly windows 10 doesn't work with chrome but why did it work fine for a few days and apparently now it's incompatible. I don't want to use Edge damn it!
 I thought this was windows not Apple don't force me to use your crappy browser. Why is their a "Google Chrome app" if it's incompatible?</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly can you please check the status of your subscriptions on the <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Website</a> to confirm they are still showing as active. After his can you please try a full console restart by pressing the Xbox button on the controller and from the right hand tab select restart, If this does not help can you please try
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
removing your profile</a> from the console carry out another restart and re install your profile.</p>

            Hey Bob.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The game may be too old.  You can try an earlier Compatibility Mode:  https://www.****/articles/set-compatib...
<br />
<br />Others report mostly similar experience:
<br /><a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/still_life_series/win_10_compatibility_questions_still_life_1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.gog.com/forum/still_life_series/win...</a>

<br />

<br />I hope this helps.

<p>Which version of the game are you using ? Disc based or download from Steam or Good old Games ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">disc based</span> version looks like it may not run on Win10 (see below), but the GOG version shows Win10 on their list,</p>
<p>so as with all of their games, it looks like they have fixed any problems it may have with Win10.</p>
<p>(The problem is possibly due to the <em>Starforce</em> copy protection, which caused heaps of issues in it's time ? GOG remove all</p>
<p>DRM from their games, so the old problematic<em> StarForce , SecuROM</em>, and thanks to MS -<em> SafeDisk</em>, can't cause problems. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The error suggests using Compatibility with XP sp3.</p>
<p>However, this game has a <em>very </em>unusual quirk. Apparently it needs <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Compatibility</span> for <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Windows NT</em></span> (even on Win7)<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
</span></p>
<p>(which may make it the only game in history that will run only with NT ).&nbsp; Unfortunately
<p><br />
</p>
<p>No harm trying to use a Compatibility option though....</p>
<p>- R/click on the games shortcut or the main <em>.exe</em> in the install folder .</p>
<p>In the drop down menu, click on <em>Properties. </em></p>
<p>Click on the<em> Compatibility </em>tab, and tic the box next to - <em>Run this program in compatibility mode for</em>...</p>
<p>Select <em>XP sp2 </em>(the game was released in '05 so sp3 dosen't really make sense), or
<em>Win98/ME </em>.</p>
<p>- Also tic the box next to Disable Full Screen Optimisations and Run as Admin ( out of desperation).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Wait for one of GOG's&nbsp; frequent sales and you can get the game for 60-75% off the 'normal'&nbsp; price. GOG also have a money back guarantee.

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Or.... If the compatibility problem is due to the StarForce copy protection,
<strong>A noCD fix\hack </strong>(also necessary with all disc based games</p>
<p>that use SafeDisk on Win10 thanks to MS) may get the game running without using a Compatibility for Window NT ?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Some old games have compatibility issues which is a nuisance as Steam is now abandoning Windows XP so this leaves games out in the lurch</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully classic games are fixed up to be compatible with modern systems, but Microsoft has to take some blame too</p>

<p>If you have tried what has already been suggested regarding compatibility options and noCD fix,</p>
<p><strong>[EDIT: Link in my first post .... ]</strong> you are left&nbsp; with only the GOG download, if the game is important enough to you.
</p>
<p>Wait for a sale and you can get it for $5- USD or less.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I have a few games from 2004&gt;2006 (Still Life was released in '05) that have a problem on Win10 which is also</p>
<p>an issue on earlier 64bit Windows. </p>
<p>This was always due to a copy protection (DRM) that was incompatible with 64bit Windows. In those games that I have that used</p>
<p>these notorious forms of DRM&nbsp; using a noCD has always worked, as this circumvents the CD check.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As if that was no enough of a problem MS has made DRM an even bigger problem by introducing DRM Blocking with Win10,
</p>
<p>which makes it necessary to use a noCD fix with hundreds of disc based games that use
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">SafeDisk DRM. </span></em></p>
<p>( Not a problem for me, as I've used noCD fixes forever because I always hated having to use the disc to run a game.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two games from this series that were released in 2002 and 2004 - Syberia 1&amp;2 both use SafeDisk, so the disc based versions</p>
<p>of these two games also require a noCD to run on Win10.</p>
