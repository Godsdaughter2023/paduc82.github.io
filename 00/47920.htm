<h2>            Copy &#38; Paste</h2>
                    When I try to copy and paste in Edge, I get Read Aloud or Inspect Element as options instead of paste.

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. 
<br />
<br />Does it do that on all sites and pages?
<br />
<br />Have you added any Extensions? Are those working? Try disabling them -click little 3 dots on upper right of Edge - Extensions. 
<br />
<br />Have you restart the computer to see if that clears?
<br />
<br />------------
<br />
<br />If still there :
<br />
<br />Sounds like something has corrupted Edge.
<br />
<br />Start - Settings - Apps - Apps &amp; Features - click Microsoft Edge -&gt; "Advanced options"  - Reset  and Repair   try both if needed.
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />Let's clear possible system corruption :
<br />
<br />Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)  OR  Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />
<br />(Run these one line at a time.)
<br />
<br />SFC /scannow
<br />
<br />Note if that shows uncorrected errors - continue regardless.
<br />
<br />When that completes run these :
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - continue regardless.
<br />
<br />Then restart the computer.
<br />
<br />Please let us know the results and if you need further assistance.

<h2>            BF4 travando em Multiplayer.</h2>
                    
<p>Alguém saberia informar como faço parar de travar o meu Battle Field 4 no modo Multiplayer? Já ouvi rumores de que, basta excluir algumas atualizações e o problema se resolve... alguém poderia informar quais as atualizações devem ser excluídas?</p>

<p>Até onde li pra o jogo voltar ao normal é preciso excluir todas as atualizações de multiplayer fora a ultima atualização que a empresa lançou. Ou seja, se tem da atualização 4 a 6 você deletaria a 4 e 5 e deixaria só a 6, no entanto, não funcionou comigo
 então comecei a analisar mais esse bug e tenho algumas dicas de como não cair nele caso você não resolva também excluindo as atts</p>
<p>Se vai jogar em modo com mapa aberto como Conquest, Rush, Domination e etc então evite o maximo possível Represa Lancang e Raiar do Sol. Se ainda assim você queira jogar nesses mapas em hipotese alguma entre num helicoptero! Nem como piloto e nem mesmo como
 passageiro por que na maioria das vezes é o veículo que trava o xbox. Não significa que tanques e carros também estejam livre, muito pelo contrário, evite-os também mas principalmente NADA de helicoptero.
</p>
<p>No caso de partidas de campo pequeno como Team Deathmatch e Cada Pelotão por Si então não precisa se preocupar pois esse bug não acontece em hipotese alguma(não por causa do jogo né, talvez por problema no seu xcaixa).

<p>Excluir as atualizacoes e baixar novamente faz parar os travamentos durante as trocas de mapas nas telas de loading, porem ainda acontece durante as partidas em modos com mapas maiores ( Conquest, Obliteracao, Rush e tals ), já em Domination e Team Deathmatch
 o jogo funciona normalmente..</p>
<p>Isso tambem acontece comigo amigo, tambem li em alguns foruns gringos e ate mesmo no battlelog muita gente reclamando da mesma coisa.</p>
<p>A minha "solucao" é jogar TDm e Domination mesmo( fazer o que né ), melhor jogar mapas pequenos do que correr o risco de estragar o HD por ter que fazer hard reset toda hora.</p>
<p>Estou de olho nas noticias sobre alguma correçao, sei que no PC lançaram servidores CTE ( Community Test Envirorment) , estao lancando varios patchs e parece que ja esta dando resultado, pelo menos o Netcode,nao sei se o pessoal que joga no pc tambem tem
 esse problema de travamento,mas, acredito que algumas melhorias serao trazidas para os consoles, tomara que esses travamento seja uma delas ... &nbsp;</p>
<p>Pelo menos quero acreditar kkkk, senao gastei 200 dilmas jogadas no lixo&nbsp;</p>

<p>É eu tb estou fazendo isso AndyAlquimista, mas é estranho, que por exemplo, a uns dias atras eu joquei por quase umas duas horas no modo Conquista, e não travou em nenhum momento. Eu tentei excluir as atualizações e quando eu entrei no jogo, começou a baixar
 denovo. Será que eu exclui as atualizações corretas?</p>

<p>Aconteceu comigo esses dias tambem, fiquei feliz achando que tinham corrigido isso, e de repente travou de novo. Acho que é algo na engine do jogo que causa conflitos, nao sei direito. XAndr3Phisio78X, vi no battlelog alumas pessoas falando que tiveram esse
 problema nos consoles de nova geraçao tambem, poucas, mas vi, nao acho que seja problema dos consoles, acho que o rolo é nos servidores, pelo menos espero que seja.
</p>
<p>O pessoal da DICE disse que as melhorias implantadas durante a CTE tambem virao para os consoles, tomara que resolva mesmo.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 task bar fully unresponsive</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i've been using win 10 for some time now. But now my pc (writing this on my laptop not pc) is having major problems. First off: my task bar is not loading correctly, and by that I mean that my own icons are not appearing on the left, and on the right
 only the message icon is visible. furthermore when i mouse over the taskbar it turns into a waiting icon (blue spinning circle) and does nothing when i left click and the screen turns black for a second when i right click. So that is my problem, i can't open
 edge or any other browser right now. but this could also be due to impatience. </p>

system restore</a> to a point when the issue was not occurring. You could also make sure you have the latest drivers or
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Restore-a-driver-to-its-previous-version" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
roll back</a> to a previous one if this was the cause.</p>

<h2>            wkssvc.dll is corrupted and cannot be fixed with sfc &#47;scannow in Windows Vista</h2>
                    My workstation service has not been working, and I tried reinstalling the client for Microsoft Networks, but this failed to help.&nbsp; I ran sfc /scannow and looked at the logs.&nbsp; In them, I found that wkssvc.dll is corrupted, but cannot be replaced.&nbsp; I tried
 booting from the install dvd and running sfc, but this also failed to replace the file.&nbsp; How can I restore wkssvc.dll with an uncorrupted version?&nbsp; Note: I am using Windows Vista SP1.

            Hi NegiAFK,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting to answers.microsoft.com<br />
<br />
For the file you are having issues replacing, and sfc scannow is not resolving, try running an In-place upgrade.&nbsp; These steps are the procedure for an In-Place Upgrade.&nbsp; Anytime it is only a system file that may be causing the issue this is always a step to
 re-enforce the install of Windows.<br />
<br />
In-Place Upgrade;<br />
<br />
<span><strong>BE SURE TO BACK UP DATA:Files and programs<br />
</strong></span><span><br />
Note: After performing In-Place Upgrade, your personal data and installed programs will not be removed but we may need to run Windows Update to install all the available updates for your system to update these system files to the current version. This troubleshooting
 process is time consuming. </span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your DVD installation disk is prior to Sp1, and you have SP1 installed on your computer, you will need to uninstall SP1 to complete the in-place upgrade and then reinstall the necessary windows updates
 .</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you would like to perform the In-place Upgrade, let’s refer to the following steps.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Start the computer by using the current Operating System.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Insert the Windows Vista DVD in the computer's DVD drive.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Use one of the following procedures, as appropriate:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>• If Windows automatically detects the DVD, the Install now screen appears. Click Install now.
</span></p>
<p><span>• If Windows does not automatically detect the DVD, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click Start, click Run, type Drive:\setup.exe, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>Note Drive is the drive letter of the computer's DVD drive.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click Install now. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. When you reach the "Which type of installation do you want?" screen, click Upgrade to upgrade the current operating system to Windows Vista.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please run Windows Update again as you will need to download and install the most current updates</span>&nbsp;
<br />
<br />

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have an Acer Windows 10 laptop which sometimes reboots itself. It loads fine before or after the reboot and I do not get a BSOD, it just resets itself. This is annoying, especially if I am in the middle of something and I'm not very good with computers.
 I have uploaded my Minidump and System information files to dropbox here:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApqtNlaiCdQIk3t2Q_XDqdGlGMGR</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am happy to upload anything else you may need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.<br />

<h2>            Why did Skype remove the Christmas Emojis before Orthodox Christmas&#63;</h2>
                    &nbsp;Does Microsoft only support certain sects of Christianity? It doesn't seem like it would be too much trouble to keep the seasonally available emojis going until everyone has celebrated Christmas on January 7th.

    <title>Problema obiettivi xbox.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adudewithnoname  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problema obiettivi xbox.com</h2>
                    
<p>Salve a tutti!</p>
<p>Ho notato ieri che accedendo su xbox.com nella pagina relativa agli obiettivi, mancano numerosi giochi, per la precisione sull'xbox ho giocato a 155 giochi, ma su xbox.com ne compaiono solamente 134, come mai? Premetto che i G ci sono ma come mai non compaiono
 anche i giochi? Inoltre mi è capitato che dopo aver giocato a Shark Dash su WP8, una volta tornato su xbox mi sono ritrovato con 8 obiettivi del gioco SSX che risultano sbloccati se vado sulla pagina del gioco, mi ha dato i punti G, ma sia su xbox.com che
 su xbox mi dà 0 obiettivi sbloccati, ho provato a riscaricare il profilo ma a quanto pare è un problema di sincronizzazione con i server perchè ormai i G mi sono stati assegnati ma gli obiettivi risultano solo sulla scheda del gioco... Infatti su xbox nella
 schermata di riepilogo con i G mi mancano questi punti, che invece mi segna sia su xbox.com che accedendo dal tasto guida su xbox. So che magari non è chiaro, ma è un problema un po' strano da spiegare. Ringrazio chi avrà la pazienza di rispondermi.</p>
<p>P.S. Potete notare anche come qui sul forum compare tra gli ultimi giochi Doritos Crash Course 2, ma in effetti sul sito xbox.com non compare, quello è infatti uno dei 21 giochi in questione.</p>

<p>Ciao, personalmente ho smesso di usare il sito Xbox.Com per gli obiettivi perché non funziona per niente bene. La One è uscita da più di un anno ma ancora il sito continua a non funzionare correttamente.</p>

<p>Ti ringrazio per la risposta, comunque ho dimenticato di precisare che per quanto mi riguarda il discorso è legato all'xbox 360, non la One. Non so se implichi qualcosa ma per essere precisi...</p>
<p>Comunque mi sono registrato su TrueAchievements, il Gamerscore si presenta come su xbox, due punteggi diversi, l'effettivo e quello al netto di SSX, che come gioco non compare presumo perchè considerato come da 0 obiettivi</p>

<p>This can be an observed behavior if one of the Ctrl keys on the keyboard have become stuck. &nbsp;Try tapping both of them a few times, then hit escape to clear any keyboard input that may be pending. &nbsp;After that, try typing again.</p>

 doesn't draw and i have set stylus settings of tip as click in properties of Wacom tablet.(I know that click means left click if we see according to mouse settings) and when i draw from mouse scroll issue doesn't happens. please help me out with this issue

            I remember a user experiencing a similar issue, but this was with the 2017 version of Photoshop CC and the recommendation by Adobe was to downgrade to Photoshop CC 2016. Could you try doing that?
<br />
<br />Have you reached out to Wacom or Adobe to find out about support?

<p>Thank you so much for giving me the solution.</p>
<p>I really appreciate that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes actually I have already spike with Wacome they told to talk with Adobe but they haven't gave me any response till now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you sure I should downgrade to 2016 Photoshop? Will it solve the problem because i already downgraded to 2017 just now and still the problem exists.</p>

            Since you have downgraded to Photoshop 2017, that partially isolates the problem. 
<br />
<br />Could you check out if the solutions from this Reddit thread works?

 but the guide did not help because my laptop is always in this state ^. It will loop by going into that form above and then the whole screen will turn black and continue in a loop(shown inpicture, black screen, and loops). I can't access any recovery mode
 as it doesn't even show the sign in page (where you type the password).&nbsp;

<p><span>May be the answer to that is probably ' it is not useful ' if my machine is running well, &nbsp;but I imagine &nbsp;what happen if any problem / virus shows up suddenly in my computer in the future,

    <title>What I want for GTA V &#40;multiplayer wise&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> filly phlex  say:</h3>
<h2>            What I want for GTA V &#40;multiplayer wise&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>First off, the only two game modes I really care about are Free Roam and Race, and I hope both are in GTA V. Here's a list of things I think should be changed and believe me it would be for the better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Multiplayer:</span></strong></p>
<p>-Better multiplayer user interface. I know they were trying to go with a 'no menu system' but I don't think having to access the multiplayer through the phone isn't very good. And individual multiplayer lobbies should be cleaned up a bit.</p>
<p>-No more of this group kicking system, the host of the game should have all the power. The fact that the host can be kicked from his own game is just ridiculous.</p>
<p>-When someone is talking, their name should pop up on screen (like every other multiplayer game) so we can see who is talking. It's pretty damn annoying when someone is blasting music into the mic and you have no idea who it is and you have to go into your
 phone, mute everyone one at a time to see who it is.</p>
<p>-Create some sort of credit system (or any system for that matter) that if you quit a game, you lose a credit. If you lose a certain amount of credits, you are not allowed to play online for a certain amount of time. You get credits back for playing each
 game all the way through.</p>
<p>-Better security. The fact that there are so many modders online is just unacceptable.</p>
<p>-Survival mode. Players start in the city with cpu pedestrians. A zombie outbreak then happens at a random spot in the city, the zombies attack you and cpu pedestrians. Cpu pedestrians turn into zombies when attacked. Survive as long as you can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Race:</span></strong></p>
<p>-Ability to take a car you customized in singleplayer (if that feature is available(which it should be since it was in San Andreas and it was fun)) and bring it into an online race.</p>
<p>-If you turn around and drive in the wrong direction, a timer should pop up counting down from 10 and if you do not turn around you are automatically teleported to your last checkpoint facing the correct direction.</p>
<p>-Lag. Fix it. If someone is lagging, it should effect them , not me. If someone who's lagging is driving next to me, and they even touch my car, my car freaks out and either spins out or flips.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Cops n' Crooks:</span></strong></p>
<p>-I don't know how exactly yet, but this game mode can be so much better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">GTA Race:</span></strong></p>
<p>-Now, in theory, this game mode is fun. In actuality, not so much. This game type needs some work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Advertisements:</span></strong></p>
<p>I don't see why there are not real advertisements in the game. Now when I say advertisements, don't mean the out of place advertisements. Like if im in the middle of playing the game and all of the sudden an ad for pepsi pops up on the screen or something,
 no that's not what I mean that would just be retarded. I mean like real advertisements in appropriate places. Like a Taco Bell fast food place instead of Cluckin' Bell, or a Sprite billboard on the highway instead of a Sprunk one. Wouldn't companies pay Rockstar
 money so that they can be featured in the game? Does it not advertise their product by being in a very popular game? And imagine if every product in the game was a product in real life, imagine how much money rockstar would make. This could then even make
 the retail price of the game come down to $40 or even less. Along with advertisements, they should use real vehicles (Corvette instead of Coquette). This goes a long with the advertisement thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hmm, I see this thread is not getting much attention; allow me to add to this thread. So you want real advertising? Do you also want real cars, real guns, real police forces, real city names? You do not have actual advertising because of the same reason
 as the others I've mentioned. It has something to do with the law and copyright. Rockstar would have to gain permission (and most likely the license) to have actual advertisments of actual brand names in the game. Another reason why they are not in is because
 the companies that [I'm] talking about would not want to see [their] restauarants and businesses exposed to any form of corruption, violence, or any form of exploding. Businesses wish to have their companies advertised in a "good light" and if they come across
 a game where that is out of question, they will most likely not sign up or give permission. Also, from a gamer's point of view, R* has become popular (and famous) for the GTA franchise BECAUSE they use fake names and parody off real-life counterparts. I know;
 I wish we could have licensed cars and such (like Driver: San Francisco) in the GTA series, but: 1) It would ruin the veteran fanbase because parodies and fake brands is one thing that made GTA G-T-A! 2) GTA is much more violent than other games, therefore
 companies usually think twice before allowing R* to use their brands. Bottom line, it's the companies' decision; not R*.</p>

<p>Now to add my own opinion. I would like R* to have another clothing mode (like Zombie and Naked) however, let us be able to expand our RP abilites as well as our wardrobe by giving us clothing that is similar to the NPCs, or just let us be able to play as
 NPC skins that resemble normal peds, fire, ems, and even police. There are tons of RP, Police, Fire and even EMS clans out there that would benefit greatly from this new option. Call it something like "SPECIAL" and make it easily accessible within the first
 few ranks (perhaps Level 5 if you want to be in between) BUT do NOT make it a Level 10 exclusive. It takes forever to rank up unless you boost HMN, DB, or BDBII. Please let me know what you think as I think this would be a great addition to GTA V. After all,
 who actually liked the clothing they gave us compared to other game modes (CnC, TW, HMN, DB, BDBII) and the Pc variants (which had a suit already!!!)?</p>

    <title>How to not get messages reported that a hacker put on your - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sgt fergus  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to not get messages reported that a hacker put on your account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So to explain my situation it is a lot more complicated but I'll explain in the below paragraph. I just want to make sure xbox enforcement is away and can give some guidance on making sure not to ban me for someone else that infiltrated my account.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I received my first&nbsp;months ago and it was due to what I found out months later that the people I was 1v1 matching with was a clan on Halo MCC and they knew how to manipulate the system and what they did was they would all enter the custom game match, that way xbox sees that we played together, and then they left for me to 1v1 this player talking trash. I win and a couple weeks later I got a ban for communications, even though the enforcement site even&nbsp;said competive communcations are okay long as they weren't swearing or anything like saying "you are going to get owned" or "Ha I beat you" etc&nbsp;aren't violations. turns out what the clan does is they report anyone that beats one of their members so they receive a ban.&nbsp;The reason they all join a match is they figured out xbox's reporting system only sees a valid report if you actually played with them so as to make sure no one can just have a mass report system that doesn't look valid. Kinda messed up how they figured this out and others ha

<p>So i get reported and it caused the ban to kick in from so many reports. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, unlike back in the days of xbox original, they don't look too far into it and even if you submit a review they don't really take a look at it's validation.&nbsp;I was one of the many that got banned back in Xbox original Halo 2 when a hacker was able to infiltrate Bungie and use their ban-hammer to give players a bogus ban hammer. Microsoft and Bungie were on it when I called in and they did everything to fix it and set my account back to no strikes, like it was before the hacker ban-hammered me, and they got me back online after a week of having to fix everyones' accounts. Back then they did through investigations. Now, by what many have proven, xbox just goes with their automated report system says and unless you can prove yourself in the guilty til proven innocent system, your submit review claim really never helps.<br />
<br />
So about 2 weeks ago I now got my second ban, this time it was for sexual content on my account's profile. I knew what was posted on my account years ago and never changed it so I found it odd and I submitted a review, of course. enforcement didn't investigate it, just stuck with their decision even though I had a feeling, since it happened to me before, that I got hacked again after a decade since the last time. So enforcement did however game me a link tool to see where my account had been accessed. I was seen that on 11/6 my account had been accessed from Washington DC area. I have never been to DC in my life, I live on the other side of the United States. Almost an estimated 3,000 miles difference. Yet some how within less then a day my account was accessed from cali, when I last played and was accessed in Washington the next day. This is where the hacker must of gained access to my account, changed my profile info and got me my ban. I asked my father, who I gave my old xbox 360 to, because he likes to pl
<br />
<br />
Anyways, I have now confirmed that I was hacked</p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fimg-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net%3a443%2ftenant%2fxvi%2fentityid%2fREJen1.img" />
<p>and went through support to get instructions to protect my account like having to change my profile and now to sign in anywhere I need to use my email. Enforcement did not say anything about that they would look into this, just that, since the content was on my profile, they are going to uphold the decision regardless that a hacker put that on there and I proved I was hacked and have the screenshot. But I only even knew of this ban entirely by email, I had been moving for about a week and just finally got back on BF1 and I see I have messages from a while back I never wrote to players I never played with and wrote messages on there that I know would get a ban hammer triggered&nbsp;that had to have been the hacker on my account. It also looks like he may even had access to my account further back then that after further reviewing my activity locations, unfortunately XBOX&nbsp;1 emulators for xbox 360 games use servers from locations around the US so I can't tell how far back because I did play some xbox 360
<br />
<br />
<br />
Since Xbox enforcement won't look into a ban after it already happens, how do I get rid of it before a ban ends up on my account and be safe from a future ban?
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Also&nbsp;on a side note,&nbsp;I know it isn't going to be taken seriously when I say this, I feel the new reporting system is terrible in design and that enforcement can't keep up with all the mass&nbsp;reporting so they are just settling with the decisions the automated system has in place and was disappointing by my first ban because of it&nbsp;and also how xbox no longer does deep investigations into hacks anymore and will still punish the victim's account. And that I need to go this far just to prevent a possible future ban. I remember xbox being so helpful and not punishing the victims. I think the whole "guilty until proven innocent" concept of reporting and claim submitting review system is terrible and that unless it can be proven in which both sides can make a claim and see the evidence, this is just a terrible system. <br />
<br />
Other then the hacked fake-ban on the XO, I have never been banned in all my years on xbox original and xbox 360 and I'm a life long member, gaming since the days of halo CE&nbsp;on XO. and yet in less then 2 years, thanks to this reporting system, I&nbsp;have received a ban, in fear of a second 1 because of this hack, no way to dispute the 2nd ban that was proven to be a hack on my end. And I have a rep that says "Needs Work" that, from what I heard from other players online trying to get out of that by good behavior say it is impossible, good players keep getting reported and with that bad rep it makes it easier to get another ban. I have gone as far as removed any voice communication. Had my kinect disconnected so there is no way I can talk to anyone, anymore on xbox one live, My mic broke for xbox one,&nbsp;my father also said he won't be using my&nbsp;turtle beaches I gave him that work for 360. And no more messaging anyone, even life long&nbsp;friends, on here.
<br />
<br />
But I still feel like I'm going to get reported for communication or cheating etc since I play better then most. I have to&nbsp;go this far just so as to try not to get another ban. It's made gaming less enjoyable. and if do end up getting banned permanently, well I as not going to buy another account or xbox to be able to still play. I will have given up on xbox. You will be losing a life long member who has been here for almost a decade. I have already decided I will not be pre-ordering anymore games and will limit down franchises I play, won't be getting Mass Effect: Andromeda and Crackdown 3 etc and slowly go to the point of no longer having games to play because of this system that punishes good players. Its punishing other good players as well as me and I'm slowly going to transition out of gaming because it's ruining the experience and has ruined the fun for me almost entirely.&nbsp;It's not like how it was in the older days of xbox live where you had to walk on egg shells so as to not to offend other

<h2>            100&#37; disk use and slow response, freezing after startup, happen even after reinstallation</h2>
                    <p>My problem is that after starting up Windows, I can see in task manager that the disk load is at constant 100% with response time of ~800ms to a few thousand ms the speed shown is no more than 1MB/s</p>
<p>and the general performance is very slow, everything takes very long time to load and start</p>
<p>when I look at resource monitor, there is nothing special (sometimes it say avast but of course there is no start up scanning)</p>
<p>sometimes it will become normal after a few minutes (5 to 10 mins) or sometimes the whole machine would become totally responseless and need a reboot</p>
<p>
</p><p>this also happen after windows reinstallation/ resetting to factory default (windows8, i mean wipe everything out and restore from the manufacturer's restoration partition with Lenovo Onekey Recovery), it usually happen after the second time of reboot when
 I have installed some software on it, the last time it took me 3 to 4 times of while system restoration to make this problem not appearing again,
</p>
<p>but recently seeing that windows8.1 update1 is coming, I upgraded to windows8.1, and it come back again!</p>
<p>The last time that it happens is when it suddenly happens, when everything had been normal for a few months and the problem just suddenly appear the next day I turn on the laptop, and I did not do or install anything special immediately before</p>
<p>And when the problem happen, uninstalling all software do not solve the problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did virus scanning and also malware scanning with a number of software and all found nothing</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Lenovo S410 laptop, Windows 8/8.1 x64, I disabled virtual memory, system restore, hibernation, install windows update regularly</p>

<h2>            Windows Boot Manager error&#58; 0xc000000e, installing Windows updates.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows Boot Manager Black SOD; 0xc000000e </p>
<p>Windows AU failed to execute on last auto update from yesterday (May 12/2012).</p>
<p>"Windows failed to start .......Status: 0xc000000e The Boot selection failed because a required device is inaccessible"&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Using the installation disk, I attempted a 'repair my computer', failed.&nbsp; I attempted a system restore, first two attempts failed but managed using a 1 week old restore point.&nbsp; I then re-tried&nbsp;the 21 file Windows update install, download ok but failed on
 re-start and back to same loop.&nbsp; I have a history of failures during W7 AU installs if anyone is interested.</p>
<p>I have invested many hours trying to resolve these issues only to find them re-appearing.&nbsp; I am getting to the point of wanting to block all updates.&nbsp; However, constructive help other than buy a new computer would be appreciated....</p>

<span>Hi KBarry,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Did you try to download the updates manually and install the same in clean boot?</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>You may try to run Checksur (KB947821) and try to install the updates manually downloading from Microsoft Download center in clean boot state:</p>
<p>Download and run the System Update Readiness Tool by following the article:<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>Description of the System Update Readiness Tool for Windows Vista and for Windows Server 2008:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821</span></a>
</p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>Download one or two updates manually from the Microsoft download center.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx</a></span></p>
<p><span>After downloading the updates from Microsoft download center, try to install the same in clean boot state by following the steps provide in the previous
 post.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Also, after resolving the issue, see the section on how to return
 your computer to a <b>Normal startup mode</b> by following the steps under “Reset the computer to start as usual.</span></p>

<div><br />
<div>Answer: Not yet, I have questions..
<div>1. Clean boot initiated<br />
<div>2. KB947821 which appears to be for Windows Vista (I have W7 Pro) downloaded and installed but is not listed when I go to "windows update"</div>
<div>3. Updates are currently turned off. &nbsp;However, I have 23 windows update files apparently awaiting action from when I had AU turned on. &nbsp;</div>
<div>3a.&nbsp;Do I need to turn this off or delete these files first?</div>
<div>3b.&nbsp;If so how?</div>
<div>4.Not sure what I am supposed to do with this link:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx</a>
<div>there are no specific recommended downloads apparent unless I missed something...</div>
<div>4a. &nbsp;How do I get the downloads?</div>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This looks good so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KB947821 is also for Windows 7 but you need to make sure you downloaded the right one:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the clean boot and the SURT tool and we will move forward on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            update:
<div>Correct KB installed, unfortunately there were 15 AU update files waiting to install at the next shutdown. &nbsp;I did not realize this at the point of shutting down, so it went through its install procedure and i ended up with a Black SOD again.</div>
<div>I started a fix my computer with the W7 install disk, which of course failed. Then tried the restore point routine but at some point it appeared that my dvd drive became inaccessible, error msg:</div>
<div>Status: 0xc00000c9, an unexpected IO error occurred....</div>
<div>So now my computer appears dead with the black sod and no way to load my [Active@] disk image that resides on an external HDD but needs its own startup dvd.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would like to swap out my hard drive for my January backup HDD clone that i keep for times like this. &nbsp;However, i need to find a way to effectively turn off these pesky W7 updates before they happen, find a resolution then turn them on again to prevent
 another crash.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am wondering if one of the AU files installed an incompatible driver for my disk drive which is anothe reason to install the clone before i rip out the dvd drive and replace it with a new one, so if you have suggestions on how to stop AU updates as &nbsp;i
 thought i had `notify first`turned on........</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Update, 31 May, 2012:</div>
<div>Wasted too much time...Re-imaged (active@diskimage) laptop HDD from external HDD that uses its own boot disk.&nbsp; Thankfully not the W7 startup disk that becomes unreadable due to not being able to&nbsp;utilize my DVD drive&nbsp;after
 crash.&nbsp; Turned off all MS updates, turned off update notifications, so far so good.&nbsp; I really recognize the importance of having&nbsp;re-imaging software that is not Microsoft&nbsp;based as the separate boot disk is invaluable after the W7 repair my computer disk becomes
 useless...&nbsp;So make sure you have third party disk image software...</div>

            <p>Hi - Zach's option would provide a neat result - using the 'Paint' program you can choose how to overlay the text and in what size, colour etc. The trick is to copy the pictures from the theme folder so that you can retain the originals as well as creating
 the labelled versions.</p>
<p>This is the file path to the themes folder which is hidden, so you'll need to copy this into your search bar (adding your username) - You can then copy the images to 'Pictures' to work on them. Probably best to copy this to a text document initially then
 add your username and save it so that you can go back easily if necessary. - Ric.</p>

<h2>            HDD Locked &#42;&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Below is the Post of the problem and replys from a Windows Secrets forum post. Sorry for this post being so wordy.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm trying to restore my PC without losing my files and would like to create an image. The computer can't find the recovery environment so I'm using my installation
 disk. But then I'm told that Windows can't perform the task because the disk is locked and write protected. But, I can read and write files to the C drive. Also, Windows 10 will not download and install because "the disk is write protected". I used diskpart
 to check the volume and got the following:<br />
<br />
Current Read-only State: No<br />
Read-Only: No<br />
Boot Disk: Yes<br />
Pagefile Disk: Yes<br />
Hibernation File Disk: No<br />
Crashdump Disk: Yes<br />
Clustered Disk: No<br />
<br />
Anyone know what's going on? <br />

<p><span>I recommend using a free 3rd party backup / image program like Macrium Reflect. I've never had a problem creating an image with it. You can either install it
 in Windows - best option - or create a CD/USB and boot from that.<br />
cheers, Paul </span></p>

Thanks for your reply. I do use Macrium and have a current image. However, that doesn't solve the problem of why the disk is locked and how to unlock it. For example, I'd like to install Windows 10 on this machine but it won't install because the disk is locked.</span></p>

<p><span>How are you running the install disk?
<br />
Is the disk using any encryption schemes ? </span></p>

<span>I'm not using an install disk. Windows 10 is trying to download and install as per my Windows 10 request to Microsoft. I can probably install Windows 10 using the Microsoft Windows Creation

 Tool but I would really like to understand this current problem. As I indicated previously, if I understand Diskpart it indicates that the volume is not locked. Very confusing.

</p><p><span>Maybe the disk that is locked is not C:? Do you have any other disks?<br />
<br />

<p><span>Good thought, Paul. Windows 10 tries to install on the system boot drive. But, just for completion, I ran Diskpart on all my partitions with the same result.
 Nothing is "read-only" so, apparently, the disk is not locked. Also, I can read the Volume and write to the Volume. It just won't allow me to make a refresh image or install Windows 10. I've run Avast and Malwarebytes just in case there's some malware playing
 games. They came up negative. But thanks anyhow for your effort. </span></p>
