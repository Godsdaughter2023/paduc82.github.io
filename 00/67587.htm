    <title>Clr20r3 error when installing paint.net - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Clr20r3 error when installing paint.net</h2>
                    I had Paint.NET installed on my laptop around 6 months ago, and for whatever reason, one day the program just stopped working. It wouldn't open. I looked around the internet for a solution and couldn't find one, so I decided to try and install the latest
 version of paint.NET. Again, this didn't work, and throws up an "Clr20r3" error, saying that "paint.net setupfrontend.exe has stopped working" and there is a "fileNotFoundException".
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There is no clear solution to this problem on any forums on the web, and I have had Dell's tech support team's assistance to no avail. I have tried installing a newer version of the .NET framework, repairing my current .NET frameworks, unregistering and
 then re-registering the setup.exe from elevated command prompt, but still nothing works. As a last ditch attempt, I cleared all of the registry files relating to my previous installation of paint.NET and deleted all of the program files (as I was unable to
 properly uninstall it via Windows - if you can't install something properly, you can't uninstall it either).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Someone on a paint.NET forum with the same problem as me said that they managed to get it solved by speaking to Microsoft tech support. Does anybody have any ideas of what I can do here? Thanks.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Place the computer in clean boot state and check if there are any conflicts with AV.</p>
<p><b>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</b>:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Once you are done with the troubleshooting, try the steps provided in Step 7 to reset the computer to start as usual.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<span>
<p>Try to create a new user account and then try to install and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong><span>Create a User account: </span></strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows-vista/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows-vista/Create-a-user-account</span></a><strong><span>
</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the&nbsp;above mentioned steps did not help,&nbsp;then it would be better to post the same question in paint.net forum for further assistance.</p>
<p><b>Paint.net forum</b>: <a href="http://forums.getpaint.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Yes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed&nbsp;a lack of scrolling&nbsp;within edge especially on my Logitech T650 touchpad.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It depends on the where your cursor is located&nbsp;on a webpage.&nbsp; It also does not scroll within the favourites on edge and the start menu live tiles do not scroll either.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>An oversite I'd say that needs fixing by Microsoft.</p>

<p>It fixed the scrolling problem I was having with Edge browser and settings windows. hope it works for you.</p>

            <p>Thanks Daryl,.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I got very annoyed with it and ended up doing a clean install of 10. &nbsp;Now it behaves without any setting changes. &nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Another user told me to use sfc to scan my system files which showed corupt files, so I did a windows reset and sfc still showed corupt files so there's obviously some issues with the way the upgrade was downloaded or the version I received.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
10 still has some issues but now at least i can use it.</p>
<p><br />
Btw on my journey to fixing it I also found the guest account is also broken. &nbsp;I enabled it for my media players and had issues so I then logged into it on the pc and the screen continually flickers. &nbsp;You aren't even able to bring up the start menu let alone
 anything else.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Storage Spaces - trying to create a Raid 0 with Powershell</h2>
                    <p>My problem is pretty simple, I set up a 2 X 960 Evo SSD simple volume with Storage Spaces and performance was no better than using the drives singly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some research seems to say that using the Storage Spaces gui in Win 10 only sets the columns to 1 when what I need is 2.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I also do not understand how to tell it what drives to use</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone could help me with this I would be eternally grateful.&nbsp; I think I can just do this in disk management but if I understand correctly this way will make use of trim, and even if it does not I will be able to add to the pool in the future once I understand
 how to set it up.</p>

<p>You first have to make a Storage Pool with the name of "<span>Windows Storage on AMD-RYZEN-2700X-Desktop"<br />
Remove all volumes from the drives you want to include in the Storage Pool, it can be done with Disk Management</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span>*you can do RAID 0 (striped volume) easily with Disk Management, but it's slightly slower and leaves you with two drive letters in places like Task Manager and other software tools</p>
<p><span><br />
If you want to stay away from the command line interface as much as possible;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>- Search "Manage Storage Spaces" or find Storage Spaces in the control panel&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>- Click on "Create a new pool and storage space"</p>
<p>- Select the drives you want to use and click "Create pool"</p>
<p>- On the next screen that is to set up the way you want to implement the pool hit Cancel</p>
<p>- Now you have a Storage pool ready, if you want rename it to something you want&nbsp; like "<span>Windows Storage on AMD-RYZEN-2700X-Desktop"</span></p>
<p><span>- Run PowerShell as Administrator and use the command you have but with&nbsp;</span><span>parentheses around the names that have spaces in them</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>New-VirtualDisk -FriendlyName SuperSpeedDelight -StoragePoolFriendlyName&nbsp;</span>"<span>Windows Storage on AMD-RYZEN-2700X-Desktop"</span><span>&nbsp;-NumberOfColumns
 2 -ResiliencySettingName simple -UseMaximumSize</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Now to go Disk Management and right click on the new Disk just created and Initialize Disk (left side of the column), then Right click on the partition area and create a new Simple Volume, Boom! your done</p>
<p>I had a few drives laying around and I did exactly that on my system while writing this, done with Windows 10 Pro for Workstations 1809<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c77589cb-4c2b-45ba-ba41-4bb7690c5517?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c77589cb-4c2b-45ba-ba41-4bb7690c5517?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Fair warning, software RAID takes CPU cycles and IMO isn't too bad with mechanical HDDs (about 5-20% depending on your CPU) but SSDs will use much more of the CPU. So if you not planning to for something like scrubbing 4K videos where's both the CPU and
 Storage are used at the same time i can see a downside. Also, depending on how you do the hardware RAID it might be slower than software.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Black Background&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> momens10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Black Background&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I got this problem today, on my ACER Laptop that I bought a week ago, it's Windows 10.</p>
<p>Intel Core's i7 6500U 2.5GHz with Turbo Boost up to 3.1 GHz.</p>
<p>NVIDIA GeForce 940 MX.</p>
<p>1000 GB HDD.</p>
<p>12 GB DDR4 Memory, 2 GB Dedicated VRAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been working perfectly all week, and this day, I started it, entered my PIN, and all of a sudden, the screen is flashing black and then back to normal, second after second, black and back, black and back, I have no idea why this is happening.</p>
<p>I had no control whatsoever so I couldn't click on anything, I could move my cursor though, I had control before entering the PIN, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After restarting it 3 times, it was still flashing black and back, but when I restarted it for the fourth, it did go black a few times but now, the background is black, all my desktop folders, notes and apps aren't there, the whole background is black and
 changing it doesn't work, I can't open the start menu and I can't search anything, I can still open a few things like the Run thing, the Device manager through it, and a few more stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no virus, I ran a scan on McAfee, but I couldn't run Windows Defender because I couldn't access it.</p>
<p>I uninstalled useless stuff like a game app on the laptop and Onedrive and a few other things, I am sure as **** I didn't uninstall something important, I know what I'm doing.</p>
<p>I installed a pirated game from a developer who I know and trust, as I downloaded a lot of games from him on a previous laptop and it ran perfectly, it's still in good shape, I ran McAfee as I said and it didn't find any viruses.</p>
<p>When I got the laptop I ran CCleaner and it found around 63 registry errors, but those are always around, so it's not much of a big deal I guess, I wiped out free space too, could that be it?</p>
<p>This is a big issue as I can't access the majority of my files and I don't want to restart my Laptop four times every several hours just to be able to use it with limited accessibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a problem from the inside?</p>
<p>The laptop has a warranty for 1 year, should I send it back so they fix it? I'm pretty sure it's their fault in the first place, I'm saying again I know what I'm doing, I did it for two previous laptops and they were perfect, why is this happening now?
</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Unable to print using my HP ENVY 4500 printer</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I am unable to print from my computer and I use <span>&nbsp;</span>W (10).<span>&nbsp;
</span>I use an HP ENVY 4500 printer and use <span>&nbsp;</span>a network setup by the HP Printer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Everything was working fine for several months until yesterday.<span>&nbsp; </span>
First it wouldn't scan. Next it wouldn't print from my computer. <span>&nbsp;</span>Today the scanner works fine but I cannot print. I use an HP Envy 4500 series (NET) as scanner.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The computer was printing to an "HP ENVY 4500 series (NETWORK)" which it has always done.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Three things:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. When I go to "Devices and Printers" it says that " this a web services printer".<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At "See What's Printing<span> &nbsp;</span><span> &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span> &nbsp;&nbsp; </span>it<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>says under "Status," "Error - Printing."<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Also, under the column "Port" it says "Status FOXIT_PDF<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">:<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have no idea what "FOXIT_PDF:" is.</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>3. Lastly at "Device Manager, it says "This device is working properly."<span>&nbsp;
</span>FYI It<span>&nbsp; </span>says, at " Location" on<span> &nbsp; </span>HP65DE1D (HP ENVY 4500}.
</span></p>
<p><span>For the record, I had changed some settings on the computer before this thing happened.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have no idea <span>&nbsp;</span>what I changed.<span>&nbsp; </span>I'm guessing that I may have changed some setting that may have caused my problem.</span></p>
<p><span>I'll work on what you suggest.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Many thanks.</span></p>
<p><span>Jim Nolan<br />

            <p>It is not on my new XPS 8900 bought in April '16 with Windows 10 installed, or my XPS 8700 bought in March '15 with windows 8 installed and upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; See the pic ... ok I can't attached anything.&nbsp; Believe me there is no Quick Assist app on
 either computer.&nbsp; I just read an online article indicating it ships with the latest version of Windows 10 in July '16.&nbsp; Build&nbsp;14385.&nbsp; So, how do I get it?&nbsp; I can't find a download for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go to my web site, <a href="http://www.getsay.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.getsay.org</a>, I put a document link near the top of the splash page "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">click 'Open' below to view Word document</span></span>

            yes go the ISO file method with the Media Creation Tool, yes you need to reinstalled.&nbsp; And after you reinstall it will be found under Windows Accessories.&nbsp; Then do this before you try it out, go to Internet Options, select the Advanced Tab&nbsp;then go to Security
 settings and make&nbsp;sure that the box in front of "Do not save encrypted pages to disk" is uncheck.&nbsp; If it is check and you try to run Quick Assist you will get an error.&nbsp; Follow this and you will be fine&nbsp;

<p>To launch Quick Assist, click the <strong>Start button</strong> and type <em>Quick Assist</em> (just like I did, without quotes) and the tool will shown up in the
<strong>Best Match</strong> category. Alternatively, open <strong>Start Menu</strong>, navigate to
<strong>Windows Accessories</strong>, find and launch the application from there. Please remember that to
<a href="https://software.informer.com/Stories/using-windows-10s-remote-troubleshooting-tool-quick-assist.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
use Quick Assist</a>, you need the Microsoft account and both parties must be at their PCs in order for the remote connection to happen.</p>

=================================<br />
Try selecting (highlighting) the message that has the<br />
video attached and go to...File / Save Attachments.<br />
<br />
Save the video file to your desktop...<br />
<br />
Try importing the saved file into DVD Maker...<br />
<br />
If you have problems with the file in DVD Maker...it may<br />
need to be converted to a more compatible format like <br />
.WMV.<br />
<br />
There are many converters available online...some retail <br />
some freeware...the following freeware example may be <br />
worth a try:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />

            Hi Johnnie, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. 
<br />
<br />A program you installed probably set those.
<br /> 
<br />Look in Task Scheduler for those and disable the task. Don't delete as you might find you later need them.
<br />
<br />Another easy way is to install CCleaner - Free (I don't recommend the use of the Registry Cleaner section) - select Tools - Startup - Scheduled Tasks tab - there on right side check the box showing Advanced Mode - under the "Enable" column you can click to Disable -Enable.

<h3> alexanderhall  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you set a screensaver downloaded from the internet as your personal screensaver on windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was watching this video -&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwX95UaKCRg - and while watching I came across a screensaver that I want for my windows 8 laptop. However when I had a fiddle around with the windows 8 screensaver settings I found that you could
 only have either pre-installed screensavers from microsoft or use personal pictures as your screensaver. Is it still possible to use these 'program' screensavers and if so how would I go about having it as my screensaver, any help is appreciated :).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer details.</p>
<p>Toshiba laptop running windows 8.1</p>
<p>64 bit</p>
<p>intel core i5</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the downloaded screensaver safe and virus free? - Yes, virus scans don't return anything dangerous and I trust the video's creator who led me to it (Vsauce).</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As per the problem description, I understand that you want to set a downloaded image as your screensaver, you checked changing the screensaver but that only gives option to choose from Windows preinstalled screensavers or personal pictures.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You’re not limited to the themes that come with Windows—you can create customized themes using your own pictures and screen savers, and choose the colors and sounds that go along with them.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may refer the following Microsoft articles for creating your own theme and set them as per your choice to make your feel a little more personal.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Ruwim, my apologies for the delay in replying.&nbsp; The problem does not always occur, sometimes the video function works fine, so I have been waiting for the error to occur before running the diagnostic program, however, there has since been a MS and Office
 update, and as yet, the error has not occurred again.</p>
<p>Maybe it has fixed itself? YAY!</p>

<p>If you are using Trend Micro's Internet Security with Windows 7, that combination is probably&nbsp;what's causing the problem.</p>
<p>To fix it , open the main console of Trend Micro Internet Security (or similar). Open Virus &amp; Spyware Controls; choose Protection Against Viruses &amp; Spyware; click Settings, then Advanced Settings. Uncheck the box next to "Back up files before attempting
 to remove viruses."</p>

<h2>            Changing windows 8 hard drive media type</h2>
                    I have tried reinstalling windows 8 a couple of time with the same result. When installing windows with just the windows updates installed my media type in disk optimization shows my ssd raid&nbsp;correct as a ssd but cant optimize. I then install Intel rst
 ( tried 3 different versions) and my media type switches to hard drive. Is there a way to manually switch my media type to ssd? The Intel control center does show the disks in this raid as ssds.

            I was able to resolve this. I did fresh install onto completely formatted drives,usb using diskpart &gt; clean &gt; clean all. I then installed windows 8 from usb updated completely. Then installed Intel divers. MY media type did change after Intel RST but after
 running windows maintenance is recognized my ssd raid.&nbsp; <br />

<h3> boltingmarrow69  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change the user directory for all the Windows 10 apps&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so a while ago now I was facing issues with my user account so I decided to create a new account then drag and drop everything from the old one to the new one...</p>
<p>As you can see I am now facing problems: the problem is that no Windows 10 applications can save because somewhere there is a file that tells it my account is the old account so it goes and tries to do everything in a non-existent account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is this: How can I change which directory the Windows 10 apps are looking in to my NEW user account to stop these issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s. I had been having these problems for a while and just realised what the issue was when I saw that groove music was looking in my old user account's music folder for music and I couldn't delete it or add any other folders. Also, I created another account
 as a test so if you could just tell me which files to NOT copy over to that then that would be great and I can just use the new account.</p>
<p>Feel free to ask for any additional information that you need.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need more details about your concern. How did you copy your files to your new account? Take note you don't have to copy built-in apps such as Groove music as it will already be included on your new account and third-party programs installed on the old
 account are required to be reinstalled/installed separately on the new account.</p>

<p>hello I copied everything in the %username% folder (C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\) from the old account to the new one (I now know that was not a good idea).</p>
<p>It's not a concern about the app. It's a concern about the configuration files. Basically, I need to know how to get my personal files across to my new account without copying account-specific data that will cause issues on the new account if that makes
 sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s. I am not <strong>that </strong>computer illiterate, I just don't know how the configurations for windows 10 apps are stored. All I am asking is what NOT to copy when I create a new account and want to have my old files :)</p>

<p>Also can I copy the folders in AppData\Roaming\ and what folders should I <strong>
not</strong>&nbsp;copy? (What I mean by this is folders that contain account specific data. I cant believe i have to say again that I want to know folders with account specific data that could cause functions to stop working so I can not copy them. I am just talking

<p>Yes you can copy and restore the roaming profile, it should restore/reinstate most of your program's user settings. Just remember that some programs might expect parts of the local appdata folder
<em>%LocalAppdata%</em>, defaults to <em>%UserProfile%\AppData\Local</em> to be restored. If that happens, you can just remove the application's data from the roaming folder if necessary or just restore the whole local appdata folder to avoid these issues.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Visual C&#43;&#43; Runtime Library</h2>
                    
<p>I have just upgraded my Toshiba Satellite L300 Laptop from Vista to Windows7, everything went fine with the upgrade except for when the computer is starting up. The whole boot process is fine until it comes to go to the sign in screen I get this message:</p>
<p>"Microsoft Visual c++ Runtime Library</p>
<p>This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way</p>
<p>Please contact the applications support team for more information."</p>
<p>To overcome the problem and be able to sign in I have to keep hittting the ESC key over and over again until the sign in screen does eventually appear. When I sign in everything appears to work OK but I only upgraded the system yesterday and am worried that
 this willl eventually become a bigger problem than it is right now.</p>

    <title>V1607 and its 5 little dots..... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> another victim of microsoft  say:</h3>
<h2>            V1607 and its 5 little dots.....</h2>
                    <p>All 4 of my PC's are processing this upgrade.&nbsp;2 succeeded without issue.....but the other two&nbsp;seem stuck. After 7 hours they still show just 5 little dots circling near the bottom of the screen. Round and round they go.....along with my hopes of ever&nbsp;turning
 them off&nbsp;tonight and going to sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has been a disaster. First the start menu disappears and logs me out whenever I try to use it, it powers up after shut down whenever it wants,&nbsp;it refuses to&nbsp;play nice with Norton AV and now this crap. How hard can it be for MS to remember that
 their customers are real users who employ all sorts of 3rd party software in other industries to be productive? Why can't they write code that doesn't have a heart attack when it sees a stranger?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's my question. Should I turn it off or let it run itself out overnight? Is 7 hours long enough for me to give up on the upgrade?</p>

            <p>Hi Kerwin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me start be saying "Thanks!" as I report to you that there has been progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The article you sent me suggested that I uninstall Norton completely and make some scans/repairs using the command prompt. Then install the upgrade using&nbsp;an "iso" which I had saved to the desktop. There were to be two machines involved in this repair process.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing all that was outlined above, <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">the update stalled just as before at a black screen with 5 little dots circling</span></strong>. I give it a few&nbsp;hours like this (the CPU light was dormant) and then
 decided to take a chance and power it down, wait 30 seconds and restart. It resumed the update and appears to have completed it successfully so I did the same on the other. I then reinstalled&nbsp;Norton Security, powering down at each stage to test. On more than
 one occasion the devices both returned&nbsp;to the black screen with the 5 little dots circling and again on each occasion I waited for it to clear itself but gave up after an&nbsp;hour or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The entire process yesterday took 14 hours and more than a little patience. However....as my reward it appears that for the first time in many months my PC possesses a functional "start" button that does not log me out with a "Critical Error" message. I
 can also now access Microsoft Edge,&nbsp;Store and the calculator. None of these were available before. The other issue seems to be resolved too as neither PC powered up on their own after being shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, I offer my thanks.</p>

            <p>.......and once again here I am bleating. It's just been 7 days since I was here last.
<strong>Hey MS!! You listening?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that another update for Windows 10 has come through and an innocent looking "restart required" message pops up in the corner of the window. That was over
<strong>5&nbsp;HOURS </strong>ago and once again I have 5 little dots circling and the CPU light madly flickering.
<strong>The two machines that started this process before I could tell the rest of the office not to accept the restart are currently useless to me.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't tell me to leave the machine on 24/7 so they install overnight. Your current track record isn't that good and I don't want to run my PC's 24/7 just for your convenience. Most users don't.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hey MS!! Gimme a break will ya? <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">It's been 5 HOURS since they were possessed by this stupid update.</span> &nbsp;I'm trying to get some work done. Windows 10 sucks. I can't tell you how many hours I am losing because of
 these forced updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello JohnRod Nav,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the troubleshooter and it&nbsp;replaced the windows update database. This is (I suspect) a default response.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran it again and it asked to replace the database again. (Hence my suspicion)&nbsp;This time I skipped the fix and allowed it to continue. I have rebooted the machine and still the same result. The report keeps repeating the same errors, even after it claims
 to have fixed them. Forgive the formatting but this is a copy of the report, cut and pasted from the screen.</p>

            <p>Hi JohnRod Nav,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already implemented this approach as a result of the input from Kerwin Lee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My systems are no further advanced than previously. I am considering that I should alter my settings to refuse further forced Win 10 upgrades since I have managed to get the machines to operate by restarting manually during the upgrades which "kick started"
 the upgrade to completion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the implications from a security point of view but I cannot trust MS to get it right when my machines contain data that is important to me&nbsp;and the only options they give us poor victims of Microsoft&nbsp;is to run these huge upgrades&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;or&nbsp;at
 quiet times. They should break these upgrades into components that would help us identify the specific area of the software that has been corrupted or damaged. I have no way of identifying if there is a BIOS/hardware/other&nbsp;conflict with Win 10 since I can't
 tell what they are doing to my systems. I emphasise the second last&nbsp;word.....MY systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS has demonstrated with every act that they are in charge yet they have no idea what we run, why we run it or how we want to use our equipment. The assumptions they seem to use are that we all now use/rely on the cloud...we all want to pay ongoing&nbsp;licence
 fees rather than own our software.....we all are happy have just one login...we all use tablet style devices with touch screens and we are also happy to sacrifice our privacy to MS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So much of this is wrong.... even offensive. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't get me wrong. I am a fan of change and admire the evolution of technology but it is the inability of business and lawmakers to resolve the practical issues of using these new advancements without risk to existing clients that has been largely ignored.
 For instance....When I give my Financial Planner all my data so he/she/it can provide me with appropriate advice am I happy that it is likely to be stored on a server in another country? Account numbers, assets with details of ownership, scanned copies of
 my ID, taxes and signature.....in fact everything needed to replicate another "electronic" me? It's no wonder identity theft is a booming industry. I know that we don't all use Financial Planners but we all use banks and many of us use accountants, solicitors
 or lawyers, etc, etc. Everyone seems happy to ignore these issues and I find myself to be seeking a PC version of the Amish. Hence my views.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my generation (50+), MS is the accepted standard and we have no real alternatives. Word, Excel, Internet Explorer and&nbsp;Outlook&nbsp;have all become synonymous with using a PC.&nbsp;Maintaining a&nbsp;compliance trail for your business needs or&nbsp;software that can play
 well with each other and&nbsp;interconnect across a network is second to the real person's needs but like it or not, MS is in charge. When it works well.....I'm a fan. When it doesn't....I'm another victim of MS and MS doesn't take this responsibility seriously
 enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts? Anyone?</p>

<h2>            ActiveSync 3.1  For Windows CE </h2>
                    I tried the Mobile divice download center but my device is still not reconized by Win 7. I have a HP PDA that uses ActiveSync 3.1&nbsp; I use a Cradle to connect via USB port. My ActiveSyn software will not install and Windows Mobile does not work either. My&nbsp;
 PDA is a Jornada 540 Series.

            If you are running Windows 7 Professional or Windows 7 Ultimate, install XP Mode&nbsp;which will let you install and run ActiveSync.&nbsp; Your PDA obviously runs an early version of Windows Mobile which is not supported by WMDC.&nbsp;

    <title>Controller disconects every 2 minutes&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Controller disconects every 2 minutes&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Good morning everyone!</p>
<p>Following the instructions i've seen on another topic i'm opening this!</p>
<p>issue: Controller not enrolling or getting disconnected every 2 minutes "or less".</p>
<p>Already tried:</p>
<p>(Controller with kit play and charge)</p>
<p><br />
1 - new AA duracell + enrolling method (fail)</p>
<p>2 - hard reset + taking off the power cord + enrolling method (worked for a day than back to blinking)</p>
<p>3 - reset account on kinect for auto login + 2nd step (fail)</p>
<p>4 - bought a new controller + 1st and also + 2nd (fail)</p>
<p>5 - MAC cleaning (fail)</p>
<p>guys its really annoying, and it happen on every game I play, not only on Titanfall as some ppl talking but also on Lego Marvel, Guacamelee, Crimson Dragon and others... even on Dashboard!!!</p>
<p>the next step i'm thinking on is Factory Reset, no idea if it will fix something but i'll give it a try -.-"</p>
<p>please Staff and volunteers if you guys already found a solution on the passed days let not only me but the whole ppl having this issue have any knowledge of a possible solution!</p>

<p>ps: with "enrolling method" i mean i'v tried EVERY enrollings described on the support page!</p>

            <p>Hey there,&nbsp;Raphacop! I'm sorry to see that your controller keeps disconnecting, even after getting a new one!<br /><br />First thing I would try is following the instructions on our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/wireless-controller-disconnects#48ed580965184a05974c083593edacbc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sync Your Xbox One Controller</a> support page. You've already done Solution 6 there, but I want to make sure that you've done all the others.<br /><br />If you aren't able to get it to stop disconnecting after trying all of those, please set up your console for repair at our <a href="https://myservice.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Online Service Center</a>. That should fix this up for you if nothing else does!<br /><br />Please post up what works for you so others know what you had to do to get it working. I hope we're able to get your controllers to stay synced with your console soon! :D</p>
