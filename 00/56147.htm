    <title>SanDisk Flash Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mickey nojiri  say:</h3>
<h2>            SanDisk Flash Drive</h2>
                    My SanDisk micro cruzer 2.0GB flash drive does not work after I upgraded my computer to Windows 7 from Vista.<br />
It still works on my old computer with Windows XP.<br />
The part where it asks for Password does not come up, thus I cannot get to the files in Document folder.<br />
Is there a fix I can download from your website?<br />

<p><span>Hi Mickey Nojiri,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>May I know the file format used to create partition on your SanDisk Flash Drive?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As your flash drive stops working when you go to the Documents folder and asks for password, Iâ€™d suggest you to backup the
 contents of your flash drive in your XP or Vista machine, insert it into Windows 7. Check if the flash drive gets detected in Windows 7, if yes, format the flash drive in Windows 7, copy the contents back to the flash drive and check if it helps resolve your
 issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also check if it is compatible with Windows 7 in Microsoft Compatibility Center
<strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>HERE</span></a></strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            When SanDisk flash drive is inserted, nothing happens. in normal case, it will start the LaunchU3.exe and goes to&nbsp;where I can type the password.<br />
Window Explorer shows the&nbsp;F drive&nbsp;with three files, LaunchU3 is one of them.<br />
LaunchU3.exe does not run when I click on it. LaunchU3 has to run so I can type the password and get to the document folder.<br />
How do I format this flash drive?

            Formatting the flash drive required downloading Launchpad Removal and LP Installer.exe from http//U3.sandisk.com. This was not mentioned in the Micrsoft support answer so it has taken me a long time to find this information.

    <title>Do I or do I not have Reserved Storage on my PC&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clayto222  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do I or do I not have Reserved Storage on my PC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Although I have not yet received the May update for my small storage Tablet PC I have for a few weeks believed that Reserve Storage had already been installed, unannounced. This is because I suddenly lost about 7 BG of my limited free storage, leaving me
 with only about 3 GB ---- 7 plus 3 is the 10 GB I expected to have available. However, some issues I have been having with the 'clean files now' function of Storage Sense has led me to look for further information ---- and I am now starting to think I do not
 have the Reserve after all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Settings, clicking on System and Reserved does not show the Reserve, as articles describe. It only shows System files: 21.4 GB and Virtual Memory 4.74 GB. There is no Reserve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Reserve has not been set up what happened when I suddenly lost 7 GB?&nbsp; It caused some major but temporary problems at the time --- another story. And what will happen when the Reserve is actually set up, given the even smaller free storage I now have?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issues I have with Storage Sense are (1) after compressing C drive I gained only 2 GB, not the 10 GB 'offered' (and still shown) as available by compressing (2)&nbsp; cleaning Downloaded files which is shown as 'offering' a saving of 8 GB, has not worked
 (repeatedly) and still shows the 8 GB with no gain in free storage.</p>

            Hi Clayto222, Windows and indeed Windows Explorer is useless when it comes to working out where your hard drive space is being used . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility called Treesize. Using that tool, you will instantly see where this space is being used
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />
<br />Once you have worked out where this space is being used, please let us know so we can advise on what is safe to remove and indeed what the underlying issues may be . . .

<p>Hello and thanks. My apology for the delay, I am being impeded by a range of issues including having to re-create my (large) desktop, createate new Folders and shortcuts; Paste History has stopped, and I am getting blocked by the Administrator,&nbsp; which is
 me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have examined Tree Size so if I am able to paste a clip of it look I forward to your advice. One thing I noticed is that One Drive is showing a number of GBs. Is this using storage on my PC? If so it is not what I intended. I have neglected One Drive recently,
 only using it as 'cold storage' and seem to have forgotten how to manage it plus it seems to have changed since I last used it ---- for example,&nbsp; have the mini cloud icons against files been abandoned? I have not yet got the sync menu to display. Also, I have
 just noticed compression may have been reversed, I am going to check now.</p>

            as stated previously, I get notifications that you reply to this thread - but none of a private message.<br />
<br />
I tried to login through various browser, edge, firefox, chrome, opera, even internet explorer. There is no messages tab.<br />
<br />
I eventually found the inbox through a websearch via google. But even then. The inbox is empty so there is no private message, I'm sorry but this is getting frustrating and annoying.

<h2>            windows live mail task bar menu with &#34;tools&#34; is missing</h2>
                    The menu bar with "Tools" is missing from Windows 7 (64bit) from Windows LIve. I've tried Alt - M and all I get is an irritating noise telling me whatever I did was wrong. I've tried Alt - V and it did not make the bar appear. I've tried left clicking
 on the right side of the question mark and it didn't work. Does anyone have an answer or solution to this problem?<br />

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>What happens when you connect the webcam to the computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> Unplug the webcam and plug back again. Allow it to search
 for the drivers automatically.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>:</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to&nbsp;do a search for the Model Web-Cam&nbsp;using your favourite search engine&nbsp;or contact the retail store&nbsp;where you&nbsp;purchased the Cam from
 and see if they have information on how to get the drivers needed.</span></p>

<p>Thanks for updating us that your issue was resolved by turning the Windows Defender off and downloading AVG again. Keep in mind that in Windows, there should be no 2 antivirus programs running at the same time as they will have a conflict with the system
 process. You can use this for further reference.</p>

            I had the same problem using XP SP3 home. I tried a number of&nbsp;things I found on&nbsp;the&nbsp;internet regarding this problem. None worked. The thought of many is that a recent Windows update caused this problem. I resolved my problem by restoring my system from
 a backup made 2 weeks ago. The restore of the most recent backup made on 10-25 had the same problem. If you don't have a backup of your system you may be stuck. If Microsoft comes up with a solution they won't be able to get it to anyone using windows update.

            Tried to restore from a couple&nbsp; of places but it would not do that either . May&nbsp; be another problem that I will need to fix but right now still need to fix the one with BITS . The updates are now up to 49 that will not install .

<h2>            Skype for Business with Vidyo</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>we have a Skype for Business with our Office 365 on cloud and moreover we have many VTC endpoint Polycom and some others in dismission with Vidyo. As regards Polycom we setted up licenses for Skype for Business direct call on Group series endpoint and moreover
 we installed realconnect licenses for interoperability with legacy vtc. The last issue is related to VIDYO, I would like to know if we can run a Skype For Business meeting also connecting with Vidyo room or not? I know that if you create a Vidyo meeting you
 can add a skype for business user, but I would prefer to create a Skype for Business meeting and then join to it the Vidyo account.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Fabio,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my opinion, there isn't official article to describe it. All the approved phones and devices for Skype for Business is listed in the following article, please see:
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Phones and Devices for Skype for Business</span></p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dn947482.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dn947482.aspx</a></p>
<p style="color: rgba(89, 89, 89, 1)">&nbsp;</p>
<p>To confirm if it has been compatible with Skype for Business, we strongly recommend you contact with Vidyo support. If possible, we highly appreciate your sharing here to benefit other users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your time and understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Now in this so called game room it says clearly on it that is suppose to have weekly new titles releases, your arcade will soon be retofitted to perfection.&nbsp; It has not have a new release in over 7 months now.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know about you all but I know how
 to count 7 months is not a week there's at lease 4 weeks in a month sometimes 5.&nbsp; Now you can try to say its on the xbox arcade area all you want to but thats not what it says on the game room thing it says it clear as day what I had put earlier.&nbsp; So that
 is just pure and simple false advertisement.&nbsp; They need to either a change the detail of it so it wont be false advertisement any more or just update it weekly like it says they do.</p>

<h2>            PDK Black Ops Clan Recruiting</h2>
                    
<p>We are having tryouts and are recruiting more members for gamebattles for black ops. We are a great clan with perfect potential to be the greatest clan in black ops and we specialize in CTF,S&amp;D, and Domination. Also we've had plenty of tryouts this month
 already and were making a clan website soon after gamebattles is over. Explain to us what you can bring to the team, how can you help us dominate some more, and if you like us and tryout and get in the clan, then you'll have to understand that there's some
 loyalty involved as well. You can not be in another clan and be in ours too thats why we want mature gamers who play to win (you'll definitely get lots with us) and for fun at the same time. And finally, if your interested then send me JPLAY23 a message and
 i'll get back to you as soon as i can.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-11.gif" /></p>

            <p>Hi mcalix,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is one of the locations from where you will be able to disable automatic restart of system failure. The other location is, as the computer is starting up, press F8. On the
 advanced boot menu select the option disable automatic restart on system failure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to check for the exact error message that you get for this in the
<b>Event Viewer</b>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Event Viewer</b> is a tool that displays detailed information about significant events (for example, programs that don't start as expected or updates that are

            The link provided in this thread is for AVerTV USB 2.0 (M026), not the Plus one (M036). That's the reason it doesn't work.<br />
The manufacturer, Avermedia, states that they don't support neither M026 nor M036 on Vista, or any newer OS due to hardware limitations. See the "Top FAQ" section at the bottom of this page: http://www.avermedia.com/avertv/Support/FAQ.aspx?type=0<br />
They too suggest upgrading the hardware. Even though I don't like the fact that the customers are "forced" to buy new hardware, I think that's the only thing to do.

<h2>            Disc drive won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t always open</h2>
                    
<p>My xbox is kinda old, so some problems are understandable. But this issue is kinda strange.</p>
<p>My disc tray won't open when there is no game in it. I have to sit and mess with it and sometimes take off the faceplate for it to open. However, it seems to have no problem opening while there is a disc in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybody have any clue as to why this is happening?</p>

<p>It's an issue I am experiencing as well, and the disc inside the Xbox does seem to resolve it for some reason or another.</p>
<p>The only theory I have on the matter is that there's likely some means of "holding" the CD into place while in the drive and, when there is no CD, the age of it has meant it doesn't work as intended and prevents the opening of the CD drive. Of course, that's
 only a theory - last time I opened a computer, I think I caused the RAM to die out in it.</p>

<p>That is pretty much how it works.&nbsp; When the Disc is in the drive and being accessed, it's not sitting on the tray. If was sitting on the tray it would make a terrific noise&nbsp;would get scratched and&nbsp;wouldn't be&nbsp;being read&nbsp;anyway.&nbsp; It opens easier when there
 is a disc in the tray&nbsp;due to the way the mechanism works in the drive.&nbsp; When there is no disc, I would assume the opening mechanism works differently.<br />
<br />
Regardless of how it works, the drive has developed a fault, a pretty common one too.&nbsp; My spare Xbox 360 also has a similar issue, although sometimes the drive won't open even when there is a disc in there.&nbsp; On&nbsp;the spare machine I have&nbsp;solved the problem for
 the moment by always keeping a disc in the machine.&nbsp; There is no risk to leaving your game in the drive.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If the issue gets worse, the only thing to do is send the machine for a repair.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Just to inform you, if you will sign in to Skype using an email address/Microsoft account that is not yet linked to a Skype account, it will generate a new account. This account mainly relies on the Microsoft credential, therefore,
 the password is different from the original Skype account.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, it's not possible to link two Skype accounts, therefore, the only option to avoid accessing the second account is through logging in using the correct Skype name and password.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you wish to delete the second account, please note that since the account depends on the Microsoft credential, deleting it would also delete the associated Microsoft account. This is due to the full migration of Skype to Microsoft and one credential
 to all Microsoft products.</p>

<h2>            Action Center Notifications Won&#39;t Go Away</h2>
                    I'm having this problem with the action center where it shows that there are five unread notifications, but whenever I click on the icon it shows no new notifications, and when I close it, the five notifications are still there. This isn't really a critical
 issue, but it bothers me a lot.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually<br />
by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<br />
For the Vista Memory Diagnostic Tool<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt;&nbsp; Memory - find Memory Diagnostics tool at top of list - Right Click -<br />
RUN AS ADMIN follow the instructions<br />

<h2>            Windows Hello Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Dear Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I own an Alienware 17 R4 which had come pre installed with Windows 10 Home but recently I have upgraded to Windows 10 Pro version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was a clean install and I have already installed the latest drivers for Tobii Eye Tracking (Version 2.11.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to set up facial recognition, I get an error message saying " Could not turn on camera "</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am attaching the error message from event viewer screen. Also, pasting the error message here :</p>
<p>
</p><p>The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Activation permission for the COM Server application with CLSID

<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following steps as suggested on the web but it did not help :</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>1. Open Regedit.<br />
2. Go to HKEY_Classes_Root\CLSID\*CLSID*.<br />
Note: *CLSID* stand for the ID that appears in your event viewer error. In your case, it's {C2F03A33-21F5-47FA-B4BB-156362A2F239}.<br />
3. Right click on it then select permission.<br />
4. Click Advance and change the owner to administrators. Also click the box that will appear below the owner line.<br />
5. Apply full control.<br />
6. Close the tab then go to HKEY_LocalMachine\Software\Classes\AppID\*APPID*.<br />
Note: *AppID* is the ID that appears in your event viewer. In your case it's {316CDED5-E4AE-4B15-9113-7055D84DCC97}.<br />
7. Right click on it then select permission.<br />
8. Click Advance and change the owner to administrators.<br />
9. Click the box that will appear below the owner line.<br />
10. Click Apply and grant full control to Administrators.<br />
11. Close all tabs and go to Administrative tool.<br />
12. Open component services.<br />
13. Click Computer, click my computer, then click DCOM.<br />
14. Look for the corresponding service that appears on the error viewer.<br />
15. Right click on it then click properties.<br />
16. Click security tab then click Add User. Add SYSTEM then apply.<br />
17. Tick the Activate local box.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you may ready know, Windows Hello is a more personal way to sign in with just a look or touch. Installing
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027667/windows-update-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Updates</a></strong> before setting this up may help in fixing the issue. Moreover, may we verify if your computer has a front-facing
 infrared (IR) camera? This is a primary requirement in order to set up Windows Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Darian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes my laptop is Alienware 17 R4 and it has a front facing IR Camera with Tobii eye tracking (version 2.11.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Hello was working on the laptop before when it was running Windows 10 Home, however after upgrading to Windows 10 Pro...it is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all the latest updates installed already, kindly advise...</p>

<p>Dear Darian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a stupid answer and any layman can tell to do system restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I had to do system restore, I would have done it long ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am expecting some professional solutions here, not suggestions to perform system restore or do a clean installation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>While anyone from "Microsoft" on these support forums may help, it's only about 2% of the time. Every response from them is canned and always resorts to resetting the computer or recreating a new user account. Both of which are time consuming and ridiculous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with the Windows Hello on the Alienware 17 R4 as well as most any PC with Windows Hello, including Microsoft's own Surface devices, got broke by Microsoft with the Fall Creators Update back in OCT/NOV 2017. Devices with a separate IR camera used
 for Windows Hello (mostly Realtek); have updated their drivers for that IR camera by downloading that device's driver either by going to realtek or the PC maker's driver's download. However, with the Alienware 17 R4 (came in 2 types of IR cameras); one with
 a realtek IR camera and the other built into the Tobii device. Tobii has yet to come out with the updated driver and Dell is waiting for Tobii to do the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://help.tobii.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003032934-Windows-Hello-not-functional-after-Fall-Creators-Update</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish these "Microsoft" people; which are I know are here to try to help... would be nice if they could research their responses (a simple Google search) before having to have people perform a full restore or reset. If you look at these forums, all the
 responses are the same canned responses. It's irritating at most.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, what most people do not realize is that even though your device has a web camera it does not mean it's Windows Hello compatible. It needs to be an IR camera. Some devices have 2 cameras (web cam and an IR camera). Or in the case of the Tobii, the IR
 camera is located on the Tobii device at the bottom of the screen and a Tobii "Aware" device the camera is on top and not related to Tobii - but Dell installed Realtek IR camera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. At this time for those of us with the built in IR camera from Tobii, we must wait for Tobii to update that driver that got broke by Microsoft the WFCU 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows Hello was setup prior to updating to the WFCU 2017, it may work. But if it was not previously setup or it was a clean install of WFCU, then it will not work no matter any steps you try to "fix" it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tobii does have a beta driver available to test if you contact Tobii. However, they want to remote into your device to set it up where we elected not to do due to security reasons. We have 9 of the Alienware 17 R4 laptops. All were a clean install of WFCU
 2017 and all of them fail to setup Windows Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The run around back in NOV of trying to figure out the issue was told by us that Dell blames Microsoft, Microsoft blames Dell or Tobii, Tobii blames Microsoft. It's a joke.</p>

@Erik<br />
<br />
I am so glad I am not the only one with this problem. Ever since the FCU, I have had nothing but problems trying to get my Tobii device functional again (and by extension, Windows Hello) and Tobii has suggested to do full clean installs, try this BIOS update
 or that clean install, etc. Sometimes it would work ever-so-briefly, but then fail to work ever again. Microsoft had remote desktop and had the idea of using the generic software driver for the Tobii device (instead of the most updated one) and that actually
 worked for a time, but then there must have been yet another update or something and now even that won't work.<br />
<br />
No matter what I do, it claims that "No eye tracker is connected", and that it cannot activate the camera when I go to try to log in. So I've sent yet another log dump to Tobii and will try to reach out to Microsoft yet again, and see what happens. Very frustrated
 at this point.

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essential settings like the<strong> Local Group Policy</strong> could be modified while upgrading to Fall Creators update. One of which is the facial recognition and fingerprint reader's feature of Windows Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can go ahead and check the biometric settings in Local Group Policy. To do that, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R </strong>. On the run box, type<strong> gpedit.msc</strong> and hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Expand <strong>Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Biometrics.</strong></li><li>Double-click on it then open <strong>Allow the use of Biometrics </strong>option.</li><li>Tick <strong>Enabled </strong>option and click <strong>Apply </strong>and <strong>
Ok</strong>.</li><li>Do the same setting for <strong>Allow users to log on using biometrics</strong> opion.</li><li>Restart your computer and see if this fixes the issue.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back with more information.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>While it is possible that the problem with your Bluetooth headset is caused by an outdated device driver, we would like to a ask a few questions to effectively assist you:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Have you tried updating your device driver?</li><li>What is the make and model of your Bluetooth headset?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, <span>if you hear audio glitches or low-quality audio in general when playing music over a Bluetooth headset, close<strong> Bluetooth settings</strong> if itâ€™s open. Your PC will no longer be searching for Bluetooth devices, which can cause problems
 when itâ€™s streaming music at the same time.</span><span> You may also hear issues if youâ€™re using Bluetooth for something else at the same time youâ€™re listening to music over it (for example, youâ€™re sharing files over Bluetooth while listening to music over
 a Bluetooth speaker).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Furthermore, </span><span>if youâ€™re running</span><span> Version 1703, we suggest using the Bluetooth troubleshooter to find and resolve Bluetooth problems with your computer. Here's how:</span></p>
<ol>
&nbsp;
<li><span>Click </span><span>the&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong><span>&nbsp;button.</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;</span><strong>Settings</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>Click<strong> Update &amp; security</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</span></li><li><span>After running the troubleshooter, reconnect your Bluetooth headset.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know if you need any other help.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards.</span></p>
<p>
