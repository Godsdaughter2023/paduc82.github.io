<h2>            Unable to Login to Skype - Child Changed User Name</h2>
                    <p>Recently my child logged into his Xbox account. &nbsp;He changed the user name and now I can't log in to my Skype account. &nbsp;It's all in my personal email address, so I'm really lost. &nbsp;How do I change the name back so I can log into Skype?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have Windows 10, I just have the Skype app installed.</p>

<p>Hey there,&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c4cc0bbd-9e70-41c1-8631-815d7ad7b7bf">newbornphotog</a></p>
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>When they changed their username, do you mean Gamertag?</li><li>What other information has been changed?</li><li>Was he signed into Xbox Live using your email address and password or his own?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>This is quite puzzling why his account has changed your account unless they were linked. Where they ever linked - could have been though Account Alias?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>

<p>He says it's not the Gamer Tag or User Name. &nbsp;It's the regular name and last name, which apparently was my personal name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He was signed in using my name and email. &nbsp;He's too young to have his own account. &nbsp;So, yes, his email is linked to my account.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Privacy and online safety.</h2>
                    <p>Im trying to change Xbox One/Windows 10 Online Safety settings. I want to change the setting "You can create and join clubs". It is currently on "Block". When i change it to "Allow" and i click on "Submit". It reloads the page and it is at the setting "Block"
 again. I tried it again, but it doesn't work.</p>
<p>I can change Privacy and Xbox 360 settings, but not the Xbox One/Windows 10 Online Safety settings.</p>

            Okay, i fixed the problem. I tried to have a chat, but no one responded. I removed everyone from my family and created a new account as adult. Then from that account i added my real account as a child. I was able to change the settings. I dont understand
 why i wasn't able to change with my own account, because it was an adult account.

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer to put it back
 to Factory Settings</span></span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/contact_us.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/contact_us.html</a></span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

<h2>            Poor quality images &#40;pixelated&#41; on the web</h2>
                    Everywhere on the web I see poor quality images<br />
I design graphics for websites. Everything looks fine in programs I use for designing, but as soon as I put the graphics on the web, they look blurry and bad.<br />
Does anyone know a solution for this? It's not only images I design, it's all other images too.<br />
I work on Asus, but when I switch to Mac the images look very good. What may be the problem?
<br />
My graphic driver is updated to the latest version. <br />

            <p>Hi Michal,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>What type of internet connection are you using? </li><li>Which web browser are you using?</li><li>Which program are you using to transfer the graphics on the web?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is not related to graphic drivers. It’s with the internet connection or the application you are using to transfer the picture on web. Since you are downloading less data, this makes things seem faster than they really are. Pictures will be pixelated/unclear
 because not all the image data is downloaded. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Some websites might appear blank or might not display correctly in Internet&nbsp;Explorer. For example, portions of a webpage might be missing, or colors and text might be incorrect. Some pages might not display at all. If a portion of a page is blank or doesn't
 display correctly, try one or more of these options:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Turn on Compatibility View. You can only turn on Compatibility View when using Internet&nbsp;Explorer for the desktop. Learn how by reading
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix site display problems with Compatibility View</a>.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Turn off Tracking Protection for the site you're on. Learn how by reading
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/internet-explorer/use-tracking-protection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use Tracking Protection</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3: Turn off hardware acceleration</strong>. To turn off hardware acceleration,</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Internet&nbsp;Explorer for the desktop, tap or click the Tools button.</li><li>Tap or click Internet Options. Tap or click the Advanced tab, </li><li>Select Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering, and then tap or click OK.
</li><li>You must close and reopen Internet&nbsp;Explorer for changes to take effect.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

<h2>            xbox live parental control    </h2>
                    
<p>hello i got an Xbox about two or three years ago now and have had a problem with parental controls. When i first set up the account my mom did not want to use her email because it was her work email so i used my alt email for the parent email. i am 14 and
 my mom really does not care what i do on the Xbox she does not have her credit card in it or anything. So i have tried to set the teen account to an adult or just costume one so i dont have to type in the password again and again but now it is starting to
 interfere with my DLC (down loadable content) i am a Call of duty player and i have gotten a lot of the DLC, but when i tried to redeem my nuketown code of the game it was downloaded but i did not have it i tried it again and it said the code had all ready
 be used. I really just want to know what I or my mom has to do to fix it. also when setting up the parental account on the this site i think i did something wrong i am not sure what but i am pretty sure i have the parental account and a random (newly made)
 account in one. i get emails about it being the parental account but when i log in it is a different account. I REALLY JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT I (or my mom) HAVE TO DO TO FIX THIS ANY RESPONSE WOULD BE NICE. Sorry for any grammar errors spelling is not my strong
 point. and before u think i am just a kid who want to break his parental controls look in to this please and tell me anything that would fix this</p>

<p>Hey boyboyyo, welcome to the Forums! &nbsp;I'll start off by saying that until the account comes of age, it's definitely going to need a Parental Account on it. &nbsp;I'd suggest reading up a bit about it over here:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/parental-controls/parental-control-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox
 360 console parental controls&nbsp;</a>. &nbsp;It'll always be important to have that account be a real email address that a parent is able to access and has the password for the account. &nbsp;If any of the info there is fake, it can cause serious issues with your account
 later, so please make sure all the info is accurate! &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now, the issue you're describing with the Nuketown code probably isn't anything having to do with the Parental Account. &nbsp;Likely you already did redeem it on your account, you can find it again by heading into your Download History and choosing to redownload
 it. &nbsp;Please let us know how that goes. :)</p>

<p>Hey boyboyyo5678! To purchase the season pass make sure to redeem the 4000 MSP on your account and NOT the parent account. Before you can make any purchases you'll have to check with your mom and ask if she's willing to let you change your current child
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/online-privacy-and-safety/online-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
online safety and privacy settings</a> to allow purchases and Mature content. Once the MSP are redeemed on your account and those settings are updated you can purchase the season pass!</p>

<p>passport.microsoft.com is not working it says not even a web sight. so this is what i do i go to my account and click &nbsp;Privacy and Online Settings, then it says Parental Approval Required so i log in has my alt email/the parental email. one problem is my
 parent email might have 2 Xbox accounts set on it because when i log in it does not have the same gamer tag as my Xbox parent Xbox account but i get emails form Microsoft addressed to my parent gamer tag (i have not change the gamer tag since i am the parent
 account so it is still the random words but i know what it is when i see it) and thank you for try to help and hope fully we can get this fixed</p>

<p>Oops! &nbsp;I'm so sorry, that should have read as passport.live.com<br />
<br />
Honestly, it's sounding like there's something up with that parental account that we may need phone support's help with. &nbsp;I would suggest trying to sign in to passport.live.com. &nbsp;If the account is blocked, that site will help you unblock it. &nbsp;If you still get
 glitch messages there, then it will be best to call phone support.&nbsp;</p>

 help) and if there is a way to buy it on the parent account and move it to the kids or something that would be nice</p>

    <title>Folders as Junction Points not working in Creator&#39;s Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlie lehardy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Folders as Junction Points not working in Creator&#39;s Update</h2>
                    <p>With the "GodMode" shortcut that can be created by creating a new folder titled "&lt;Some Name&gt;.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C}" (replacing &lt;Some Name&gt; with whatever you want and not including the quotes), in the new Creator's update (build 15063.13),
 the folder name is not shown in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance, I have a folder that I created on the desktop called "Master Control" but when it is displayed on the desktop after doing the update to the Creator's update, it is blank for the name of it. Of course, normal folders and other file types on
 the desktop display just fine. It's only the Junction Point that I created to GUID&nbsp;{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C} that is not so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, this worked just fine in older versions of Windows 10 and also Windows 7. Plus, other junction points I've created to other GUIDs have worked just fine with this build of the Creator's update, it's only that one so... What's up?<br />

            It's not something that's causing problems with running the computer and if I'm not the only one having this problem, I'm hoping people at Microsoft will hear about this issue sooner than later and be able to have an update out for it a fairly soon after
 the official roll out.

            I am seeing same issue here on the community forum and they only advise people to roll back since it is not officially released. Hopefully they will fix this.

    <title>Unable to start Windows Firewall Service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> orbsitron  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to start Windows Firewall Service</h2>
                    I run Services.msc as an administrator on Vista Home Premium 32 bit, scroll down to Windows Firewall (which is set to automatic and is currently stopped). When I try to start the service, I get the error:<br />
<br />
Windows could not start the Windows Firewall on local computer. For more information view the System Event log. If this is a non-Microsoft service, contact the service vendor, and refer to service-specific error code, 5.<br />
<br />
I have looked in the system event log but the System Log in Windows Logs in Event Viewer gives me the error:<br />
<br />
Event Viewer cannot open the event log or custom view. Verify that the Event Log service is running. The data is invalid (13).<br />
<br />
In Services, I see Windows Event Log service is running.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Have you tried the good old fashioned down to earth method .....<br />
Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Windows&nbsp;Firewall &gt; Turn Windows Firewall on or off &gt; turn it&nbsp; ON.<br />

<p>I tried starting ICS.&nbsp; First it was disabled, so I enabled it. Then when I started it, it was automatically stopped because nothing was using it.
<br />
<br />
Windows Firewall still won't start.<br />
<br />
Should I do the registry changes even if ICS is instantly stopping after I start it?</p>

    <title>Remove OneNote from Surface Pro 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> karinadale  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove OneNote from Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>How do you remove OneNote from the Surface Pro 3?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an artist using the Surface Pro 3 as a digital art machine only. OneNote is annoying and useless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I hate that the pen jitters. It makes taking notes in OneNote impossible anyways. The line jumps and makes handwriting illegible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) I want to use the end of the pen as an eraser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) the buttons on the side of the pen are useless and don't seem to be customizable, which is weird and sucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I liked the wacom technology better. The jitter in the pen makes this tablet barely useable to a professional. The Surface Pro 1 had far superior line quality. I understand the company isn't making this machine for digital artists specifically but I'm pretty
 sure we're using them more than people who really, really need OneNote.&nbsp;</p>

<div>is what you are describing. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Microsoft has recently purchased N-Trig (as you know this is the technology in</div>
<div>the SP3). Microsoft has stated that the "Surface" windows store app will be</div>
<div>enhanced. Some people have speculated it will allow more customization of the</div>
<div>buttons. I haven't seen anything on this since October 2014..</div>

            Hi RilerssDV 
<br />
<br />Do you have Driver Veririfer enabled at the moment?
<br />
<br />If so, disable Driver Verifier and see if your system continues to crash, driver verifier can cause a lot of false positives . . .
<br />
<br />Then if you get another crash, please post any new minidump files that are generated . . .       
        </p>

            Try downgrading to an older version of Windows 10 and see if the crashes still happen.
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1803 from the following link:

<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1803 
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy

            <p><span>Hi Natalie,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft community where you can find all the answers related to Windows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description, you have been told by a technician over phone that your system has to be cleaned and you would be charged for it. Am I correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The phone call you received was<u> not from Microsoft</u>. We appreciate your efforts in updating us with information about theses Fake phone calls. They work for third party companies and try to sell&nbsp;virus protections to make money.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We do not send unsolicited email messages or make unsolicited phone calls to&nbsp;fix your computer. If you receive an unsolicited email message or phone call that purports to be from Microsoft and requests that you send personal information or click links,
<b>delete the message or hang up the phone</b>. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>How do they get your information?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>They get your contact details by <b>spamming your Email address</b>. Ensure that you are resetting all your email passwords to very strong Password (includes Alpha numeric’s)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Use strong passwords and keep them secret</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Strong passwords are at least 14 characters long and include a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. Find out how to create them.</span><span>
</span></li><li><span>Don't share passwords with anyone. </span></li><li><span>Don’t use the same password on all sites. If it is stolen, all the information it protects is at risk.</span><span>
</span></li><li><span>Create different strong passwords for the router and the wireless key of your wireless connection at home. Find out how from the company that provides your router.</span>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Update software regularly</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Cybercriminals are endlessly inventive in their efforts to exploit vulnerabilities in software, and many software companies work tirelessly to combat these threats. That is why you should:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Regularly install updates for all your software—antivirus and antispyware programs, browsers (like Windows Internet Explorer), operating systems (like Windows), and word processing and other programs.</span><span>
</span></li><li><span>Subscribe to automatic software updates whenever they are offered—for example, you can
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=148275" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">automatically update all Microsoft software</a>.</span><span>
</span></li><li><span>Uninstall software that you don't use. You can remove it using Windows Control Panel.</span>
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Cybercriminals often use the names of well-known companies, like ours, in their scams. They think it will convince you to give them money or your personal information. While they usually use email to trick you, they sometimes use the telephone, instead</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Common scams</span></b><span> that use the Microsoft name</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Someone from "Microsoft Tech Support" calls to fix your computer </span>
</li><li><span>"You have won the Microsoft Lottery" </span></li><li><span>Microsoft "requires credit card information to validate your copy of Windows"
</span></li><li><span>"Microsoft" sends unsolicited email messages with attached security updates.</span>
</li></ul>

<h2>            Blue screen of death after April 2018 &#40;and 8th May 2018&#41; update</h2>
                    <p>I have been having frequent computer crashes because of the buggy updates Microsoft has released. Nothing has been fixed in the May 8th 2018 update. I'm not even using any strenuous programmes... I'm just watching youtube, or watching amazon prime, or twitch,
 or browsing, or using WhatsApp web, or reading on Adobe Reader, or writing on MS Word and it just crashes. I have done every fix known to man e.g. hard resets, components tests, troubleshooting with F11 bootup, command prompt actions like wmic recoveros set
 AutoReboot=False, Win+V key during startup, Win+B key to reinstall my BIOS, using Windows Update assistant to install a clean version of Win 10, updated all my drivers from Intel, NVIDIA and HP AND I HAVE DONE A FACTORY RESET AND IT STILL BLUE SCREENS AFTER
 THE LATEST WINDOWS UPDATES.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has been an immensely frustrating experience and this is on my BRAND NEW HP ENVY Laptop 13-ad014na. I spent over £1000 on this laptop and it was running beautifully until Windows comes in with KNOWN buggy updates to mess everything up!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is proof. All of my blue screens since I updated to the April 2018 Win update:</p>

<h2>            Cross next to friends name in party chat&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've posted about this before and still have this issue. I cannot chat to one particular friend in an xbox party chat. e.g If i start a party and this particular friend joins then he will have a white 'X' next to his name and we cannot communicate. and if
 he starts the party i have the 'X' next to my name. If another friend joins the party then whoever has started the party can communicate with him but the player with the 'X' cannot talk to either player still! We both have open NAT types and have tried doing
 a hard restart of our system and clearing cache and also alternate MAC address but still nothing changes. This seems to have happened since the update where they added the 'X' feature to the party chat as it was completely fine before.</p>
<p>Any help please?????</p>

<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p>This usually means a network issue with one of the players. I would check the following link, as it has a lot of helpful tips on how to discover where the issue lies:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/nat-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>If none of that works, let us know and we'll continue from there :)</p>

<p>Xbox live Family pack is more trouble than it's worth. Have had this since January, since then two of the accounts have been hacked on call of duty world at war leaving us with a negative ranking so we can't play online. Microsoft don't appear to be able
 to support the Family Pack as they don't know themselves. Now my main account has been suspended for Marketplace Theft although all of my downloads are legitimate and points have been purchased from Play.com or Ebay. Microsoft charge for Xbox Live which you
 would think would be a good service but their support is useless and then they give you two fingers when asking for support, also accused of Theft of What?!?!</p>
<p>I would NEVER advise anyone to purchase the family pack, it may appear to be value for money but it's far too restrictive and Microsoft can't / won't help when you have problems.

<p>How do you know you are playing on a Modded lobby until it's too late? </p>
<p>When our accounts were hacked the game started and writing started scrolling down the screen. We couldn't exit the game so had to switch the Xbox off. WShen switching it back on the Call of Duty rank was at -10000000 so we couldn't play online. We called
 Microsoft to explain what had happened and then the endless loop started, Microsoft said it's an Activision problem as they hold the Call of Duty accounts, Activision said that they only market the game so it's a Treyarch problem, Treyarch said that there
 is nothing they can do. So then started the Family pack issues as the account which was hacked was the Family Pack Primary Account - two months later and having to remove Xbox dashboard updates and user accounts several times under the instruction of Microsoft
 support we wer able to play online again. Now the main account has been suspended and according to Xbox Support today the account may have been suspended due to all of the removeal of updates and reinstall etc etc. So you talk about personal choices - 9 months
 of owning an Xbox - 2 accounts been hacked - loads of problems with Xbox Live Family Pack and rewarded with a permanant suspension for doing what Xbox support tells you to do. looks like my choice will be going to Playstation, at least they are open and honest
 when they have problems, Microsoft are totally disengaged with their customers, users have been complaing about being hacked for months and Microsoft has sat back and rode the money cow.</p>

            <p>As has been mentioned on the boards before, the moment you see that you are in a modded lobby (ie. people flying/running or shooting through walls/etc) immediately back out and restart your console. &nbsp;Continuing to play will result in a ban as the PET team has taken a less lenient stance on them.</p>
<p />
<p>An xbox live account cannot be hacked. &nbsp;Only phished. &nbsp;This means that at some point the owner of the account gave out details about the account that allowed someone else to get access (ie. information about the account holder or attempted to buy their way into prestige/modded lobbies).&nbsp; It has nothing to do with the family pack itself as I said earlier.&nbsp; Only personal choices of the account holders.&nbsp; Xbox live does not govern what they choose to do or not do.</p>
<p />
<p>Even though you say you are going to PS3 (which has had far more problems with their service itself getting hacked) perhaps you should read some of the links <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-ca/xbox-live/how-to/online-safety/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> about account safety and security for future reference.</p>

<p>Thanks for your prompt reply, however the details you have described are not as i have experienced. I couldn't back out of the lobby, i couldn't do anything other than switch the console off with the button on the front. When switching back on (after disconnecting
 the power for 60 seconds) and re-starting the game i was left with a negative ranking. This has heppend on two different consoles and gamertags, we have been forced to sell Call of Duty World at War due to it being so insecure.
</p>
<p>Weather the account was Phised or Hacked (not sure what the difference is) teh fact is that we could no longer play that game online. This is what caused the problems with the Family Pack, maybe it is an unrelated cause but this is the fact of what happened.
 We have NEVER and would never give account details out to anyone, the second time we were hacked / phised one of the players asked if we were English, i said yes, they replied we don't like English and that was it, negative ranking. You keep mentioning personal
 choices, i don't see what choice i have had? Once realising what was happening it was too late. I'm not a stupid teenager, i'm over 40 and have a very good career with a multinational company.
</p>
<p>As i've also said i have made Microsoft aware of the full details of what happened on both occassions. You also mention PS3, yes they have had problems and they have been open and honest about thoise problems. I can't say the same for Microsoft in the least.
 In the miltinational company i work for Customer service is an extremly high priority as we understand that unhappy customers = reduction in orders. In todays climate i would have thought Microsoft would at lest listen to their customers problems. It's all
 very well posting things on a forum, i have never used a forum before as i think any company should engage in their customers needs, this is a way of hiding from the problems. Although you say what i have experienced couldn't happen i do know of other people
 who this has happened to, maybe Microsoft should spend some time trying to engage with their customers, they may learn something.</p>

<p>First of all, "hacking" can be used to describe any activity who's express purpose is to gain unauthorized access to any type of computer system. "Phishing" which certainly falls under this category, is referred to as such because it's a very unfocused and
 widespread attempt to solicit information from large groups of people, casting a large net so to speak. &nbsp;What you are describing would be more akin to Social Engineering (essentially scamming). In any case, semantics aside, CouthGolf's point was that the account
 that was hacked (yes "hacked", phishing is still hacking) was the Primary Account &nbsp;for the Family Pack which essentially meant that they could no longer remove their other accounts from the Family. This is a true, verifiable and absolutely ridiculous fact
 that unfortunately is par for the course.</p>

<p>Was arguing over the definition of "hacking" so vitally important that you had to resurrect a thread from September? There is much more recent thread you could have posted this rant under:

            <p>I am having a similar issue.&nbsp; I performed an OEM installation of Windows 8.1 from the Microsoft dvd disc.&nbsp; Device Manager reports the card reader as "Unknown USB Device (Device Descriptor Request Failed)."&nbsp; This same card reader works fine in another computer
 running Windows 7. </p>
<p>***update***</p>
<p>The original card&nbsp;reader had been working fine, but an end-user must have used too much force when inserting a memory card and damaged the connector.&nbsp; I had a 2nd card reader laying around and swapped them, resulting in the error message above.&nbsp; Upon further
 investigation the 2nd reader was missing a pin on&nbsp;the usb header located on the circuit board.&nbsp; A standard usb header has 10 pins (9 + 1 blank), but the malfunctioning unit only had 8 pins.&nbsp; I installed a 3rd card reader and it is working properly.&nbsp;

 a single problem with any of them.&nbsp; The USB port on the reader still works fine but no SD card I put in it is recognized and I get an error<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">every time I boot&nbsp;
</span></strong>(annoying!) that says 'unrecognized USB device."&nbsp; Has anyone found either a driver or another &lt;$20 card reader that works with Windows 8.1?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>The above 2 solutions (posted by Mr. Manjhi) did not work for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Win 10 Pro upgraded from Win 7 Pro. Permissions were fine after upgrade for a few days.... I could save photos just as when I was on Win 7. Tonight, after an unknown system update, I noticed that my system login prompt was now set for my online login.
 Saving photos from FB did not work since. I set to the login back to my original local login but found that Win 10 was asking to set the password as if a local account had never existed before. Perhaps previous permissions were grandfathered over from Win
 7 but now have no means of management in Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having read up some in various forums, other reported that reverting back to Win 7 Pro would not remove this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[SOLUTION] I applied some rules I used to use administering domain controlled versions of Win XP. This should not need to be performed to resolve that which worked fine before upgrading an OS from the same developer
<em>but </em>it is what worked for me;&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Right click the&nbsp;<strong>Pictures</strong> folder (or whatever folder is not allowing access to save) and select
<strong>Properties</strong></p>
<p>- Select the <strong>Security</strong> tab</p>
<p>- Select <strong>HomeUsers </strong>(your-system-host-name\HomeUsers)... observe current permissions. You need to be able to
<em>write</em> in order to save pictures in the folder.</p>
<p>- Click<strong> Edit</strong></p>
<p>-&nbsp;Select&nbsp;<strong>HomeUsers&nbsp;</strong>(your-system-host-name\HomeUsers)</p>
<p>- Check the <em>Full control</em> box (or at the very least check <em>write</em> in addition to what's already set)</p>
<p>- Click OK on both windows. Permissions will set for that folder and all folders under it.</p>
<p>- Effectiveness is immediate without a reboot... I could now save from FB to anywhere in the pictures folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * &nbsp;This issue kept returning. The security settings kept reverting back to Read only.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*<strong> Update 31Aug15:</strong>&nbsp;* &nbsp;Happened on&nbsp;my laptop running Win 10 Pro and wifes laptop running&nbsp;</p>
<p>* * * * * * * * * * * * * * &nbsp; Win 10 standard. After a Windows 10 tech remoted into my system, a permanent</p>
<p>solution was found. I was able to replicate the folder permission anomaly while the tech was logged in.
</p>
<p>After trying various scans and reboots she did the procedure below that is remarkably simple to apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[FINAL SOLUTION] </p>
<p>- With folder properties window open (Picture, Documents, etc), go to the Security tab</p>
<p>- Click <strong>Edit...</strong></p>
<p>- Click <strong>Add...</strong></p>
<p>- Type in <strong>everyone</strong> and click Check Names</p>
<p>- Set <strong>Everyone</strong> to <em>Full control</em> and click apply. Click ok on a few resulting popups</p>
<p>This setting is a bit all encompassing but for home laptops not on a domain this should be fine. Settings enable saving files, photos, etc in the folder and sub-folders where the setting is was applied</p>

<li>
<p>If your PC is on a domain, your system administrator must reset your password.</p>

</li></ul>
<p>If you've tried these suggestions and still can't sign in:</p>

<p>If you have <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span>, you'll need to reinstall Windows. </p>

    <title>How to remove MBR master boot record from slave hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> binary helix  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to remove MBR master boot record from slave hard drive</h2>
                    I want to dual boot Windows 7 and Windows 8 on 2 separate hard drives.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I already have Windows 7 64-bit installed on an SSD, and want to install Windows 8 onto a slave hard drive that does not have an operating system installed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am aware that attempting to install Windows 8 onto the hard drive while the SSD is plugged in will likely result in the installer overwriting the Windows 7 boot record instead of installing to the HDD, resulting in the loss of Windows 7. I therefore
 went to unplug the SSD, and then attempted to install Windows 8 to a new NTFS partition on the HDD without the SSD being detected.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I received an error saying that Windows cannot be installed onto the HDD because there is an MBR table already present on the drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I initially installed Windows 7, I had trouble installing it to the SSD and may have tried installing it to the HDD as well (I don't remember anymore) - how do I remove whatever boot records exist on the HDD to enable me to install Windows 8 onto
 it?</div>
<div><br />
Just for clarification, the HDD has data on it only - there is currently no installed OS on the hard drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Paragonia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community and giving us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description, you are facing issues with installing Windows 8 onto a slave hard drive that does not have an operating system installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Booting from GPT (GUID Partition Table) is only supported for 64 bit editions of Windows 8 (and Windows 7) on UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) based
 systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Windows and GPT FAQ:</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg463525.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/gg463525.aspx</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>﻿</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your computer does not support UEFI, delete all the hard drives partitions and create a new partition (backup any data first):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>
</span></span></span>Boot from the <b>
Windows DVD</b> </p>
<p>
<span><span>b.</span></span>Click
<b>Install Now</b> </p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>
</span></span></span>At the setup screen, click
<b>Custom</b> (Advanced) 
</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.</span></span>Click
<b>Drive Options</b> </p>
<p>
<span><span>e.</span></span>Select the partition(s) you want to format</p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click Format - this will delete EVERYTHING on that partition
</p>
<p>
<span><span>g.<span>
</span></span></span>Create a new partition and select a partition to install Windows on.
</p>
<p>
<span><span>h.</span></span>Continue with
<b>install</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Make sure you backup all the data before installing Windows 8 onto a slave hard drive</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. For any further Windows related assistance, feel free to contact us and we will be happy to help.</p>
