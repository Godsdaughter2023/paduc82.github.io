<h2>            Deleted sharepoint group, but onenote notebooks are stil there.</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed that when i delete a sharepoint site through Office Admin Center - Groups, that the notebook regarding this sharepoint site does not get deleted.</p>
<p>Is there a way to use PowerShell to delete these notebooks?</p>
<p>I can't open them in the One note app either, it says that i don't have enough rights to open the notebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<p><span>Hi Rick,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>I would like to explain that based on your description, the notebook has been deleted.</p>
<p>As you opened the notebook on OneNote before, so it still list on More Notebooks, however you couldn't access the notebook.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If you want a completely fresh start, you can <a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/?nlp=1&amp;signup=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a new account</a>. This will give you a new outlook.com address and independent inbox and "From" address. This will be a new Microsoft Account and identity. If you close your old account, you would not be able to sign in to other Microsoft services you
 currently use. You'll have to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/How-to-sign-in-to-or-out-of-Outlook-com-e08eb8ac-ac27-49f4-a400-a47311e1ee7e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
sign out</a> before you can create a new account.</p>

create an alias</a>. This will give you an additional email address which uses the same inbox, contact list, and account settings as your primary email address. You can choose which email address you send mail from, and y<span>ou can sign in to your

<h2>            Bookings - multiple locations</h2>
                    <p>My office has multiple locations with different office hours.&nbsp; I can also meet clients at a location of their choice, like a coffee shop.&nbsp; Is there a way to edit availability by location? I know you can create multiple booking sites (from reading the forum),
 but then I wouldn't be able to send one link and let the clients choose their location.&nbsp; I know I can create difference services, and just title the service by the location.&nbsp; But I haven't found a way to edit the availability of just that service.&nbsp; I've been
 using Calendly, which allows you to edit the availability per event type (aka services on bookings), but I'd like to consolidate to one system.&nbsp; Hopefully this can be resolved.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 removes contacts inside groups in 950XL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> levitator  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 removes contacts inside groups in 950XL</h2>
                    <p>It has happend already twice that contact information is gone inside all groups that I've created in my 950XL. Both times the phone has had the current sw versions, now it is 10.0.14393.321. The first time the contacts were lost was with the previous sw
 version. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I can re-add the contacts, this is annoying since I have a fair amount of groups.&nbsp;There doesn't even seem to be any clear restore to this. Per discussions I've found around this issus, even doing a factory reset won't help to recover the contacts
 automatically but manual typing is the only way to go.</p>

<h2>            How do I get back to Windows 8.1  , I&#39;m done, that&#39;s it, I just cannot take this any longer</h2>
                    <p>I recently took my Surface Pro 3 and decided that, I could;t leave well enough alone. (Actually I really do NOT care for Window 8.1) so I became a Windows Insider. &nbsp;Since then I have perched 3 separate virus programs and today I reached the end of my rope
 when I told MAfee that I was running windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to download an update, I'm stuck at a completely buggered 10122 build with a constant &nbsp;"can't find or is corrupted SysMenu.dll file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what AV I realtime protection is running I can not rid myself of some virus that seems to be attached to i_Camers &nbsp;or cameras or whatever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bottom line is, is there a way to FACTORY RESET my surface Pro 3 ? &nbsp; I did not receive any DVD or CD's with the system so I have to clue how to rid myself of this windows 10, I'll just keep my Sp3 off to the side until there is a Ga release. Since it
 is now brick as far as I'm concerned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>HO do I rest my machine NADA, ZIP, NOTHING and get windows 8.1 on there. I've reading conflicting reviews of whether or not I can do that. &nbsp;Can someone PLEASE PLEASE help me.</p>

            Did you read what to do before installing Win10... My guess is no, if you had you would have a restore disc that you made before, now the only way is with a OS disk, good luck.

            <p>I have a Surface Pro 2. Great computer. Windows 8.1 is great for both Tablet mode and on the desktop with external 22" monitor and the Type Cover keyboard.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Do not confuse the Surface Pro's with Surface RT's. The RT is on a track by itself and is NOT comparable to the Pro.</p>

            I don't have the web site handy but if you try google "Windows 8.1 recovery disc" it might give reference to the microsoft page where you can download and make a&nbsp; recovery usb drive disc...I did a while back...have not needed it yet...and also make one
 from your own 8.1 system...I had to use 'that' once already on my other 8.1 when it crashed...worked great but lost all my files.*john<br />

<p>By default, the Disconnect button doesn't appear in the connectivity ballon. Fortunately there is a registry hack to change that. Learn how to

Something else to try is simply press the Red phone button for a few seconds.

    <title>SharePoint Site task questions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint Site task questions</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.</p>

<p>I'm trying to use the Tasks functionality of SharePoint Sites in our Office365 instance and am getting stuck on a few points. I would appreciate help with any and all of these things:</p>

<p>1. Can I add additional fields to the tasks? At minimum, I'd like to have a field for users to add comments about a task they are working on that remains unfinished. The only way I've found to do updates to tasks is to update the description, which is clunky.</p>

<p>2. Can I have a message thread that's attached to a specific task, such that multiple users can have dialog about the task? If so, being able to do this externally, via email, would be very handy. I've used Basecamp quite a bit, and it's useful to be able
 to carry on conversations back and forth via email from phones without having to log in to a system.</p>

<p>3. Can I have a task in Sites link to a task in Outlook, such that when I assign a task to a user, they would get an Task Request email sent to them? And, that updates to the task in Outlook would be reflected in the Site?</p>

<p>4. How can I expand the field length limitation for the description field in Site tasks? I was dismayed to learn today that the field length limitation is a mere 255 characters. If I can't have another field in the task for updates and we have to use the
 description field for all dialog about the task, we would have to constantly delete stuff from the task description just to have that dialog, which is totally unworkable.</p>

<p>5. Can I import a list of tasks from Excel? I haven't figured out a way to import tasks, so I'm having to copy/paste them from Excel.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Bingo,</p>
<p>1.You can edit the task list and add more fields</p>
<p>2. Not 100% sure on that to be honest</p>
<p>3. You can Connect the task list to Outlook and all the tasks will be there.</p>
<p>4. Change the description to a new field type (multiline)?</p>
<p>5. If you import an excel file it will create a new library.</p>
<p>I hope the above are useful to you.</p>

<p>Hi, Panos. Can you please provide more details on these things?</p>
<p>I figured out how to update my personal view to see more fields, but I don't seem to have the right access to make it a public view (I'll talk to our admin about that). I see the Task Name and Description are two different fields.
</p>
<p>As for #3, how?</p>
<p>As for #4, where do I go to do this?</p>
<p>As for #5, I'm not trying to import an Excel file as a file on the Site. That's easy enough. I'm trying to parse fields from a spreadsheet into the Task list. I'd guess it can't be readily done.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>hi mark,</p>
<p>i would like answer your questions or complete some information.</p>
<p>#1 yes, you can modify the view to let some default columns display. besides, you also can add some custom columns into the view based on your own requirement.<br />
to do that, go to the task-&gt;click <b>list </b>tab-&gt;<b>list settings</b>-&gt;<b>create column.
</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7cb04f86-57d9-4841-b668-0785aa87c862" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7cb04f86-57d9-4841-b668-0785aa87c862" /></a><br />

</b></p>
<p>#2 for this requirement, it is not feasible to add a live email as an attachment in the task. you may consider adding a saved email as an attachment to specific task.<br />
tick the task item-&gt;click <b>tasks</b> tab-&gt;<b>edit</b> item-&gt;<b>attach item</b>-&gt;<b>browse</b> the email as the attachment.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=8804104d-80d2-4e4e-b07d-85f356a789ae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d8804104d-80d2-4e4e-b07d-85f356a789ae" /></a><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=4f847872-c97c-4587-80a4-643298270379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d4f847872-c97c-4587-80a4-643298270379" /></a></p>
<p># 3 click list tab, you will see the connect to outlook button.</p>
<p>#4 the default description column is a <b>multiple lines of text&nbsp;</b>column. it can store as many as 63,999 characters. you also can create a custom multiple lines of test column as i mentioned before.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e3a4d836-f481-47a0-9d11-712b52ba28c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3de3a4d836-f481-47a0-9d11-712b52ba28c0" /></a></p>
<p>#5 it is not feasible using sharepoint online out-of-box solutions.</p>

<p>Hi Bingo, to make the view a defalt view you ll need to go to the same area you went to add more columns and at the very top of the page you should have a tick box asking if you would like to make this the default view. If not then as you said you ll need
 to speak to an admin or someone with higher access than yourself.</p>

<p>Hi, folks.</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback. I've sorted out most of this, except the part about having SP send out email alerts when there are updates to Tasks. I really like how this works in Basecamp, where activity in a Basecamp project is sent to users via email, and updates
 can be provided by an email reply. I'd like it so any time a task is updated, that it alerts everyone on the project, or at least everyone who can see the tasks. Basecamp tended to overwhelm inboxes, but too much information is much preferred over no information.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
        </p>

</p><p>Because hardware could be anything, this phone needs inspection. Therefore, please, bring your phone to your retailer. Your retailer sends this phone to a local but authorised repair facility. Looking at the second-hand market price for a Nokia Asha 501,
 you might face a complete financial loss â€“ even by just investing the time to bring/catch the phone. If you have to pay for the repair why-ever, the situation could be even worse. Did you consider to go for a new phone?</p>

<p>Give it a few full charge and discharge cycles straight out of the box. After this you can charge the phone anytime you want as necessary. It is a good idea to discharge until the phone says low battery once in a while, say every few weeks. Try not to let
 the phone cut out itself. It is ok to unplug your phone once the phone indicates the charging is complete.</p>

    <title>Create query to find most recent update record for each product - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mickman123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create query to find most recent update record for each product</h2>
                    <p>I am new to Microsoft Access and in a little over my head on this one. I have two tables product_information and product_updates. The product_information table holds all of the basic product information and the product_updates keeps a record for each time
 a product is updated. I want to create a query that will supply the most recent update for each record. I have looked at a lot of examples online, but can't get anything to work. The fields in the two tables that I want to include in the query are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Table 1 - "product_information"</p>
<p>product_name, received_date, region, product_filenumber, primary_product, primary_producttype, product_status</p>
<p>
</p><p>Table 2 - "product_updates"</p>
<p>product,name, update_date, update_type, update_description</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on this would be greatly appreciated. The more detail the better. I'm not the sharpest guy out there.</p>

<p>If you do it in 3 steps it's easier:</p>
<p>Create new query, select Updates table. Click the sigma button to turn it into a totals query. Select the Name field, and keep the Group By default; select the UpdateDate field and set to Max. Save as qryProducts_MaxDate</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then create a second query with Updates table and the new query. This allows you to pick up the entire row of data for the max row.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then a third query joining Products table with the second query to finish it all off.</p>

            Both are using the same email address?  If so, its not recommended as it will cause login problems. Add an outlook.com alias to the microsoft account and remove the address that is hosted on office 365. 
<br />
<br />You can add your hotmail account to Outlook as an account - auto account setup will properly configure it as an Exchange account. 
<br />
<br />If that is not what you are asking, please use something like @mydomain or @outlook.com in place of the email addresses so it makes more sense. 
<br />
<br />This is how I am reading it: 
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />I have microsoft account with user name @mydomain.com and using since many years. This is already enabled with Office home version but expired which I didn't even know.
<br />
<br />Just 2 days back, I subscribed for Office 365 Business and while subscribing it prompted me to create a domain id and i have created user name @mydomain.com

<p>If you are affected by a known bug in this build then you will need to wait until MS find a fix. In Fact you may have to wait until the next update. Don't try "fixes" as it may cause a problem in the long term.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wish MS would stick to keeping the Feedback Hub announcements up to date instead of using another location for info.</p>

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />Please, try to open any browser, then log in to <a href="https://onedrive.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com</a> if you got any error messages let me know, if you can allow to access to your account and works properly. Please, you can try the following troubleshoot below for your OneDrive Client: 
<br />
<br />1. Exit OneDrive (right click in the system tray)
<br />
<br />2. Go to Control Panel &gt; User Accounts &gt; Credential Manager
<br />
<br />3. Click on "Windows Credentials" (on the right)
<br />
<br />4. Choose the down arrow to the right of "OneDrive Cached Credential"
<br />
<br />5. Choose Edit, and enter your OneDrive (Microsoft Account) Username/Password.
<br />
<br />6. Go to the start menu, and launch "OneDrive" again
<br />
<br />This may restore your OneDrive without resetting your local copy.
<br />
<br />Alternatively, simply remove the "OneDrive Cached Credential" (there is an option to do so) and let OneDrive start over. The positive side is IF you wanted to move your OneDrive to another location, you'll have the opportunity to do so during the reset. Either way, you will NOT lose your online data.
<br /> 
<br />Please let me know if this helped and works.  
<br />
<br />Best Regards,
<br />
<br />Diego R.

            Let's try to re-install OneDrive: 
<br />
<br />Go to control panel--&gt;Programs and features--&gt;look up for Onedrive app and click uninstall 
<br />
<br />
<br />Next open a run command box by pressing the Windows Key + R on your keyboard
<br />
<br />type Regedit.exe into the run command box
<br />
<br />Go to RegEdit on this path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive 
<br />
<br />Delete all OneDrive folders and keys
<br />
<br />After that restart the pc and install OneDrive from the following link: 
<br />
<br />Now restart the Pc and download and install Onedrive latest version from this link:

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I followed the instructions to reinstall OneDrive.&nbsp; For two days it would not sign in, and the error said to check my internet connection, which was not 100 percent strength but was sufficient to use for other sites and media.&nbsp; Today OneDrive is syncing,
 but I am confused why it is off and on, and not steady.&nbsp; If you know some other way of troubleshooting&nbsp; please let me know, if not I guess the problem is fixed for now.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

    <title>Office for Mac 2016 Autoupdate Not Working Properly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skesler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office for Mac 2016 Autoupdate Not Working Properly</h2>
                    <p>This is the second Office update in a row that has caused me the same problem. &nbsp;My apps are at v. 15.13.1. &nbsp;I get an update notice to install v. 15.14.0. &nbsp;I click Install and the process successfully downloads and installs the apps--or at least appears to.
 &nbsp;However, when the update is finished and autoupdate checks for updates, it finds and offers the same version. &nbsp;I have re-started my MacBook and checked the version number and then run the process again. &nbsp;However, I get the same results. &nbsp;I remember a helpful
 reply to the problem I had going to v. 15.13.1, but I can't remember what was recommended as a fix.</p>
<p>Why is this such an issue? &nbsp;For now, to avoid getting offered the update again, I'll put autoupdate in manual mode.</p>
<p>Should I just download the updates per the links offered in the KB article?</p>

            <p>There is an issue with the download server. I had to run this update three times before I got it all. They all opened to correct version after they were finally downloaded and installed. I tried them all and from what I could see they open a few seconds
 faster opening, but that might because they may have removed the old versions and re-installed new versions. &nbsp;I don't know, who knows, they may have even decided to ditch the code they use test for defects to upload.&nbsp;</p>

            Unfortunately, Phillip, the problem with the download server must still not be fixed. &nbsp;Yesterday, I downloaded and installed (that is, I performed the procedure) three times and my apps are still at 15.13.1. &nbsp;I have given up and have just changed my Auto
 Update preference to manual. &nbsp;As much work as Microsoft has obviously lavished on the Mac Office apps, it is difficult for me to believe that such a major issue continues unresolved.

            <p>Just been speaking to the tech people who admitted there has been a problem and that "eventually" it will be OK. Whether that "eventually" is a month or a day - they cannot say. Meanwhile we are reduced to having to download standalone versions of each of
 the pieces in the suite and expend so much time waiting for downloads then opening and installing each of them. It feels like computing did in the dark ages when I got my first personal computer in 1990</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am reminded again what a rubbish way they have of understanding needs from the consumer/operator side of things. The pathways I went through and the people I spoke to are so convoluted, they have no idea of what it feels like for us who simply want to
 get on with downloading/updating/using the blessed software.</p>

            I finally found the source of my problem. &nbsp;I had renamed my Office apps in the Application folder by deleting "Microsoft" from their names. &nbsp;So, what apparently happened is the the update installed the 15.14 apps as new apps rather than as updates to my
 existing apps. &nbsp;I had 2 sets of apps in my Application folder: &nbsp;one with "Microsoft" in the name and one without. &nbsp;I deleted the ones without, and am now left with only the 15.14 versions. &nbsp;Now, when I run Microsoft update, I am told no updates are available.
 &nbsp;So, lesson learned. &nbsp;At least until Microsoft addresses the underlying issue, I will not rename my Office apps.

            At first i didn't think this was relevant but turns out it was. &nbsp;i had moved all the .app files to a folder i created (called Microsoft Office 365, not that it's relevant), so when i updated, as with @skesler a new set of apps were installed in the Applications
 folder. &nbsp;what also drove me nuts was that the shortcuts on my dock pointed to the old apps and thus when i used them i was still opening the old versions. &nbsp;once i dragged that Microsoft Office 365 folder to the trash, Microsoft AutoUpdate stopped telling me
 i needed updates, i created new shortcuts on my dock, and all is good.

<h2>            outlook is a mess</h2>
                    <p>I recently changed one of my email addresses to IMAP and in the process created a mess. Not only did it create a duplicate of the 8k+ emails I had stored but now I also have duplicate calendars and tasks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first question is about personal folders and proper setup in the left navigation bar. I currently have 5 emails plus personal folders. Four are IMAP, 1 is an Exchange account. How does personal folders fit into this? If it doesn't, can it be deleted without
 causing more trouble ... especially since it is the default data file. Or should all the emails be within personal folders? I would like to get a handle on how this should look. If I don't delete personal folders I can delete the duplicate calendar but not
 sure where to find the duplicate tasks. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing I noticed is that each of the 5 have their own PST file. Is that correct or should they be merged? If merged, how do I do that?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like I went from having a nice, neat - and manageable - email reader and now it's all over the place. If you've got some tips on how to organize this for better management please send some links.

<br />The other thing I noticed is that each of the 5 have their own PST file. Is that correct or should they be merged? If merged, how do I do that?
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Just for sake of accuracy, am assuming what you meant to write was "......have their own OST file.....". Imap &amp; Exchange accounts don't use pst files
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />I recently changed one of my email addresses to IMAP and in the process created a mess. Not only did it create a duplicate of the 8k+ emails I had stored but now I also have duplicate calendars and tasks.
<br />
<br />My first question is about personal folders and proper setup in the left navigation bar. I currently have 5 emails plus personal folders. Four are IMAP, 1 is an Exchange account.
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />A little confused about what the actual question/issue is given on the one hand you state that you recently changed an account to IMAP but state that you have 4 IMAP and one EX account.........
<br />
<br />In short, each IMAP and EX account will have it's own (ost) data file. The EX account will have a complete set of folders including contact/calender folders. Whether or not any of the IMAP folder trees contain contact/calendar folders depends on whether the associated ost file for the account has been set as the default data file for the profile (not recommended).
<br />
<br />Going back to changing an account from POP to IMAP. &lt;IF&gt; you removed the POP email account from the profile, it would NOT have removed the PST file that appears in the Outlook Nav pane so ignoring all the other accounts for a moment, in this scenario you would have ended up with 2 folder trees in the Outlook Nav Pane if you didn't remove the PST file.
<br />
<br />To narrow things down 
<br />
<br />#1 - Just to confirm again, you only have 5 email accounts configured at this point correct? (4 IMAP and 1 EX)
<br />#2 - How many data files are currently configured in the profile? 
<br />Go to Outlook menu --&gt; File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab
<br />#3 - Which of those data files is configured as the "default data file"? (this file will contain the default contact/calendar folders for the profile)
<br />
<br />Lastly, with IMAP and EX accounts, you cannot merge everything into a single data file (Nav Pane folder tree).

<p>#1 I have 8 email accounts (3 IMAP, 4 POP (forgot about these others) and 1 EX). The one I recently switched over to IMAP is the main business account. This is the one that's a mess. 3 of the POP accounts are still in personal folders. The other POP account
 is a client account with its own PST.</p>
<p>#2 Data files: 2 PST (personal folders and client acct), 4 OST (business, personal, EX and icloud) , 1 internet calendar (PST), 1 icloud aplzod</p>
<p>#3 personal folders is the default data file</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each account has its own folder tree except the business account has an additional tree in the inbox that also contains drafts, sent, trash, deleted messages, junk, notes, spam. I'm assuming this came with the data file when I converted it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is data in the drafts, sent (although this is no longer current), trash. Junk, notes and spam are empty. Which ones are the ones that I should be using and how do I merge and/or clean them without creating duplicates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sent items folder outside of the inbox has columns for to, subject, received and size. Shouldn't received be sent?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can the business account be the one that shows when the app is launched? Currently it's personal folders which is usually empty. Business is the default send-from account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help on this. I really need to understand what folders to use and how to clean this up.

<p>A pop mail account uses a set of Personal folders and unless you modified the settings each pop account would have its own folder set including contacts/calendar.</p>
<p>The exchange mail account will have its own ost data folder set, usually named as per the mail address</p>
<p>If you added an IMAP account, that had previously been pop, then that too would have its own folder set again normally named as per the mail address, but its Calendar/Contacts/Tasks would still be contained in a pst data file</p>
<p>Within Outlook, File&gt;Account Settings&gt;Email Tab......... you can set the default mail a/c in this window</p>
<p>The IMAP folder set, depending on the provider, would have at least Inbox/Sent/Drafts/Trash</p>

    <title>Invalid Product Key - Office 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sc2919  say:</h3>
<h2>            Invalid Product Key - Office 2010</h2>
                    <p>I purchased this product in 2010.&nbsp; The software came with a 3 User License.&nbsp; In the 7 years that I have owned it I have installed it on 2 home computers but have also had to reinstall it on 2 occasions when replacing retired computers with new.&nbsp; Each time
 a computer was retired I uninstalled it from the old computer and installed it onto the new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, this week I installed&nbsp;Office on a new replacement computer, spent hours downloading updates and when I attempted to use the product I was prompted to activate.&nbsp; During the activation process I received a Invalid Product Key message.&nbsp; I contacted Microsoft.&nbsp;
 The support analyst said the Key was no longer valid because it had been installed to many times.&nbsp; I have to admit that it has been installed more that 3 times but it has never been actively installed on more than 2 computers at one time.&nbsp; The support analyst
 also proceeded to lecture me that the product is "old, outdated, and the new Office is much better".&nbsp; I thought I was contacting support not sales!&nbsp; As a 30 year&nbsp; IT professional (now retired)&nbsp;I am well aware of the advantages of new technology but have neither
 the need or the funds to purchase an upgrade.&nbsp; I would simply like to continue to use the product that I paid for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The support analyst also forwarded my call to someone else but he had the same story line, too many installs and need to buy new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to register a formal complaint with Microsoft?&nbsp; Right not I feel like Microsoft has breached my License agreement because they have no process in place&nbsp;to truly control and account for concurrent installations.</p>

<p>Hi SC</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go back to Microsoft.&nbsp; They have the ability to deactivate the old installations, just as they are doing to you right now.&nbsp; Not sure where you live but I live in the UK.&nbsp; I would send then a 'letter before claim' and if I did not get an adequate response
 I would issue a claim in the small claims court. </p>

<p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply and suggestion!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I live in the state of Virginia, in the Good&nbsp;Old USA.&nbsp; Since MSDOS, I have had to contact Microsoft on thousands of occasions as an IT Professional.&nbsp; I have never until yesterday been led to believe&nbsp;that I was the problem, I had done something wrong when
 contacting technical support.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a one way scripted response to my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if a letter is the resolve as I have a distinct opinion that I will be ignored.&nbsp; I certainly don't want to have to go through the pains of having to file a small claims case.&nbsp; All I want is for Microsoft to resolve this&nbsp;problem.&nbsp; Office is installed
 on the computer that I am typing on right now.&nbsp; Office is installed on the new computer that I commissioned over this past weekend but was unable to activate.&nbsp; That's it, their are no other computers under my control/knowledge that use my 3 license Product
 Key&nbsp;legally.&nbsp; I would hope that Microsoft could provide a MAC address for&nbsp;any offending PC that uses the Key but according to support that is not possible so to simply say "it has been installed too many times" is completely unreasonable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Microsoft abandoned the transfer of software from old computer to new in Windows 10 they recommended the purchase of LapLink to perform the process.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; LapLink also indicates that the product key for software may be needed for activation on
 the new computer which could result&nbsp;in the same invalid Product Key issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure how to resolve but I do know that I have not breached.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>You did not indicate that you were on Windows 10.&nbsp; You may already know and have used it but just in case you are not aware there is a 'Contact Support' App on Windows 10, which can easily be accessed by typing 'Contact Support' in the search box. If this
 information was of no use to you, it may be of interest to others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re: the Letter Before Claim' here in the UK it a device that may be used to force people to take the matter of complaint&nbsp;seriously.&nbsp; The reason being is that it costs very little to serve the claim and costs the defendant a lot of money in legal fees to
 defend, where as the claimant, as a Litigant in Person cost very little as even if the claim is lost the defendant cannot claim for expenses.&nbsp; Cash always concentrates the mind.&nbsp; This webpage gives you addresses and telephone numbers for Microsoft USA:

<p>Ron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to thank you for your assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read both of your replies.&nbsp; I when through the "Contact Support" process and it said that the Product Key has been blocked and cited link for assistance to resolve the problem.&nbsp; This link here: &nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Your-Office-product-key-is-blocked-3503ede3-9f14-4490-9a98-da887c6f454a?wt.mc_id=LC_Chatbot_Pkey_Blockedkey&amp;ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not helpful as it also wanted to sell me either a new version of Office or a Product Key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also read through the case in the UK.&nbsp; As you pointed out it was handled in a very different manner.&nbsp; I could relate to the user that indicated that they had "spoken to someone whose English isn't great".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will try one of the number later today and update this thread but would rather correspond via email or chat so that I have an electronic copy of the conversation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your assistance!</p>

<p>I did get into a chat session due to Contact Support not being able to resolve the problem.&nbsp; The chat Agent looked up the Product and said "I have checked with the product key which is of Office 2010 Professional Plus and this key is blocked due to pirated
 reason as the activation limit has been exceeded. "</p>
<p>
</p><p>The agent also expressed that "This is the MSDN product key.&nbsp; Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) subscription offers product keys for organizations/subscribers. It means that you have been sold a product key that was specifically issued [to an organization
 that subscribed to a special Microsoft development program] with the constraint that it was not for resale."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if that is correct or not but the agent told me to submit a CFR report.&nbsp; I have completed the CFR and now I am required to send Microsoft what I have in the mail.&nbsp; I assume I will get something back but really not sure at this point??????????</p>

<p>Ron,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's my issue with completing the CFR.&nbsp; I don't believe it is counterfeit.&nbsp; The product I purchased in 2010 was a complete, unsealed, retail package.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am a member of the MSDN and have been offered products but have never taken advantage of it.&nbsp; The chat
 agent said it was a MSDN "Product Key", which&nbsp;would require a download to install, but what I received was not just a "Product Key" but a complete retail package.&nbsp; What I want to believe is what I was told initially, that it has been installed too many times
 but that their is no accountability for concurrent installs and that no violation on my part has been committed.&nbsp; I also received 3 different answers from 3 different agents as to what the problem is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs a process to account for uninstalls as well as installs.&nbsp; However, as we all know their are times when uninstalls are not possible due to hardware failures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I guess I have gotten my monies worth through the years for Office but it's the hours of updates to the 7 year old product that had too be installed only to then be notified of the issue.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The widgets on the main home screen, ie the box you can amend via 'Add Content' with the contacts/calender/mail/camera or whatever ppl want to put there, that surely should shortcut to that partic application? I have the above 4 shortcuts in a horz line
 across screen but cant access them indiv.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just get the option 'Settings/Remove/Change wallpaper' when I touch the box, I get the same kinda problem with the Favourite Contacts box, I cant quickly call or text anyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I must be something really stupidly wrong but it took so long to get the N97 to sync with Outlook properly that I'm getting frustrated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be really appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Albert, Gina and Nathan,</p>
<p>I was using an Access 2007 database so used another machine (the third :&gt;( ) and built a new database in Access 2010.&nbsp; I had the same problem.&nbsp; In all of these cases so far I have used a generated form and none of the controls I selected turned on the Quick
 Styles button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because a few replies mentioned a command button as one of the controls and I've been using generated forms that don't have one for testing, I decided to add one to my form.&nbsp; Voila, the Quick Styles button and Change Shape buttons become active when the
 command button is selected.&nbsp; I've looked everywhere I could think of trying to find details on using Quick Styles and which controls it should/does work on to no avail.&nbsp; It looks like it might only work on command buttons.&nbsp; Now I feel pretty dumb... can any
 of you point me to some documentation where these new buttons&nbsp;are described?</p>
<p>Thanks to all for your collective help and solution,</p>
<p>Bob</p>

<p><span>If still using Java suggest you either remove it (recommended) or update Java to the latest version.&nbsp; If you wish to keep Java be sure you remove any old versions of Java.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Empty temporary internet files, reboot, manually update your installed antimalware program and run a Quick Scan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow <b>all</b> steps in this free removal guide from Malwaretips.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whatever malware remains after using AdwCleaner and JRT should be removed by using Malwarebytes Free and Hitman Pro:

<p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 Business subscription doesn't support to configure email notification settings for OneNote. To use this feature, you need to subscribe extra Exchange Online subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sky</p>
