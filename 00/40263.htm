<h2>            Adding new events to Calendar</h2>
                    <p>My calendar in Windows 10 won't allow me to add new items. The "New Event" text is bright blue, but does nothing when I click on it, or on the "+" beside it. In addition, all my past events from Windows 8.1 do not appear on the calendar. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to Outlook online, I can see my past events, I can create new events, but these events do not appear on my "calendar" application. Is there any way to get my Calendar app to show this info?</p>

    <title>I am a programmer and have administrator privileges on my Win 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johndarnell  say:</h3>
<h2>            I am a programmer and have administrator privileges on my Win 7 machine.  Why can I not modify some files &#40;including batch files&#41; on my box&#63;</h2>
                    I attempted to modify a batch file in a folder that was not in the Windows folder or any subfolders of the Windows folder.&nbsp; When I attempted to save the batch file, I was informed that the file was in use by someone else (there was no one else).&nbsp; I copied
 the file and tried the same exercise and got the same result.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Here is a precise series of steps I took to try to get my purposes accomplished.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I opened the file up in UltraEditStudio.&nbsp; File path is C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Adobe InDesign CC SDK\devtools\sdktools\dollyxs\DollyXs.bat.&nbsp; II am able to write to other portions of this SDK tree, FYI.<br />
I made a very small change.<br />
I attempted to save the file using the same path.<br />
<br />
I received this error message:&nbsp; "File/Device may be readonly, or open for write by another application.&nbsp; Use 'Save As' as a different name."<br />
<br />
I attempted to save the file under a different name in the same location and received the following message:&nbsp;
<br />
"C:\Program Files (x86)\...\DollyXSc.bat<br />
You don't have permission to save in this location.&nbsp; Contact the administrators to obtain permission.&nbsp; Would you like to save to the &lt;&lt;Users folder&gt;&gt; instead?"<br />
<br />
I clicked no and clicked down a folder so that I was able to check readwrite permission.&nbsp; Permission was set at readonly.<br />
I unclicked that box, clicked Apply and received&nbsp; a requrest for confirmation.&nbsp; When I clicked the OK button a second dialog appeared informing me that "You will need to provider administrator permission to change these attributes.&nbsp; Click continue to complete
 this operation."<br />
<br />
I clicked "Continue" and the screen made noises like it was changing things.<br />
I closed the Properties dialog and opened it back up and the readonly checkbox was rechecked.<br />
<br />
I double-checked my account privilege level and I am very definitely included in the administrators group and the description of the administrators group goes something along the lines of, "the administrator has full access...." and yet I am unable to change
 one small batch file or its clone--among all sorts of other things.<br />
<br />
On top of that there are only two accounts on my computer--mine and one called "JBGoode" which is set up by the techs so that they can get into the machine whenever they need to.&nbsp; There is no Admin account, or anything similar.<br />
<br />
BTW, this is not the first Win7 box upon which I have had this problem.&nbsp; As a programmer I ABSOLUTELY NEED to be able to control my box down to the rules governing the behavior of the OS.&nbsp; Why do I not have that control and how can I get it?&nbsp; More importantly,
 how can I make a file that is readonly (or appears to be readonly) read-write?&nbsp; Ditto for a folder?<br />

            Standard UAC stuff. You have three choices:
<div>
<ul>
<li>Store your script in a non-system folder, e.g. C:\Scripts.</li><li>Open your script editor by right-clicking it, then left-clicking "Run as administrator".</li><li>Turn off UAC (not recommended).</li></ul>

            First of all, thanks Oberwald.&nbsp; I appreciate your time and effort in responding to this forum request for information.&nbsp; I want to make just two points and they are NOT aimed at you, but at the universe in general and Microsoft in particular:<br />
<br />
1.)&nbsp; I do have a second Win7 box and it does allow me to write to the root.&nbsp; UAC is not turned off on that machine (at least I have not turned it off).&nbsp; If it is UAC preventing the action and something that ought to be maniuplatible, why the difference between
 the two boxes?<br />
<br />
2.)&nbsp; Why does Microsoft say in its documentation that providing the user with Administrator level access to the machine gives the individual full access when it obviously does not.<br />
<br />
The last question may be classified with such questions as "why is water wet" or "why is the sky blue?"&nbsp; I recognize that fact and really do not expect to receive any answer, but the first question is an honest one and I would appreciate any further illucidation
 available.<br />
<br />
R,<br />
John<br />

<div>-&gt; I believe it when I see it. I have never seen a Windows 7 machine that had UAC at the default level and that let administrators create

<div><i>2.)&nbsp; Why does Microsoft say in its documentation that providing the user with Administrator level access to the machine gives the individual full access when it obviously does not.</i></div>
<div>-&gt; Because lots of Windows users were caught by malicious software doing bad things behind their backs. If some software wants to perform sensitive actions then UAC requires your
<b>explicit </b>rather than <b>implied</b>&nbsp;approval.</div>

Thank you Oberwald for calling me a liar.&nbsp; I attempted to be gracious to you, I guess your Momma never taught you to be gracious in return.&nbsp; And since you are not a resident of Brookfield, MO, you certainly don't have to worry about being proved an idiot.&nbsp;

<br />
The answer to you question is that at the command prompt I executed a very simple&nbsp; command at the root level on both computers. The command was "dir &gt; file."&nbsp; On the HP box (the newer box) I received a "acess denied" response.&nbsp; On the second box, (Bootcamp
 using Win7) the command created a small file with the root folder contents saved therein.<br />
<div><br />
<div><i>2.)&nbsp; Why does Microsoft say in its documentation that providing the user with Administrator level access to the machine gives the individual full access when it obviously does not.</i></div>
<div>-&gt; Because lots of Windows users were caught by malicious software doing bad things behind their backs. If some software wants to perform sensitive actions then UAC requires your
<b>explicit </b>rather than <b>implied</b>&nbsp;approval.<br />
<br />
I see.&nbsp; Microsoft provides faulty documentation to customers because some bad guys somewhere write malware and distribute it to unsuspecting customers.&nbsp; That certainly does seem to be a straightforward way of handling the problem.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<b>Read the question again, buddy.</b>&nbsp; I was not asking why Microsoft rewrote the code to disallow some behavior, I was asking about the documentation, which in every and any case should always be written correctly, from the abbreviated tool tip that appears
 on the screen, to the stuff you read in the Help window that Microsoft provides on request.<br />
<br />
And I can see that this is developing into a nice little flame war such as those that used to occur regularly in the late eighties and early nineties.&nbsp; So let's both go our own ways and let the matter drop.&nbsp; You think I'm an idiot and I think you have the manners
 of an untrained housecat.&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp; I appreciate your attention but I don't need any more of it.&nbsp; Go find someone else to "help."<br />
<br />
I would rather buy a Mac than submit myself to your kind of abuse.&nbsp; <b>And I hate Macs.</b><br />
&nbsp; <br />
Moderator, if you won't let this message go through then at least let Mr. Oberwald know how helpful he is.&nbsp; Something about snowballs and the flaming nether region and the length of time it will be comes to mind when I think of when I will post my next request
 for help to this forum, and it will be because of his Philistine manners.&nbsp; <br />

            In Australia we use the phrase "he wears a chip on his shoulder" when someone feels insulted the very moment someone disagrees with him. I never called you a liar - I simply said that I believe it when I see it. I am a skeptic - I want to see the evidence.
 I have responded to countless posts whose authors made some extraordinary claim, only to find that the erred in their observation or misinterpreted the results.
<div><br />
<div>Here is the evidence that would go a long way towards convincing me that your claim is correct:</div>
<div>- A picture showing that this is a Windows 7 machine.</div>
<div>- A picture showing the position of the UAC slider.</div>
<div>- The screen output of the command <i>set system</i>&nbsp;(so that I know which is your protected system drive)</div>
<div>- The result of the command <i>dir &gt; %SystemDrive%\Test.txt</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div>Now please let's ignore this personal stuff and stick to the technical discussion. OK?</div>

            I did not react until your second entry, not the first, so "wearing a chip on my shoulder" as they say in Australia does not seem to apply.&nbsp; As a matter of fact I tried to praise and thank you in my first reply.<br />
<br />
Be a skeptic if you want, that is your prerogative, but your attitude very definitely did put me off my feed from the very first.&nbsp; Though I tried to be conciliatory in my first reply, I was bitten by your skepticism.&nbsp; If you think that helpful in establishing
 working relationships then I leave you to your fate. <br />
<br />
Please, no more replies from you.&nbsp; You are right to some extent; I am developing a chip on my shoulder and that chip will prevent me from having any kind of working relationship with you.&nbsp; Perhaps that is my character failing, but I would also recommend you
 think about how you come across when you try to "help."&nbsp; People who are seeking help, who have been working on a problem until their frustration limits are reached, do not need some high and mighty expert telling them they do not know what they are talking
 about, and I do not care how you desire to style it, the bottom line was, you told me I did not know what I was talking about.<br />
<br />
Go away please.&nbsp; If that's the flavor of your help, once again I say, I do not want it.<br />

Could it be that you find it difficult to generate the evidence that would convince anyone that the Windows 7 UAC mechanism is not bullet-proof?
<div><br />
<div>Some time ago, while replying to a poster, I deplored the fact that Microsoft no longer included telnet.exe with Windows 7. Another respondent pointed out that I was wrong, that telnet was still included but that it needed to be enabled. I checked out
 this claim, found it to be correct, then thanked the respondent for pointing out my error. No hurt feelings at all.</div>

            Is this your work computer or your personal computer?
<br />If it is a work computer then it is more than likely that your company has set firewall rules to protect the machine.
<br />If it is personal computer then verify your account is an administrator.

<p>Hello Roly,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue persists after installing Windows Update, let's roll back your keyboard driver to resolve this.
<strong>The Roll Back Driver </strong>feature enables you to<br />
replace a device driver by using a previously installed version. When you use this, you can restore the previous driver, and continue to use the computer. Follow these steps for instructions:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Expand the<strong> Keyboards and double-click</strong>.</li><li>Under<strong> Driver Tab</strong>, click <strong>Roll Back Driver</strong> button.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>We'll wait for the result.</p>

<p>Hi </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Need to research this error message "Catalyst control center: Host application has encounter a problem and needs to close ATI". The message is then procceeded by a new screen titled&nbsp; "System Repair" that runs a diagnostic test that concludes the hard
 disk drive have five critical errors: (1) Read time of hard drive cluster is less then 500ms, (2) 32% HDD space is unreadable, (3) Bad sector on hard drive or damage file allocation table, (4) Boot sector of the hard drive disk is damage, (5)&nbsp; Hard disk drive
 does not respond to system commands. While all of this is going on McAfee keeps popping up with a message that a Trojan have been removed and no further action is nessasary. Howw do I fix this. O/S windows 7</p>

            The Catalyst Control Center is part of your ATI video system.&nbsp; Uninstalling and reinstalling the ATI drivers and CCC will usually alleviate that problem<br />
<br />
It also sounds like your system may have malicious software on it and you may want to take a look here to see if this looks like what you see:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-system-repair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/virus-removal/remove-system-repair</a><br />
<br />
If that's what you see, I would recommend you abandon ship from here and move yourself over to the BleepingComputer forums where they have a special group of folks that specialize in removing this affliction if the Uninstall Guide does not help get things straightened
 out.<br />
<br />
Running chkdsk /r will not help you with the System Repair affliction or your ATI problem.&nbsp; It is just something to do that has a link to a KB article in the instructions.
<br />
<br />
Personally, I would ditch McAcee all together and use something else that is free (unless you paid for McAfee or you are being forced to use it).&nbsp; If you have the System Repair affliction, obviously McAfee has failed you.&nbsp; However, some people love their McAfee.<br />
<br />
If you are running Windows 7, you are posting your issue in an XP forum and may have better luck in the Windows 7 forums (maybe).<br />
<br />
And finally, if you run chkdsk /r from the command prompt as indicated and when chkdsk runs on the next reboot, wouldn't you be curious to know the results when it is done?&nbsp; (they always seem to omit this part and/or don't know how).<br />
<br />
Here is how to do that:<br />
<br />
When chkdsk runs automatically on a reboot either because XP thinks it needs to (perhaps your NTFS volume has been marked as dirty) or you choose to schedule the chkdsk with error correction on the next reboot, the results are shown in the Event Viewer Application
 log.&nbsp; You need to look there for the chkdsk log to see what happened and any problems after chkdsk has run.
<br />
<br />
To see the Event Viewer logs, click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\system32\eventvwr.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
Look in the Application log for an event sourced by Winlogon, something like:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winlogon<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />

            I think <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Security Essentials</a> has a fairly low overhead, some folks like <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ESET NOD32</a> and for the on demand scannings,&nbsp; <a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MBAM</a> and <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SAS</a> are well respected and all have free and paid versions depending on your needs.&nbsp;
<a href="http://usa.kaspersky.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Kaspersky</a> also has some good things and you can make a bootable CD or USB of their stuff in case your system just will not boot.&nbsp; The free versions are generally fine, but if you want to pay, you will
 get more features.<br />
<br />
It is my opinion that McAfee, Norton and ZoneAlarm have too big a footprint and high overhead and can slow things down if installed "out of the box" with all the options.&nbsp; Tthat seems to be what most people generally do...&nbsp; thinking more is better.&nbsp; You can
 have "too much" protection and pay for it with a big performance hit.&nbsp; So can AVG and avast!&nbsp; and I will never install any of them again - even to test something.&nbsp; I am a Trend Micro Certified Expert, but I will not even recommend their products unless I am
 forced to by certain rules I must obey in other venues.<br />
<br />
Frequently, my suggestion for performance issues is to just disable or totally ditch all those and THEN see how things look without them running (usually much better) and switch over to MSE/MBAM/SAS combo (all free).&nbsp; That should be okay unless you go looking
 for trouble.<br />
<br />
I sometimes do go looking for trouble and try to get infected on purpose so I can learn how to remove things without letting phrases like "reinstall", "repair install", "restore point" come off my keyboard.&nbsp; Those are forbidden words to me.<br />
<br />
If I even think a system has a malicious software affliction, I will always start with MBAM and SAS first, no matter what else is in use.&nbsp; Then, when they run clean, I feel like I can fix up any remaining issues without using those other bad phrases.<br />
<br />
Remember that no single scanning tool seems to know about everything so you need to use more than one.&nbsp; Some folks are quite tickled with their McAfee, Norton, ZoneAlarm, AVG and avast!, but they have long ago lost their luster with me.<br />
<br />
I can get my system infected on purpose 10 ways that MSE will not catch but MBAM and/or SAS will so always use more than one tool that you update with new definitions before using.&nbsp; MSE/MBAM/SAS update definitions sometimes several times a day.<br />
<br />
Other folks may offer their opinions too (I hope).<br />

            <span>I have followed the instruction from this blog and able to fix the issue :-</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>When did you encounter with this error message regarding the Catalyst Control Center?<span>&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is the exact error message that you get?</span><br />
<span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens when you try to open the programs?</span><br />
<span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the applications that you are not able to open?</span><br />
<span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens when you try to access the webpage’s?</span><br />
<br />
<span>The error for the Catalyst Control Center is related to the Graphics card installed on your computer, you may check with the manufacturer if there are any updated drivers for the graphics card which needs to be installed
 to take care of the issue.</span><br />

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>This is a Dell Inspiron 3542, Win 8.1, &amp; bought new on 10/31/14.</p>
<p>Action Center tells me: No current issues detected.</p>
<p>C:, Properties, Tools, Error Check: No errors were found.</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>SFC /Scannow: Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</p>
</span>
<p>Chkdsk C: /R reported: Windows has scanned the file system and found no problems.</p>
</span>
<p><span>Dell SupportAssist says: </span><strong><span>Overall Test Result:</span></strong><span>
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 128, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 128, 1)">Passed </span></span><span>(All nine individual HDD tests passed.)</span></p>
<span>
<span>
<p>Bios diagnostics also reported no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...</p>
<p>(1) Need I worry over the following Administrative events?</p>
<p>(2) Am I right they implicate the hard drive?</p>
<p>(3) Why is it always Livecomm.edb &amp; Edb.chk (both in the same folder)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first (below) likely happened during a defrag I just did. The second &amp; third (I'm pretty sure) happened during a GUI run of Seagate DiskWizard. Perhaps I'll run that from its rescue CD from now on. Update 7/20/15: Neither a subsequent run of Defrag nor
 DiskWizard has reproduced any of these events.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorting the Administrative events by Event ID shows...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(a) This is my first ever 532. </p>
</span>
<p><span>(b) I have had three 507's (all mentioning </span><span>livecomm.edb)</span><span>: 2/2/14, 3/12/15, &amp; 7/10/15.</span></p>
<span>
<span>
<p>(c) I have had 38 472's mentioning Livecomm.edb (4) or edb.chk (34): 2/14/15 thru 7/10/15.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to copy edb.chk away &amp; back, but that was no cure. I could not move Livecomm.edb. McAfee is able to scan both files &amp; reports they're clean: All of C: is clean.</p>

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I can understand that you want to know about these events.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You need not to worry for the above Administrative events. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Edb.log.</strong> This is a transaction log. Any changes made to objects in Active Directory are first saved to a transaction log.</div>
<div><strong>Livecomm.edb</strong> is a tool designed to read, decode and extract information contained within the Windows Live Mail Store livecomm.edb data file. The livecomm.edb file can contain email related information in use by the Microsoft Live Windows
 Mail applications.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>All events are related to mail exchange they are not related to hard drive. You get Event 532 when logon attempt failed and you need not worry for this Event. When the shadow header page of file&nbsp; was damaged you get Event 472 which is again no cause of worrying.
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

            <p>Thank you for this response, Vardhamon.&nbsp;What is edb.chk? (Edb.log was never mentioned.) I do want to believe you that I need not worry, especially after running all those tests &amp; coming up clean. And I forgot to mention I also did a SFC /Scannow &amp; was clean.
 &nbsp;(I'll edit the original post &amp; put it in.) It seems odd only livecomm.edb &amp; edb.chk would be mentioned in these things after all this time (5 months since my 1st 507, apparently), if it were a hardware error. Can you start now &amp; have MS reword those error
 messages by the time Win 10 comes out - I'm signed up for it! I don't want to see "faulty hardware" mentioned in there. :-).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, is there a way to fix the "shadow header page" of edb.chk &amp; livecomm.edb? This would be the best way to eliminate the 472's. Copying edb.chk away &amp; back didn't do it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 . I would like to mention that these events are related to Windows live mail.&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier you don't have to worry about these events and these are Warning events&nbsp;not error.&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PARAMETERS:&nbsp; &lt;database name&gt; - filename of database to repair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OPTIONS:&nbsp; zero or more of the following switches, separated by a space:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /t&lt;db&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - set temp. database name<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - set 4k database page size (default: auto-detect)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - set 8k database page size (default: auto-detect)<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTES:&nbsp; 1) Repair does not run database recovery. If a database<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is in a "Dirty Shutdown" state it is strongly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recommended that before proceeding with repair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; recovery is first run to properly complete database<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; operations for the previous shutdown.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) The /g option pauses the utility for user input before<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; repair is performed if corruption is detected. This option<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overrides the /o option.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>Usually this event do not need users action but you can run Check Disk from the Command Line to find and fix errors on the disk.<br />
1.&nbsp;Type <strong>Windows </strong>and <strong>X </strong>key together &nbsp;from the keyboard&nbsp;and click on
<strong>Command Prompt(Admin).</strong></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Type chkdsk /f drivename&nbsp; for ex. <strong>chkdsk /f C:</strong> and press Enter
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note </strong>: Check Disk can’t repair volumes that are in use. If the volume is in use, Check Disk displays a prompt that asks if you want to schedule the volume to be checked the next time you restart the system. Click Yes to schedule this</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;Hope this helps. </p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

            <p>Thanks for your continued interest. Is chkdsk supposed to reconcile the primary &amp; shadow header pages? But I've already done it&nbsp;&amp; continue to&nbsp;see 472's - about one a day (but I've been doing extraordinary things like going to Safe Mode &amp; back). Here's a
 new file mentioned...</p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/efc622f6-08b6-4804-a024-755f88b2eea2" /></p>
<span>
<p>taskhostex (4132) WebCacheLocal: The shadow header page of file C:\Users\PCR\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WebCache\WebCacheV01.dat was damaged. The primary header page (32768 bytes) was used instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think what needs to be done is to reconcile those header pages?</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE 7/30/15: Since my upgrade to Win 10 yesterday, I find all the event logs have been reset/cleared. So far, there are none of these&nbsp;particular ESENT errors in Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-EventTracing/Admin. The other event errors I've complained about
 in Win 8.1 (500/501 &amp; 5003) have also disappeared - &amp; those had triggers known to me that came &amp; went.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a numerous bunch of ugly events in Admin with Win 10 - but I'll be posting of those elsewhere when I'm sure they're here to try &amp; stay. And all seems to be working well. Do remember, nevertheless, to do a full system backup first.</p>

<p>
</p><p>What is disturbing here is Microsoft's faulty hardware warning. The C: drive here is a brand&nbsp;new Samsung SSD EVO 850 500GB. All the diagnostics show no problems with the drive, including running chkdsk and Samsung's Magician software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted Samsung and they offer no further help regarding this&nbsp;problem as they are happy the drive is&nbsp;working, with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have run&nbsp;the System File Checker&nbsp;and DISM tools:</p>
<p>sfc /scannow:<br />
Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</p>

            <p>Uh-huh, that's what I was getting in Win 8.1, alright, &amp; I passed every diagnostic too. Oh, how happy I was they were gone in Win 10, build 10240 (when last I checked).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But on 4/11/16 -&nbsp;Win 10, ver. 1511, build 10586.218, came in - a 2 hour &amp; 4 automatic reboot experience. It's running very well. I'm pleased.
<strong>But </strong>yesterday I got my first ESENT &amp; with those ugly words...</p>

<h2>            What class speed is the flash memory in  the 64gb Surface and is the memory upgradeable&#63;</h2>
                    I have never fallen into the "gotta have it now" group of people, so i do not own an ipod, iphone or tablet of any kind, mainly because the tablets that get the good reviews do not come with an upgradeable memory slot.
<br />
&nbsp; Does the Surface have a slot for more storage and also whats the internal flash memory class speed? I only just learned about mem card class speeds when a friend told me to get class 10 for better HD video.<br />

            The local storage on the Surface for Windows 8 RT is set to either 32GB or 64GB of onboard flash memory depending on the Surface unit you buy. The Surface for Windows 8 Pro will have onboard memory of 64GB and 128GB depending on the unit you purchase.
<div><br />
<div>Both units are expandable via USB memory using the RT's USB2 port or the PRO's USB3 port. Both devices also have a single microSDXC slot behind the kickstand along the right side that currently supports a maximum chip size of 64GB (the max microSDXC size
 currently on the market).</div>
<div><br />
<div>The&nbsp;specifications&nbsp;of the internal memory itself are a bit of a mystery and will fluctuate per model depending on the manufacturer date and availability. With that said, iFixit recently

What XPM actually does is allow you to run Windows 7 and XP side by side so most older applications that don’t run on 7 can be run on XP.</p>
<p>Running Windows XP Mode requires:<br />
1) Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise, or Ultimate edition<br />
2) A computer capable of hardware virtualization. This means your computer has a central processing unit (CPU) with either Intel-VT or AMD-V virtualization features.<br />

    <title>Elite Controller - paddle not working, MS support unable to replace - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> muchcracker197  say:</h3>
<h2>            Elite Controller - paddle not working, MS support unable to replace</h2>
                    
<p>I received my elite controller today, but my lower right paddle is not working. Pressing the button does nothing. I tried mapping different buttons to the paddle, but nothing worked.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I contacted MS via their support chat, and was told that I should contact the Xbox preview experience people, as it was likely a software issue. I could not find any contact info for them, so I called the 1-800 support line. I was told that there was no
 replacement controller in their system, only the paddles, sticks, and D-pad. He advised me to return the controller to where I bought it (MS website).</p>

<p>Overall, I'm very frusterated. Does anyone have any recommendations? Returning the controller because a replacement isnt available seems ridiculous to me.</p>

<p>Update - I connected the controller to my PC and ran joy.cpl. I was able to confirm that all buttons work with the exception of the paddle in question. It would seem that it is a hardware issue.</p>

            <p>Hey MuchCracker197,</p>
<p>Very sorry to hear about the issue with the controller, but it does sound like the controller will need to be replaced. If you already went the route of contacting our phone support, I would check in with the retailer you purchased it from to see if you could exchange the controller.</p>
<p>Again, please let us know how it all goes and I hope you're up and running soon.</p>

<p>MuchCracker197. &nbsp;I'm having trouble with one of my paddles not fitting the controller right. &nbsp;Xbox support wanted me to try to send it back to the retailer for replacement before I send it to them for repair replace. &nbsp;Since they are out of stock at the retailer
 I am unsure if I should return for refund or send it to MS. &nbsp;They said most cases are resolved in 14-21 days but if everyone else is out of stock when will a as have replacements? &nbsp;Don't want to send it to MS and risk having to wait a long time to get it back
 because they don't have stock either. &nbsp;That is my experience so far, but probably going to cross my fingers and send it to MS for repair/replacement and hope for a quick turn around. &nbsp;Also kind of confused why the push so hard to return to retailer first.

<p>Rockhound, my resolution was taking it to a Microsoft store and they had a replacement for me.
</p>
<p>My path on how I got there was extremely frustrating though. After getting nowhere with the service chat, I called the Xbox service people and they were unable to find the controller in their system. The service operator had no ideas and told me to return
 it where I got it (microsoftstore.com). Then he sent an email telling me how to connect a controller to an Xbox (not helpful...). I decided to try the Microsoft Store at my local mall and that worked out for me.
</p>
<p>I know this doesn't exactly help, but I hear your frustrations and wish you the best of luck.</p>

<p>Glad you were able to get a new controller. &nbsp;Mine came from Amazon and they are out of stock. &nbsp;It is a simple fix of just needing a new paddle, since they other paddles work in the slot the bent paddle was in, and the bent paddle doesn't work in the other
 slots. </p>

<p>That's interesting. The guy from the 1-800 service line said that they had replacement paddles and sticks in stock for replacement. I'm suprised they wont just send you one. It sounds like you've tried this, but I'm suprised they cant make it right with
 a simple fix.</p>

<p>So what's the best way to try to get a replacement stick? I don't want to return the whole controller, I just need a replacement for one of the domed sticks that doesn't snap quite right onto the controller.

<p>I'm having a problem with one of the paddles too, the bottom right handed one doesn't fit properly and wobbles about. I've tried the other three paddles in the same socket and they all fit fine which suggest there is an issue with the paddle itself and not
 the controller.</p>
<p>I spent nearly 2 hours overall last night trying to get replacement paddles but was finally told they are not covered by the warranty and I had two choices - I could send the entire console back to the seller I bought it from for a replacement or new paddles
 would cost me £15 for a set of 4.</p>
<p>I opted to get replacement paddles for £15 as it was easier but I'm no where near happy about it.</p>

<p>Just to clarify I was told the removable parts for the Elite controller are not covered by the warranty.
</p>
<p>If you opt for a replacement controller all you get is the controller with nothing attached (paddles, sticks, D-pad) and a charging cable.</p>
<p>Replacement removable parts are available to buy however but I had to speak to someone at support to put the order through for me as I couldn't find them anywhere on the website to do it myself.</p>

    <title>Windows Activation problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alx_andre  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Activation problem</h2>
                    <p>I have installed windows 10 &nbsp;for free &nbsp;( I had win 7). &nbsp;But it says that my windows is not activated but my win 7 was. I've played a bit around with my computer to either fix this or other reason. So here's what I did:<br />
<br />
1. I updated my windows 7 to 10. Not a wipe clean, just a simple update, my user and my &nbsp;games were still there. I had the message on the down right corner telling me to activate my window. (being busy and a bit lazy I didn't care much)<br />
<br />
2. I had a but where the START button didn't work, I tried many solution that need the use of the CMD but none worked until I wiped clean windows 10 to a fresh start.<br />
<br />
3. I've bought new hardware for my computer which includes : A new graphics card (gtx&nbsp;950), a new CPU (Intel i5 4460), a new power supply and a new motherboard (which have a better chipset). To be sure to not forget to uninstall a driver &nbsp;of my previous graphics
 card or what else that could cause trouble I wiped&nbsp;win10 a second time.<br />
<br />
Now that I am done with school for a while, I've&nbsp; decided to look for the activation thing and here it's what it says: Windows is not activated as your previous version of Windows on this device was not activated prior to upgrade to Windows 10. Error code:
 0x803F7001.<br />
<br />
I can't go back to my win 7. it have been way to long the button is no longer there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note : My computer was a prebuild from HP, but I had to reinstall it due to a virus. It has been almost 5 year that i had this windows &nbsp;and I don't remember where is my activation key for my old win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is there any solution?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Changing the motherboard will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade since it used the base qualifying Windows 7 OEM license which came with the old HP motherboard.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Change the product key

<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>

<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

    <title>Low Disk Space Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Low Disk Space Windows 8.1</h2>
                    Hey Folks, <br />
<br />
I'm a pretty novice user and am looking for some help. I've looked for similar threads and can't seem to find any assistance, I'm curious to see if anyone has any thoughts.<br />
<br />
I recently purchased an Asus T100 with 32GB with a 500GB HD in the keyboard that runs on Windows 8.1. I'm having a problem where no apps are opening, which I've been trying to troubleshoot. It has been suggested that I do a system refresh. I've tried to do
 such, but am running into a more basic problem - no disk space! It is saying it needs 11+GB free to do a refresh. I can't for the life of me figure out what to remove from the machine to free up space.
<br />
<br />
My C: drive shows that it has 1.45 GB of free space. <br />
I've deleted almost all of my apps.<br />
I've looked at "Programs and Features" (right clicking on the start menu) and have deleted almost everything I can see (I had iTunes on the machine, realized it was a bad idea and deleted it, etc.).
<br />
The machine is basically just as it came, plus I put the Microsoft Office package on it.
<br />
I have some photos, etc. saved on the machine, but I looked up how to have them all directed to the D: drive instead of saving them to the C: drive.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to free up space? Am I a dummy that's just missing something? Thanks for any help!

            <p><span><span>HI EmmySta,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would appreciate if you could help us with more information.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>-What is the issue are you facing with apps? Do you receive any error message/code?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>System Refresh is the ultimate resolution for this issue, we can try basic troubleshoot to fix it. Refreshing the computer will remove apps that you have installed
 from websites and DVDs. Apps that came with your PC and apps you installed from the Windows Store will be reinstalled.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>-What is the exact/complete error message you receive while performing system refresh?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Initially I would suggest you to refer to these suggestion and check if it fixes issues with apps.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>These issues could occur due to some incorrect settings or due to some corrupt system files. Check your display resolution. If it is lower than 1024x768, Metro apps will not
 work. You can visit computer manufacturer website and update the display drivers and check if the issue persists. Make sure the latest updates are installed on your PC including optional updates. For more info on installing updates for your PC, see

            <p><span><span>Emily,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for the detailed response. The app troubleshooter was unable to fix some issues, we will try these steps and check if that makes any difference.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>-Did you install latest Windows Updates?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>You can try running a SFC scan and check.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>This issue may occur if a particular system file is missing or corrupt. You may refer the Method -The System File Checker tool in the following KB article:
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Clear &amp; Reset Windows Store Cache with WSReset.exe</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Press Windows key + R to open run window.</span></li><li>
<span>Type <strong>wsreset.exe </strong>and press OK.</span></li></ul>
<p><span><span>Windows Store will open and you’ll get a conformation message saying that:
<strong>The cache for the&nbsp;Store&nbsp;was&nbsp;cleared. You can now browse the Store for apps.
</strong>It will the take you back to Windows Store. Now try to open apps and see if it’s working like it should.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Keep us posted.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried both things.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The SFC scan yielded the following: Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.&nbsp; There's a log that's too long to paste here.&nbsp; Is there anything specific from it that would be helpful?&nbsp; Also, I read somewhere that
 running it a few times could be helpful, so I tried it more than once.&nbsp; </p>
<p>

            <p>Good morning, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried this a number of times and just can't get it to work.&nbsp; I created the new user profile (as you showed me how before) and it seems to function just fine.&nbsp; However, it's not the administrator profile.&nbsp; I've tried to copy everything over from the
 current (corrupted) administrator profile, paste it into the new profile, and delete the current one, and am not able to do so.&nbsp; I'm not convinced that the copy and paste is working.&nbsp; And when I try to delete the admin user, I'm asked to log in as the admin.&nbsp;
 Once I enter my password for that user, it won't allow me to delete it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that makes some sense....</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Edge Playback Old Youtube Video Sound When Not on YouTube</h2>
                    <p>Edge keeps playing the "sound only" of the last video I played. Even when all tabs are closed the sound of this video keeps playing. I've closed out and restarted the xbox1 and everytime I open up edge it takes me to the home page and plays the sound of the same video I opened up the day before. It just keeps looping.</p><p><br /></p><p>Second I absolutely hate edge on xbox1. It is the worst. I hated it before the April update and I hate it even more now.</p><p><br /></p><p>By God I will drop xbox1 over this and move back to playstation.</p>

<h2>            USB Audio Drivers</h2>
                    I've been having a minor issue with a USB headset for some time now, and discovered when I looked at the drivers running it that the only driver that's running 7.1.7601.18208, while all the other drivers are running 7.1.7600.18385. Are they up to date?

            The issue is that when I'm using the headset (USB Logitech H390 Clearchat Comfort), when running Skype (every version from 5.11 to latest), certain actions will cause the headset to Code 45 repeatedly (I had to open the properties window for it to see
 it disconnect/reconnect in the device manager, as there is no error code). The computer in question is a Dell XPS 720 running Windows 7 Professional 64 bit. Oddly enough, it doesn't occur with an older model H390 I had.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I've done everything I could think of to try and solve this problem, including uninstall/re-install of the headset drivers themselves, updating all my other drivers and as of today, a re-install of Windows 7 due to two BSODs that didn't finish dumping
 and blacked out too fast for me to see what actually caused it. The only information I have as to what caused those two BSODs were a startup repair error log indicating a bad patch with the version number 7.1.7600.18385 and two failed attempts at a system
 restore. Sorry I don't have more information on those - they didn't leave a minidump behind.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Logitech headset itself uses generic Microsoft drivers.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Actions that cause the headset to Code 45 repeatedly includes:</div>
<div>Pressing Caps/Num/Scroll Lock</div>
<div>Starting up Steam</div>
<div>Attaching another USB device</div>
<div>Opening up games (Some don't, most do)</div>
<div>Running DxDiag</div>

            With regards to the blue screens, I've fixed that and identified it as the RAM not having fully dumped after shutdown. During RAM testing, they came up positive for errors, but after a complete power down, removal and re-seating (and initially, to my confusion)
 they came back completely negative.
<div><br />
<div>As for the USB audio issue, recently, after having installed Mumble, the problem has stopped with Skype, but started automatically when Mumble was started up.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The newer model headsets do not have this issue on other computers (as far as I can tell), but I find it odd that it would still occur after a clean install of Windows 7.</div>

                    well my problems with Cortana involve that she says that something went wrong, she isn't speaking to the internet, or that I should try again later but its already been one day and she still doesn't work. The internet works perfectly, I can search things
 but she just doesn't work. I am running the official windows 10 on the dell inspiron 15 4500 and I'm located in the US. thank you in advanced. also, ive thought of everything that I could, stopping Cortana on task manager, restarting the computer, turning
 her on and off.

            Hi Trevor.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />HP makes great hardware but the factory install is the worst in the industry, larded with bloatware like utilities that duplicate and cause issues with better versions built into Windows.   No tech enthusiast would even consider running the HP Factory Install, or an Upgrade install so if this is both there is no surprise about the problems you're having.
<br />
<br />What we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.
<br />
<br />Until then Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Run the onboard HP diagnostics to test all hardware by powering up the PC while pressing the ESC key:  <a href="http://www8.hp.com/us/en/campaigns/hpsupportassistant/pc-diags.html?jumpid=va_r602_us/en/any/pps/pl_ot_ob_ds_pd/HP_PC_Hardware_Diagnostics_cc/dt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www8.hp.com/us/en/campaigns/hpsupportass...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi trevormack 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />have you tried a restore point first?
<br />First you will need to force your machine to get into the recovery screen.
<br />To do this boot up and wait for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle, when you see that press and hold power button to shut down.
<br />Boot up again and do the same thing by waiting for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle then shut down, power up for the 3rd time and you should get repair screen.
<br />Let it run.
<br />You will then get a screen with the Automatic Repair, select the Advanced Options.
<br />Then choose a restore point.

            I think at this point your best option is to a custom install.
<br />This will take your windows folder and turn it into windows.old then you might be able to get your files from that folder.
<br />See link by Andre on how to do this.
