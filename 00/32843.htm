<h2>            Unable to hide Desktop.ini</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Desktop.ini won't be hidden</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>recently, for some reasons desktop.ini files appeared in every folders. Now, I know from searching on the internet that it's not a virus and it needs to be there.
</p>
<p>I also know that checking "Don't show hidden files, folders or drives" as well as "Hide protected operating system files(Recommended)" will hide them from my sight.</p>
<p>Except that this doesn't work for me. Desktop.ini files won't be hidden, even though I did all that as you can see here.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c0a5444-b354-423b-bfb3-34fc785969fb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c0a5444-b354-423b-bfb3-34fc785969fb" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They still come up everywhere. Here I was trying to ctrl+A and hide selected files all at the same time, but it doesn't work either. The only way now is to hide them individually one by one, which I'd rather not do if possible, since there are so many.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, help me. I realize they are important files, so I don't want to delete them by accidents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per description, you are unable to hide desktop.ini.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The desktop.ini file by default has the System, Hidden and Read-only attributes assigned. So they should not be showing on the Desktop.As mentioned you have already tried to hide the system file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try is one more time and also click on APPLY TO ALL FOLDERS tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Windows Explorer; click on Desktop. Go to Tools/Folder Options. Click View, and check "Hide protected operating system files" -&nbsp; CLICK "APPLY TO ALL FOLDERS". Just click OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue still persists, I would suggest you run a virus scan and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Microsoft Safety Scanner.</span></span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>I would suggest you to perform a full system scan using the Microsoft Safety Scanner to eliminate any issues related to virus/malware.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was searching in the Internet for this problem and found your post. I know some time has past, but maybe this will be help for other users.</p>
<p>The problem was with desktop.ini files, that they were not hidden and not set as system files. Short solution can be this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Command Line with admin prompt and write down this sequence:</p>
<p>
</p><p>cd C:\</p>
<p>attrib +S +H desktop.ini /S</p>
<p>
</p><p>That will set all desktop.ini files in your C:\ drive with attributes hidden and system. Now, with folder options as set in post, the desktop.ini files won't be displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards,</p>

            Hi  enricoattas, I would wait for a couple of days which will male 1709 obselete . . . 
<br />
<br />A new version of Windows 10 is being released at the moment (1803) 
<br />
<br />Your best option is to wait on that release and install that, rather than having to go through the whole process twice . . .
<br />
<br />You may get it within the next few days that way, if you do not, keep an eye on the link below, when the heading change from 'Fall Creators Update to 'Spring Creators Update', click the 'Update Now' button and you will not have to wait, the update will start straight away . . .
<br />
<br />Or on that page you will also to download the latest ISO with the Media Creation Tool and use that to update . ..

            Rather than getting into technicalities and analyzing log files, you should upgrade this manually. 
<br />
<br />1. Right click on Windows Start &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin) 
<br />Type following (or copy and paste following) one by one and Enter 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />2. Type following in Windows Start Search box and hit Enter %systemroot%\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log to something else. 
<br />If it doesn't allow you to rename - Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer 
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update, SFC etc) 
<br />

            Hi,
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file. Too early but You can get 1803's ISO file here which replaces 1709 today:

<br />
<br />Click start, type “cmd” - right click and run as admin - then copy and paste this:

<p>Haha, always the same solutions without telling what exactly went wrong. I have been applying all these similar solutions since the first version of Creators Update until today and never get it resolved. I believe such solutions have been duplicated all
 over the internet, but none can actually tell what happens. Some people might have an older laptop or laptop with Intel HD 4000 + Nvidia combined, I'm not sure if this is the cause of the problem or Microsoft doesn't really interested in solving the upgrade
 problems faced by this group of users. Hundreds of hours have been spent on such similar solutions, like purging cache files, downloading media creation tool, run sfc and DISM, run Windows Update Troubleshooter blah blah blah, none has been worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While unable to get this problem resolved, Microsoft keeps popping up that annoying full-screen notice, warning the users to upgrade to the latest version of Windows 10 -- if NOT upgrading to the latest version of Windows 10 bothers them, why not bothering
 to solve the users' upgrade problem first and foremost? I believe many users still keen to experience the new Windows, just that nobody can really help them to solve the upgrade issues except the copy-and-paste solutions that have been duplicated all over
 the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope Microsoft can seriously look into this issue and incorporate a smarter installation component that offers fixes to user's problem, e.g. auto-fix&nbsp;outdated or corrupted device drivers, skip certain issues that can be resolved later and let the installation
 moves on until the completion, auto-fix certain outdated or corrupted system files, and finally, even prompts the user that certain problem cannot be fixed due to outdated computer hardware -- as such, stop prompting for upgrade on the same hardware PC. I
 thought many IT companies are moving towards AI, why not applying AI to offer advanced technical support to the users?</p>

            So true. Its the same solutions offered over and over and none of them work. I NEVER had these types of upgrade issues under Windows 7 or even Windows 8 for that matter. Update is a mess and they need to take a serious look at all of these failed upgrades
 and figure out a better way. &nbsp;

<p>Please see:</p>
<p>how to speed up your Windows 7 system:<br />
http://adacosta.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!E8E5CC039D51E3DB!40406.entry&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are your system specifications?</p>
<p>32 to 64 bit:</p>
<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.<br />
<br />
Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.<br />
<br />
Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>
<p>32 vs 64 bit<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions<br />
<br />
Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit<br />
<br />
Windows 7 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 7 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than 32
 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 7 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 7.<br />
<br />
As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 7 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers</p>

<p>The only way to migrate between 32bits and 64bits is a custom (clean) install.&nbsp; But that is what you had to do to go from XP to Win 7 so you have already been through that once.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than just install over the present installation, use the disk tools you will see during installation to delete and then recreate the partition and format it.&nbsp; That should straighten out things that might be causing the poor performance.&nbsp; At this point
 you might as well run some disk diagnostics (get them from the hard disk manufacturer's website).</p>

<h3> kingsbeard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 White Console Problems.</h2>
                    
<p>I recently have purchased a used white Xbox 360 console. The console has been testing by the owner and myself and works in great condition! I recently purchased a brand new wireless adapter for it. The installation CD does not read when it is inserted into
 the Xbox. All that comes is Mixed Media Error. Also, There is no flashing light on the wireless adapter when I pug it in. No green or red light. However, I do not have a hard drive which is to be placed at the top of this console. Due to the lack of a hard
 drive, does this mean I cannot connect to Xbox Live and the reason why the wireless adapter does not work? Thanks.</p>

There's one main account we use to buy all the games, and when we had the Xbox 360, we didn't need to sign into the account that the games were purchased on in order to play the games. Anyone could sign in on their own account and play any game that was purchased on that Xbox. Even when we had two 360's, games were still shared between both consoles without issue. In fact, we didn't have any problems until we upgraded to the Xbox One.</p><p><br /></p><p>We transferred all our accounts over to the Xbox One, along with all the games that were compatible with the new console. Then we bought some new games for the kids to play, but we found that no one could play any of the games unless they signed into the account that purchased the games. This was a minor annoyance at first, but we just got used to signing into the main account, then signing into our own accounts to play a game.</p><p><br /></p><p>Yesterda

<h2>            Skype Handset is offline and will no longer connect</h2>
                    <p>Have Skype unlimited calling 12 month subscription for US &amp; Canada since 2011.</p>
<p>Calls made with Skype handset plugged directly into router (i.e. not attached to computer)</p>
<p>Have Skype phones at two separate locations using two different ISP's. Using Cable modem to access internet. No problems with internet connect other than with Skype phones the last several days.</p>
<p>For the last several days have been unable to use Skype handsets. Message on handsets say connecting&nbsp; or offline. On Friday the handsets would connect to Skype then disconnect. Now they will not connect at all and the screen on the phone says "offline".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried different pug in ports on router. Unplugging router &amp; power connections. Signing in and out of account on phone and powering down phone and then turning back on. The strange thing is I have the same problem on two different Skype handsets at two
 different locations with two different ISP's and the internet is fine at both locations</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. We rely on Skype because we have no landline anymore and our cell service is poor at our home.</p>

</p><p><span>And at the beginning of June they have really messed up Skype and put a lot of their paying customers offline with regards to using their paid for SkypeOut accounts. Millions
 have been affected worldwide, Myself being one of those, I pay for a local number Called SkypeOut works like a normal telephone. But without any notification to their customer base, Microsoft/Skype pulled the plug on millions of customers, putting their Skype
 phones out of action. And the first most knew about it, was when folk were trying to ring their landline number, and they were not receiving their calls (the phone did not ring). Basically it now just re-routes straight to voicemail. Your phone no longer rings,
 or informs you that someone has left a voicemail for you. Consequence is, unless you have access to a computer, you have no way to retrieve your calls. This service is not free it is subscription based (you pay for it).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>And since the beginning of July they have now cut the out going&nbsp;calls on any Skype phone type equipment - IF you check this (the link) board, it will explain fully exactly
 what has transpired.&nbsp; Basically ALL SkypeOut domestic subscription based (with local landline numbers) customers who had telephone handsets (like a normal phone handset) even IF they say Skype certified are now only good for the bin. Hope the link below helps.
 Millions it seems have been affected worldwide, but it does not look as IF Microsoft/Skype are listening to their customers.&nbsp; All replies from the moderators, seems as though they are working to a prompt sheet.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Personally with the help of my grandson I have invested in a new iPhone and they have shown me how to use the iPhone app called facetime, which is as good as Skype (and it
 is free, as part of the phone and contract), and at least it works. When my subscription runs out with my Skype account, I will not be renewing it. And I think many others are of the same opinion.&nbsp; Microsoft have literally killed off Skype as you once knew
 it.&nbsp;</span><span>A service that was well liked, trusted and used, by generations of people over many years.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In my attempt to get answers when this first occurred in June, I signed up to get replies from a couple of the boards, just so I could keep an eye on developments. Which is
 how I noticed you query, hence the reply.</span></p>

<p>Hi Diana D;</p>
<p>My laptop is a Microsoft Signature Series Lenovo Y550P purchased online at the Microsoft Store last February. It did not come with a W7 dvd. In fact, it did not come with any reloadable software. I do know that I cannot use the Lenovo "One Key" Recovery
 button as it will remove all the software used to make this a Microsoft Signature Series version.</p>
<p>This is not a new problem. In fact, I've had this&nbsp;since I first attempted to run a backup. Since then, I have had long conversations with the Microsoft Escalation Team Leader at Microsoft Online Store, I have spoken to Lenovo Technical Support Team, I have
 chatted online with with two (2) Microsoft Team Experts all to no avail. The problem still exists and I cannont run a file backup.</p>
<p>Obiviously, I have followed all the instructions from the various technical experts I sopke to and yet I still cannot run a backup.</p>
<p>I'm hoping this forum can help as I see many others are experiencing the same problem.</p>
<p>JI</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yes you can try that.</p>
<p>If not, follow the steps in the below link</p>
<p>
<span><span>“Check a drive for errors”:&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors</span></span></a></p>
<p>
The most common causes of corruption are bad sectors on storage media, lost clusters, crosslinked files, malfunctioning antivirus software, viruses, and system crashes.</p>

<p>Dana,</p>
<p>I have followed both of your instructions above, which by the way I had followed these exact same instructions from the Microsoft Escallation Team and Windows&nbsp;Team Advsor. Once again the results were the same. I still have&nbsp;the list shown below of corrupted
 files on my C: preventing me from running a backup. The corrupted files (as I am sure you have seen these from other users) is:</p>

<p>You said&nbsp;<em> "The most common causes of corruption are bad sectors on storage media, lost clusters, crosslinked files, malfunctioning antivirus software, viruses, and system crashes."</em> I have run the Windows 7 maintanence features several times to correct
 any and all bad sectors, broken links, lost clusters, etc. I have cleaned and removed unnecessary files on my C: drive. &nbsp;In addition, the Microsoft Signature Series laptop runs Microsoft Essentials to protect against virus, spyware, malware etc. I also run
 on a regular basis "Regwork" to remove corrupt registry links.</p>
<p>I do not know why so many users have the very same problem. Many users have commented on this forum that the problem cannot be resolved until Microsoft corrects it with an update the the os.</p>
<p>Please help!!</p>

<p>I am going to try and give an answer(short) or statement&nbsp;to your question, "Why?".&nbsp; Even though it may not conform to your fundamental question about how to fix it; but, since you asked it(more than once),&nbsp;and are convinced there is a solution from Microsoft
 on avoiding corrupt files and it is their fault:</p>
<p>Corrupted files are not the "fault" of OS.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that's all i'm gonna say...</p>

<h2>            XP always loads Temporary Accounts, no matter if they&#39;re just created or old ones</h2>
                    Hello, <br />
<br />
Some time ago, 
<span><span>Windows</span><span>XP</span></span>
<span><span>Windows</span><span>XP</span></span>
 said it couldn't load a user account so made a temporary one instead. I know this happens sometimee (something about not being able to log off properly so it can't reload the profile next time).
<br />
<br />
Anyway, instead of messing about trying to fix it, i just saved all the account's files (there weren't many), deleted the broken profile and then created a new one from scratch. But when I try to log into this new one, XP still starts a temp profile instead
 (with no 
<span><span>internet</span><span>connection</span></span>).
<span><span>internet</span><span>connection</span></span>).
 No matter how many I create, they will always be temp ones. (There were two accounts on the<span><span>PC</span></span>,
 both admins, and this problem happened to one and subsequently all new ones I create from now on. I can still use the other original profile, which is how I'm deleting and making new accounts).<br />
<br />
I have tried the following things to fix it: <br />
<br />
-<span><span>System</span><span>Restore</span></span>.
 This probably should work but my PC had always been very tempromental with System Restore. It always fails for no reason other than it wants to.
<br />
<br />
- Someone said it may be something to do with GoogleUpdater, which google accept is a problem that happens with it. GoogleUpdater was on my PC so i deleted all instances of it. The problem remained.<br />
<br />
- I ran the WinFix program (I think that's what it's called), to restore all registry entries. in case there was a problem in the registry. WinFix did it's job but the problem still remained.<br />
<br />
- I installed UPHclean, which is meant to look after and sort out user accounts, but that did nothing either.<br />
<br />
So I don't know what to do... In summary, I can use the PC from the one admin account, but can create no new accounts (admin or regular) without them loading temporary profiles instead of proper ones. Any ideas what I can try next please?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time and help.

<p>Try booting to Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 while booting) and then run System Restore from Safe mode.&nbsp; This seems to take care of a lot of System Restore failures.&nbsp; Boot to Normal mode after it completes.</p>

                    <p>Hi folks!</p>
<p>I have been unable to scroll with 2 fingers anywhere after upgrades to Windows 10:((</p>
<p>I have searched the internet but none of the solutions I found seemed to apply/work. I have a yoga pro 2.</p>
<p>Not being able to scroll with 2 fingers is driving me nuts. Any help/input is greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>Hi Vinod,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Anywhere with a up/down scroll bar, I used to be able to move up &amp; down with two fingers on the touch pad. In fact, no gesture with more than 1 finger works on my touch pad anymore.</p>
<p>2. I guess I'm using a mouse with the device since I can't really use my touch pad for that purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. For troubleshooting, I went to the Control Panel and played around with the mouse/touch pad (&amp; gesture) settings, but nothing worked so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>
        </p>

            <div>Hi Dan - Me too!&nbsp; I'm not able to scroll&nbsp;up/down on&nbsp;my touchscreen with two fingers as I used to in Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I can scroll with my finger up/down using the scroll bar and tough still works to open a link or email (i.e. Facebook or Email).&nbsp; Also, I
 can no longer use fingers to scroll through my pictures right to left and vice versa.&nbsp; Really frustrating.&nbsp; Couldn't find anything about it on the internet except your question.&nbsp; I have a Microsoft Store by me and plan to take my laptop over to see if they
 can help.&nbsp; Might be a setting or something with a driver but I wouldn't even know where to start.&nbsp; I opened Facebook with Internet Explorer thinking it might be Edge causing the problem but wasn't able to scroll through posts on IE either.&nbsp;

<h2>            &#34;Display driver stopped responding and has recovered&#34;.... PSU problem&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Specs: </p>
<p>Windows 8.1 64bit</p>
<p>Amd radeon r9 m375</p>
<p>Intel i7-5500 2.40Ghz</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I had this problem in my laptop for months, I start a game, then in a few minutes or seconds i get a blackscreen end returns to desktop and a pop-up says "Display Driver stopped responding and has recovered" . I tried to fix it with "TdrDelay", nothing happens.
 Tried updating drivers, gets BSOD. And a reset, still occurs. Well, I managed to duct tape it with "TdrLevel", the pop-up message does not show and the blackscreen does not occur, still it crashes the game. And the temperature reaches 80c after 20secs of gameplay.
 Since the previous fixes i tried did not work, im starting to think that it has something to do with the power. And btw my gpu can only used when it is plugged.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi
</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/06bd26bc-6a23-42a6-93c7-9f21ad0868a9" title="katekatebrooks"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">katekatebrooks</span></a><span>,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Are you having issues on verifying your Skype account? When you said ID are you referring on the Skype name of the account? If you still remember the
 email address you used to create your account, then you can use this </span><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">link</span></a><span> to check on the account you’re referring
 to.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I look forward to your reply.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks.</span></span></p>
