<h2>            Skype Compatibility with MacOS High Sierra &#40;10.13&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone tried installing and using Skype for Mac on MacOS High Sierra 10.13?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I try to open the app, I see it briefly appear in the dock where it bounces once and then vanishes. Moments later I get a Problem Report for Skype error message that comes up with the information seen in the attached photo. Thank goodness the
 web-browser version still works as I need it for work, but has anyone had this issue and/or found a workaround? OR... is this merely a compatibility issue where Skype simply hasn't been updated to be functional with High Sierra...</p>

<p>Hello CarpeDiem1924,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We truly understand how important this is for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do provide us the version of Skype on your Mac OS High Sierra.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate the issue, <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12073/how-can-i-completely-uninstall-and-then-reinstall-skype-for-mac-os-x?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Uninstall and reinstall Skype</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the firewall settings on your Mac, following the steps below</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">From the Apple menu, select <strong>System Preferences</strong>.
</span></p>
<p>2. <span>Select <strong>Security &amp; Privacy</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click the <strong>Firewall</strong> tab.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click the lock icon and authenticate with your administrator username and password.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click <strong>Start</strong>. The firewall turn on - you'll known it's enabled when you see the green light and the
<strong>Firewall: On </strong>message.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Click <strong>Advanced</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Select the <strong>Automatically allow signed software to receive incoming connections
</strong>checkbox. This allows the applications on your Mac to communicate with the outside world.</span></p>
<p><span>8. Select the <strong>Enable stealth mode </strong>checkbox. This prevents your Mac from responding to port scans and ping requests.</span></p>
<p><span>9. Click <strong>OK</strong> to close the <strong>Advanced </strong>settings.</span></p>
<p><span>10. Close <strong>System Preferences</strong>. Your Mac is now protected by the built-in firewall.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps us. Let me know if you need further assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you!</span></p>

<p>The version of Skype is the latest version currently available from Microsoft which I believe is version 6.19.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I posted my initial problem, I had already tried to uninstall and reinstall Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, your provided instructions are not for MacOS 10.13 High Sierra as evidenced by Step #5 as there is no "Start" button, instead there is a "Turn Firewall ON" button. Next, clicking "Advanced" does NOT provide any of the options you describe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The closest thing I can come to is beneath the "Firewall Options" menu and the "Automatically allow signed software to receive incoming connections" checkbox is not an option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried enabling stealth mode anyway to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype still does not function. I would highly recommend you try out your instructions on the appropriate operating system before blindly copying and pasting from a reference manual. You might find better luck.</p>

</p><p>Skype 7.59 (37) works fine (i.e. as well as normal) on High Sierra for me (MacBook Air mid-2012).</p>
<p>Skype 7.58 worked on Sierra, but not after upgrading to High Sierra (dead microphone and camera - although an external USB headset microphone did work OK).</p>
<p>LibreOffice 5.4.3.2 works perfectly well on High Sierra too.</p>

<p>In my case, Skype&nbsp;7.59.37 didn't work (also no chance with v8.12.0.2) but 7.58.501 did on macOS 10.13.1.</p>
<p>There seems something wrong in High Sierra and having a lot of compatibility issues so far...</p>

<h2>            Audio driver doesn&#39;t load up while turning on the system after a shutdown.</h2>
                    Audio driver doesn't load up while turning on the system after a shutdown everytime this problem occurs in my dell inspiron n5559 windows 10 powered laptop. Everytime I should restart the laptop to get my dell audio drivers work. No hardware issues, only
 driver not loading while the system is booted after a shutdown. Hardware is Waves Maxx Audio.

            I tried but still the problem remains. This laptop was preloaded with windows 10. I even did hardware troubleshooting in bios - diagnostic tool. I ran even dell support assist provided by dell, so no hardware problems detected but the audio driver doesn't
 load or run when the system is turned on for first time. For this I should restart my laptop. I tried updating it said driver is up to date. At first boot even the start menu, task bar nothing works I should manly restart that is by pressing the power button.

            <p>Hi Akilesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check if the issue persists in Clean Boot state.&nbsp;<span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software
 conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>*
</span><span>Place the computer in a Clean Boot and check if the issue is occurring due to any third party programs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the link to view the steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>

            <p>Hi Katie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can&nbsp;only be removed from a family by the primary member (parent) who added you to the&nbsp;family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore,&nbsp;I would suggest you to follow the steps:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Log in as the primary&nbsp;member or ask the primary member to login.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family &amp; other users.</strong></p>
<p>3. Click on the account you wish to remove and select <strong>Remove.</strong></p>
<p>4. A prompt will appear, click on <strong>Remove account and data.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Make sure you always keep a back up of all your important files before making any changes to the system</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please respond if you have further related queries.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jesinta Rozario &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3> petehudson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Losing hard drive space fast after each start up</h2>
                    
<p>I have 78G of free space on my C Drive and am losing chuncks of 10-20Gig's every 20 minutes or so on&nbsp;my Gateway laptop.</p>
<p>When I run out, I delete my temp files and shut down...when I turn on, my 78 Gigs are back, but only until I lose them all again in an hour.</p>
<p>My process speed is also hit and miss and any online activity is a huge chore.</p>
<p>I'm running Nod32 antivirus 4 and it's not picking up anything.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.<br />
(If Rootkits run UnHackMe)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes - free<br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />
<br />
Run the Microsoft Malicious Removal Tool <br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; MRT&nbsp; find at top of list - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You should be getting this tool and its updates via Windows Updates - if needed you can<br />
download it here.<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
(Then run MRT as above.)<br />

System Restore usually reserves 15 % of drive space and updates that are needed to run computer<br />
use up some more. Backups - Recovery Options and even updates from MS and those from HP, Dell<br />
or similar makers use space if your system loads them. Also there is overhead so drives do not<br />
format to their max capacity.</p>

<p>Test Drive Unlimited 2 (Atari), Final Fantasy XIII (Square Enix). On Xbox 360, XIII is 576p native although the graphics look so good I'll call it 720p or even 1080p native. You can't tell me the ending cutscene to XIII is 576p native.
</p>
<p>And yes, we do have authorized Microsoft staff on here. I call them support staff and moderators, peps who are authorized by Microsoft to help monitor this site's forums. They do have an official feedback site where they visit too to take in everyone's feedback
 about everything Xbox. It's up to the individual game developers not Microsoft though. Microsoft does own Halo and Minecraft so they should have an open ear if you want games remastered which are made by any of Microsoft's subsidiaries like 343 industries.

<h2>            Skype for Business&#58; Transfer calls to mobile</h2>
                    <p>Recently a MAC user demonstrated the ability to transfer a skype for Business meeting from Skype client audio to his cell phone. This was a feature in the old Lync client as well but I do not see that option any longer in the windows client. Is this option
 available?</p>

<p><span>-&gt; A password recovery disk is something you must make in advance. You cannot make it after the event. You must now do this:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Ask a friend to create a bootable Windows Repair flash disk on his Windows 10 machine, using the command RecoveryDrive.exe. Do NOT copy the system files.</span></li><li><span>Use this disk to boot your machine into Windows Repair Mode.</span></li><li><span>Use System Restore to set Windows back to a point when your old password was active.</span></li><li><span>Plan ahead and create, test and document a spare admin account. It's the same as with your house key. People without a spare house key must smash a window in case they mislay their key. People without a spare admin
 account must go through awful contortions in case something goes wrong with their single admin account.</span></li></ol>

<p>Hello all and thanks in advance for any help you might offer here. I have been getting a message 'windows cant check for updates' for some time now. When I go to Systems and maintenance and ask it to search for updates there it gives me error Code 80070005.
 I have looked through the forums but none have helped. Those threads that looked promising had broken links... I am running Windows Vista. Any help here would truly be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks for your time!</p>

    <title>Gamertag Change Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> im kinda frosty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamertag Change Problem</h2>
                    
<p><span>ok so i have this really weird problem and i don't know how or why it happened. so earlier today i decided i wanted to change my gamertag and was just fooling around typing in different gamertags and i finally found one i wanted and it said it was
 available. so, keeping the gamertag in mind i just typed in some others to see if i was sure i wanted this new one. i couldn't find any better ones so i typed in the one i thought was good that was JUST available again and it said the gamertag was taken. i
 honestly didn't think someone had taken it in the 5 minutes between when it said it was available and when it wasn't so i decided to message the person that had possibly just taken the gamertag. i typed it in and it said "this gamertag is not on xbox live"
 or something like that so i went back and tried to change it again but it said "gamertag is already taken". the gamertag was Fresh n Frostyy and after a little toying with it i figured out that if i typed anything starting with "Fresh" it was always unavailable.
 for example i typed in Fresh werg556k and Fresh ood883 (things that were obviousley not taken) and it said they were already taken. it seems to me that for whatever reason xbox has blocked me from using any gamertag starting with "Frosty" and i dont know why.
 if anyone could help or explain why this happened that would be great and any feedback at all would be appreciated, thanks guys</span></p>

<p>Even if it doesn't show up as an Xbox gamertag, tags are also used on other Microsoft services, such as Zune. It could also be a spacing issue. For example, if I wanted to use your gamertag but spell it "bsuniverse" the system would say it's already taken
 even though you have a space in it.</p>

                    <p>I have a Lenovo windows home laptop, the problem is it is in french and I cannot download any language more because it is said to be uni-language. first I thought I could upgrade freely to windows 10 pro but, I found that it is not possible. the lack of
 professional feature in my version of windows does not matter, but I want at least to be able to download the languages I want.</p>
<p>so, I want to know if in the case there is, how to upgrade to multi-language windows home.</p>

<h2>            Windows won&#39;t startup -- blue screen error -- what next&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have XP SP3. &nbsp;I'm getting the following blue screen message: PROCESS1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED. . .&nbsp;</p>
<p>STOP: &nbsp;0x0000006B (0xC000003A, 0x00000002, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've come across some solutions online, but none have helped so far. &nbsp;I can't start Windows in safe mode, nor with last known good configuration -- I get the same blue screen.&nbsp; I don't have GoBack installed on this computer. &nbsp;I haven't installed any hardware
 or software recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>From the DOS command prompt, I did manage to chkdsk /r. &nbsp;It came up with a few errors &amp; corrected them.&nbsp; I tried deleting the bootcat.cache, but I got an error message that file can't be found (found 2 suggestions on where it would be located, but neither
 worked).&nbsp; Also tried replacing Ntdll.dll.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am getting an “invalid boot.ini” upon booting the computer, prior to the blue screen.&nbsp; So, I’m thinking I may have to repair the boot files somehow, but from what I’m reading, I’m afraid I’ll lose my personal stuff on the HDD by doing so.&nbsp; Is that true?&nbsp;
 (I haven’t tried to reinstall XP for the same reason).&nbsp; Any ideas on what to do?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, I don’t have another Windows based computer handy (I’m posting this from a Mac). &nbsp; I was thinking, if inevitably I have to do something that could make me lose files, that I could somehow save those files on a 2nd HDD installed on the same computer
 through DOS.&nbsp; Problem is, I don’t know the pathnames (I think that’s the correct term).&nbsp; Most files i save on my 2nd HD but there are some on my desktop a few in the My Documents folder, &amp; also my general settings that i would like to be able to save.</p>

            You will not boot into any kind of mode with that error.<br />
<br />
How are you able to get to a DOS command prompt?<br />
<br />
What is the bootcat.cache and where did you get that idea (which has nothing to do with Windows XP)?<br />
<br />
You said you tried replacing the ntdll.dll file, but does that mean you did replace it or you tried to replace it and it did not work?&nbsp; How did you try to replace it?&nbsp; There should be an extra backup copy of the file on the afflicted system.<br />
<br />
It would help to know a little about your system first...<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked so we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving
 these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Did your system come with SP3 already installed or did you download/install SP3 from the Internet?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is where I usually start with that error:<br />
<br />
If you are seeing a message like this:<br />
<br />
PROCESS1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED<br />
*** STOP:&nbsp; 0x0000006B&nbsp; (0c00000034), 0x00000002, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)<br />
<br />
<br />
That usually means your c:\windows\system32\ntdll.dll file is missing.<br />
<br />
Of course the file should never be missing, but it may have been quarantined (effectively deleted) by your antivirus/antimalware software.<br />
<br />
There are other copies of the missing file on your system in other places so you just need to replace it.
<br />
<br />
You can replace the file from the XP Recovery Console. <br />
<br />
If you do not have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (or are not sure what you have) to boot into the XP Recovery Console, you should make an XP Recovery Console CD and be sure (no XP media required).&nbsp; If you need to know how to do that, just ask.<br />
<br />
Once booted into the XP Recovery Console, do this::<br />
<br />
A good idea before starting things is to first verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.<br />
<br />
From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any problems on the afflicted drive.<br />
<br />
Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems.&nbsp; It will not hurt anything to run it.<br />
<br />
Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:<br />
<br />
chkdsk C: /r<br />
<br />
Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to be 'stuck'.&nbsp; Be patient.&nbsp; If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount to be sure it is still making progress.&nbsp; It may even appear to
 go backwards sometimes.<br />
<br />
We know that XP keeps copies of critical system files in the following folder:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache<br />
<br />
From the XP Recovery Console prompt enter the following command:<br />
<br />
copy c:\windows\system32\dllcache\ntdll.dll&nbsp;&nbsp; c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
Respond in the affirmative if asked to overwrite the existing file and then you should see a message that 1 file(s) was copied.<br />
<br />
If the copy command can't find a copy of the file in the dllcache folder, this command may work depending on how your XP was installed:<br />
<br />
copy c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386\ntdll.dll&nbsp;&nbsp; c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
Type 'exit' to leave the Recovery Console and the system will restart.<br />
<br />
You may then see a boot options menu so if you do, choose to Start Windows Normally.<br />

            <p>I got the DOS command prompt by running an XP reinstallation disk.&nbsp; I hit F12 when starting the computer to get the Boot Device Menu &amp; then selected the option to run the CD-ROM device.&nbsp; If I
 choose the Recovery Console/Repair, I can get into DOS.&nbsp; The Recovery Consule doesn’t work every time though, so sometimes it takes several attempts of rebooting to get into DOS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>I only have the Windows recovery/reinstallation CD. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>I did replace the ntdll.dll file, &amp; did that by copying the file exactly as you’ve included in your post.&nbsp; I assume it worked, as I didn’t get an error message upon doing it. &nbsp;And, again, I already
 checked the disk.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>Bootcat.cache I think is actually a Windows 7 issue, but I kept coming across it when I was searching the web specifically for XP info related to the error, so I just took a stab at it.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>Computer is a Dell Dimension 2400 that came installed with SP3.&nbsp; IDE.&nbsp; Internal CD drive seems to be working fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>I think Avira virus protection (had Norton until about a month ago, but that’s currently uninstalled).&nbsp; I don’t know where to look to verify the brand that’s on their now, as I would normally
 look on my desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>This all began with Internet Explorer crashing, &amp; not the usual type crash, as I was actually prompted to try &amp; fix an error, rather than the usual report the error.&nbsp; I can’t remember the exact
 wording of the error message, but it gave me the option of trying to fix the problem or shutting down the computer, &amp; I chose to shutdown (I’m a bit wary of being prompted to fix a problem while online like that).&nbsp; Of course, it didn’t shutdown, it just froze
 for several minutes &amp; even CTR-ALT-DEL wouldn’t work, so I did have to shut it down w/the computer’s power button.&nbsp; Haven’t been able to get the computer to start correctly since.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>Not sure exactly what happened, but it does seem to be a software problem, rather than hardware, problem to me.</p>

            If you copied the file and only got a message that the file was successfully copied (and not a prompt to overwrite the existing file), that means the file was missing - and it should never be missing.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, AV programs (especially Avast, AVG and Avira) will mistakenly interpret critical XP system files as threats and quarantine (effectively delete) them resulting in a no boot scenario.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If that is the case, there could also be other files missing.<br />
<br />
After you replace the ntdll.dll file, are you able to boot again (maybe just one more time)?<br />
<br />
After you replace the ntdll.dll file and reboot do you still get the SESSISON1 message and are you getting this:<br />
<br />
PROCESS1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED<br />
*** STOP:&nbsp; 0x0000006B&nbsp; (0c000000<span style="font-weight: bold">34</span>), 0x00000002, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)<br />
<br />
or this:<br />
<br />
PROCESS1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED<br />
*** STOP:&nbsp; 0x0000006B&nbsp; (0c000000<span style="font-weight: bold">3A</span>), 0x00000002, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)<br />
<br />
There are other SESSION kinds of messages too and my notes tell me that other files that might be involved that may need to be replaced are:<br />
<br />
Windows\System32\smss.exe&nbsp; <br />
Windows\System32\ntdll.dll <br />
Windows\System32\ntoskrnl.exe<br />
Windows\System32\drivers\ftdisk.sys<br />
Windows\System32\winlogon.exe<br />
<br />
If those files are missing, you may/will get other kinds of SESSION type messages so I would check them out too.<br />
<br />
From the Recovery Console you can get into the system32 folder and using the dir command, see if those files are missing and if they are missing, replace them like you did with the ntdll.dll file.<br />

<br />
I have a few ideas, but need to see if I can recreate it here perhaps.<br />
<br />
Since you are now familiar with the RC a bit, and you mentioned boot.ini earlier, here is one idea...<br />
<br />
In a single partition configuration, XP does not even need a c:\boot.ini to boot.&nbsp; It will complain, but still boot just fine.<br />
<br />
Since you can get into the RC, navigate to the C:\ folder and rename your c:\boot.ini to something you can remember like:<br />
<br />
boot.ini.bak<br />
<br />
Now your c:\boot.ini is "missing", but from the RC you can always rename it back to c:\boot.ini later.<br />
<br />
What happens when you reboot now?&nbsp; XP should at least complain about it.<br />
<br />
If things are worse, rename the boot.ini.bak back to boot.ini and you will be back where you were.<br />
<br />
I will noodle it and let you know if I come up with anything, but at the moment I am stumped!<br />

            OK, I get the message that "The system cannot find the file or directory specified."

<div>I want to verify my syntax is correct, as my DOS is extremely rusty -- when at the

<div><br />
<div>I know it's supposed to be a hidden file, but is that relevant in DOS? &nbsp;Could the problem be that the boot.ini file is missing all together?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Addendum:</b>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I&nbsp;figured out how to add the boot.ini file using bootcfg. &nbsp;I then renamed the boot.ini file -- got the exact same blue screen error --<i>&nbsp;it never changes!</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;I changed the filename back to boot.ini.
<div><br />
<div>One thing that has now been accomplished -- I'm no longer seeing the invalid boot.ini error upon booting the computer. &nbsp;I'm also getting the same blue screen error w/the added boot.ini file though.</div>

<p>Basically, my computer is still not working properly.&nbsp; I now at least know the cause was some something viral.&nbsp; (So much for that anti-viral program I was using, I'm going back to Norton).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I hooked my HDD up to another Windows computer, the McAfee on that computer immediately found the virus (Trojan, I think -- never had a virus before, so I know nothing about them) &amp; knocked it out.&nbsp; My computer's Windows&nbsp;will now start, but it's like
 a stripped down&nbsp;version (reminds me of Safe Mode, but it's not in Safe Mode).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My System Restore points were wiped out.&nbsp; My start up menu is virtually empty (no pinned programs &amp; lots of missing links).&nbsp; I even tried to change the wallpaper by right-clicking on the desktop, as it changed to a plain blue background, &amp; I couldn't even
 do that (the option isn't there).&nbsp; If I go into Windows Explorer, it balks when I try to access the C drive (warns me I shouldn't access the C drive -- can't remember the exact wording), which I don't remember ever happening before, &amp; it won't let me view
 the hidden files (I know how to switch the hidden file view on, but it doesn't work).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Windows installation CD will no longer run the repair/reinstall feature either (so no more recovery consule).&nbsp;</p>

            You need to undo the damage done by the trojan. This includes unhiding hidden folders and files and restoring certain files to their proper locations. I hope you haven't cleared your temp files because you will need them!
<div><br />
<div>This page contains a number of helpful tips:</div>
<div><br />

<div>Also, this guide should be consulted:</div>

<div><br />
<div>Again, do not clear your temp files until you have recovered everything you want!!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>And you need second, third, and fourth opinions with regard to whether or not you are truly free of malware! Definitely use TDSSKiller, MBAM, and the portable SAS scanner. Also run this free online scanner:</div>

            <p>I haven't touched my temp files.&nbsp; I actually copied my entire C drive onto a 2nd HDD, which is probably insane, but I was thinking in case the computer got even more messed up, I could go back &amp; get copies of any file.</p>
<p>Besides the McAfee, I also ran 2 anti-viral programs off&nbsp;the Hiren CD, &amp; I&nbsp;was planning on reinstalling Norton.&nbsp;One problem is the virus went into&nbsp;my saved Norton settings,&nbsp;so I'm wary of using them as they are right now, but&nbsp;I the shortcut for the program
 that I used to backup my settings was in my startup menu (so now gone),&nbsp;&amp; I can't find the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do have Norton settings from March saved elsewhere, so worse case, I can use those, but would prefer something more recent.&nbsp;&nbsp;I will try those other scanners
 you suggested as well.</p>

<p>Hello and thank you, in advance, for taking time to read and respond to my query.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a Dell Dimension 4300 XP Pro/SP3 and installed a new MICROSOFT Comfort Curve 2000 keyboard. According to the information about the different styles
 of keyboards, this one stated it was compatable with my system. The software, for the Comfort Curve 2000&nbsp;keyboard,&nbsp;was downloaded from the MICROSOFT website as I was instructed to do. Since completing the installation I get&nbsp;an error message,"Keyboard failure-Strike
 the F1 key to continue, F2 to run the setup utility", each time the computer boots or is re-started. Neither the F1 or F2 activate the commands that the message states. In order to&nbsp; use the computer AFTER initially pressing the power on button, I have to press
 the&nbsp;power button off, wait a second or two, then press the button on again. Only then will my security logon page appear and I can resume using the computer with no keyboard problems or errors. This proceedure must be repeated at each re-boot and re-start.
 At each&nbsp;re-boot or re-start&nbsp;the computer beeps twice&nbsp;and this error message appears. I am at my wits end having to turn the computer on/off/on and am not sure it is good for the health of my computer. I read&nbsp;that one suggestion is&nbsp;to un-plug then re-plug the
 USB connector that attaches the keyboard to the back of the back of the computer and that remedy did not help. I have gone into the "Device Manager" and it states&nbsp;the keyboard is operating properly.&nbsp; I can answer any&nbsp;further questions, if needed, and can follow
 step-by-step instructions. Otherwise, my knowledge of computers is limited to use only.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, once again, for&nbsp;ANY help by anyone willing to tackle my issue. sherudi</p>

<p>This appears to be a Dell issue, if you visit Dell support forums you will find many pages on this error "Keyboard failure-Strike the F1 key to continue, F2 to run the setup utility" I would guess that its caused by some Dell utility that auto starts when
 you power on.</p>
<p>Does the issue occur if you boot using Safe mode?</p>

<h2>            I have two duplicate user accounts with same sign on info, but two different passwords</h2>
                    <p>I have duplicate user accounts that I set up when i started using Windows 10 &nbsp;a couple of weeks ago. &nbsp;Now I have may a couple more trying to fix it. There are only two I want to combine and remove the others with other user names i used only to fix hte duplicates.
 &nbsp;This all happened because I wanted to download my copy of Officce 365. &nbsp;It didn't &nbsp;download completely, so when I started the 2nd account, I used the same user acct to get into my microsoft account. &nbsp;It worked and I downloaded office. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I somehow lost the first account that had the other downloaded programs and files i wanted. They are both the same microsoft user names, but have different passwords and both admin with the second being a stardard user with admin rights. &nbsp;Since then
 I could not get into my microsoft account with the second account which I now use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The odd thing is when I am using my current account I notice that I could not sign into my Onedrive account which I had in windows 8.1. &nbsp;Suddenly while I was in my account, all my Onedrive pictures started loading, and I was confused. &nbsp;Now the only way to
 see my first account is to click on the pictures tab in the task bar. &nbsp;So when I tap that tab, all the (collection" comes up and I'm in the first account which has all the setting color format, etc. &nbsp;I see the present account picture &nbsp;down at the left corner
 as well but can't access it. There is also a setting page that comes up for the Onddrive acct. It has a box in the middle which gives the usual "see all your services in one place, bla bla, and has my duplicate microsoft sign on and the old pic. &nbsp;I want to
 get into my onedrive account now but can't because I don't own it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm praying I can just combine the two of them since they are the same account with different pass words and codes.</p>
<p>can anyone help?</p>

            <p>I'm sorry, I should have made myself a little clearer. &nbsp;When I first got upgrade, &nbsp;I created a microsoft admin account, with my microsoft account name &nbsp;address and password. &nbsp; Then, because I should have another admin account which is standard, I created
 another and made it an Admin account as well. &nbsp;I think I named it with the same microsoft account but gave it a new password. &nbsp;Then I went back and made the first one the standard acct with admin rights. &nbsp;Because we both were able to get into my Microsoft
 account at the top of the page, I downloaded Microsoft Office on the 1st user account, and it did not quite make it to set up (not sure if it was a compatibility issue) &nbsp;I also downloaded programs I wanted on it. &nbsp;My other pictures and docs made it fine, and
 still had all files, though mixed up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I created the 2nd user account I was able to get into the Microsoft sign in and re download my Office, and discontinued or canceled the first download. This one seemed to download, but I couln't find the files when I went back to my acct. &nbsp;In fact all
 my stuff was gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told that if you need files from windows.old you can download what you need out of there. &nbsp;Mistakenly I downloaded all of them. &nbsp;bad idea. There was nothing in the files. I left it all alone though. Looked like the settings were back to Windows 7.
 So I created another admin account with a different microsoft address and email address. &nbsp;Was using that one. &nbsp;I might as well admit that I made a few more just to try to get a decent user account. &nbsp;After all that, I lost the original user acct. I had a new
 one called Linds-PC (my name) could not access it so with Geek Squad's help we rounded up the accounts I did not use and put them on a desktop in folder. &nbsp; Most of the items I downloaded in the current user acct were scatter all over and missing some. When
 I tried I tried to get into some files, I was blocked because either I entered password etc wrong or i was part of an organization that did not have me set up yet.. Permissions were set with main admin Linda's PC. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another strange event was that when I was on my present acct, Onedrive started downloading a huge amount of pics from my onedrive in 8.1. &nbsp;I was able to see my original file with the picture I gave it at the lower left bottom, but couldn't access it, so
 now since there is a "pictures filed" in the task bar, we are &nbsp;able3 to share just that picture file. &nbsp;I tried to open and start my Onedrive from current acct and I am not allowed to. &nbsp;Same message as before. &nbsp;I also cannot access microrsoft sign on 'my account'
 because the address was changed so many times. &nbsp;This first acct is not visible on the start up window desktop. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So if this makes any sense maybe someone has an idea as to what has happened and iff I should start over with Refresh (don't) know if I can do that on a upgrade) and start over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perfectly miserable and confused.</p>

            <p>okay, let me ask a short question and make long story short. &nbsp;I realize what I explained is unnecessarily confusing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I could make a new account which i would make admin and then delete the rest of the user accounts in my name, after transferring docs and pictures? &nbsp;Should I make the other accounts standard before I do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I have my Microsoft account and information such as orders, credit card, etc. &nbsp; Can I possibly make that my main user acct? &nbsp;It's a long shot, but it would be convenient.</p>

<p>"I tried to make another <strong>user acct</strong> for myself to make it a standard with the first as admin. &nbsp;I used the exact same User name and password on the standard account, (which was pretty foolish) &nbsp;I named the second one standard acct and was
 going to use that one. &nbsp;Trouble is, I used my <strong>microsoft account</strong> on both of the user accounts to download my windows office subscription online. &nbsp;I'm not used to this multiple password and code stuff. &nbsp;I made yet another new account creating
 a a new "Outlookl" account and new password. I was told by someone to delete the other accounts when i transferred the files i wanted and then delete the other user accounts, but when I signed in with the Hotmail account it asked for me to use my microsoft
 account instead. (my microsoft acct is a hotmail acct) &nbsp;I put in my hotmail account but used the Outlook password, didn't work, my hotmail password didn't work either. &nbsp;Don't know what I'm doing wrong."</p>

            Microsoft created a requirement that I log in with a password with windows 10 which I did not want. &nbsp;I created a password and used the instructions to tell it to never ask for a password, but it constantly ask for one, both on start up and after it puts
 itself to sleep. &nbsp;This was all bad enough, but you forced me to change the password, which presents a screen that cannot be closed without a code which I have to go to another to get because I cannot check my email because of the verification requirement.
 &nbsp;Once I did that and changed the password, you created a second user with the identical name. &nbsp;One user accepts the new password, the other doesn't. &nbsp;When I try to change the password from another computer it shows only one user, but requires a verification
 code from another computer to do that. &nbsp;If you look at my account you will see I have had to get at least 20 verification codes in the last month. &nbsp;I have to go through this with every computer I own (five)

                    I have a Compaq laptop that was infected with a virus and now refuses to activate. MS says the current key is invalid but it is the one that was originally installed on the device. I can't read the sticker on the bottom so I'll need to buy a new copy of
 Windows 7 but nobody seems to have them available. What can I do?

            I used Produkey from Nirsoft to access the activation key before I started. I have already created a System Image if anything else goes wrong. I used the HP recovery partition to restore it to 'factory new' condition and it didn't even have SP-1 installed.
 It still had the same activation key. The part of the sticker that says which version is installed or licensed is scrubbed clean. Home Premium is my personal choice and I also think that Ultimate on a laptop is overkill. Maybe it is a Home Premium key and
 is why it won't activate but the owner insists that Ultimate is what was on it when she bought it from Walmart in 2010. Being that Home Premium 64-bit is my own personal choice I don't have an Ultimate install disk and neither does the owner. What complicates
 things more is that is a 32-bit OS. All I know is what the laptop owner tells me. I am doing this as a favor for one of my sister's friends.<br />

            HP says it is out of warranty and wants $100 to remote connect and make sure that there are no driver conflicts. Seriously? I'm just going to tell her to buy a Windows 10 Home key and be done with it. The HP recovery partition installs Ultimate and says
 I have XX days left to activate it. I have already saved her Docs and Pics. If I had a 32-bit Home Premium disk I would try it but I am only doing this as a favor and my patience is wearing thin right now. Placing a Product Activation Code sticker on the bottom
 of a laptop where it will constantly be worn away and scuffed is the stupidest idea I have ever seen or heard of. To top it all off is that HP doesn't keep a record of the code either. When she buys the Windows 10 install disk I will place the sticker inside
 of the battery compartment where it should have been to begin with if Windows 10 even has a sticker. I've heard that the activation code is built into Windows 10 and no longer has a sticker. Anyone walking through Walmart, Sam's Club or anywhere else with
 laptops or desktops on display can use their smartphone to snap a picture of the sticker and use the code anywhere else they wanted.&nbsp;

            <p>This should not be an issue since Factory Recovery always reactivates itself.&nbsp; So the problem is surely they you inserted a Product Key which fouled out activation.&nbsp; In this case I would do Recovery over looking for Minimal Recovery choice.&nbsp;

            Factory recover did not reacivate this installation. IDK what the problem is but they have CCleaner installed and I have no idea what they might have deleted. I am in Pennsylvania and the owner is in Florida so I have had no contact with them other than
 using my sister as a go between. The laptop is fully functional other than activation. SFC shows no corrupt files, I installed AVG Free since it had no AV/AS other than Windows Defender, and it has all Windows updates installed including SP-1 which was missing
 when I got it. I have gone as far as I am going with this device. Thanks for your suggestions.

            To my recollection AVG didn't start putting their 'PC Tuneup' garbage in the AV/AS until 2013 but what do I know. AVG doesn't slow or bog down my PC when gaming which is more that I can say for many other AV/AS products including the big boys like Norton
 and McAfee which I consider to be the worst resource hogs on the market. I tried MSE and had nothing but problems with errors in my Event Viewer requiring a Folder or File needing to be deleted before rebooting ad infinitum. MSE has the lowest rating of almost
 any of the available software on the market. Now that we got that out of the way, SLUI 4 gives me the same results of opening a help window and telling me my product key is invalid. When I click a link to go directly to Microsoft from the help window they
 want me to upgrade to Windows 10 instead of allowing me to purchase a new product key. Can't upgrade to Windows 10 because this Windows 7 isn't activated. I prefer Windows 7 but that decision will be up to the owner who will probably lik
