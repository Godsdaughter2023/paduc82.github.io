<h2>            Windows 10 Lenovo laptop stuck at 48&#37; during reset</h2>
                    My relatively new laptop has been having some screen flickering issues so I decided to do a full reset to fix the issue. Unfortunately, the process had been stuck at 48% for a couple hours. I have no idea what to do please help.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you with your concern, we suggest that you perform a reset again by using the
<strong>One Key Recovery feature</strong> that is available in Lenovo laptops. There is a certain button on the laptop that will direct you to the recovery partition of your machine. Contact the manufacturer of your laptop so that they can guide you on how
 to access the One Key Recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further queries, feel free to post back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Oh I completely forgot to update this thread, my apologies. The reset process eventually ended. It did something with driver repair and ended up installing windows and finiishing the reset. Overall, everything worked out. Thanks for helping anyway and
 sorry for the trouble.&nbsp;

<p><span><span>Hi shippy59,</span></span>
<br />
<span><br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers community forum!</span> </p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>‘conime.exe’ is the input method editor associated procedures, allows the user to use the standard keyboard
 to enter the complex characters and symbols. </span><span>File conime.exe is a Windows system file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note: &nbsp;</span></strong><span>However,
 some malware camouflage themselves as .exe files. Remember that although many files are always in default file locations, some files can easily be moved to different locations or change names like many spyware, adware, or popup programs do.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to perform a complete scan on your Computer and check for infections.</span></p>

    <title>Error code 1603 &#40;or 643&#41; when trying to install any - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pkgam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error code 1603 &#40;or 643&#41; when trying to install any &#34;Microsoft .Net Framework 3.5&#34; update.</h2>
                    
<div>First off, my system specs&nbsp;that may be necessary to help determine the solution:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Windows Vista Home Premium</div>
<div>64 bit system</div>
<div>(x64)</div>
<div>I have Norton 360 Antivirus, but I disabled it completely during installation just to make sure it wouldn't interfere with all these steps&nbsp;I took, keep that in mind.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>................</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>All right, for about 6 months now I have been trying to install the update ".NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 and .NET Framework Family Update". I keep getting error code 643 for this update. I looked for the solution online on Microsoft's site and came
 across this page:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923100</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'll now explain the steps I went through</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I checked in the add/remove programs (It's actually called just "Uninstall Programs" on my machine) And there were no .NEt framework programs installed (or were showing) on my machine. Right there I found it weird because I knew at least the .NET framework
 1.1 service pack was on here. So I figured the article was just referring to ones I can uninstall, then I should reinstall them manually.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>OK, then I got the cleanup utility from that page linked to in&nbsp;Method #1 just to be sure called the "windows installer cleanup utility". Again, no .NET framework updates showed on the list.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So I just downloaded the 3.5 framework&nbsp;and it's updates manually since it was apparent that I couldn't uninstall anything from there...&nbsp;They all&nbsp;failed with error code 1603 during installation for some reason I haven't been able to determine.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>...............</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So, I of course went to&nbsp;Method #2...</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;and got this program:</div>
<div><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2006/05/30/611355.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/archive/2006/05/30/611355.aspx</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It came up with a list of 3 things I "could" uninstall</div>
<div>1.0</div>
<div>1.1 and</div>
<div>3.5</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So, I made note of them and used the "all" function, then went back and downloaded all the ones that could be installed on this operating system based on the "compatibility list which was 1.1, 1.1 SP1, 3.0, 3.5 &amp;&nbsp;3.5 SP1. I got all of them and here was
 the results of each:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.1: it installed but said it has knows incompatibility issues with a IIS thing</div>
<div>1.1: Sp1: Same incompatibility as 1.1 but installed.</div>
<div>3.0: Said it had to be configured or installed through the "turn windows features on/off". So I made sure it was on.</div>
<div>3.5: Error code 1603</div>
<div>3.5 SP1: Error code 1603</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>.............</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since both methods failed and I'm still not sure what versions of framework I need, I decided to go with a more "logical" approach and let windows update determine which versions I need or I had because I thought that may be the problem...</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It said I needed these to be installed:</div>
<div>.NET framework 1.1 service pack 1</div>
<div>and</div>
<div>NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 and .NET Framework Family Update</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>That told me that 1.1 did get successfully installed by the above program because it hasn't showed in the updates when I checked for them before. Meaning those are the 2 that my system apparently needs... right?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So, I went and let them get installed...</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.1 SP1 got a 66A error</div>
<div>the 3.5 one got the same old</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Ok, both got errors&nbsp;I said... I looked up the 66A error...</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Based on this page:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistawu/thread/3f236221-d868-49d8-9615-54e811263c5e/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistawu/thread/3f236221-d868-49d8-9615-54e811263c5e/</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It says I need the other 1.1 installed first. Which made sense. So I installed the regular 1.1 (by the way it still got the compatibility error) and redid the windows update process... same error. So, I downloaded the update manually... Success! it is
 no longer appearing in windows update.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So, I thought just maybe that's the problem with 3.5... I have to do it all manually... So I did in the proper order of installation one at a time... every time I get to the 3.5 updates they fail with error code 1603.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I just don't know what to do anymore. Microsoft really has to release a patch or fix for this problem I'm experiencing. The ones they gave do not work for me. There is no solution that worked for me on the support forums so I am posting every bit of knowledge
 I have been accumulating&nbsp;on this problem.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>My grandpa needs his Turbotax deluxe 2009 installed to do his taxes soon and for some reason it requires that 3.5 framework&nbsp;update for it to work (I don't know why because other previous versions didn't need it. But&nbsp;this one&nbsp;needs it.)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also, the .NET framework update we need for it to run is on the disk Turbotax comes on and it fails with the same error codes. So, it's not just the manual installs or Windows Update.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Any help is appreciated! Thanks!<br />
<br />
Also, don't tell me to use the "get help" page here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gethelp/default.aspx?content=kb;en-us;923100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/gethelp/default.aspx?content=kb;en-us;923100</a><br />
<br />
Their prices are outrageous! $99 JUST for a e-mail is insanity! I could get Windows 7 for a bit more then that and it would probably work better then Vista.</div>

See...<br />
<br />
TurboTax 2009 can fail to install because it thinks the .NET Framework is not installed, even when it is<br />

            Windows 10 Digital License
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />
<br />Out of Box Experience
<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, configure privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.

            Hi Hemant, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, you will not need a product key and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />

<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<h2>            Skype for Business - Unable to join meeting</h2>
                    <p>We have two licensed users in our office 365 group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We both attempt to join a meeting set-up by a different party, one of us is on Windows and works fine, our other user on Mac has issues joining the meeting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When we tried doing a meeting between each-other to test it out, we can connect fine (audio, video, and screen presentation), but when the Mac user tries to connect to the meeting set up by a different party, he is unable to. We both attempt to join the
 meeting by clicking on a link sent by the organizer, when the mac user clicks on it, skype for business attempts to call but never successfully connects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Mac user is on iOS = OS X El Capitan 10.11.6 and Skype for Business version 16.10.97.</p>

<p>And could you tell me whether the issue occurs on a call or meeting? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, the issue may related to Skype for Business client on MAC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the versions of your OS and Skype for business aren’t up to date. it is suggested to upgrade OS and Skype for Business. This may help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, please tell me.</p>

    <title>How a Windows Firewall packet filtering scheme looks like&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trismarck  say:</h3>
<h2>            How a Windows Firewall packet filtering scheme looks like&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I've stumbled on the iptables routing scheme and I was wondering if there exists a similar graph for Windows XP with routing service enabled / disabled. Here is the graph for iptables:
<a href="http://www.adminsehow.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/tables_traverse.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.adminsehow.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/tables_traverse.jpg</a> .<br />
I'm particularly interested in the following questions:<br />
1. why on the scheme there are three routing decisions? Does it mean there are actually three routing tables on the computer?
<br />
2. If there is only one routing table, why the routing decision occurs twice for a forwarded packet? (why the redundancy)<br />
3. Lets suppose Windows XP has routing disabled. If a packet traverses to the computer NIC from an external network, on what basis is that packet processed / discarded? (the routing table works for outgoing packets only)<br />
4. Lets suppose Windows XP has routing enabled. If a packet traverses to the computer NIC from an external network, on what basis is that packet processed / discarded? (the routing table?) (so when routing == enabled, the routing table works for incoming packets
 also?)<br />
<br />

            The native Disk Manager is very limited. Try a free third-party partition manager such as AOMEI.

            Hi chEnnAkEshAvA 
<br />
<br />Most likely the page file on your C drive is stopping you from choosing a larger size to shrink that partition by, Windows Disk management is very limited in its abilities
<br />
<br />You will need to use a 3rd party utility to do this, the free version of AOMEI partition Assistant is the best.
<br />

<h2>            Automatic Repair</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I was playing a game on my computer a few weeks ago, when it froze.. so I unplugged it from the back, I tried turning it back on and when I did it said "Running Automatic Repair" After about 2 minutes of that it said "Diagnosing your pc" for around 3
 minutes. Once it went into automatic Repair I tried everything, I dont have it installed on a usb or on a disk because i bought the pc on ebay, But Ive tried the commands in Cndprompt and when I try to reset it it will say it was unable to reset. Olease helo
 me I want to use my computer again.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The reason why you are experiencing an automatic repair might be caused by a corrupted or missing files or sometimes a faulty driver. You can follow the steps below to use the Command Prompt from Windows 10 boot options menu:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Choose <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced Options</strong> and select
<strong>Command Prompt</strong> from the list of options.</li><li>When <strong>Command Prompt</strong> appears, enter the following lines and press Enter after each line in order to run it:<br />
bootrec.exe /rebuildbcd<br />
bootrec.exe /fixmbr<br />
bootrec.exe /fixboot</li><li>You can also run additional chkdsk commands as well. To perform these commands, you need to know drive letters for all your hard drive partitions. In Command Prompt you should enter the following (but remember to use the letters that match your hard drive
 partitions on your PC):<br />
Ex. chkdsk /r c:<br />
chkdsk /r d:<br />
Note: You have to perform the chkdsk command for every hard drive partition that you have.</li><li>Restart your computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any other questions.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Enforcement</h2>
                    <p>Just wondering if someone can please explain what is going on with Xbox Live Enforcement. 2 Days ago I&nbsp;received an email stating that my sons Xbox Live Communication was suspended for a week due to breach of the communication Policy. There was no information as to when, why, how the breach occurred. No evidence offered or supplied as to how the breach occurred and no further explanation.</p><p>I&nbsp;tried to get a case review however I&nbsp;answered the questionnaire wrong and no needed to wait 24 hours before I&nbsp;could try the questionnaire again. I&nbsp;contacted online support who basically said "Bad luck Its an enforcement issue" I&nbsp;asked if there was any other way to deal with the issue to which I&nbsp;was advised to place a post on user voice and offer a suggestion. Somewhere along the line I&nbsp;would basically like customer support for a service that I&nbsp;pay for and was suspended without an explanation apart from breach of Policy, I&nbsp;find this utterly ridicu

            <p>The questionnaire is used to gauge your (or your son's) knowledge of the code of conduct. If you're failing then it's to help push you to read over the code of conduct to have a better understanding of what can and cannot be done over Live. The enforcement team does not suspend an account for no reason. They investigate the complaints they receive and will only issue a suspension if they determine you have done something to violate the code of conduct.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Based on the terms you agree to when you sign up for Live, the enforcement team are not obligated to give specific information regarding suspensions/bans. If you want to leave suggestions/feedback about the enforcement team, you'd want to post at http://xbox.uservoice.com.</p>

                    I am trying to 'extend my display' to use 2 screens.&nbsp; When I specify 'extend my display' in the Display application, my monitor says 'Input signal out of Range', change settings to 1280 x 1024, however my laptop doesn't allow me to change the resolution

            I would recommend looking at the specifications for your monitor and keyboard to see what resolutions they support.
<br />
<br />It's possible that your monitor does not support the 1280 x 1024 resolution.

            Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried this and it still doesn't work.&nbsp; When I use the 'Duplicate these displays' option, the resolution on my laptop defaults to 1280X1024 and the monitor works.&nbsp; When I change to 'Extend these displays' option the resolution
 changes to 1366X768 and the 1280X1024 is not a resolution available.&nbsp; &nbsp;The external monitor HP Compaq ProDisplay P17A says input signal out of range and the screen goes blank.&nbsp; It says to change to 1280X1024, which I can't do.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am using an adapter to connect
 the monitor to my HDMI connection and not a USB port.&nbsp; Interesting, using the HDMI connector to a TV the 'extend these displays' works at the 1280X1024 resolution setting.&nbsp; &nbsp; Any other ideas?&nbsp; Thanks for your help.

<h2>            Window XP repair</h2>
                    I have an older computer that stopped booting up. What happens is that I get the "Starting Windows" screen, and just before it kicks in, that drive powers down and starts up again. I know the drive is OK, because I can see it by hooking it up to one of
 my other systems. I have tried inserting the original set up CD, but it will not boot (maybe the CD drive is not functioning properly). My guess is that something is corrupt in the OS. I would like to see if I can repair it by hooking it up to my other system
 (Windows 7), and run some kind of repair tool. Is there a certified Microsoft program that will do this?

            <p>I know of no way to effect repair of a (non-)bootable XP hard drive in another PC. Leastways not without knowing why it won't boot in the original PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that you are getting a blue screen crash (also known as BSOD) but that the PC is rebooting too fast for you to see it and give us the important&nbsp;information that it displays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep hitting F8 at boot time and when you get the&nbsp;b&amp;w Windows Advanced Options menu, select the&nbsp;"Disable automatic restart on system failure" option. This should cause the PC to halt when it gets the BSOD so that you can read it. We need to know the BSOD
 type and all of the numbers associated with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you reply, it might prove beneficial for you to tell us about your system. Brand and model of PC at least, Windows XP version and service pack level, hard disk drive type/manufacturer/model and&nbsp;anything else that you think might be useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was this PC mothballed for a long time or has it been in constant use? Have you made any recent changes to the hardware and/or software?</p>

<p>
</p><p>First of all, if the battery has expired:</p>
<p>BIOS will <strong><em>already </em></strong>have been reset and this may well be the cause of your problems. Resetting it again, in all probability, will result in no change - the BIOS settings will automatically reset whenever you switch off the PC (because
 the battery has no "juice" to preserve them).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, if the battery has not expired:</p>
<p>You might just make matters worse rather than better and obscure whatever the current problem is until a new problem can be resolved.</p>

            <p>Thanks for this reply. Frankly, I never saw the BSOD before, but when I tried it per your instructions, it stopped on the blue screen. Here is the message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>STOP: c0000221 {Bad Image Checksum}</p>
<p>The image url.dll is possibly corrupt. The header checksum does not match the computed checksum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a PC that I built myself, about 10 years ago. I have used it on off over the past five years, but it was never mothballed, per se. It's running XP Professional, and I can't remember if it's SP 2 or 3.&nbsp; The drive is a Western Digital 80 GB 7200 rpm.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couple of months back, I was doing some work on this system, and it simply just stopped and tried to reboot itself. Everything seemed fine up to that point.&nbsp; Let&nbsp;me know if there is any other if you need.</p>

            <p>Windows is finding&nbsp;a problem with&nbsp;the file url.dll at boot time, its contents are not what Windows is expecting. First, please make sure that the BSOD specifies url.dll and not urlmon.dll (or some other similar name).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the file is <strong><em>not </em></strong>url.dll then please confirm the exact name of the&nbsp;corrupted file in your next reply and ignore the rest of this post.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the file <strong><em>is </em></strong>url.dll and the rest of this post does not help to get you working again let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you boot into safe mode? Use F8 at boot time as before and select "Safe mode". If you can logon in safe mode you could rename url.dll in C:\Windows\system32&nbsp;to (for example) url.old. Then&nbsp;copy back into C:\Windows\system32&nbsp;its replica, which should exist
 in C:\Windows\system32\dllcache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failing that, if you can get into safe mode you could try to perform a system restore</p>

            One other question - is the url.dll file generic, or it specific to a particular OS?

            <p>Certainly I can say that it is a <strong><em>much</em></strong> bigger file on Windows 7 than it is on&nbsp;XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only place that I would trust to get a replacement url.dll from is C:\Windows\system32\dllcache. The dllcache folder should contain an
<strong><em>exact</em></strong> copy. This should be dictated by Windows File Protection</p>

            <p>Another potential source for SP3 files is if SP3 was installed from a download (not preinstalled or slipstreamed on a fresh install), the unpacked ready to install SP3 files end up in this folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failing that, there is always a copy on my OneDrive and once you get booted on Hiren's, from a working system one can download the file from my OneDrive, copy it to a USB thumb drive (or floppy) and use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em>sneakernet
</em></strong></a>to carry the file to the afflicted system and replace it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that unless you have previously configured your XP to allow access to external media/drives (most people don't do this), you will not be able to replace the file this way from the XP Recovery Console since you will not be able to access the thumb drive
 or floppy (but you can sure try).&nbsp; All the more reason to have Hiren's handy.&nbsp; Copying from folder to folder (under c:\windows) will work with the usual RC folder limitations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The urlmon.dll file is different for IE7 and IE8 so if you need to replace it (there is no other copy found), you need to use the correct one for the version of IE installed, even if you are not using IE that much.&nbsp; Of course both are available on my OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use an IE7 urlmon.dll on an IE8 system, you will see stuff like this:<br />
<br />
explorer.exe - Ordinal Not Found<br />
The ordinal 423 could not be located in the dynamic link library urlmon.dll<br />
<br />
dwwin.exe - Ordinal Not Found<br />
The ordinal 423 could not be located in the dynamic link library urlmon.dll<br />
<br />
You will have an empty desktop (explorer.exe will not start), but Task Manager works.<br />
</p>
<p>Note that there is no url.dll file in XP - there is urlmon.dll and f the urlmon.dll file is corrupt, you will see an error like this:<br />
<br />
STOP: c0000221 {Bad Image Checksum}<br />
The image urlmon.dll is possibly corrupt.&nbsp; The header checksum does not match the computed checksum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your system will not boot in any mode if the file is corrupt (but you can sure try).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the urlmon.dll file is missing, you will see an error like this:<br />
<br />
Explorer.EXE - Unable To Locate Component : This application has failed to start because urlmon.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.<br />
<br />
Since explorer.exe is not running, you will have no desktop (only wallpaper) but can get to a Command Prompt from Task Manager and replace the missing file.<br />
<br />
You can also boot into Safe Mode with Command Prompt and replace the missing file.<br />
<br />
Note that a missing or corrupted c:\windows\system32\urlmon.dll is not replaced by sfc /scannow since that is not what sfc /scannow does, that is not how it works and that is not what it is for.</p>

<p>Useful information (assuming Roger is actually on SP3).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The urlmon.dll file is different for IE7 and IE8</p>

<p>Although Roger hasn't explicitly stated this, it is implicit that the corrupted file is url.dll not urlmon.dll. I did seek confirmation but it was only implied when Roger asked "is the url.dll file generic?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that there is no url.dll file in XP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is on my XP Pro SP3 system. I checked before posting. It is in system32 and it is 104KB. There is also a urlmon.dll (1188KB). The same is true on my XP virtual machine. My experiments also revealed that it is protected by WFP because it gets re-instated
 if I rename it.&nbsp;Even though there is also a copy in dllcache, maybe you can tell me why this doesn't show up my search?</p>

<h2>            Gamertag Availability. </h2>
                    
<p>I'm currently trying to change my Gamertag, but whenever I change it to the one I want, I'm told that it's already in use, even though I've checked the availability of it on three different&nbsp;websites, one of them being the official Xbox website, and I'm told
 by all three websites that it's available.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know why that's happening?<br />
<br />
Or is it "already in use" because it's a banned account or something like that? Similar to what happens to banned YouTube accounts, where the username can no longer be used.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Assuming you are using the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">disk based</span> version of FIFA 2004 - The error message to run the game as admin is a lie.</p>
<p>Running as admin will not help. - The early (up to '05 at least)&nbsp; FIFA games use

<p>MS started blocking the driver used by SafeDisk&nbsp; when they released Win10. I have more details on DRM Blocking in my</p>

</p><p>Games from '04 also rarely benefit from Compatibility with an older Windows version, but there is one Compatibility setting that

<p>OK, and I'm guessing this is a digital copy of the game, yeah?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let's try this:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete the game one more time but note the size </li><li>Head to the Marketplace, and download a game/game demo of as similar size as you can find
</li><li>Leave that other game/demo installed while you redownload the original game </li></ul>

Does that behave at all?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            You don&#39;t currently have permission to access this folder. Click Continue to permanently get access to this folder. &#40;SSD temporarily accessed with another machine&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I've just had spent a very frustrating couple of days dealing with this problem and nothing I tried would enable me to set drive permissions / ownership globally, the only workable option was to manually find problem folders and enable permissions for each
 one.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/badb34b4-e8e3-4e2f-9e04-3ce2f801b683?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/badb34b4-e8e3-4e2f-9e04-3ce2f801b683?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation arose because I removed the (2.5") SSD from my Father's laptop so he could access the files whilst it was sent away for a repair on the hinge mechanism.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>My Dad's laptop is running Windows 8.1</li><li>I put my Dad's drive into a&nbsp;<span>USB 3.0 </span>caddy and connected it to my Laptop in order to gain access to the 'My Documents' folder &amp; copy it to the cloud for him to access remotely.&nbsp;</li><li>My laptop is running Windows 10 (Version 1709)</li></ul>
<p>When I accessed the drive in Windows Explorer, I saw the dialog box above, with the, now very familiar message.
</p>
<p>At the time, I thought nothing of it and clicked 'Continue'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I accessed the drive with no problems, copied the folders my dad needed and unplugged the drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the laptop was returned from repair, I copied the relevant files back on to the SSD, before refitting it and booting the laptop - that's when I started to see error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I quickly established that most programs which start at boot were unable to gain access to various folders necessary for operation and that was why I was seeing errors. For instance, DropBox displayed a message saying it couldn't load because C:\Users\*user
 name*\DropBox was inaccessible.&nbsp;<br />
Sure enough, when I navigated to the folder in question, I saw the dreaded message above. Once I had clicked 'continue' DropBox was able to run normally.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I realised that manually finding and setting rights to folders that were causing problems was lengthy and impractical, so I attempted to find a way of setting permissions for the entire drive - all to no avail.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Can anyone explain what happened to cause this problem and how it can be resolved without manually setting permissions for each and every problem folder?</p>

<p>Hi Rupert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This error might be caused if someone have logged in to the user account and changed the user permissions. For us to better assist you, kindly provide us the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you logged in to the administrator account?</li><li>If so, do you have a password set on your administrator account?</li><li>Do you also have any third party security program or antivirus software installed on the computer?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate the cause of the issue, we suggest that you try booting your computer in Safe Mode with Networking and check if you are able to access the folder. To boot to safe mode, you may follow the steps on this

<p>Hello Anna, thanks for responding to my request.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You state that 'This error might be caused if someone have logged in to the user account and changed the user permissions.'
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was in possession of the SSD the entire time it was&nbsp;removed from&nbsp;the laptop, so there was no chance of the user account being accessed. In addition, the machine remained disassembled until I rebuilt
 it and reinserted the drive in question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the answer to your questions are below and I have also included screen grabs to illustrate my responses:
</p>
<p>•Are you logged in to the administrator account?<strong>&nbsp; Yes</strong></p>
<p>•If so, do you have a password set on your administrator account?<strong>&nbsp; Yes</strong></p>
<p>•Do you also have any third party security program or antivirus software installed on the computer?&nbsp;
<strong>Yes, Avast.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I did not try safe mode, but I&nbsp;did enable the built-in administrator account via cmd.exe (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Net

<p>Hello Gino.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your thoughts on this problem. </p>
<p>I should've pointed out previously that I ran the File and Folder troubleshooter (winfilefolder.DiagCab) when I first encountered the problem and although it appeared to help at first, as soon as the machine was rebooted, the permission problems returned.
</p>
<p>Subsequent use of the troubleshooter made no noticeable difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must also remind you of part of my previous post, in which I explained&nbsp;that I did not experience the permission problems when accessing the same files when logged in using the hidden 'super administrator' account (enabled in the command prompt:
</p>
<p><span><span>This would presumably preclude your suggestion&nbsp;that the issue lies&nbsp;with the integrity of the Windows installation?
</span></span></p>
<p><span>If you really think I should run the SFC.exe and DISM.exe tools, I will have to do it remotely, as I won't be visiting my parents for several weeks.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Incidentally, the </span><span>link you provided returns an error:</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2623670/access-denied-or-other-errors-when-you-access-or-work-with-files-and-f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">"Access
 Denied" or other errors when you access or work with files and folders in Windows</span></a>.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>NB: <span>THE SUPER ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNT HAS SINCE BEEN DISABLED, RETURNING FULL ADMINSITRATOR STATUS TO MY FATHER'S ACCOUNT</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>A&nbsp;further development since my first post:</strong></span>
</p>
<p>My father asked me to reinstall Open Office, which I attempted to do remotely via MSRA.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I right-clicked the Open Office .exe file and chose 'run as administrator'</p>
<p>After unpacking the necessary files into a folder on the desktop, the installer ran normally at first, but then threw up an error message, claiming that the file 'openoffice1.cab' was not found.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>You can see from the screen shot below that it was, in fact visible in the directory with the other unpacked installation files.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a7f52ec2-9e64-493e-8db2-2de11c4a2451?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a7f52ec2-9e64-493e-8db2-2de11c4a2451?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I assumed that the problem had something to do with the wider user permissions issue and so investigated the properties of the 'openoffice1.cab' file.</p>
<p>Below is what I found:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89e66e69-a48e-4d0b-ad31-d969c501a8d0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89e66e69-a48e-4d0b-ad31-d969c501a8d0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, my father's account has full control, but I decided to add another group for 'everyone' and give that full control.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b1eb7f82-3d0d-4f10-9174-963cc5798121?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b1eb7f82-3d0d-4f10-9174-963cc5798121?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That method did the trick and Open Office installed without any problems, but the issue illustrates a key point about the wider permissions problem:</p>
<p>The .cab&nbsp;file in question was created by the system as part of the installation process, but the system (installer) was unable to access it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This shows how fundamental the problem is and that really, only a system-wide permissions solution will resolve it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to point out at this stage that the problem occurred by merely plugging the drive (via a USB cradle) into another machine, essentially as an eternal storage device, similarly to&nbsp;a flash drive.
</p>
<p>How on earth can that simple action have caused such a major problem and HOW CAN IT BE AVOIDED IF I NEEDED TO DO A SIMILAR THING IN FUTURE?</p>

<p>We appreciate the update, Rupert. This is definitely not the usual behavior of Windows. It looks like it may be caused by NTFS permissions being out of whack. Since you mentioned that this issue does not happen on the hidden Administrator account, a workaround
 would be creating a new local account <em>(with admin rights)</em> on your computer and then use it as your main account. You can transfer user related files
<em>(such as documents, desktop, and photos) </em>from the old account to the new account. You will also need to convert the old account first to a local account before converting the new account to a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also refresh the Windows installation. <span>Refreshing your PC reinstalls Windows and keeps your personal files and settings. However, since you are only troubleshooting the PC remotely. This method may not be possible for now. See:
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17085/windows-8-restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to refresh, reset, or restore your PC</a>.</p>

<p>Hello Gino, I read your reply with interest. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What you suggest about NTFS permissions makes some sense to me, as it certainly seems to be created at a higher level in the system than&nbsp;I am able to influence from within the windows environment, which is borne out by the files and folders created by an
 install process suffering from the same issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems pretty clear that some major intervention is required to put it right properly and that would be best done in person hands-on, rather remotely, even if it is technically possible. For the moment, I've got the machine working well enough by manually
 accessing all the folders I can think of that are required (many in the hidden AppData folder) and enabling permissions one at a time where required.
</p>
<p>I think the best thing is if I make a special trip home in the next few weeks and do a refresh.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate a little more info though, as it's not clear how this happened in the first place.
</p>
<p>Could you take a look at my original post and see if you can shed some light? </p>
<p>
</p><p>In years past, I used to regularly remove system drives from desktop computers in order to stick into another one as a slave for mass data transfer or even simply to work on very large data sets (CAD assemblies) on another machine without messing with the
 integrity of the file structure, date stamps etc. </p>
<p>How on earth did accessing my dad's drive in the way I did,&nbsp;end up causing all this trouble?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I certainly don't want to run into this problem again, so any guidance now will help avoid major pain if I ever need to do something similar again..</p>

<p>Connecting a system drive&nbsp;(drive with an OS installation) to a different computer as a slave drive should be safe and not cause problems. However, it can cause Windows and file system permission issues especially if the other computer is taking ownership
 of the files or folders. Additionally, UAC protections may also cause this issue
<em>(You may try disabling UAC and check if the issue will persist)</em>.</p>

<h2>            Low FPS in games like CS GO, with high specs.</h2>
                    <p>Hello :)<br />
I have a problem with FPS lags when i play Counter-Strike Global Offensive.</p>
<p>I just made a fresh windows 10 install (ofc legit) to make sure it wasn't some random thing that could be fixed with a fresh install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Specs are:</p>
<p>- Intel i5-6402P CPU @ 2.80 GHz</p>
<p>- Nvidia Geforce GTX 980 4GB</p>
<p>- 8 GB ram</p>
<p>- 120 GB SSD Harddisk</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when i play CS GO i get like 60-140 FPS in LOW graphics, even when i put it to HIGH graphics i get the same amount of FPS, so its not a question about my gamesettings.
</p>
<p>When i play other games like League of Legends or so, i get like 250-300 FPS on high settings, so what could it be?</p>
<p>I get a random bunch of "stuttering lag" when i get shot at, when i press "escape" to open the game "menu" and just do like anything in the game i also get lags. If i see another enemy i get heavy lags aswell.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe a year ago i used to run CS GO with 300 FPS and it should be good to go?</p>
<p>After i reboot my computer svchost.exe is using 40% of my CPU (just after reboot).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope some one have a solution or just some tips for a sad gamer. </p>

            <p>Do you have frame limiting turn on in your game settings? High frame count is nice, but anything over 60 isn't necessary and having an uncapped frame rate&nbsp;cause slowdown and tearing.</p>

<h2>            Cisco AnyConnect issues</h2>
                    <p>Hey!<br />
&nbsp;I've been running Windows 10 for a while. School just started and I just found out the VPN software that my school now uses for the Wifi (Cisco Anyconnect) does not work. I only know that IT is working on the issue. It is apparantly an issue with Windows 8
 computers that upgraded to Windows 10. My current problem is trying to uninstall the program. When I tried to reinstall the program, the install got stuck. I killed the install process, but that left the Cisco Software on my system. Is there any way to fix
 this uninstall issue? Also, is Microsoft trying to fix the Cisco non-compatibility issue?<br />
