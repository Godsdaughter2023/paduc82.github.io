<h2>            1080p on 1080i Television Error. Please Help</h2>
                    
<p>My roomate tried changing the settings on my xbox so that instead of displaying 720p it would display 1080p. &nbsp;The problem is that my television doesn't do 1080p. It only does 1080i or 720p. &nbsp;Now my XBOX ONE is stuck on 1080p and I have no way of changing
 it back to 720 because the TV wont display anything. &nbsp;Is there a way around this problem without plugging it into a TV thats 1080p?</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

            <p><span>Hello Michael, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>If you had a 3-party antivirus program on your PC when you upgraded, you can possibly resolve your problem by upgrading to the latest version of your antivirus program or by uninstalling and reinstalling your antivirus program.</p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As a next step, try running the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=271185" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Apps troubleshooter</a>. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If your modern apps contain an “X” on the tile and won’t launch, try uninstalling and reinstalling one of the affected apps in the Store.&nbsp; If the app’s framework is corrupted, this will fix all apps that are affected by that framework.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Some other possible causes for this problem:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Your screen resolution is below 1024 x 768</span></p>
<p><span>2. Your video driver is not updated</span></p>
<p><span>3. UAC (User Account Control)&nbsp;is disabled</span></p>
<p><span>4. You are logged into the Built-In Administrator account</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks, <br />
<br />
Marilyn </span></p>

            I had the same problem. internet access via the Desktop was fine but the App Store was saying I wasn't connected to the internet. After a lot of installing &amp; uninstalling I decided to uninstall AVG internet security 2012, this cured my problem. I installed
 AVG free Antivirus 2013 which works fine. My 2012 Internet Security still has 10 months to run, if AVG come up with a solution for 2012 then I&nbsp;will reinstall.

<br />
<div>=============================================<br />
Two possibilities:<br />
<br />
1) Renaming or deleting the following file:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "PreviouslyAcquired.db"&nbsp;&nbsp; </div>
<div>should allow the photos to be downloaded again.<br />
<br />
Find the file at the following location:<br />
<br />
C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Photo<br />
Acquisition\PreviouslyAcquired.db<br />
<br />
Rename to&nbsp; :&nbsp; PreviouslyAcquired.OLD<br />
<br />
If you cannot find the file you may need to change your<br />
settings to "Show Hidden Files".<br />
<br />
Try the following steps in Windows 7:<br />
<br />
Go to.....Start button / Control Panel / Appearance<br />
and Personalization / Folder Options / Advanced<br />
settings / Show hidden files, folders, and drives / OK<br />
<br />
Now find and rename the file.<br />
<br />
Try to re-import your photos.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Connect the camera to the PC via USB cable and<br />
turn the camera on.<br />
<br />
Close any windows that may open.<br />
<br />
Go to...Start / Computer / Devices With Removable<br />
Storage...<br />
<br />
Look at the drive letters and see if one of them<br />
represents the camera. It may say Removable Disk<br />
<br />
If the camera is recognized...right click the drive letter<br />
and from the menu choose...Open or Explore.<br />
<br />
The directory of the memory card in the camera should<br />
be displayed and if you navigate through the various<br />
folders you should find the photo files.<br />
<br />
Once found...you can copy/paste the photos to a folder<br />
on your hard drive.<br />
<br />
Simple and best solution IMHO is to use an internal<br />
or external USB Memory Card reader.<br />
<br />
It won't drain your camera batteries and may be faster.<br />
FWIW...downloading from the camera when batteries<br />
may be low after a long photo shoot could result in<br />
corrupted photos.<br />

<p>-checked wired connection- it was ok<br />-the typical reboot PC- no luck<br />-uninstall drivers for both the controller and the wireless adapter. It works on until the controller disconnects fro being idle, then goes back to only connecting for a brief second<br />-checked both the adapter and controller on another computer, they worked just fine<br />-checked the elite's batteries in other controllers, work just fine<br />-Tried connecting another regular Xbox controller, it disconnected the same as the elite<br />-the device manager wasn't registering it as an xbox one controller, said it was a generic Xinput HID controller, I manually searched for the xbox one driver and installed it, worked until the controller went idle, then goes back to only connecting for a brief second.<br />-early on when the issue first started there was some conflict with visual C++ runtime library, I uninstalled any packages dated earlier than 2010 and updated the rest, and it removed that issue<br />-When I check the event

<p>It could be because you are not an Xbox LIVE Gold member. Do get exclusive passes, (like this one) you'll need that.

<p>Like miss Keleo said, and this is true it does pop up </p>
<p>When you load BF3 select "Multiplayer", enter your account information and then you should be asked if you'd like to purchase an online pass it will pop up asking you to buy the pass but if you cant get your card working or would like to try it for free
 2 days here is a pass.</p>

            <p>I also have the same problem. Using Win7 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using the GWX.exe which after about an hour it finally went to the windows update screen.. downloaded from 0% to 100% and then went to the next few tasks. After it was finished it went back to the original "2,936,3MB total, 0% complete..." only thing
 my HD is now has 18g less space..</p>
<p>
</p><p>pagefile.sys (new file I all of a sudden have on my PC) is taking up 15g of space but even if I could delete that it would still not be enough to try the whole thing over because there's still 3g (assuming this is the actual Win 10 file) unaccounted for
 somewhere in the update process and my free space was very limited already and I will not meet the minimum space required to try to download and install a second copy of Win 10. It downloaded. I watched it finished. I just can't locate it and Win 7 to manually
 delete it all to try again. And Win update does not recognize that it's already downloaded and will not just install it. I tried using the Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant application but it wants me to start from the beginning as well and will not let me attempt
 to install because I do not meet the minimum space required to begin. (I had 22g free when I first attempted this update and it bugged out on me..)</p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>W10 Blue Notification Will Not Disappear - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arthur p goan  say:</h3>
<h2>            W10 Blue Notification Will Not Disappear</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>Mine is&nbsp;perhaps unusual. Many times when I boot up my Surface Pro 4 I get the standard notifications to the bottom right of my screen. These could be for mail, FB or indeed anything. They will not disappear as they should after a few seconds. Instead they
 remain at the bottom of the screen and I can't remove them. This is always accompanied by the sounds not working at all. If I continue to use the system it will eventually hang in whatever app I am using and I am forced to switch the device off with the power
 button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone experienced this? I am running 393.187.</p>

<p>Many thanks for reply. Problem is that I have to reboot anyway because the system has stopped&nbsp; and when I do so all is fine again. This happens perhaps three times in ten when I boot up the Surface. It is odd really because, when it happens (and it did again
 this morning) my sounds do not work either and the physical rectangular box (notification) remains at the bottom right of the screen. I did check sound controllers in device manager and all looked fine there with&nbsp;no yellow exclaimation marks. &nbsp;For a test on
 this occasion I opened Groove and none of my songs would play and I am guessing this is because my sounds were not working. All of this is tied into the notifications. This morning, when I rebooted, I turn off notifications in settings . Will update this thread
 in a few days.</p>

            I find now that, if I disable Realtek sounds sat in device manager the problem goes away in that the notification goes away as it should. I did delete Realtek and its driver and reinstalled but the issue came back. Any ideas?

What printer do you have? Does it not print from all applications or just some? Is this a new problem or has it always been this way? If it's a new problem, what did you change around the time it started? Has it ever been able to print? Have you installed a
 Windows 7 driver for it? What are the things you've tried?</p>

<h2>            Open favorites in current File Explorer window</h2>
                    <p>Friendly greetings!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to <strong><em>not </em></strong>have your favorites in the File Explorer open in a new window every time you click them, but have them open in the current window, like in previous Windows? Can someone please guide me to the corresponding
 options I have to set for this? Because, I prefer to right click and select 'Open in new window', if I want it open in a new window.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows + R keys</strong>, type <strong>inetcpl.cpl </strong>
in run window and press Enter.<br />
b. Under "<strong>General</strong>" tab, click "<strong>Tabs</strong>" button.<br />

            <p>Hello and thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, it does not help. I was not talking about bookmarks or an Internet Explorer, this solely relates to the (local) File Explorer as the Explorer is now called in Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows + E</strong> keys</p>
<p>b. look at top left corner</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the favorites/folders/locations I am talking about, like Desktop, Recent places, Downloads and whatever you drop there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if you click on <strong>View </strong>in the ribbon above and then <strong>
Options </strong>there are some options to configure certain aspects, but opening the favorite location in the same window, as it was in any other Windows before Windows 8 seems to be no option there as far as I see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, even if you wanted to open the location in the same window i.e. by right clicking on it and choosing a corresponding action from the context menu, all you get are more options to open the folder in a new window..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that makes my initial post clearer.</p>

            Hello and thank you for your reply.<br />
<br />
I checked the option you mention in your post ("open each folder in same window") and it was set.. to my surprise, as the Explorer clearly showed a different behaviour. I switched the option to "open all in a separate window", applied that settings, then switched
 back to "open all folders in one window" and applied that.. just in case. Anyway, I clicked through the favourites to test whether something changed and I found that some folders open in the same Explorer window and some do not and open a new window instead.<br />
<br />
The difference between these folders was the address to them. Some had the explicit path in the address bar (blue monitor icon, 'This PC - C:\Users\My User\My Folder') and some linked to my user directory (green user icon, 'My User\My Folder') - same folder,
 different addresses.<br />
<br />
I was able to solve this for me by identifying the Favorite folders that make a new window pop up and recreating their corresponding Favorites shortcuts with an explicit link to the folder on the file system. They were linking to the folder via user directory
 address before.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your support!<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />

</p><p>I have been using the system for a few more days now and it still shows the mentioned behavior from time to time.. was just a temporary fix it seems. I'd be glad if the Microsoft guys could fix this bug.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
We want to know more about your concern. Regarding the plug in keyboard that is attached, are you pertaining to the type cover of the Surface Pro 3? Also, have you done any recent changes on your device prior to this?

            <p>Let's us go ahead and troubleshoot the issue by making sure that all the latest Surface and Windows updates are installed on your device. Here's the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/performance-and-maintenance/install-software-updates-for-surface?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> on how to check and install updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, we suggest that you do a two-button shutdown. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.</p>
<p>2. Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds, and then release both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.<br />
3. After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

                    <p>Trying to watchNetflix&nbsp; in my bedroom the other night and it wouldn't work, "having trouble connecting with network".</p>
<p>&nbsp;Looked at my wireless network in control panel and found that I&nbsp; have something called a BRCM router in my network. My question is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;what is this BRCM router?</p>
<p>What does it do?</p>
<p>Why won't my wireless work, I've never had any problems with it for years?</p>
<p>Can I remove it from my network without causing any problems?</p>

<p>That is almost certainly your router ("BRCM" is short for "Broadcom" which is the manufacturer of the chip used in many routers).&nbsp; Do not remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting with whatever is the source of your Internet service -- e.g., a wire coming out of the wall -- please list the make and model (as shown on the manufacturer's label) of each device between that source and your computer.&nbsp; Most home connections will
 have either one device (a "modem" with built-in wireless capability) or two devices (a modem and a separate wireless router).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Network Map," if that's where you're seeing this router, is notoriously inaccurate and confusing.&nbsp; Please include a screenshot of what you're looking at when your see the "BRCM router" (directions here:&nbsp;

    <title>WORST SYSTEM EVER - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            WORST SYSTEM EVER</h2>
                    
<p>I am selling my console if i can as soon as i can or throwing it away the minute i come home with a PS4. I have ALWAYS BEEN a loyal xbox owner and never owned a ps3 (though i have played them and never had any issues with them). I was very excited about
 the Xbox one and this was the earliest i have ever bought a system so close to the release date. I knew there would be bugs to work through and that i would need to be patient with the updates as they came. I actually did not play much other than titanfall
 when i first bought the system because all of the games that were out were just ***. I thought sniper elite had potential but after owning it for weeks xbox failed to get me into a lobby of more than just 2-3 players all but one time when there was a 2v2...
 still was pretty fun. I talked to other players on there and they said they were having the same difficulty finding a lobby that had more players in it.... no big deal maybe it just wasn't a popular game.... ill give Microsoft the benefit of the doubt. As
 time went on i became bored with the system until finally MADDEN then COD came out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However the constant issues with partying up with my friends was getting too much to bear. We would spend a minimum of 45 minutes a night JUST trying to get the party to work if at all. We went through the xbox merry go round of resetting our xboxes then
 loading titan fall then doing a hard reset then changing party leader then starting back at resetting the xbox, loading titan fall, then re-loading COD checking if that was the right host then going back and each player would do another hard reset and this
 would continue until we would finally be able to all get into one lobby and not have any issues. In case i lost you there we would have to load TITANFALL to get COD to work! you heard me right. It was the right mixture of number of resets to number of hard
 resets to number of titanfall loads (or another game) vs the number of party leader changes and the number of times you re-loaded xbox and the party app. It was a joke.... and most of the time still is. You dont even want to know how frustrated we all get
 when someone accidentally backs out or gets kicked once we do get it to work because we have to start the xbox merry go round all over again!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blame it on Call of duty ... right xbox? NO it was not just call of duty it was also madden. And on top of that both games would just decide to kick you from your game randomly and that was always a blast because if it was call of duty that means there goes
 the next 45 minutes trying to get the *** party to work right again, and if it was madden you just lost ALL OF YOUR PROGRESS IN YOUR CURRENT GAME which to me is even more annoying. You just wasted the last hour of your life in a game that you have to restart!
 So maybe blame it on each of your games... blame both call of duty or/and madden.... hmm... maybe it is xbox live? No still too many issues that are unrelated. My xbox wont recognize me, it wont load a game, it wont load all of the other apps, it says the
 kinnect is disconnected.... which of course it isnt and you can even talk into it and give it commands even though apparently it is disconnected... ya ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next i was thinking maybe i got a bad system.... hmmm nope not that either!!!!!! all 3 of the other guys i play with experience all of the exact same issues constantly. So for each hour i waste on my xbox *** up can be multiplied by 4 just for the four of
 us. Meanwhile we are supposed to not only pay half of a grand for this system and an additional $70 each game and not to mention a scam of $60 a year on xbox live which works consistently so rarely i spend more time trying to get my system to work than actually
 enjoying myself each night!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a full time job and have waited patiently for xbox to get their *** together far too long. I like to spend my free time relaxing and playing xbox with my friends. There has been ABSOLUTELY MINIMAL relaxation time with this joke of a system. I cant
 believe the amount of $ i have wasted on this crap not to mention the time i spent trying to play with my friends rather than time i should have been spending with them elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hate this system so much that after wasting WELL OVER 100 hours doing nothing but play the right tricks to get the system to work that i decided to start a log of it. I decided i would start from February 11th (when i actually started it) so that i can
 have all accurate information. I am primarily regretful because i wish i would have started from the second i bought this system and logged every wasted second and every penny i put into it but late is better than never. Keep in mind this is a looooonnnnggggg
 time after i bought the system and they had multiple chances to fix whatever bugs that came out with the system when i bought it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also keep in mind most of the entries include anywhere from 2 to 4 people ... not just myself that is wasting time. The entries vary anywhere from party issues to connection issues, from madden making a crazy noise and resetting to getting booted out of
 a exo zombie map on level 19 of call of duty (took us over an hour to get there) to controllers randomly loosing its connection to the game you are playing ... though you can still go to the xbox home screen and use it when you return to the game it is not
 recognized. This list includes the system itself sitting on the xbox home screen and you can select whatever app or game you want and it making a noise like you selected it but in fact it is not loading anything, it is not going anywhere it is not doing anything...
 select multiple apps if you like nothing will happen. The list also includes the xbox freezing and much much much more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most recent and the newest that really blew my top off is all of the sudden not only did it not recognize me but even after i signed in the xbox pretended like it had never seen the games i have been playing for the last few months ever!!!! i had to
 re-watch all intro demo videos to each game, had to accept licenses and agreements/terms and conditions for the game i have already done this to and been playing for a long time already. Somehow though it doesnt recognize i have played the game before it still
 lets me load my last savepoints (seasons in madden) right where i left off... but with a wrinkle all settings are reset! everything!!! doesnt sound that serious but it is! gameplay views, sensitivity, button layouts, gameplay settings, etc... etc... etc...
 stuff that i dont even know how it was set to previously but its all gone now. I am hoping it will fix itself because after a hard reset and trying different games with the same result i have again lost my patients.</p>
<p>This is going to be sold or given away if it doesnt fix itself (which actually happens quite often with this pos).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case if not left satisfied by you microsoft xbox i am taking my log book/ spread sheet of dates of issues, time spent/wasted and issue notes and taking it to all social media that i can. As i said i have 3 other friends that all experience the same
 issues so it can not be blamed on my console either. I have highlighted on my spreadsheet when it includes more than just me and am going to send each of them a copy of when it messed up and they were involved as they have already agreed to go to social media
 with it if i send it to them as they are equally dissapointed and feel taken advantage of by microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is just a rough draft (as there are many grammatical errors as well as this not being put together very well), but i promise you i will be editing and adding my spreadsheet and sending it in to you MICROSOFT as well as all social media me and my friends
 are connected to and make sure we get it to go as viral as 4 grown men can. I am connected to a few video gamers groups and will warn them away from xbox one when they get the chance if it isn't too late. I am the leader in my small group on this and we are
 already talking about playstation sooner rather than later especially since it has MLB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to your response or lack there of. Either way i am prepared to take the time i would spend playing on my $500+ system that doesnt work and putting that time into making sure other potential customers stay far away from the xboxone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am VERY DISAPPOINTED in the xbox live crew as well as the lack of updates for the system. When i get into a game and there are 12 people in it and we all get kicked it really gets to me that there were 12 people that are paying $100 each (game + xbox live
 membership) that were just robbed from something they worked hard to pay for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your profit from the system out weighs your care to make it run smoothly far too much for my liking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ya this console is extremely buggy, 2014 was the year of unfinished buggy games. Takes Microsoft months to finally put an engineer on certain issues. Gaming consumers pretty much have no protection from the abuse. Can't wait to see the first serious class
 action lawsuit against Microsoft and gaming publishers for releasing unfinished products. Probably will fail anyways when the prosecutors and judges get donations from the gaming industry to rule in their favor and turn a blind eye. Gotta love humanity and
 our thirst for greed.</p>

            <p>Hey there, Rufio135669! I'm very sorry to see any issues you may be running into! To see if we can rule out everything possible, could you please post up what the model and manufacturer information is for both your router and your modem? We can double check to ensure that the devices don't have any known issues that could be causing the troubles. Also, could you please let me know if you have multiple consoles in the house as well? Certain devices can't handle more than one Xbox, and this can cause a majority of the symptoms you describe. Get back to me with that information and we'll see what we can nail down! :D</p>
<p>OUTLAWXXX - I'm sorry to see that you, too, are experiencing issues! So that we can get you some individual support, please post up a new thread detailing what you're running into and troubleshooting you've completed. Thanks for understanding!</p>

<p>Sure can Misses Quinzel,</p>
<p>But i want to make you aware (in case i blabbed on too much about other things) all of these issues are common with myself and the 3 friends i play with almost daily. One of which bought his system around the same time i did with different internet (most
 likely different modem and router), one of them bought his system at least 6-10 months after the first of us two did (similar situation) and the last is in a different state and bought it midway through. So what i am getting at is that i find it hard to believe
 we will be able to blame it on internet, modems, routers, different games, bad batch of xbox systems, etc.... they are common issues with almost everyone i know who owns xbox ones.
</p>
<p>However i am willing to go through whatever we need to, to prove this to you including getting details and i can tell you down to the exact order of puzzles i have to go around to get the system to work when it is acting up.
</p>
<p>Modem: Motorola SB5101 Surfboard</p>
<p>Internet provider: Time Warner Cable</p>
<p>Router: Netgear N600 Dual Band Router (WNDR3400v2)</p>
<p>I am willing to try whatever equipment you guys are willing to send me to make my xbox work ;-)</p>
<p>Again, not to be rude but i dont want this to get into the blame game, i am logging all issues that will and do prove what the issue is NOT. My only regret is that i waited until i already had the xbox one too long before i started logging this information.
 I knew there would be bugs in the first year or so and was patient initially. 100% honesty, i had issues the entire time i have owned it and i did not log a single one until after i had issues with it 7 out of 8 nights in a row with it.... all various. This
 was long after i bought it and the issues should have been fixed (as many were by then). Those i did not log, but did make the decision for me to start logging everything. Though i have missed a few issues out of laziness this list is piling up quick.

<p>Out of curiosity, do you have your ports forwarded correctly for your Netgear? This will result in an Open NAT, instead of a Strict NAT, which causes many problems. The Surfboard Modem I believe is supposed to be quite reliable (I've heard many who use it
 with Xbox) though I don't know much about that particular router. I do know, though, that if you don't have your ports forwarded or, as Misses Quinzel stated, if you have multiple consoles, that there can be MAJOR issues with a number of online services. The
 different ports that need to be opened control everything from dashboard behavior to party and multiplayer connectivity issues and drops.</p>
<p>Also, if I'm not mistaken, then N 600 is a wireless router, correct? Oftentimes, devices that use the same band and frequency can interrupt the signal of other devices and cause connections to be dropped.</p>
<p>Let us know!</p>

            <p>I really do appreciate you providing that for me, Rufio! Believe me, I do understand that there are others running into this issue. There are several devices that can cause issues with certain settings, and it does appear you have one of them.<br /><br />The Netgear WNDR3400 has a known issue where Preamble Mode should be set to short. This should resolve any issues if you are connected wirelessly. You can change this setting by logging into the router and (if you are on Netgear Genie) selecting&nbsp;<strong>Advanced</strong> at the top, then <strong>Advanced Setup</strong> on the left. In the <strong>Wireless Settings</strong> there will be an option for Preamble Mode. Go ahead and ensure that is set to <strong>short</strong> for me. Connect up and see how your games are after that.<br /><br />If you are not wireless, please give what Jaymo suggested a try. Port forwarding is really terrific to help out connection issues as well. They won't work if you have multiple consoles, though! It will j

<p>Well so far i am at a record # of days without something going wrong... almost a week.
</p>
<p>I am actually wired directly into my xbox so that i could rule out the wifi. Shouldn't this rule out the preamble mode (though i am not sure what that is)?</p>
<p>I do have an xbox 360, but it is not connected to the network.....yet/still. </p>

<p>Well that did not last very long. More issues to log into my spreadsheet only 15 or so minutes after being proud that my unit did not mess up and almost a week!!!! Turned on xbox, signed in (through facial recognition on kinnect). When I clicked on my game
 it made a sound showing that I clicked on it but it never loaded. I clicked on several things that did not load. Turned off the system and turned it back on, signed out and signed back in, . None of these fixed the issue which by the way this is a common issue
 but probably my favorite issue because it does not happen in the middle of a game and this time I did not have people waiting on me so I was not wasting three other people's time as well as my own due to the Xbox not working correctly. Eventually I had to
 do a hard system reset and it worked. Again this is usually my favorite error because it only takes around 10 minutes to fand usually it does get fixed that same night and I do not give up after getting frustrated. I work out on a daily basis and I try to
 get in a game before I work out to let me relax a little after work and before my workout. But when I get constant issues with my system I get zero relaxed time but it does help with my workout. It just amazes me how often something goes wrong with the stupid
 system.</p>

            <p>Oh no! I'm sorry to see that issues have crept back up! You are correct that being wired would rule out the preamble, which is related to wireless. I wasn't sure which way you were set up, so I wanted to be sure you were aware of that setting!</p>
<p>The router you have should support multiple consoles, however you need to be sure that you do not have port forwarding or DMZ set up for either of them. This will cause issues with either one.</p>
<p>Could you please&nbsp;<strong>Test multiplayer connection&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Detailed network statistics</strong> on your console under <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/network-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Network Settings</a>? Please post back with a screenshot (uploaded to a site and provided via a link) so that we can review your situation. Your symptoms are still very much saying something is going on with your network, so I want to make sure that it is ruled out completely. :3<strong><br /></strong></p>

<p>Rufio that was spot on! All those issues and more for me. Netflix and my blu-ray player don't work. It's a Junk box one. I have a group of friends who I always game with, have with them since the 360. They live all over the states and a few in England. It
 all used to work great on the 360. It's never been smooth on the one and now it is utter garbage. They can't possibly try and blame your router or modem or internet, mine used to work fine but it doesn't now I didn't didn't change anything on my internet.
 maybe they should have FOCUSED ON GAMERS because that's what the original xbox was for. i switched to the 360 after playing a friends xbox when the next Gen after the ps2 came out. Wish I would have stuck with sony. Microsoft should send an Xbox that works
 for us to play on while they fix their trash. Remember the red ring of death &nbsp;Microsoft, I do. I had it twice. Ever think that all these issues is something to do with your cap box?</p>

<h2>            V8 Supercars 3</h2>
                    
<p><span>I Thought I would get in the swing of Bathurst Week end by playing V8 Supercars 3 xbox version my 360, only to find it is not backwards compatible for the 360 GRRRRRRRRR! This annoyed me as my
 orginial PS3 which could play PS2 games died the beginning of this year also, so I have no way of playing this awesome game on my PS3 nor 360, unless I drag my old Xbox out which I have given to my kids to use. I then started to do some research and found
 that since V8 Supercars 3 there has not been any game for the Xbox 360 or PS3 with as much Australian content ( tracks and cars ) that I am aware of. Forza 3 has a few cars, NFS shift 2 has Bathurst buit no cars. I am totally disapointed about this especially
 that Codemasters could not produce an update or patch so the xbox game could be played on 360 :(<br />
<br />
Does anybody else share my frustration??</span></p>

<p>^^^^^I was positive that was how you would spin it. &nbsp;Even if I bought this excuse of yours, which I dont, your post just reeks of hipocrisy given that you never once mentioned the post was a year old (which you do nearly every time you post in a resurrected
 thread), you didnt quote one of the 'new posts', and even though you mentioned superstars V8 which was in the post above yours, your post is very sympathetic to the OP. &nbsp;None of which matters exactly. &nbsp;The fact is, you responded to a year old bumped thread
 as if it was current.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I dont really care that you responded to the thread per se. &nbsp;I couldnt care less how old it is. &nbsp;And everyone makes mistakes and mispells or doesnt read the date or whatever. &nbsp;What bothers me is that you do indeed (in your own words) ridicule others for
 what we all, including you, do a lot on here, and which there is very little way to avoid, which is why I point it out when you do it. &nbsp;I implore you ("you
<em>implore</em> me? &nbsp;you <em>implore</em> me?") to stop correcting/ridiculing/etc for meaninless mistakes, for misread dates or spelling or whatever. &nbsp;If you were mistake free it would be one thing (although still slightly annoying), but you arent and that
 makes it much worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure you will post again to show how I am totally off base here. &nbsp;Do what you want and you will get the last word, but if you miss the point of what I am saying and why I am asking for it, that is what makes the forums, for me, a very useless place
 for real discussion. &nbsp;And that is the heart of the matter to me and why I posted in this thread in the first place.</p>

<br />
As you yourself have pointed out I mention the post is a year old "Nearly" every time. Not all the time.&nbsp;There are maybe half a dozen times when I have not. Each of those times is also a time I have added to what has been said by some one who posted recently.&nbsp;You
 can find them if you like.<br />
<br />
You say my post is very sympathic to the OP? I don't once mention the OP, or what he posted about. My response is only to The post above me and refers to what was posted in that.</p>
<p><br />
As for not believing what some one says, I don't believe your reasons for posting, I think at the heart of the matter it was an attempt to do what you have been trying to do for so long and failed to do at every turn, you were just trying to show me up. it's
 actually the only time you seem to respond to any of my posts. Each one seems to be a failure to one up me. Just as you have failed here.<br />
<br />
And yes, I do on occasion have typos in my posts when I don't have time to proof read them. That's all well and good. Most peoples typos I don't pick on, or I try and make something funny out of it. But when people repeatedly mispell the most basic words or
 butcher common phrases then posting a correction is not picking on them to me. <br />
<br />
And you know what? if people took the time to take my typos and make something funny of them I would not be bothered by it, Hopefully it would be funny and I would get a chuckle or two from it.<br />
<br />
How many threads here have derailed because some one says "I could care less?" Quite a few. So I believe that quite a few people here are of the opinion that the english language should be used properly and I guess respected, rather than butchered and then
 the phrase "itz da Interw3bz" used as an excuse for it.<br />
<br />
Also, just want to say, nice job derailing this thread.</p>
