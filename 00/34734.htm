 so I just deleted the X partition where documents was stored (after copying them to ofther drive) and merged the c drive.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 activation issue</h2>
                    <p>Hey all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've logged in to my laptop today and encountered a problem regarding my Windows 10 activation. In the settings, it said: "We can't activate Windows on this device because we can't connect to your organisation's activation server... If you continue having
 problems with activation, contact your organisations' support person. Error code: 0xC004F074".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, the troubleshoot mentioned that it has found a Windows 10 Home digital licence for this device running Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; I'm unsure how to proceed with this issue and any advice will be very much appreciated. Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Michael
<br />
<br />Thank you for the screenshot . . .
<br />
<br />You are running the volume licence version of Windows 10, that may have been installed when you sent your system in for repair, a lot of repair shops do this, to save them the bother of properly applying your licence
<br />
<br />The only option you will have is to backup your data and clean install the Home version of Windows 10, that will then self-activate once it is installed, because that is the version your system is licenced for . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything&nbsp;!
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Click this link:&nbsp;
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10&nbsp;

            Hi Michael
<br />
<br />No problem, by data, I mean all your personal files, from where ever you store those on your PC, that will include Documents, Pictures, videos Music . . .etc
<br />
<br />If you use the default saving methods in Windows 10, those files should be stored in your User Library folders (Documents, Pictures . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />After the clean install you will then need to re-install all 3rd party applications (including Office, if applicable) that you previously had installed on your PC . . .

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Look on the bottom of the computer and on any paperwork or disks that came with the unit.<br />
<br />
These can be checked in Safe Mode as well - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot.<br />
<br />
If the system still runs you can use these to access your product key. These are not cracks, they<br />
only recover your existing key.<br />
<br />
Use one of these to recover it from your machine if possible.</p>

    <title>Setting up two separate audio devices in &#39;playback devices&#39;, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> silk186  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting up two separate audio devices in &#39;playback devices&#39;, passed tone test but no sound.</h2>
                    <p>I have three audio devices connected to my computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>HDMI - TV (updated ATI drivers to fix this)</li><li>Analog (green) - Monitor</li><li>Analog (black) - speakers</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Initially the monitor and speakers played the same output simultaneously. I wanted to be able to switch between outputs in 'play back devices'.</p>
<p>In Realtek HD Audio Manager I changed two settings "Make Front and Rear output devices playback two different audio streams simultaneously" and "disable front panel jack detection". Now I have three devices in 'playback devices', TV, Monitor and Speakers.
 The TV and Speakers work correctly, but my monitor doesn't have sound despite passing the tone test. When a video is play, the green bar goes up and down in playback devices but no sound.</p>

<p>Hi Silk 86,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that there's a conflict on the changes made. May I know where is the monitor connected? Is it on the front panel? If not, are both the speakers and monitor connected to the analog rear panel? If one of the audio outputs is connected to the front
 panel, try enabling the front panel jack detection and see if both the monitor and speakers work simultaneously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Vanessa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both devices are connected to the rear analog ports. This is the configuration the worked separately prior to reset. After resetting windows, both&nbsp;<span>the monitor and speakers work simultaneously. With the setting in Realtek
 the monitor and speakers appear as separate&nbsp;devices in playback devices but only the speakers work correctly.</span></p>

</strong>or Right click on task bar and select Task manager.</span></li><li><span>Go to<strong> Details </strong>tab.</span></li><li><span>Locate <strong>Runtimebroker.exe </strong>and see if it is running or not, then

<p>Hope it helps. Let us know if you need further assistance and we'll be glad to help.</p>

            Sorry but that did not help me. I am still not able to open the settings menu on my pc. And it still gives me the same error as i have stated above. Is there any other solution. Don't know what happened with the pc but now i note along with the settings
 menu another problem has arisen. The problem is i have a limited data pack on my dongle which is 6Gb per month. But now i notice that even i don't use my pc still some application or something is consuming my data as the application on the dongle shows and
 the data consumption becomes so fast that it consumes around 200 Mb in 5 mins sometimes so please help me with these two problems at the earliest.<br />

            After upgrading to Windows 10 I found out my laptop model was apparently not compatible with Windows 10 &amp; so I want to roll it back to the previous version (Windows 7) before my 30 days is up. Unfortunately, I need to get to my settings menu to do that.
 I set RuntimeBroker as high priority, but still not working. Really want to get this problem resolved before my 30 days are up.

<h2>            KB4103721 Win10 can&#39;t boot, spinning blue wheel, safe mode BSOD</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>with the last update to Windows 10 1803 everything worked ok, until <strong>KB4103721
</strong>appeared. Right after installing it and restarting PC I couldn't login, there was only<strong> black screen with spinning blue wheel</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened on 4 PCs that I was repairing, all of them where Dell Optiplex 990 with SSD drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here some solutions I made to repair:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Going to safe mode and uninstalling&nbsp;KB4103721, after that in windows hiding it with this tool:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3183922/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-windows-update-from-reinstalling-in-windo on this PC&nbsp;Windows 10 1803 is still operating
 normally, delayed all updates in windows settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Booting system to recovery mode (starting windows, and when win logo appeared plugged off power, after 3rd time it went to repairing mode), and I could choose advance and restore previous windows version (FCU 1709).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Last solution on 3rd PC didn't go so smoothly. I couldn't restore it to previous version, got errors that it's impossible to restore it. Starting safe mode caused BSOD. Automatic repair couldn't repair the problem. When I dig it little more I got info
 that Windows was unable to repair and logs are in C:\windows\System32\LogFiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt and in it this "Important file C:\efi\microsoft\boot\resources\custom\bootres.dll is corrupted | Error code 0x57". So in this case luckily I had a disc copy from
 a week ago, so I restored it, but update&nbsp;KB4103721 was already on it so I had to uninstall it and clear windows update download, it still keep installing on restart, so I recovered PC again, uninstalled that KB and switched in windows setting to boot into
 safe mode, after third restart to safe mode it stopped installing that KB (it shown unable to install, rolling back), every-time deleted everything that was in&nbsp;C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other weird thing on 4th PC I installed update 1803 and that KB. For testing I turned PC of from Windows with close option and when PC was turned off, unplugged power cord, plugged it back after a minute and started PC, there was no black screen. This happened
 on PC that before restoring drive copy had this issue with black screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also checked that with this update turning off PC from windows will be ok, but if you try to use restart option in windows then it will start to crash and show black screen instead of login windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked with the fresh install of Windows 10 1803 on one of those PCs, and after installing only KB4103721 and restarting got me back to black screen and blue wheel. So I expect some hardware issue with some SSD drives maybe, because 2 of those 4 PCs had
 same model of SSD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Local isp&#58; do not allow you to change your settings&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;we were wondering if there were any other consumers having issues with their isp setting which virtually do not allow you to change your settings?&nbsp; We have&nbsp; attempted to change the security to our router; &amp; the isp totally cut our signal off.&nbsp; we have also
 tried other routers&nbsp; along with modems in an attempt to obtain some measure of security, or the best we could hope for on this wifi.&nbsp; Others are complaining about the same issues we have</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The person attempting the change for us is an IT ADM &amp; he literally could not believe that our signal was virtually cut of when this happened. To be fair to them, it is a local ISP &amp; there materials are old and possibly outdated.&nbsp;&nbsp; What I mean by that
 is this: &nbsp; our service is affected by(especially) time of the day, bad weather, cold weather, rain, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;We have known there are issues for several years because our computers will pick up the other computers on the network; that we my "see".&nbsp; I may check my settings(keeping a written log of the time cut off, &amp; "logout" according to my personal computer-however
 when I logon for a new date- a site-esp facebook-I check where I am "logged into" &amp; it gives me a random list of "where I am supposedly logged in" which baffles me as I have noted the time-date</p>
<p>The only thing I may gather from this is-others are logging into my account; perhaps when I log out IDK.&nbsp; some of the IT techs have asked us to change the channel &amp; we try but it usually "reverts back to the programmed on via ISP.&nbsp; Many have said they are
 using our signal as an "access point" to logon avoiding paying for the service-IDK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I realize there are possibly "too many" services that may not be able to provide for; however we are beginning to question if there is any security at all on this system at all.&nbsp; We change passwords regularly, but is seems to have virtually NO effect on
 the facebook logons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the other issue we are having at this time include the inability to download windows "malicious software removal tool, as well as trouble with cc cleaner.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>we have never had an issue with a new, out of the box computer &amp; are wondering if it is in fact the computer, or the people accessing our wifi signals</p>

            <p>hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>as far as a domain, IDK I am sure that I am but do not have that information. &nbsp;my sip is TDS and I know that often they have to "offload" because they have oversold their services and I do not know who, or how they utilize them-or what the schedule is for
 that. &nbsp;Referring to WiFi settings-stepson tried to change password and all information was totally cut off-signal went down and no access to it(although &nbsp;he is a Network Administrator for a huge company) I believe he knows what he is doing, &nbsp;trouble with cc
 cleaner-it takes forever and never finishes running-I left it one night and then next day it had still not stopped trying to clean it. &nbsp;This is a new computer(Bought in NOvember 2015) &amp; it runs as if it is one that I have for years-as if it has so much data
 that it has literally years of info&amp; it should not-I was downloading from the site for the Windows malicious software tool; and it ran once-as could not get it to work again after that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again CC Cleaner never stops running-this computer-it will analyze but it recently took over 2 days and it still had not cleaned everything that I had requested. &nbsp;The browser I was using was Mozilla computer Toshiba satellite laptop</p>

<p>You could try this:<br />
1. Set your BIOS to use the DVD drive as the primary boot device.<br />
2. Boot with your Windows 7 installation DVD or the Windows Repair CD. <br />
3. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …" appears.<br />
4. Select a language, a time and currency, and a keyboard or input method, and then click Next.
<br />
5. Click Repair your computer. <br />
6. In the System Recovery Options dialog box, choose the drive of your Windows installation and click Next.
<br />
7. In the System Recovery Options dialog box, click Startup Repair.<br />

            <p>Agreed, and they all claim magic when there is no real magic out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no way that they will know better on how to handle all the possibilities in the world that is the register.&nbsp; At best some random luck like the old "reboot Windows that might fix it advice" types of stabs in the dark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At best the most a cleaner could do is if it was installed at the time on an install of a program, and monitoring it.&nbsp; And you went to uninstall that program, and it didn't uninstall everything.&nbsp; The cleaner might be able to clean up what the uninstaller
 missed.&nbsp; Other than that any "magic" it will make you computer run faster, with less problems, jump buildings with a single bound,&nbsp; ...&nbsp; That kind of thing is going have the result of some people get lucky and the tweaks they make help some, most it will do
 nothing, and others it will totally trash their machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I suspected problems that say most likely caused by incorrect settings/update problems, and there no simple way to fix those problems, I would backup my personal data files, do a clean install, and restore my data files.</p>
<p>Ultimately that is the best fix for this kind of problem.&nbsp; Actually there is another in between one.</p>
<p>The setting in the register are in files at the machine level, and files for your account.</p>
<p>If the settings that are messed up are at the personal level then creating a new account should fix that.</p>
<p>Then you just transfer your personal data files over to the new account and delete the old one.</p>

            <p>If you think that cleaning your registry might help, I would go ahead and use ccleaner. Just use the free version. It cleans up lots of unnecessary temp files, in addition to removing unnecessary registry entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would not expect miracles, but I haven't had any issues with ccleaner. Use it on three PCs, mostly, because I'm somewhat obsessively compulsive about these things.&nbsp;It cleaned up a whole lot of stuff after the enormous 1511 update.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have heard some people swear by ccleaner, and one that just swore at it.</p>
<p>Based on one of the "some people" is a person that I respect I would say that ccleaner is one of the better ones.&nbsp; Not something I would use, but better.</p>

            <p>It takes me one to two weeks to do a clean install and get all my applications installed, configured etc. This is true despite the fact that I keep Windows on a separate physical hard drive (SDD) and all my data are on three other hard drives in the same
 computer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So while I reformat the C: drive, I am able to preserve my data - unlike in most Windows computers.&nbsp; Still ALL the applications must be reinstalled and most have registration, passwords etc. that all have to be researched and many require calling customer
 support and waiting on hold for 1/2 to several hours to listen to someone in a foreign country trying to fake English while trying to read a script and having no clue about what you need.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I hate having to do&nbsp; a reinstall. It has been 3 months now since my last "clean install" and again things are going bonkers.&nbsp; Usually because of corruption in the registry.&nbsp; But alas, my trusted PC Tools Registry cleaner is no longer available despite
 my paid up the license fee. Also the Revo Uninstaller which removes all the left over files and stuff in the registry when one has to uninstall and reinstall an application will not install.&nbsp; Appears that MS may have done something to kill it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need the Justice Department to force MS to turn the Windows API over to the IEEE/ASNI/ISO and then break MS into two companies. This could create competition for the MS core OS and their applications. One company being devoted to the core OS and the other
 for applications, hardware etc.&nbsp; These two new companies would then have to compete in the open market.&nbsp; Everyone would benefit, the US economy, the Global economy, and all industries that are forced by reason of the MS monopoly to employ the MS tools which
 are buggy and not user friendly or efficient. </p>

            <p>the virus was a redirect. I used several tools to clean it out and finally no longer redirects. I also removed several programs that i no longer use.</p>
<p>the program was a torrent client. I have removed all but the issue remains, somehow i think the cleaning process deleted the dnsapi.dll. as i said i downloaded another and placed it in windows32 system, but i tried the same programme ( after downloading
 it again) and still get the same error message. perhaps the dnsapi.dll is too large?</p>
<p>
</p><p>as far as i know, this was the only kind of programme affected, besides my vpn.&nbsp;</p>

            well thanks for your judgmental and patronizing reply. You haven't answered my question at all, just judged me and pretended to look knowledgeable. Nice one cyber warrior no 764. I am guessing you don't know the answer and are filling in time. why waste
 your time and mine if your don't have a clue? you obviously don't read the update i posted either. try it....without your own interpretation, just read the words. As a security professional, i investigate many things, and sometimes copied text pasts itself
 and you dont proof read. my bad, but your bad for....well you know

<h2>            Windows are resized and  moved to upper left corner when Displayport is used and the monitor wakes up from switch off state</h2>
                    I use Intels HD Graphics 530 from the i5-6500 CPU. The 32" Monitor is connected via DisplaPort. When i switch off the monitor&nbsp;the Windows are resized and moved to the upper left Corner when the monitor&nbsp;isswitched on again.&nbsp;This issue does not occur when
 I use HDMI for the monitor.

            This apparently is a known issue when it comes to Windows, Microsoft has a knowledge based article that discusses it:

https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2625567/open-windows-change-position-when-turning-off-displayport-monitor-on-w

Their recommendation:

Resolution
One potential workaround for this problem is to avoid turning off the monitor manually via its power button. To conserve power, you can instead use the Power Options in the Windows control panel to set the monitor to be turned off automatically when the computer is not in use. To adjust this setting, click on the Start button, and in the "Search programs and files" text box, type "Choose when to turn off the display" and press Enter.

Alternately, the problem may not occur if you attach the monitor to the computer using a different type of display cable, such as an HDMI or DVI cable. Consult the manuals for your computer and your monitor to determine what types of display connectors are supported.

            Actually I have the same problem.  So I went to that page. Followed it's instructions to the settings page. BUT, it does not say WHAT SETTING TO SET! There is nothing relevant as far as I can tell in the drop downs.

<p><span>Original Title: <span>Overnight laptop stopped playing all sounds and media player, real player etc all come up with errors</span></span></p>
<p><span>C00D11B1 - thats one of the windows error message for media player.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Overnight the laptop has stopped working, probably a day or two after i installed Norton.</span></p>
<p><br />
When I click to play a song media player just comes up with a red cross next to the song, moves to the next song and the same, so on.</p>
<p>Real player and Itunes do the exact same thing.</p>
<p><br />
I cannot play sound from websites or when the laptop starts up.</p>
<p>I did have a virus which I got rid off but its all happend just after that.</p>
<p>I tried a check disk, system check, device manager shows sound card running and ok, i have latest windows update and drivers for the RealkTek HD sound.</p>
<p>Also since then when I play a video from like youtube or yahoo news, it has no sound and it stutters really bad even though my connection of 16mb is fine, my PC works fine.</p>
<p><br />
Please can anyone help !!</p>

<p>I would suggest rebuilding your database in WMP as if the audio is stuttering it may be a corrupted. Probably do the same thing for iTunes, as far as Real player is concerned, I am afraid I would just uninstall it. The red cross usually means that the system
 thinks it is missing a codec, which it probably isn't. Last time I used more than a couple programs to lsten to music they did not play well together and rcaused stuttering and red crosses, rebuilding the database fixed the problem</p>
<p>If the version of Norton you installed was 2010 or 2011 it should not cause any problems.</p>

<p>just to clear it up, the stuttering is any video i play or steam from the internet like youtube or yahoo news, I have no sound what so ever, thats why I tried Real player&nbsp; to see if that would work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been using media player and itunes for the last few years with no issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no sound what so ever, even when I try a test sound through the speakers in control panel it shows "cannot play test sound".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anything that plays sound comes up with an error, no matter what program. Its doing my nut in !</p>

<p><span>Hi tnpmonkey,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First and foremost thing, download and run Microsoft automated fix it. See what it has to say.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Run Microsoft Fix it&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This tool automatically diagnoses and repair problems with sound and audio on your computer or when your computer does not play sound.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Download audio driver from Realtek</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>In case you updated the driver via Windows Update, manually do the update by downloading the driver from the link given below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.realtek.com/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PNid=14&amp;PFid=24&amp;Level=4&amp;Conn=3&amp;DownTypeID=3&amp;GetDown=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Software:

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you’ve done this already, you can skip this method.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: Perform System Restore</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Since the problem happened few days back, you can perform system restore to the point when the problem didn’t exist. This should fix the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>System Restore can return your system files to a point in time before you noticed a problem, without affecting documents, photos, or other personal
 files.</span></p>

            READ THIS - MIGHT HAVE HELPFUL INFO!!!<br />
<br />
Hello - I happened upon this string because I am having the same issue with my Dall laptop, running Vista home 64-bit.&nbsp; I thought the issue was somehow linked to the latest iTunes update but a system restore did not help. I have been racking my brain over here
 and realized that I had been having issues getting my external USB speakers to work a few weeks ago. (They used to work just fine and then stopped working a while back but I just had the ambition to tackle that issue two weeks ago.)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I just plugged them in to see if I could play my music through the external speakers if not through my computers speakers. Don't you know, I plugged them in and the music started playing - not through the external speakers but through the laptop speakers!!
 WTF?????&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I pulled the plug on my USB speakers and the laptop speakers are still playing in iTunes and I media player works, too! I closed both programs and restarted them and they both still work. Who knows what restart will bring and now I am back to square one with
 my USB external speakers not working, which is frustrating; and I haven't figured out where the confusion lies in the laptop's twisted little mind; but at least it is a step towards the solution... I hope! Good luck everyone!! ~ Kimmy

<h2>            Windows 7 On Screen Keyboard</h2>
                    I am having a problem with the Windows On Screen Keyboard. I only used it because my keyboard wasn't working at the time but I got a new one. Anyways, every time I log on to my computer the On Screen Keyboard thinks I am pressing the "ctrl" button from
 both left and right! I try to un-click it but it still won't unselect. Due to this it won't let me type at all! It sometimes goes away, then it comes back again not letting me type at all. What should I do? Please help me.

    <title>Xbox live account for a child&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ifarrow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox live account for a child&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've been trying for some time now to set up an Xbox live account for my two children, both of whom are under 13 years of age i.e. they don't have their own email address. According to the online searches I've done it should be possible to set them up as
 a child account under the umbrella of my own parent account but I just can't seem to do this as everything I try asks me to enter an email address for them and if I enter my own it gives me an error message. We are new to Xbox and I have very little to do
 with it but am keen to get it sorted for them while maintaining some control over their access. We don't have the gold membership on my account, just the free one.</p>
<p>So...my questions are:</p>
<p>a) Is it possible to set up an Xbox live account for a child who is under 13?</p>
<p>b) Do you need a gold account to do this and, if so, does it need to be the family pack?</p>
<p>c) If the above answers are 'Yes' and 'No' respectively could somebody please walk me through it step-by-step before I throw the whole thing out of the window?!?!?&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can set up an account for a child under 13, however each account that you set up requires &nbsp;a unique email address. &nbsp;(An email address is required to sign up for Xbox LIVE.)</p>
<p>This means that your children will each need their own email address to set up their account.</p>
<p>The way this will work is that when you create the account, you will be prompted for an email address. &nbsp;You will enter your child's email address. &nbsp;You will also asked to provide a birth date. &nbsp;It's very important that you provide the correct birth date,
 since this cannot be changed later.</p>
<p>You would not want to use your birth date and email address, since this would prevent you from managing the safety settings for your children.</p>
<p>When the system detects that your child is under 18, you will then be asked to provide your email address. &nbsp;This will enable you to manage your child's safety settings.</p>
<p>I've provided a &nbsp;link below that may help you better understand how to manage Xbox LIVE for your children:</p>

<p>You do not need a Gold account to set up an account for your children.</p>

<p>Hey there IFarrow!</p>
<p>Once you create the account for your children, &nbsp;you will want to set up the Parental Controls. &nbsp;Here is the link to the official Xbox page which has a video on how to set the controls up. &nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/parental-controls/parental-control-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../parental-control-info</a>
 &nbsp;Also, I'm giving you a link for you to control the Online Safety and Privacy Settings for your children. &nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/online-privacy-and-safety/online-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../online-safety</a>.

<p>Thanks for taking the time to reply but this is where the problem lies - As my children are both under 13 they can't get an email address!
</p>
<p>This is why I've been going round in circles since Christmas!!! Children under 13 can have access to Microsoft live but only with an email address. However, children under 13 can't get an email address!</p>
<p>I realise that I could easily lie about my children's ages to get them an email account but that misses the point.
</p>
<p>If Microsoft accept that children can have access to live why do they need to provide an email address which they are too young to actually have?</p>
<p>Or am I still missing something obvious?</p>

<p>I'm not sure why you would say that children under 13 cannot get an email address.</p>
<p>You should be able to sign up fro a free email address for your children at any of the sites that provide free email addresses. &nbsp;You may be required to provide parental consent to do so.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about giving your children access to an email address, you can always create accounts in their names without providing them with the passwords.</p>

<p>That's what I would expect but when I tried to set up a Gmail account for my children it simply says that I can't because age restrictions apply. After doing some searching and asking elsewhere I've been told that Gmail requires children to be 13 or over
 to set up an address. </p>
<p>I hope you're about to tell me I am wrong and show me what to do to get round this!!!</p>

<p>No problem...</p>
<p>They can have email addresses. &nbsp;Go to Outlook.com which there you will create the email addresses for your children. &nbsp;You will enter their correct dates of births and as part of the process of signing up, the system will recognize that they are children
 and will ask you go give or deny your child permission to Microsoft online services.</p>

<p>Well I can't believe it was that simple!!!</p>
<p>I had been trying to set up a Gmail account not realising that other providers didn't have the same age restrictions. Thanks Loquacious I now have a Yahoo account for my daughter and will be able to sort out her live acccount!</p>
<p>(I do still question Microsoft's policy though - How can the same company require an email address for one product while barring that very thing with another?)</p>

<p>Well I spoke too soon!!!</p>
<p>Having sorted all that out I have tried to set my kids up on Xbox live and now I can't because my region doesn't match my kids' regions. Having read a little I discovered that this is because Microsoft automatically assumed that my .com account from Gmail
 is American whereas my kids' .co.uk accounts from Yahoo are based in the UK. </p>
<p>I have followed the link on here and tried to change my region but it is telling me that I can't!!!</p>
<p>Do Microsoft actually build stupidity into their systems on purpose?</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(232, 17, 35, 1)">Vérifiez les&nbsp;instructions fournies avec votre code.&nbsp;Vous devez peut-être l’échanger sur une page web différente.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Comment valider mon code ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Merci et bonne journée</p>

<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased a new computer for work. Windows 10 is not compatible with our systems because of all the problems it is still causing. I need to know how to get rid of Windows 10 on this computer and "downgrade" to Windows 7 or 8.1. I have tried everything
 and frankly I am not a fan of this Windows 10.</p>

<p><span><span>Please be informed that Downgrade and down-edition rights are an end-user right that Microsoft offers to customers for certain OEM products which meet the technical requirements for a
 Windows software downgrade. Downgrade rights are documented in the Microsoft Software License Terms that customers accept upon first running Windows and Windows Server software. Thanks to downgrade rights, end users who have acquired a later version of the
 software (such as Windows 10 Pro or Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard) can use an earlier version of the software until they are ready to migrate to a later version technology.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I suggest you to refer the below article</span></strong><span><span>regarding
 the Downgrade right and check.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Skype sign in</h2>
                    Skype fails to connect. Yesterday Skype crushed when I tried to make a call. After I restarted my computer, Skype won't start. My Skype usually signs in automatically. Now it just displays "Sorry we could not connect to Skype. Please check your internet
 connection and try again." Obviously, my internet connection is fine. Trying again many times. It is not a problem with password, because I cannot even try to enter password (it tries to sign in automatically). How do I contact tech support? The link on the
 support page is broken.

<h2>            Issues with SIM card applications</h2>
                    <p>I'm having some issues with SIM card applications on Windows 10 Mobile. Have anyone else&nbsp;had similar problems&nbsp;or have a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Norway, we use a technology called BankID to log in to financial institutions (like our bank) and so on. One way to log in with BankID is by a SIM card application called BankID&nbsp;on mobile. It's a two factor authentication using your mobile. However, after
 the anniversary update this summer I've been unable to use BankID on mobile. When I type in my password and press the send-button, a message is shown for a nanosecond saying something like "SIM card applications are not able to run". The places I try to log
 in gives me a message saying they don't have contact with my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not possible to remove or reinstall the SIM card application (to my knowledge).</p>
<p>
</p><p>BankID - the provider, my bank and my network carrier has no solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Info:<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>as a long time user of windows phone, I can attest that this is a thing.</p>
<p>Mobile BankID is something absolutely everyone in Norway is dependent on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked for a while on WP 8.1, but works maybe 1 time out of 5 and some days not at all on W10 Mobile. This has been the case for me with all builds thus far, and with all SIM cards I have tried. The same sim cards work perfectly with other phones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, switching my SIM into another phone in order to log into my bank, an then switching back when logging out is something I've often had to do. Needless to say this is a huge problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left">I've been using WP exclusively since my first Samsung Omnia 7. Currently I'm using my Lumia 930, which is an absolute pain. I loved the different versions of Windows Phone, but thus far using Windows 10 mobile has been a horrible
 experience. The only reason why I haven't switched is that I'm still waiting for th Surface Phone, hoping you'll have fixed the OS by then.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">This issue, however, may well be the one I cannot live with, and why I may have to switch to something else. Please fix this.</p>
