<p>Hi Donald,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Excel start folder locations:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">C:\Users\user_name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\</span></p>
<p>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\XLSTART</p>
<p>You can check if there are any files in these folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please also try the steps below to see if you can find the location of the book1:</p>
<ol>
<li>File&gt;open&gt;Recent&gt;check if the book1 is there.</li><li>If the book1 is there, right click it then “open file location”.</li></ol>
<p>In the meantime, please go to File&gt;Account&gt;Product Information to check the Office version.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rena</p>

    <title>Autorecovery in MS Word&#47; MAC - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Autorecovery in MS Word&#47; MAC</h2>
                    <p>Hello, All!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded my MS Office 365, and am having trouble with the Autosave/Autorecovery function in MS Word. A few minutes into working on a document, I receive this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You cannot save while the file is in use by another process. Try saving the file with a new name.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;(AutoRecovery save of Chapter&nbsp; )</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Mind you, when this message appears, I am not actually trying to save anything. &nbsp;I am just trying to work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I say OK to clear the message, and a new message appears:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Word is unable to save the AutoRecover file in the location you have specified.&nbsp; Make sure that you have specified a valid location for AutoRecover files in Preferences, and
 that you have permission to write files to the location you specified.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">
I have tried saving the file location in Preferences to no avail. &nbsp;The only way to rid myself of these messages is toI turn off the Save Autorecover Files in Preferences. &nbsp;But as long as it is turned on, I receive these messages roughly every
 three minutes. &nbsp;(Even though Autorecover is set at 10 minutes in Preferences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">
I'm pretty annoyed, but also fairly concerned as I am dependent on MS Word as a writer and teacher. Other threads I've found on this topic seem to indicate there is the possibility of losing all my work. Any help out there?</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">
Many thanks!</p>
<p />

<p>I found another thread dating back to April that seems to have a similar issue with the messages. &nbsp;I am going to try moving older documents into new, blank documents, although I believe that is where I began with the doc in question. &nbsp;(I know from past experience
 that MS Word does not always love an older document post-upgrade.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Asha 210 rebooting with call key and call logs option,  once again.</h2>
                    I use the Nokia Asha 210 dual sim phone. Today I found my &nbsp;phone rebooting upon accessing call history, both from the call key as well from &nbsp;some of the the options under the Contacts icon in the Menu. It has happened earlier and got resolved with a software
 update. This time it shows no update available. &nbsp;Why is it happening? What do I need to do ?

Thanks again. I'll try the recovery tool. I had not required it the first time around for getting a new update. The service centre has conveyed that the software version is the same.

The software recovery tool couldn't do its job as the pc keeps restarting and my phone simply shuts down. I saw the description of the problem under "kernel_security_check_failure." Will have to show it to the service centre.&nbsp;

            Alternatively, please, try another computer. Preferably a computer only with USB 2.0, no USB 3.0 – and Windows 7 32 bit.<br />
When it comes to the kernel security check failure, do you see an error code or an error message? If it goes away too fast, please,

            <p>Hi Hilced7,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you fro your contribution to the forum!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand while your phone is connected to your PC it keeps turning off.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried to remove the battery of your phone for about 1 minute and then connected it to your PC again?</p>
<p>Also, can you try to connect your phone to a different PC and verify if the issue persists there as well?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue doesn't persist on another PC, there might be an issue with your PC, in this case I would suggest you creating a new user profile on the PC and check if it works there:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Create-a-user-account</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue should persist on the other PC, there is most likely an issue with your phone itself. In that case I would suggest you resetting your phone to factory settings. Unfortunately by doing so you will delete everything what is stored on your device.
 Apps you purchased can be re-downloaded by using the same Windows Live ID with the same Zunetag as before the reset. Contacts are saved on your Windows Live ID, this you can check on:
<a href="http://contacts.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://contacts.live.com</a>. Pictures, videos and music unfortunately if you cannot sync them to your PC, cannot be backed up, except you upload your pictures to SkyDrive (which would only save your pictures).</p>
<p>You can reset the phone in <strong>settings</strong> -&gt; <strong>about</strong> -&gt;
<strong>reset your phone</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should a reset also not be able to solve the issue, unfortunately you will need to send your device in for repair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know if one of the steps could help you to solve the issue!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Silvia B.</p>

            the only way is to do a hard reset press and hold the volume down and the power buttons until it vibrates then release them and in the following order press volume up until you see a big exclamation mark then press volume up volume down power volume down
 if you had backup turned on then you will get back your data once you set it up again

<h2>            Trouble Importing PDF of powerpoint outline into OneNote</h2>
                    One of my teachers has given us&nbsp;PDF files which contain the "outline view" of her powerpoints-- text only, with the little numbered slide icons next to the text.&nbsp; When I try to import a printout of this file into Onenote2013, any pages that contain the&nbsp;outline
 icons are just importing as blank pages.&nbsp; I tried printing to Onenote as well as dragging and dropping the file into Onenote and am getting the same results.&nbsp; Not sure what is causing the problem.&nbsp; There are other pages in the PDF file that contain pictures,
 which ARE showing up in the printout.&nbsp; But the other pages containing the outline are all blank.&nbsp; I am using Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Any ideas of how to fix this?&nbsp; Thanks

<h2>            Converting bulk .txt files to .csv files</h2>
                    Hi guys, I got hundreds of txt files that I want to convert to csv files. Each txt file consists of lots of numbers which are separated by tabs and that's how I want them in the csv files. I know how to do that one by one but I got hundreds of them and
 wondering if there is a way to do that either using window command lines or excel macro? Thanks!

<p>CatherineYKF,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have a tab delimited file that looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>file1.txt</p>
<p>
</p><p>Header1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Header2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Header3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Header4<br />
G&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;H&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;30<br />

G&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Z&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8</p>
<p>
</p><p>(entries are separated by tab characters).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then open it in excel using the text import wizard and choose delimited with tab as the delimiter, then I will get these entries in 5 columns and 5 rows.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I then save the file as a CSV file it will look like this in notepad:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Header1,Header2,Header3,Header4<br />
G,6,H,30<br />
Z,4,G,26<br />
H,6,J,64<br />
G,4,Z,8</p>
<p>
</p><p>The code below will do that for each .txt file in the folder&nbsp;&nbsp; "C:\Data\Files\"&nbsp;&nbsp; making a copy of the file and replacing the .txt extension with .csv&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>

&nbsp; If LCase(Right(sName, 3)) = "txt" Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workbooks.OpenText Filename:=sPath &amp; sName, _<br />

&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; sName = Dir()<br />
Loop<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>-- </p>
<p>If that isn't what you want, then it just sounds like you want to rename your .txt file with a .csv extension and not change the contents to be what is expected in a true .csv file (US English).&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            I get &#34;error on page&#34; message when trying to download some PDF files and then blank page. Vista - Internet Explorer version &#63;</h2>
                    Example: Ezine Articles has help documents varying in size. None will download - even one page docs. The first time I try, I get the very descriptive message "error on page" and then I hit ENTER to see a blank page with DONE at the bottom. After that I
 only get a blank page but no message. I don't know my Explorer version because I can't find the Help button on that page.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks

<p><span><span>Hi Tburd62,</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forums.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>When was the last time it was working?</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Do you remember making any changes to the computer recently?</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>What is the version of Windows installed on the computer?</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Does this happen only when you try to download PDF files?</span></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To find out which version of Internet Explorer you're using, the cipher strength (SSL) it is using, the
 product identification number, or to see when the latest update was applied, follow these steps.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Open Internet Explorer by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, and then clicking <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Press ALT+H, and then click
<strong>About Internet Explorer</strong>.</span></span> </li></ol>
<p><span><span>Let us know what the version of Internet Explorer is.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This may also happen if the Internet Explorer browser settings are incorrect. I would suggest that you reset the browser
 settings to default and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Steps to reset the Browser settings to default</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1: Clear cached data in Internet Explorer</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>To determine whether a performance issue or an error message is caused by corruption in the temporary Internet files
 or in other cached information that is used by Internet Explorer, you must clear cached data. To do this, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Internet Explorer 7
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open Internet Explorer 7. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click Tools, and then click Delete Browsing History. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In Delete Browsing History, click Delete All. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click to select the Also delete files and settings stored by add-ons check box, and then click OK.
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Internet Explorer 8
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open Internet Explorer 8. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click Safety, and then click Delete Browsing History. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In Delete Browsing History area, click Delete. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A progress bar is displayed to indicate that the browsing history is being cleared. After this process is complete, test
 Internet Explorer to verify that it works correctly. If issues still occur, try Method 2.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2: Reset security settings for Internet Explorer</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If you configure security settings to be too restrictive, you may prevent Internet Explorer from displaying certain Web
 sites. To determine whether an issue is caused by overly restrictive security settings, revert to default security settings. To do this, follow these steps:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open Internet Explorer. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click Tools, and then click Internet Options. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click the Security tab. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click Reset all zones to default level, and then click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After you do this, test Internet Explorer to verify that it works correctly.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information refer the below link.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>How to optimize Internet Explorer</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Important</span></strong><span>: Reset Internet Explorer to
 its default configuration. This step will also disable any add-ons, plug-ins, or toolbars that are installed. Although this solution is quick, it also means that, if you want to use any of those add-ons in the future, they must be reinstalled.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above step does not fix would suggest that you install the latest version of adobe reader
 on the computer and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer the below to download latest adobe reader.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Dave,<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>It is possible that you may have not entered the correct credentials or server settings for your email account.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For us to better isolate this issue, we have some questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried reinstalling or updating the Outlook app for Android on your device?</li><li>Are you able to log in to your account from the email domain or website?</li><li>Are you using an Exchange account?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response. Rest assured that we're still here when you reply back.</p>

            I ended up getting it to work by uninstalling completely and then reinstalling.&nbsp; Still not sure how to remove an account stuck like that since the add account process always seemed to assume I needed to complete that incomplete account before doing anything
 else.<br />

    <title>Multiple users of the same outlook email address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sandrabrownxd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple users of the same outlook email address</h2>
                    I have a issue where someone has been able to register the same outlook email address as me. I would to stop receiving their emails and would also like clarification on whether my email is secure. At the same time I also started to receive some other emails
 also from another person with the same email address as me. This has been happening since Saturday.<br />
<br />
I have had one email conversation and they said they were trying to migrate from hotmail to outlook and had picked the same email address as me. They didn't see any messages telling them the email address was already in use. Can anyone help?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Sandra<br />

<p>My situation is slightly different, &nbsp;I have never received the other scuppers emails but when I opened a skype account it automatically picked up the other individuals name and inserted it. &nbsp;Exactly the same thing happen with the exact same name when I started
 a Paypal account and just know &nbsp;I received notification from emailsherlock.com that I was being searched for, &nbsp;When I clicked on the link provided it wasn't me they were searching for it was the other *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, &nbsp;He's younger than I am, lives in
 CA and I'm in TX. &nbsp;This hotmail account is pretty well established amongst my friends and on dozens of websites. &nbsp; Last fall I lost access to my hotmail for a time, being only semi computer literate I don't &nbsp;remember exactly what the deal was. &nbsp;But about the
 2nd time I couldn't access a website because I had forgotten my password and they couldn't send me a link to access a change I started digging around and was able to revive it, I can not remember why it went away or remember how I was able to retrieve it.
 I think I remember that there were still emails available that I had received before the account disappeared. &nbsp;Because of unrelated issues I have become more security minded and this concerns me, &nbsp;Suggestions anyone?</p>

As of today, I am receiving emails from another Outlook.com user who is located in the UK. &nbsp;I am in Jacksonville, Fl and have been using Outlook.com email since August 1, 2012. &nbsp;This person has the same first initial and last name as me, but his first name
 and indeed, country of residence, are different from mine. &nbsp;I recently began occasionally receiving and email intended for him, usually of the "no reply" type of business transaction confirmation. &nbsp;I attempted to reply to notify sender of the error and have
 been unsuccessful. &nbsp;I would rather not share contact details over this public forum, but have been unable to reach the Outlook.com help desk due to extended "heavier than usual traffic with the help desk". &nbsp;I wish someone at Microsoft would contact me to look
 at the specifics and clean up this impending disaster.....

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that when you rename your account. The new email address will be an alias, old emails will be moved to a special folder named after your old username. So it is normal that you can find your old emails on this location.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, to fully understand your issue please provide us the step that you want to execute. Do you want your new emails to be received on the Inbox? Are you unable to open your new emails?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Thank you for taking the time to reply but this does not really solve the problem.&nbsp; My Inbox now has only two pages of emails whereas in my Hotmail account there were over 1000 before they were transferred.&nbsp; The selection in the two pages makes no sense
 - they range selectively from 2008 to 2010 and a couple from 2011.&nbsp; Surely they should all be there or none at all?&nbsp; when I tried to revert to Hotmail my Inbox there did not all reappear so I have given up reverting.<br />
I would like to know what has happened if anyone can work it out.&nbsp; <br />
I would also like all my emails in my Inbox so I do not have to click on the Hotmail sub-folder every time I access my emails.<br />
Many thanks.<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>By upgrading to Outlook.com, you are only upgrading the user interface of Hotmail to the new user interface; hence all your emails should still stay in your Inbox. However, if your emails were over 270 days old, you may have lost them due to inactivity
 in account even before you renamed the account. If you had Self-recovery of emails turned on in your account before rename, you can try to recover some of the deleted messages yourself, please refer to this link:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/how-recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>Restore deleted email messages</span></b></a><span>.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you chose to rename your account to @Outlook.com, a prompt would have asked you – ‘Where do you want to save your emails?’ You will have the option to create a new folder for your old account or save the emails in the Inbox of your renamed account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you chose to create a new folder, the default name of the folder will be the name of your old account and the folder will appear in the left pane under ‘Folders’. And all your old emails will be stored in this folder.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Another reason why some users aren’t able to see old emails after rename is when their account was hacked and the hacker had already deleted emails in their account before their renamed the account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

I selected (unfortunately) to rename my account to outlook.com because I liked the fresher interface.&nbsp; They then said they were transferring my emails. None have been deleted as such because they are all in the hotmail.com sub-folder.&nbsp; What I still do not understand
 is why they are not all in the new inbox which is where I want them all to be.&nbsp; The inbox shows only a couple of pages of
<b><i>old </i></b>emails from around 2008 - 2010 and a couple of more recent ones.&nbsp; It makes no sense.&nbsp;
<br />
- How can I now get <b><i>all </i></b>my emails - including new arrivals - which are now in the hotmail.com sub-folder (without losing any) into my Inbox?<br />
- If this is not possible how can I revert to Hotmail and have my original <b>complete
</b>Inbox restored?<br />
(I did try clicking on revert to Hotmail but it just changed the interface and did not restore my Inbox as before so I went back to outlook.com).<br />
For the record I use my account nearly every day so there has never been any question of inactivity.<br />
I would really like to sort this out and appreciate your willingness to help.<br />

            I am afraid there is no red link - when I click on the blue link to view my private message it just returns me to the thread of messages.&nbsp;
<br />
I would be glad to have all my emails - <i><b>all </b></i>those received previously and any to come - in my Inbox.&nbsp; Only half of the older ones are there since I moved to Outlook.com.<br />
I am hesitant to return to Hotmail in case I lose access to any of my emails past or future - all this has caused me to lose confidence in Outlook.com.<br />

            Hi djsfb,<br />
<br />
We apologize for the inconvenience this matter may have caused you. <br />
<br />
<span>By upgrading to Outlook.com, we are only upgrading the user interface of Hotmail to the new user interface; hence all your emails should still stay in your Inbox.
</span><br />
<span><br />
You got another option to save your Hotmail emails differently when renaming your account to @Outlook.com account</span><span>: If you chose to rename your account to @Outlook.com, a prompt would have asked you – ‘<em>Where do you want to save your emails?</em>’
 You will have the option to create a new folder for your old account or save the emails in the Inbox of your renamed account. If you chose to create a new folder, the default name of the folder will be the name of your old account and the folder will appear
 in the left pane under ‘Folders’. And all your old emails will be stored in this folder.<br />
<br />
However, if you still wish to move all your email messages to your Inbox you can do it by manually moving all the emails from sub-folder to your Inbox.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</span>

            Clearly the transfer of&nbsp; my emails was faulty as not <i><b>all </b></i>were transferred to my inbox but some older ones to my inbox and the rest to my
<i>hotmail.com</i> address.<br />
<br />
Could you please explain <i><b>exactly </b></i>how:<br />
1. I move my emails 'manually' from the <i>hotmail.com</i> sub-folder to my inbox
<b>in one go</b> as there are a lot,<br />
2. I delete the <i>hotmail.com</i> and <i>outlook.com</i> sub-folders so that all new emails go automatically to my inbox.<br />
<br />
This would cancel out any choice I unknowing made at the point of transfer from hotmail.com to outlook.com.&nbsp; I want all to go to my inbox<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<p>Try installing UC browser from store. Even if it is a browser, it lets you scan QR codes either using the camera lens or the QR code image saved on your phone.</p>

<p>Hi Arjun Dafda,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For most cases we recommend you to create
 there would be a mail user object remained on-prem so both online and on-prem mailboxes can interact with the shared mailbox.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One exception is you have migrated everything to Exchange online and your on-prem Exchange server is only kept for management purpose, in this case it would be easier to directly create it online.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope above information made it clear for you.

<h2>            Import CAD Drawings results in blank rectangle Shape</h2>
                    <p>I have imported several CAD drawings into separate Visio 2016 Pro and saved these files. &nbsp;Everything seemed fine but now when I open these Visio files some show the CAD drawings as a blank rectangle shape (not a CAD Drawing) and some files have the CAD Drawing
 visible (although still a shape). &nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Why the blank rectangle?</p>
<p>2) Does Visio save CAD Drawings as Shapes automatically or is there a setting that I am missing?</p>

<p><span>Generally, when you import a CAD Drawing into Visio, it will not covert into shape automatically.</span></p>
<p><span>Please use the steps in this article to convert CAD drawings into shape, refer to Covert DWG and DXF objects into Visio shapes section:

<p>
</p><p>Hi Gloria</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a serious issue with excel 365 version 16.20 running slow on the Mac. I'm experienceing this on all my Macs all of which are pretty new and more than capable from a hardware standpoint. The issue is with the Office 365 software. You guys need to
 fix this. Most of us dont have the time to try workarounds and send screen shots of said work arounds. Its a software issue, and these very workarounds you speak of should automatically be built into the software before it is released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise us loyal paying and subscribing customers whether Microsoft is working on fixing this issue... and when an update might be expected?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using Excel for 15 years and this is the first "really bad, really broken" release. Having said that I love the program, just very disappointed... like - how do you guys just go ahead and release something that is so obviously incompatible with
 current operating systems?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Rian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience it brings to you and we will try our best to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested from my side and I cannot reproduce the issue.</p>
<p>For the slow performance, there may be many causes such as bad user profile or some 3rd add-ins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create a new user profile on your Mac refer to this article: </p>
<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/guide/mac-help/set-up-other-users-mtusr001/mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Set up users, guest, and groups on Mac</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try running your Mac in safe mode to see if it helps:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If the new user profile doesn't work for you, could you please help confirm some information:</p>
<p>1. What is the version of Mac OS?</p>
<p>2. Does the issue just happen after your update to Office version 16.20 (181208)?</p>
<p>3. For the issue happens on all your Mac, do they have the same Office versions and Mac OS versions?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Gloria</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive tried all of that yes, does not fix the issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue only started when I installed Office 365 - switched over to that subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I was running Office 2012 - which I had bought outright and worked great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my macs now run office 365 (version 16.20) and all of them have this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even scrolling down a couple of pages in excel I have to wait a couple of seconds before the information in the spreadsheet populates on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running the latest version of MacOS Mojave 10.14.2</p>

<p>Hi Rian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the suggestions don't work for you, let's try doing the complete uninstall to see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the article for your reference (backup some files refer to the tips in the article):

 uninstalling before you reinstall</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do the uninstall on one Mac to check the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, for you have to wait a couple of seconds, is the Excel large or the issue even happens with a new Excel file?</p>

<p>Hi gloria I wish I had the time for that... and as other users have said on this forum they tried that it didnt solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is the software that needs patching.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since its running slow on all my macs that it is installed on, im pretty sure its not the install thats the problem... that would have had to have been 3x separate bad installs - Highly Unlikely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I can ask is please put some pressure on microsoft to make and send the patch to fix this... I dont have time for a wild goose chase.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been tracking complaints about Excel speed. This is what has been reported on the topic so far:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span><span style="color: rgba(149, 79, 114, 1)"><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/copy-cmdc-causes-spinning-beach-ball-delay-for-3-4/36e2e400-59c7-471b-b7d6-b5d5082a545a"><span style="color: rgba(149, 79, 114, 1)">Copy (Cmd+C) causes spinning beach ball

A corrupt user account can cause Excel to be slow</li><li>Zoom – set zoom to 100% or less</li><li>Another user reported the problem goes away when menu manager is turned off. The name of the manager was not disclosed. The general case is that a 3<sup>rd</sup> party application intercepts keyboard and mouse input, performs actions, and then passes the
 keyboard and mouse activity on to Excel resulting overhead and delay.</li><li>A different user reported uninstalling QuicKeys input manager fixed the problem.</li><li>Page Layout view is slow. Use Normal View, instead</li><li>Another user reported that inserting pictures caused Excel to be slow and/or hang</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>There does not seem to be one thing in particular going on that causes slowness in Excel. You can use the above list to rule things out, but there may be other causes.</p>

<p>Hi Rain,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The slow performance is related with many reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tested on many Mac and it seems that the slow performance doesn't happen from my side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try the suggestions shared by Jim Gordon when you have time for them and we are willing to provide further help for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, the new version of Office for Mac is released, you can update your Office applications and the AutoUpdate to see if it helps.</p>

    <title>Java causing browser to crash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> f1charlie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Java causing browser to crash</h2>
                    I noticed that Java applets were not displaying when I visited a website. I checked the test on the Java.com website and that didn't work. Java said that my version was out of date. It said I had version 6 update 15 and should update to 16. I did that
 and tried the test again - still didn't work.<br />
I looked in my installed programs list and saw that as well as update 16 I had SE Runtime Environment 6 installed.<br />
I uninstalled update 16, revisited Java which said I had 1.0.6 installed and the test worked. Hooray! I installed update 16 again and it worked! Double hooray!<br />
I went to bed happy. Next day applets weren't working again. Visited Java, test wasn't working.<br />
Tried uninstalling both Javas and deleting the Java directory and installed update 16. Now any site with Java causes IE8 to display ''Internet Explorer has stopped trying to restore this website", Firefox just closes.<br />
I did a system restore to before I uninstalled both Javas in the hope that at least the browser wouldn't crash on encountering Java, but no luck.<br />
Thank you if you have read all of this, I would be grateful for any suggestions

            Update:<br />
I uninstalled the latest version and used Javara to remove the older version.&nbsp; Installed the latest offline update 16, checked the Java tester and it worked!&nbsp;
<br />
I rebooted and checked again and as before Java had stopped working!&nbsp; I tried uninstalling and reinstalling a couple more times with no success.&nbsp; As a last resort I looked in the Java control panel and tried deselecting 'Enable the next-generation Java plug-in'
 and what would you know?&nbsp; Java now works, even after a reboot!&nbsp; <br />
I don't know why I can't use this plug-in, but I'm pleased I've sorted it (sort of!)

<h2>            Powerpoint plays only first 5 slides, then stops.</h2>
                    My powerpoint presentation has forty (40) slides, but when I start the presentation it plays only the first five (5) slides and then ends(?). I never had this problem before and can not figure out why this is happening.

            There are a few possible things that could be happening.<br />
<br />
(1) Go to the Slide Show menu and choose Set Up Show. Look under slides to see if it is set to show all slides or some subset of slides.<br />
<br />
(2) Check to see if slides 6-40 are hidden. Go to slide 6 and look in the Slide Show menu to see if Hide Slide is checked.<br />
<br />
(3) When you say it "ends(?)," what exactly do you mean? Do you have automatic timings set and they stop working, or when you manually try to advance the slides, the slide show exits? If it is the latter, your problem is probably 1 or 2. If it is the former,
 you might have some kind of sound or animation on slide 5 that is hanging up.<br />

<p>Just went to verizon to buy the Nokia 928...want to know why Nokia is WAY behind Android and Apple&gt;. their marketing people must be working for the competition. They launched a new phone today on verizon..the Lumia 928&nbsp;in only 2 colors(white/black). Guess
 what--Black is not available until next week---Really???!!!! Are you kidding me. I wanted to try out the new camera and use it for some end of school stuff for my kids this weekend.&nbsp;Now i have&nbsp;to use my 4 year old Droid 2. Maybe i should just get the Samsung
 Galaxy 3 and stick with Droids. Unbelievable Nokia!!! Keep shooting yourself in the foot!!!</p>

            Rant over ?<br />
You need to understand on launch days there is only a certain number of handsets assigned to each store its always been that way.<br />
The same goes for samsung and htc etc,where colors are involved thats down to the carrier .<br />
No launch goes without hiccups htcs launched was bad due to shortages and so was the S4 again not enough to meet demand,so dont blame nokia.<br />
If you want to buy an S3 go ahead.

<p><font>you are complaining about having to wait a week? Nokia just showed off the 925 and 928.. In norway we have to wait until Q4 before we can buy them.. It is so lame its possible to put in words.. Apple shows off a new iphone, wait 1-3 weeks
 maximum.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>My patience with Nokia and Windows Phone is starting to run out, i very much would like to support both but they are really making it hard.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>its not about waiting for a week----its that they never said that ONLY WHITE will be available and black would be available a week later.&nbsp; Verizon is just as much to blame!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way----this post was deleted by the Nokia moderators----pretty slick as not to have bad review on launch day!!</p>

            What device are you using?&nbsp; I am using the HTC Imagio and HTC Touch Pro2 and find I can adjust it to a very comfortable level.&nbsp; I have the default text size set to the second from the largest and (with my devices), I can use a slider to adjust the size
 larger (or smaller) if needed when reading email and documents. I do wish I could use the slider when viewing Calendar items but overall, the second to largest text size has been OK for me (as long as I have my glasses .. lol).
