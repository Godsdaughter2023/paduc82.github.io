            Hi,<br />
<span>Pqservice is used for restoring the system if it were ever to become corrupted. The question of whether or not to have it turned on is up to you. I would suggest you to contact
 the manufacture of the system </span><span>if you have any further questions regarding the

<p>Hello Darian,</p>
Thank you for your prompt and HELPFUL reply.<br />
A bit more background.<br />
Q1 "Were there any changes made to your computer prior to the issue?"<br />
Yes, I have recently installed Windows 10 on a spare desktop PC.<br />
Most of my useful work is still done on Windows XP, an excellent operating system which I know how to work and which does nearly everything I want it to.<br />
I am struggling severely with Windows 10, mainly because of the lack of obvious documentation.<br />
Q2 "How are you accessing your emails? Is it via browser or an application?"<br />
I am trying to use the Mail facility from the Start menu. I click on the Windows icon to bring up the start menu and then on the Mail button.<br />
This brings up a window with some of my most recently received emails but the earlier ones have vanished with no indication as to where they have gone or how to get them back.<br />
Q3 "Have you tried checking your junk/spam folders?"<br />
There is a folder called Trash which contains a couple of rubbish emails I sent myself but none of the important stuff to be seen anywhere.<br />
Q4 "Have you tried checking your rules?"<br />
No, What rules? I can't see a button marked rules.<br />
Q5. "What is your email provider?"<br />
I probably don't understand the question. &nbsp;Only Windows 10 provides me with an email capability. &nbsp;My ISP is Sky.<br />
<br />
By this time you may have begun to susspect that I am terminally stupid. &nbsp;I'm not, honestly, but I am profoundly ignorant.<br />
<br />
Hoping you will be patient with me,<br />
Jack.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>Based on your answer for the question number 2, you are accessing your emails using the Windows Mail app. In order for us to further assist you with your concern, we would like to know your email provider (e.g. Outlook, Gmail, Yahoo) as there is a chance
 that your emails are not properly synced since you've mentioned that you just installed Windows 10 on this computer.</p>

            Darian,<br />
I haven't specified any 'provider' on the Win10 machine.<br />
It is probably worth mentioning that the Win10 machine and the XP machine are connected on a LAN.<br />
The XP machine receives email in Outlook Express.<br />
This handles my email perfectly and W10 may be picking the mail from there.<br />
That still doesn't explain why emails disappear from the W10 app. &nbsp;They stay on Outlook Express until I delete them manually.<br />
<br />
I can't retire my XP machine until I can reliably receive email on Windows 10.<br />

<p>You mention that you are using Outlook Express on XP.&nbsp; From a distant memory of that setup I remember there being an option to delete emails from server when downloaded into Outlook Express.&nbsp; So, basically, when Outlook Express downloads the email it is
 deleted from your email server (which is likely in the cloud with your email provider).&nbsp; Once deleted from the server it ONLY resides on your XP machine with Outlook Express.&nbsp; Therefore if you try to download on Windows 10 it will go to the server to find
 nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IIRC the option to delete was somewhere in account settings in Outlook Express - I would have a look at this and switch it off if still on.&nbsp; But, bear in mind that may well only mean that any emails received from now on will be on the server anything historic
 will be sitting on the XP machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a different train of thought - easy way to test if emails are still on server and available for the mail app to download, most email providers offer the option to login via their website.&nbsp; Might be worth trying this as well to see what is there.</p>

            You are right about the option "Leave a copy of the message on server" being in the Account settings. At the moment this option is not checked so it's hard to see why ANY messages are being sent to the W10 machine.<br />
Also I found some emails on the W10 App in a folder called 'spambox'. &nbsp;This seems to suggest that some Rules have been applied to redirect these messages. &nbsp;Do you know where I can read up on the Rules, how to access them and what I can do with them.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Not used Outlook Express for a while so can't remember on rules, I would imagine there is a settings option for these?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see how the W10 machine CAN download emails.&nbsp; It's all down to when the XP / Outlook Express machine tries to download the email, ie: who gets there first!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are sent an email.&nbsp; It sits on the cloud server.&nbsp; The XP machine is off / outlook express closed, it doesn't look for new email.&nbsp; As the email is on the cloud server it is available for the W10 machine to pull down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are sent an email.&nbsp; The XP machine is on / Outlook Express open and polling for new mail.&nbsp; It downloads the email, removing from the cloud server.&nbsp; The W10 machine has no chance to poll and get the email as well.</p>

My problem has not been resolved.<br />
I apologise for the length of this but it's all relevant.<br />
<br />
I have two desktop PCs connected via a hub in a Local Area Network.<br />
One of the machines is running Windows XP and the other is running Windows 10. I would like to retire the XP machine but first I must be sure that I can receive email properly under Windows 10.<br />
On the XP machine I used Outlook Express and this worked perfectly satisfactorily. All my email arrived in my Inbox and stayed there until I moved it to another folder or deleted it.<br />
I would like my Windows 10 machine to work the same way.<br />
<br />
My first try was to use the Mail app from the W10 Start Menu.<br />
This now appears to be receiving all my incoming mail but only part of it goes into my Inbox; a lot gets redirected to a folder called Spam.<br />
Presumably some 'Rules' are being applied which decide where incoming mail should be stored but I can’t find any documentation on how to access any rules or to modify them. &nbsp;Documentation on this app seems to be very scarce.<br />
<br />
My second try was to attempt to use the Outlook program in Office 2016 but this failed because I could not create an account under which to receive email because the on-screen instructions kept referring me to a 'Welcome Screen' which I was not receiving and
 could find no way to invoke.<br />
I deleted that version of Office and installed a brand new version of Office 2016 and tried to use the new Outlook program.<br />
<br />
Now, immediately after the blue 'Outlook' flash window I get a dialog box titled "Internet email - Jack Bailey". &nbsp;It asks me to enter my username and password for the following server. &nbsp;Under Server it says mail.tatparam.net (my email address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***').
 It gives my username as 'Jack Bailey' and provides an empty input box for me to enter my password.<br />
As I haven't got a password I can't get past this dialog box.<br />
I recognize the Server name, 'mail.tatparam.net', as one of the parameters I entered when setting up Outlook Express on the XP machine but this never required a password.<br />
<br />
Now a new problem has arisen. My Outlook Express client on the XP machine is no longer receiving all my emails. Only those which are delivered to the Inbox in the Mail app on the W10 machine appear in the Outlook Express Inbox - all the rest, the ones that
 are delivered to the Spam folder 1n the W10 Mail app, simply disappear!<br />
<br />
I would be happy to use either the Mail app or Outlook provided either was working properly (though Outlook would probably be the preferred option.)<br />
<br />
Help!<br />

    <title>Linking 2 folders after copy&#47;paste the parent folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> magkraa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Linking 2 folders after copy&#47;paste the parent folder</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to set up some project template with a set folder structure. Each department in the project has their own folder where they work and export to. But I would also like to have a Library folder that has links to all exported work. My initial idea
 was to use create shortcuts of all the export folders in the Library folder. The problem with this is that when I copy paste the parent template folder to create a new<em> Project01,</em> the shortcuts obviously still links to original template folder, not
 to all the export folders in <em>Project01.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried using Symbolic Links ( <span>mklink /D Link Target)</span> But when the Link and Target directory is complete (starting from D:\) I still have the same issue as with the normal shortcut. Is there a way of telling the symbolic link
 to use a parent directory. I.e. in stead of <strong>D:\Projects\Template\Work\Export</strong> to just say<strong> [Parent Directory]\Work\Export</strong> so that when I copy paste the template folder it changes the directory?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realise my idea probably won't work as the Command Prompt would have any idea of where the Parent Directory is. That's kind of the important information I have to tell it, but if anyone knows a way to solve this (through Symbolic Links or with other methods),
 I'd be very grateful!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Magnus</p>

    <title>Print jobs being canceled by computer after certain amount of time. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c-  say:</h3>
<h2>            Print jobs being canceled by computer after certain amount of time.</h2>
                    Print jobs are canceled approx. halfway thru the second, third or fourth page.&nbsp; this will change depending on print setting (ie; a "fast" print will print more pages before it is canceled- etc.) Used to print just fine, with no problems, I believe it could
 be the installation of the service pack that had prompted this, it went undetected for a bit, before we realized the print was actually being canceled.
<strong><em>per Brother manufacturer printer is working fine, seems to be a problem with spooler canceling out the print.</em>
</strong>Single page sheets print fine, except if it is a large quantity, high quality print that takes time to print, it is then canceled about halfway through.&nbsp; Printer display actually goes from "receiving data" to "cancel print". Happens on every program,
 including internet, word/office, quickbooks.... seems to be a time issue,cancels the print after "x" amount of time but have no idea how that can be. thanks

<p>Hi C-,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.<br />
<br />
When the print job gets cancelled, check in the services if the print spooler service is stopped.<br />
(Start-&gt;type services.msc in the search bar and hit enter-&gt; find Print spooler)<br />

            TY Diana, the first thing I did after speaking to Brother regarding the printer is the Fix It program - it came up with nothing... the search shows no results when I try it to find what you asked me to....<br />
<br />
print queue states "Error - sent to printer" and just sits there until i delete the unfinished job... for some reason windows is cancelling the print jobs if they are too big or take too much time, something like that anyway... just really really want to figure
 it out!!!<br />
<br />
thanks anything more you can suggest would be great<br />

    <title>Windows 10 time limits are completely broken - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tim_842  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 time limits are completely broken</h2>
                    <p>I have two computers that my son uses. One of them turned off, the other one still has yet to turn off. Yes, it shows the popup that says, "Your activity is being monitored". It's signed into his Microsoft account. This is on a laptop, and sometimes it works,
 and sometimes it doesn't. Edit: And yes, I rebooted it and it STILL isn't turning off, and I even set the time limit to zero.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm assuming it's related to the fact that the time tracking is horrendously inaccurate in the activity log, but who knows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I know is that I upgraded to Windows 10 and the family controls are horribly broken. Windows 8 worked fine. But of course, Microsoft in their infinite wisdom took out the perfectly functional Windows 8 local method so I can't even escape the totally
 broken online method. Yes, I understand the advantages, but if it's completely non-functional, how does that help me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And let's not even get into how Microsoft completely crippled the functionality in the name of "simplicity" by having only a start/end time and an interval. With no way to add a temporary override. But hey, simple is better, right? It doesn't actually matter
 if it's *usable*, as long as it's simple. Right, anonymous User Interface designer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about this? How about if some "support engineer" doesn't give me a B.S. answer from their keyword search, and how about a REAL programmer with REAL power to fix things actually looks at these problems and fixes them? I mean, supposedly this is a new
 day at Microsoft, right? Where people actually care about the product working right? New leadership, right? Balmer is gone! It's a new glorious day when Microsoft will start producing good software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry for this rant, but I have a severely ADHD son and I depend on this function. Yes, real people use this stuff and have real consequences when you screw it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how about it, Microsoft? How about if someone looks into all the reports of people have the same problem? How about if someone who is an actual engineer at least acknowledges that you care about all these problems? I don't think I've ever seen Microsoft
 actually respond to a problem and fix something, but maybe this will be the first time. It's a new era, right?</p>

            <p>Hello Deepika,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it's not your fault, so don't take this personally. I know the only power you're given there is to click checkboxes and generate that reply with canned responses. I don't know, maybe you could have personalized it, but either way, you have no power
 to act on anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I do wonder if you know just how really useless those links were, in almost a "dystopian society" way. The first one told me what's coming. Hey! Maybe they'll fix things... but no. Your big new feature will "[make] it easier for you to add money to your
 child's Microsoft account". So making it easier for me to spend money. Always thinking about me, thanks, Microsoft! The second link was just plain useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometime in the past, someone at Microsoft clearly decided "We want to care about our customers, so we'll make sure everything gets a reply!" And someone else created the "response generator", because so many queries are the same. It all makes sense, but
 what's left out is escalating things to people who can actually fix things that are broken. Yes, the vast majority of time it's user error and you don't want to bug programmers with user error. But clearly the support engineer here has no idea why it doesn't
 work for me, so why wasn't this escalated to an upper level support person who could figure it out if it's a legit problem? Maybe it was escalated, but it's obvious it wasn't, otherwise the message would at least say, "Let me do more research, meanwhile, take
 a look at this information... [blah] [blah]"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess my question is whether anyone at Microsoft <em>ever&nbsp;</em>reviews problems here, or if posting here is a complete waste of time except if something can be solved through the canned responses.</p>
<p><br />
I know this is just a howl in the wilderness, but who knows, maybe the benevolent gods at Microsoft will listen and something will change.</p>
<p>

            I just want to add that I too used a support engineer who took over my computer but to repair Win 10 Edge Browser, Hub didn't work, no history, no internet page printing, etc. &nbsp; (I see others with same problem) and couldn't be repaired so engineer said
 only way to fix problem was to reinstall Win 10...................ouch ! ! !&nbsp; That was not my big problem though as I closed down computer for the night but got up at 3AM to do some work online...................well, my computer was on ????? with a window
 displaying all my email contacts..............I mean a history going back years.&nbsp; Somehow someone got into my email server and downloaded information..........................wasn't me.........anyway, changed all passwords.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope I am safe now.&nbsp; Maybe I
 should dump Win 10 and go back to Win 7 ?

<p>Hi Mohinish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help us identify the cause of the issue and then find the proper resolution for it, let us know if you made any significant hardware or software changes on your PC prior to this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Code 29 error means that the hardware device is disabled. In other words, Windows recognizes the device in the computer, but the hardware itself is essentially turned off. As an initial troubleshooting step, we suggest that you enable the device in the
 BIOS settings. For information on how you can make this change, you may refer to the hardware documentation or contact the manufacturer of your computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            What&#39;s the best way to Clean Install Windows 10 on my ACER All in One desktop Aspire ZC-102&#63;</h2>
                    <p>What's the best way to do a Clean Install of Windows 10 on my ACER All in One desktop Aspire ZC-102?</p>
<p><span>I bought it new with Windows 8 on it then upgraded to 8.1 and then to 10 using the Windows Update download thing. I waited for a week then it told me my day had come in early August.<br />
But I've been fighting this thing since even before the upgrade to 10. It might be hardware related. I've got another Question going to try to resolve that disaster. I'd sure hoped that the upgrade to 10 would fix everything but it didn't do ANYTHING to the
 performance. Booting, program starts, logging in, installations, basically EVERYTHING sucks. Gerry Cornell has been very
</span><span>generously </span><span>helping me to fix it over at my
</span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/can-i-have-some-help-with-my-sick-windows-10-pc/e6066b14-e8cb-4781-9c5e-7d42773fe690">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/can-i-have-some-help-with-my-sick-windows-10-pc/e6066b14-e8cb-4781-9c5e-7d42773fe690</a>
</p>
<p><span>Anyway, I do have a CD of Windows 10 that I got somewhere (I actually forget due to all the tech messes I've got going on). I think I got it before my upgrade download date finally came and I
 was afraid to use it since these ACER computers have so much odd stuff built in that I worried if some normal disc would do the upgrade correctly. But now I realize that the online download was also just a normal upgrade so the disc would probably have been
 OK.</span></p>
<p><span>You tell me if any of you actually know.
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>So my Question remains, if I end up needing to start over with a Clean Install of Windows 10 or maybe a Repair Install, would I just use this disc or is there an official Microsoft site
 that would have what I need and it could verify thru the internet that my installation of their Windows is genuine as I know it always wants to do?</strong></span></p>

            <p>Hi Jeff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I&nbsp;understand you successfully upgraded and&nbsp;activated Windows 10 but you are facing issues&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;performance&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;due to which you wish to repair or reinstall Windows 10. By repair installation I understand you mean in-place upgrade or custom installation
 of Windows 10 meaning you wish to do a refresh on your system. Please correct me if I am wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before providing any&nbsp;steps I would&nbsp;recommend you to<strong> keep a back up&nbsp;of all the important files and documents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If you are able to successfully login to Windows 10, then&nbsp;you can try a refresh which would be a fresh installation of your OS.
</p>
<p><strong>Refresh is part of reset in Windows 10</strong> </p>

    <title>Disney Infinity Backward Compatibility - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leldorin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disney Infinity Backward Compatibility</h2>
                    
<p>I understand why Xbox 360 games for Kinect may be difficult to make backward compatible due to the hardware differences between the two Kinect sensors (which is too bad, because my son and I love the Kinect Sports games and several
 others), however I don't see how Disney Infinity 1.0 is not simply a software emulation. The Xbox 360 base is interchangeable between versions and consoles, so why is it that an emulation would not allow Infinity 1.0 to work?</p>

<p>Because plain and simple Disney won't allow it. They are the publishers and as with all BC games the publisher has to allow the game to work. This has nothing to do with MS.</p>
<p>Everything I have read about D Infinity says the Version 1 base for the 360 will only work with the Xbox 360. It will work with version 2 and 3 but only on the 360 not the Xbox One. Same for the Version 2 and 3 base for the Xbox One, it won't work on the
 360 and never has. </p>
<p>The Wii U, PS3 and PS4 versions are all interchangeable console to console, but the Xbox peripherals have a chip that locks other consoles out as that is how MS chose to protect the add on market for their console.</p>

<p>The computer continually puts these drives to sleep, as well as the internal drive.</p>
<p>If I haven't accessed the drives for 10 seconds, they are put to sleep and take a while to spin up when I do access them.</p>
<p>Everything is up to date and I can't find anywhere on the pc that controls when and how the drives are put to sleep.</p>
<p>I have been through MS help desk, yet no-one can help me.</p>

<p>Hi George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take a look at the Power Management settings for the external drives you connect to the Surface Studio. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on <strong>Start </strong>(<strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>
X</strong>).</li><li>Choose <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Expand <strong>Disk drives </strong>and locate your drives.</li><li>Right-click on the drive and choose <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Go to the <strong>Power Management</strong> tab and make sure the box for <strong>
Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power</strong> is unticked. If the option is currently selected, untick the box and click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The Power Troubleshooter should also be able to find any power management issues on your device. To run it, go to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Troubleshoot
</strong>&gt; <strong>Power </strong>&gt; <strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest you try running the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit if the problem continues after following the suggestions above. This tool will ensure that you have the recommended drivers and firmware updates on your Surface, and check for other underlying
 software issues. To download the tool, open <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong>. Remember to perform
 a forced shutdown after running the SDT so the Surface will be able to reload the software properly. Simply press the power button for 20 seconds to perform a forced shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be here if you need more help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>I tried everything you suggested, but it's still the same.</p>
<p>Ran the troubleshooter and went through the Device Manager and found the drives listed in 3 different sections, but there was only one section that had the Power tab, so I changed these, but it's still cutting off the power.</p>

<p>Thank you for providing an update, George. Let's review your Surface's Power Options and check if the current settings put the hard disk to sleep. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>Power &amp; sleep</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Additional power settings</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Change plan settings</strong> for the power plan that's currently in use.</li><li>Select <strong>Change advanced power settings</strong>.</li><li>Expand <strong>Hard disk</strong> and do the same for <strong>Turn off hard disk after</strong>. You will see in
<strong>Setting </strong>if the hard disk is currently set to switch off after a specific period of time. Change this setting if needed. By design, the setting applies to all hard drives connected to the Surface.</li><li>If the hard disk is already configured to not turn off but the drives still go to sleep, try creating a different power plan.</li></ol>

<p>Thanks Ruz, but when I go into Change Advanced Power Settings, there is nothing there about the hard disks at all. I've expanded every tab and tried right-clicking on them, but there is no mention of the HDDs. In fact, even the C: drive goes to sleep after
 less than a minute, let alone my connected drives.</p>
<p>I've been going nuts checking every possible setting, but there seems that changing the power settings to external drives is non-existent on my machine. The only place I found something was in Device Manager where I found the USB ports and told it to not
 turn off the power to these ports, but it still does!</p>
<p>Please understand that I am a photographer, and often have to process thousands of photos, and having to wait for the drives to spool up in between every photo is a real chore and is costing me my sleep!</p>
<p>Maybe I need to exchange it for a new one. Is that covered under warranty?</p>

<p>I think the major part of the problem is that this PC thinks it's a laptop or tablet, rather than a desktop computer connected to a wall socket.</p>
<p>Is there some other firmware that can get rid of these laptop-based power settings?</p>

<p>The other way to rule out possible software issues is by using a recovery image to reset the Surface. Before proceeding, remember to back up all your files since the suggested troubleshooting will remove personal files on the Surface. Check
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023512/surface-creating-and-using-a-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong> to learn how you can use a recovery image. Once ready, you can download a recovery image
 for your Surface Studio by going <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem continues after resetting the Surface, then this may be a hardware problem. Please
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact Microsoft Support</a></strong> or drop by a
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Store</a></strong>. If a replacement is necessary and your Surface is under warranty, then we'll be able to provide a replacement unit
 for no cost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly update the post so I can continue looking into this.</p>

<p>I tried the troubleshooter but nothing has changed. I'm reluctant to have to set-up my pc again so I didn't do the recovery thing, as this computer has been switching off the drives (including the C: drive) since it was brand new.</p>
<p>Guess I'll have to pack it up and take it to the Microsoft store in Sydney, but this will mean going by train as it is impossible to park or even drive into the city now, so it will be difficult for me to do this.</p>
<p>Carrying my Surface Studio and my external drives by train should be an experience at my age!</p>
<p>I wish you were like HP that offers free on-site warranty.</p>

    <title>Keep Metro UI open on second display - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> username872  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keep Metro UI open on second display</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've been loving the new Windows 8 experience so far! I was originally unsure when using the customer preview, however, some time spent customizing I realized how useful the Metro UI was for me.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am now running Windows 8 Pro on my desktop with dual monitors. &nbsp;I am able to open a desktop application and a metro app and run side-by-side without issue. &nbsp;However, I would like to have my metro UI with live tiles
<u>always open</u>&nbsp;on my second display while running applications on my primary monitor. &nbsp;Currently, whenever I have no metro applications running and try to launch a desktop app, my metro start menu goes away and I am left with a blank extended desktop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there an option or registry tweak that can be entered to always keep metro open on my second monitor?</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new Windows 8 UI will start on your primary monitor.&nbsp; You can always change which monitor is considered to be your primary.&nbsp; You can only have the new UI on one of the multiple monitors including the new Start Screen.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a blog post that walks&nbsp; you through the Windows 8 multi-monitor feature:&nbsp;

    <title>Achievements only pop on Windows 10 instead of Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Achievements only pop on Windows 10 instead of Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>This isn't a big deal by any means but I'm wondering if anyone knows a fix.&nbsp; Since installing Windows 10 and letting it connect to my Microsoft account, when I unlock an Achievement on Xbox One, it doesn't pop on screen anymore.&nbsp; It pops on my computer.&nbsp;
 It's dumb but I liked the little Achievement popup and sound.&nbsp; I've fussed with all the settings and even disabled Smart Glass but it didn't help.&nbsp; Any thoughts?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Assuming that all of your settings are on Show Notifications, have you tried a hard reset of your console yet? To do this, hold the Xbox logo for about 10 seconds until it fully shuts down, wait a few seconds and turn it on and try again. I definitely know
 how you feel. I'm a little upset when I unlock an achievement on my phone when the sound is off</p>

<p>I don't know how but it fixed itself or I unknowingly fixed it. &nbsp;It still pops on the Windows notification area too but it's popping on the One again. &nbsp;I'll take the win.</p>

<p>I've done this several times....including a few days ago.</p>
<p>The main thing you want to do before this though&nbsp;is to make sure you have all your documents, Favorites&nbsp;etc...saved or moved to somewhere else. This includes any logs created by Programs like SpyBot etc...that may have been written to folders in the particular
 User profile, and you'd like to keep / save.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Yes you can delete this folder if you no more require it. Cross check if you need any data from the folders in it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer&nbsp;the article below to show hidden files:</div>

</p><p><span>Hi Linda,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can upgrade your current PC to Windows 10 by going to the Windows 10 Software Download page to download the Media Creation Tool. The Media Creation Tool can
 be used to create a USB or DVD media to upgrade your current PC to Windows 10 or install Windows 10 on a different PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the instructions on Windows 10 Software Download page:
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10</span></span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong></span><span>When upgrading to Windows 10 using
 media, you must run setup.exe from within your Genuine and Qualified version of Windows 7 or Windows 8. If you want to boot from media, you must have upgraded to Windows 10 previously. Boot from Windows 10 media directly without upgrading to Windows 10 previously
 is not supported and will have activation issues.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 Configuring Windows features stuck on 15&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> takemethere  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Configuring Windows features stuck on 15&#37;</h2>
                    I bought an Asus X502C laptop a few days ago. When I switched it on this morning, it installed four updates and restarted. It is now stuck on a screen saying Configuring Windows features / 15% complete / Do not turn off your computer
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After waiting 15 minutes I turned the power off and switched it back on. It went back to this screen.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been reading posts on the forum for over an hour, but the solutions I can find require actually being able to get the laptop to start up, which I can't do. I've tried turning it off and switching it back on whilst holding F8 and Windows key + X
 but neither had any effect. I was trying to go into safe mode, but I'm not even sure that is how to do it. My Asus manual is useless.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm not interested in having the update installed, I need to use the laptop today and have already wasted time trying to get it to work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Help?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Edit: it is now on 16% after approx. 30 minutes.</div>

                    <p>Hello, as the title says I stopped receiving pop-ups for incoming messages in Skype on my Windows 10 laptop. It used to work just fine until the recent Skype update from a week or so ago. Now I only get a sound + a taskbar icon notifications, no pop-ups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone advise if it's by design or a bug? How can I get those notifications back?</p>

            Hi Lana_MS, I hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear that, give a try to this and see if the same thing happens.
<br />
<br />Quit Skype
<br />
<br />Press windows key + R
<br />
<br />Type %appdata%/Microsoft
<br />
<br />Rename your "Skype for Desktop" folder to Skypefordesktop_old
<br />
<br />Open Skype and sign back into your account.
<br />
<br />Check if you're still having the issue.
<br />
<br />Regards.       
        </p>

    <title>KotOR2 unplayable on the 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> snake616  say:</h3>
<h2>            KotOR2 unplayable on the 360</h2>
                    <p>I just got an email back from support, 5 days after I contacted them, that says a broken game that i bought from the marketplace isn’t eligable for a refund. Since when does a broken product not qualify for a refund????</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a bug that happens very early and completely prevents all progress. 30-45 minutes into the game, after a very short cutscene, the screen goes black, then nothing happens. I’ve loaded old saves, started multiple new games, and deleted and redownloaded
 the game multiple times and it happens every time. Even sat there for about 20 minutes while I messed around on my phone and the screen never changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How does a broken game not qualify for a refund????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never been on here before so I don’t even know of this is the right place to put this.</p>
