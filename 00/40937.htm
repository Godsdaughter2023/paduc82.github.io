            Hi Lutelsa.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page for your Dell Service tag Number on the sticker on bottom of laptop: <a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/Products/laptop?app=drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/Produ...</a> .  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

            Hi  luteIsa, that depends on the type of graphics card you have . . .
<br />
<br />Either way, you cannot so that in Windows, you need to open the Graphics Control Panel (Intel, nVidia . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Generally this is found by right clicking your Desktop or at the bottom right of your screen - an icon for Intel HD Graphics or nVidia Control panel - you might have to click the up arrow to find it on the Taskbar
<br />
<br />Once in the graphics control Panel, find Resolution and choose 'Custom Resolution'
<br />
<br />Then set resolution to 1024 X 768
<br />
<br />Please note, this will skew things very slightly on your screen slightly since that resolution is not supported . . .

    <title>Plugged in, Battery Not Charging - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slhughes315  say:</h3>
<h2>            Plugged in, Battery Not Charging</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Pavilion g7-1077nr Notebook running Windows 10. While my laptop was unplugged with roughly 50% battery life left, the screen blinked, scrambled, and the computer shut down. I tried turning it back on to no avail. I grabbed the charger, plugged
 it in, and turned on the laptop once more. A battery error popped up as it was booting. The battery indicator in the tray says that it is plugged in, but not charging. The battery LED indicator (which is orange when charging, white when charged) is currently
 blinking white. When I unplug the laptop, it shuts down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried several thing, but the only thing that did anything was turning it off, unplugging it, holding down the power button for 30 seconds. When I hooked everything up again and turned it on, the indicator in the tray said it was 76% charged, but not
 charging. While the laptop is off while plugged in, the LED indicator starts off white, turns orange for a bit (this is typical), but then turns white again, not blinking. It only starts blinking when it is turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to the F2 start-up menu, there is no option for a Components Test or a Battery Test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is: How can I fix my laptop's battery? I have a new battery that I have had for less than a year with no problems before this.</p>

    <title>Headphones Not Being Listed Seperately - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael cassoni  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headphones Not Being Listed Seperately</h2>
                    <p>I'm not sure when this happened, maybe with Windows 10 it's causing an issue, cause I don't remember it on 8.&nbsp; When I plug in my headset to the 3.5mm jack on the front of my computer Windows doesn't recognize it as a headphone connection.&nbsp;It keeps combining
 it with my regular speakers and not as two separate devices.&nbsp; This causes issues in programs where I'd rather have the program sound coming through my speakers so I can hear people talking to me through my headset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will also note that I'm using the Realtek HD software. I don't know if that would contribute to the issue.&nbsp;Anybody have an idea of what could be causing this or might be having the same issue and found a solution? Thank you.&nbsp;

            <p>To answer your questions,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't receive any error messages.&nbsp; I don't have an exact make cause it's a custom built, but my Motherboard is a Gigabyte F2A88X-UP4 and that's where I get my sound from.&nbsp; I haven't checked the headphones on another computer, but them being detected isn't
 the problem. Yes, sound comes from my speakers no problem when the headphones aren't plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried both methods to possibly fix the issue, yet I don't think those methods help with the problem I'm having.&nbsp; The system will detect the microphone&nbsp;and the headset no problem, however, when I have my headset plugged into the jack the system doesn't
 count it as a separate device.&nbsp; It thinks my headphones are my actual speakers and sets them as my default playback device even with my actual external speakers still hooked up.&nbsp; I took a snippet here of my sound menu for playback devices to help show what
 it's doing.&nbsp; I do have it to show all disabled devices. All I need to fix my problem is to just have my headphones be listed as a separate device from my speakers.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
To format the D drive, you just have to right click on the D drive and then click on format.<br />
<br />
To format the C drive, you can boot from the Windows vista disk and then format it from there. You can try the links below, they might be of some help.<br />

                    <span>
<p>When I turn on my Acer Aspire 5050 (which runs on Vista), everything loads but when I get to where the login screen
<em>should</em> be, I get the BSOD. This is what the BSOD tells me<br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.<br />
<br />
If this is the first time you've seen this Stop error screen, restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
Check to be sure you have adequate disk space. If a driver is identified in the Stop message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates. Try changing video adapters.<br />
<br />
Check with your hardware vendor for and BIOS updates. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. If you need to use Safe Mode to remove or disable components, restart your computer, press F8 to select Advanced Startup Options, and then select
 Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
Technical information:<br />
*** STOP: 0x0000007e (0xC0000005, 0x81ED2693, 0x805F0650, 0x805F034C)<br />
<br />
<br />
Collecting data for crash dump...<br />
Initializing disk for crash dump...<br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
Now, I've waited for a few hours (6 hours actually...) cause I thought it was going to "crash dump". In the end, I figured nothing was happening so I restarted it to try the other options. I restarted it, same BSOD came up at the same time. I then 'F8' to check
 my options. I've tried every possible option and it goes to the same thing. <br />
I've tried</p>
<ul>
<li>Safe Mode (<strong>all</strong> of them; with networking, with Command Prompt but I don't know how to use command prompt)
</li><li>Enable Boot Logging </li><li>Enable low-resolution video (640x480) </li><li>Last Known Good Configuration (advanced) </li><li>Directory Services Restore Mode </li><li>Disable automatic restart on system failure </li><li>Disable Driver Signature Enforcement </li><li>Starting Windows normally </li><li>Repair Your computer (tried every option but back-up disks because I didn't make one and command prompt because I don't know how to use it)
</li></ul>
<p>Before I got the BSOD, I did have malware on my notebook which I scanned, found and attempted to remove with a cleaner. Each day, there would be the same malware in the same locations even though it was said it was removed. That was over a week, at the 7
 day mark I just got the BSOD upon turning on my laptop. Ever since, I've just left it and tried the options again... but it didn't work.<br />
<br />

            are you sure you really want to replace everything on your Hard drive? there may be ways to fix windows is there any more information after the STOP line sometimes they give a file name or a long word string separtted by underscores "_" like "SOMETHING_WENT_WRONG".<br />
<br />
anyways while you try to work out the problem you might as well boot to command prompt and run the following hopefully it fixes any other problems you might have:<br />
<br />
<br />
chkdsk /r<br />
<br />
sfc /scanonce<br />
or<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
its a difficult problem to pinpoint if its just a single STOP line like that check to see if it has any references to a particular file or whether the message changes after each succussive reboot cause it could be hardware related too.<br />
<br />
<br />
with Acer notebooks you can actually restore your machine back to factory without going to windows. first boot up the computer and press F2 F9 F10 F11 F12 and Del repeatedly one of them will take you to your BIOS. from there you need to disable the quite boot
 function or display POST messages. try to stop it from displaying the Acer logo screen when it boots up because that is hiding the keys that you need to press to get to Acer's eRecovery program.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
BCCode&nbsp; 7e<br />
<br />
Cause
<p>The SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the follwoing:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates a memory access violation occurred.
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the <em>Ntstatus.h </em>file that is located in the
<em>inc</em> directory of the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).</p>
Resolving the Problem
<p>If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have enough disk space. </li><li>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates.
</li><li>Try changing video adapters. </li><li>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </li><li>Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. </li></ul>
<p><em>If you plan to debug this problem</em>, you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter&nbsp;2 (the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware incompatibility<em>. </em>Make sure that any new hardware that is installed is listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.
</li><li>Faulty device driver or system service<em>. </em>A faulty device driver or system service might be responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts, and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error.
</li></ul>
<p>If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS
 file system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you must start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the computer by using the Recovery Console and then deleting
 the offending system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x7E.</p>
<p>You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS might to try to resolve the error. You should also run hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies. For more information about these procedures, see the owner's
 manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows
 installation that are associated with lack of disk space, reduce the number of files on the target hard disk drive. Check for and delete any temporary files that you do not have to have, Internet cache files, application backup files, and
<em>.chk </em>files that contain saved file fragments from disk scans. You can also use another hard disk drive with more free space for the installation. You can resolve BIOS problems by upgrading the system BIOS version.<br />
<br />
======================================================<br />
<br />
Please see the generic troubleshooter in 1st message&nbsp;below and also use the generic driver update methods to
<br />
update major drivers, BIOS, and control software (if any).<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For
<br />
each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description,
<br />
version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your
<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site
<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software
<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

                    <p>I've asked about this issue before but it's happening again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>basically my skype is unresponsive, but not "not responding"</p>
<p>it goes white and thats it, i get an error noise whenever i click on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can receive messages but not click anything or respond to them. This is not all the time, but it's happened at least 4 times now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last time it was fixed by updating my security but it's happened 3 times since and there's nothing wrong with my security programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://snag.gy/CbdG2y.jpg - a screenshot how i looks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>the event log program doesn't register it as an error or a problem either, if that helps.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi DerpyGamer, 
<br />
<br />Let’s give windows troubleshooter a shot. Click start, type “troubleshoot” and launch it. Click on hardware and devices and see if it’ll find the camera. 
<br />
<br />ChipSet:
<br /><a href="https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/DriversForWin10/Chipset/Chipset_Intel_Kabylake_Win10_64_VER101144.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/DriversFo...</a>
<br />
<br />BIOS:
<br /><a href="https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/X411UN/X411UNAS300.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/X411UN/X4...</a>
<br />
<br />Let’s also update the ChipSet and the BIOS, and then we’ll check device manager again. 
<br />
<br />Is there any chance you could send a screenshot of the device manager to me? 
<br />
<br />Press the Windows Key + PrntSc and a photo will save within a screenshot folder in your Pictures folder.
<br />
<br />We’ll try to figure this out!

<h2>            How to layer video clips</h2>
                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
Other Windows Live Movie Maker issues

<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Movie Maker are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Version 2011 (15.4.3538.513)</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows 7</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
I just upgraded to the Windows Live Movie Maker. I have done a lot of work on an older version of Movie Maker that was on my previous Vista system. On that version I was able to put two video clips side by side and then click and drag one over the other to
 overlap them so that they would gradually fade into one another. For some reason it won't let me do it like that on this newer version, it only allows me to move the sequence of my clips. So I was wondering if there was a way to achieve this effect. Any help
 would be appreciated. Thank you! <br />

<p>In the prior WMM version, if you dragged video clips so they overlapped, WMM would insert an implied Fade transition.&nbsp; You can get the same results in WLMM, but you just have to do it a different way.<br />
<br />
You would put the two clips (one after the other) and pick from your animations.&nbsp; Find the one labeled 'Cross Fade'.&nbsp; You'll also probably want to adjust the duration of the transition to get the desired overlap.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you could load WMM 6.0 on your Windows 7 system and get back the drag-drop interface for overlapping clips.&nbsp; You would also then be able to use all the custom transitions/effects/titles that are available for that version.&nbsp; And you could have
 that and WLMM on your system at the same time so you could use whichever program fit a specific project need (e.g. quick, lots of photos, simple interface = WLMM, more control, custom transitions/effects/titles = WMM)<br />

    <title>Mass Effect 3 is not recognizing my save file. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xeroshinobi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mass Effect 3 is not recognizing my save file.</h2>
                    
<p>I transferred my Mass Effect 3 save to the cloud and then downloaded it to my friend's console to play while I was there, and it worked fine. I put it back on the cloud and redownloaded it to my console, and all of a sudden the game won't recognize it at
 all. I don't even see "Load game" on the main menu. I tried both disc 1 and 2, I put the save back on the cloud tried to load the save without success, put it back on the harddrive and tried again without success. I'm starting to think I'm going to have to
 restart from scratch.</p>
<p>If anyone knows of a solution, I'd appreciate it.</p>

<p>That is weird, once suggestion I have is to test your save file on your friend's xbox again so see if was a transfer error. It could be that your xbox isn't recognizing the save file for some reason, I would test it out by re-downloading it onto your friends
 xbox, and if it works try once again to transfer it back over onto the cloud. </p>

<h2>            Windows 7 critical problem when connecting to internet</h2>
                    
<p>I recently had a bunch of trojans on my computer, and after removing them, Windows displays the message "Windows has encountered a critical problem and will restart in one minute" whenever I turn on the wireless network switch. It happens in safemode with
 networking as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the errors Event Viewer reported:</p>

<p>firstly run system file checker by opening command prompt with administrative&nbsp;privileges and type<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></p>
<p>let this scan to complete. It will repair any damaged system files. Also if the shutdown message comes up run "shutdown -a" command using run (windows key + R). Hope that it will help. But if some trojan earlier messed up with your registry then you might
 have to run windows repair by booting from dvd using windows installation dvd.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

    <title>32 vs 64 bit programs on secondary drives or partitions&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> randycolby  say:</h3>
<h2>            32 vs 64 bit programs on secondary drives or partitions&#63;</h2>
                    I recently built a new PC and made a major jump from WinXP to Windows 8. &nbsp;&nbsp; I have been so used to organizing things my own way on my system by partitioning two different hard drives, with each partition used for different types of programs (C was always
 for OS and nothing more, G drive for Games, P drive for pagefile, S drive for Music Software, etc).&nbsp; I have set up my new system in this same way but have since learned about the whole Program files vs Program Files (x86) sorting.&nbsp; Most of my programs are
 running just fine where I put them anyway, but I am having a couple of my most used programs crash a lot.&nbsp; I am not sure whether it's because they were not designed for Windows 8 usage, or if it's because I didn't put them in C:\Program Files (x86).&nbsp; I am
 now attempting to slowly reconfigure my system and just accept that I cannot organize things the way I'd like.<br />
<br />
My question before I go any further is this...<br />
Will Windows 8 read my programs files the same way if I still use a secondary drive or partition?<br />
Can I put my games into G:\Program Files (x86)\ or even G:\Games\Program Files (x86) instead of C:\Program Files (x86)\ ?<br />
<br />
I don't need anyone to tell me that there is no need for me to use partitions or multiple drives.&nbsp; I understand that.&nbsp; It's just how I am used to keep things organized and easy to find.&nbsp; I just want to understand the protocol so I can properly reconfigure my
 system.&nbsp; If I have to put all my programs on C for Windows 8 to be able to properly call up system files without getting confused between 32 bit and 64 bit dll's, then I will do that, and then just use my second hard drive for files and backup data.&nbsp; If Windows
 can properly sort 32 and 64 bit programs on various drive letters if I just sort them into Program Files and Program Files (x86) per each drive letter, I would prefer to do it that way.<br />

Thanks for your response, RIchard.&nbsp; The tricky part is knowing whether a program is acting up because it is not in that folder.<br />

            <p>I have found that in sticking with reputable software, it generally doesn't screw up unless it's unhappy about something.&nbsp; Rarely have I found a program that I install and it's stuffed or flaky after the install unless I either did something to it while installing it didn't like or it's not happy with something already present.&nbsp; In that case a quick uninstall/reinstall should tell the tale.</p><p>Any decent, well tested program should be happy no matter where you install it (with certain exceptions such as trying to force an install into a protected folder like the Windows root folder).</p>

<p>Removing the accounts will not correct anything. It will permanently remove all the account folders and their contents. Adding the accounts back again won't make any difference if you use the same settings as before. Re-installing the program won't make

<p>That is the IP address of your computer, or of your router if that's how you're connected to the Internet. It belongs to the GWI network. The GWI postmaster needs to know which
<em>server </em>you're using to send. The one&nbsp;in the error message you quote is one belonging to tds.net (64.8.70.104 is the IP address of mx.tds.net).
</p>
<p><br />
What is the name of the outgoing (SMTP) server on the <em>Servers</em> tab of the accounts' properties dialogues?
</p>
<p><br />
Was the error message you quoted part of a bounce message from tds.net? Or from a Windows Live Mail error message?</p>
<p>

</span></div>
</blockquote>
<p>That is quite immaterial. When you send from a mail client like Windows Live Mail, you're using a completely different system from when you use webmail. The servers involved are different ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you have to change the server port for outgoing mail, or was it already 587?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened to the test message you sent?</p>

            This solution did not help me. I have the same issue with various file types after upgrading to Windows 10. MP4, MTS, etc. Odd thing is, sometimes the files play normally, but most of the time I get an error message saying the file type is not supported...The
 SAME file it just played.

</p><p>I dont get any error message. &nbsp;The player plays the audio and not the video thats why I thought it had something to do with the codecs. &nbsp;What I dont understand is why it was working before the upgrade to windows 10 and not now. &nbsp;Whatever codecs that were
 on the machine under 7 should still be there unless the upgrade wiped them out. Ive called your tech support, gone through the forums, followed all the solutions that have been given but still no resolution. &nbsp;Please help</p>

<p>Media player was playing mp4s using windows 7 prior to the installation of win10. &nbsp;After the upgrade WMP only plays sound with no video. &nbsp;Ive tried installing various codecs, checking for corrupt system files, removing and reinstalling WMP and no luck. &nbsp;HELP!!!</p>

<p>I have this same problem with playing mp4s and other assorted problems with the Windows Media Player after updating to Windows 10 on my previous HP Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried different codec suggestions and have messed with this for a week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the Microsoft Windows company needs to come up with another update for this WINDOW 10 UPDATE Problem, so the customers don't have to go through this!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I followed steps to 'troubleshoot' Windows Media Player and got a message (even when running as Admin) that settings may be incorrect, but reset of settings does not fix it. HELP!</p>

<h2>            windows movie maker error 0x87160139</h2>
                    <p>ive done it before but now suddenly I cannot. every time I try to edit a mp4 type file I get all the way to publishing and end up with yellow caution triangles dictating my file is either corrupt or not supported. I can get the file to play on other apps
 but not my currently updated version of movie maker. I just want to know what I can do to get it to edit and finish a project sans buying a computer and a photoshop based movie editer.</p>

<p>hi,</p>
<p>I am using Windows 7 Home Premium. Can someone please tell me whether the files are associated with Windows systems. This is because I have allowed permission to execute these files and in less than&nbsp;an hour my desktop&nbsp;standard gadgets stopped working (clock
 only show a&nbsp;black square with a red vertical line, calendar never load at all).</p>
<p>Oliqaa.exe, Osw.exe, Osx.exe, Osv.exe</p>
<p>Description: Windows Setup API</p>
<p>Publisher: Windows (R) CodeName Longhorn DDK Provider</p>
<p>File Path: C:\Windows\OLIQAA.EXE</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\OSW.EXE</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\OSX.EXE</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\OSV.EXE</p>
<p>The OSV.EXE file is missing now. I just want to know whether they are part of my Windows&nbsp;7 system files. If not I wished to delete them. Please advise on the above matter.</p>
<p>Many Thanks</p>
<p>Loyal</p>
