<h2>            Cant received call on Win10 app when iOS app also installed</h2>
                    <p>I have Skype via the Windows App Store on Win10 Pro. I also have Skype on my iPhone 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having this weird issue where when anyone calls me it only rings on the phone. If I sign out of Skype on the phone, it will still not ring on my computer. So essentially I cannot get a call on my computer. I use the desktop app to screen share but can't
 get around it. Also the person on the other end who I could call also has the same setup so it wont ring on their computer either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ANyone else seen this and found a work around?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Yes I have that setting on for receiving incoming calls. My other friend has the exact same settings and it only rings on her Android phone and ipad, you have to sign out of both to get it to ring on the computer. Super annoying.</p>

                    I just received&nbsp; a call from someone claiming to be from Microsoft Security Essentials Customer Service Department.&nbsp; They knew my name &amp; address &amp; claimed they got it from me registering my computer when we bought it.&nbsp; They said people in the town I live

 a lot of questions about if I was having any problems with the internet. I told him I didn't believe him &amp; ask him why he called my home.&nbsp; He kept repeating the stuff about wanting to help me with my computer &amp; kept saying he was with microsoft security system.
 Does Microsoft Security System really call people at their homes &amp; try to get them to talk to them over the phone about their computers? This is a very bad idea! Also why did my calle

            <p>Hi Carol,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It is a SCAM!!! Microsoft does not do that nor do they have partners who do that nor do they hire sub-contractors or people or even get volunteers to do that. There are probably thousands of such companies out there doing this every day - we get two
 or three messages like this (or more) every day asking about it. You are the lucky ones who recognized the scam enough not to be sucked into it and end up with identify theft, infections, hacking of your computer, convincing you to buy software or services
 you either don't need or that don't really exist at all, and all sorts of nefarious tricks. You'd be surprised by how many contact us AFTER they realized they'd been suckered asking what to do. Do not waste time talking to these people, do not give them any
 personal information whatsoever, do not be tricked by what they may get you to see on the computer - in fact, don't do anything they suggest on your computer or even visit websites they recommend, and for heaven's sake don't give them access to your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Microsoft knows this goes on but with these companies springing up like dandelions, or closing and changing names when discovered, and mostly operating in foreign countries, it would take an army of lawyers to pursue every one of them. They do the
 best they can, but there simply are too many and more get added every day. People have to be careful of these things. They not only occur by phone, but also by e-mail, instant messaging, regular mail and every way imaginable. Just remember that Microsoft does
 not do this and hang up or delete emails or messages or mail from anyone claiming they are doing this because they know information about your computer or want information from you to confirm your account so it won't be closed and ask you for your username
 and password and all sorts of other personal information. Microsoft DOES NOT DO THIS!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>See the following for additional information about this and what to do and how Microsoft operates:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope you didn't get caught by these scammers and saved yourself a big headache. Continue to use the same caution and you should do fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you got caught by these scammers (did any of the things they suggested and especially if you gave them access), I would also proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It was not a good idea to give them access to your computer or any personal information, but if they had access to your computer or you visited a website they suggested or downloaded anything intentionally or unintentionally from a website or email,
 they could have infected you or made changes (or installed a way to gain access at their convenience in a background download occurring while they were showing you things and installing who knows what). Plus if they installed fee-based products (as is often
 the case since they negotiate deals with such vendors to split the profits on such “sales” – in effect, a kickback), they may have removed other products and when the service is cancelled what they installed may also be cancelled. In some cases, this may be
 good. In others, it may leave you without security protection depending on what they did. So you need to make sure that you eventually have proper firewall and real-time AV protection installed (and remove any they installed unless you did a clean install
 or System Restore as will be suggested shortly – then just confirm things are back to normal and the security is enabled or re-installed).
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>See this article: </span><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx?PageIndex=10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx?PageIndex=10</span></a><span>.
 The article also includes links for things to do if you think you've been a victim of this type of scam and information about what Microsoft does and doesn't do so you won't be tricked again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Still, it doesn't hurt to be cautious. <b>I believe the safest thing to do at this point is to backup your data and do a clean install or a restore to factory conditions (however you are setup to start from scratch after doing a full format of the
 hard drive).</b> If you aren’t prepared for such a radical solution (even if it is the safest), please at least proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do a System Restore to before the call and giving them access. That will hopefully remove anything they may have installed and undo any changes they might have made. Also change your password and security questions with your email provider, network,
 ISP and perhaps others listed below (which a System Restore won’t do – they’ll still be the same until you revise them). There’s no telling what they could have done while they had access to your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then to make sure you weren't infected, please do the following;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:</span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><span>
 and SuperAntiSpyware:</span><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a><span> and then run a full ESET online scan:
</span><a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Are you running Microsoft Security Essentials? </span></p>

<p><span>P.S. In the meantime, I'd contact the bank or credit card company and dispute the charge to try and get my money back (if you actually paid anything - otherwise skip ahead to the P.P.S). Canceling the card is not enough to remove prior transactions
 that were charged to it without disputing them – and there may be more than just this one company if they installed products that cost money that will separately charge you (or already have). That may be simpler than asking the company or companies for a refund
 - but if the banks can't help you at this point, then of course try to get the refund from the company or companies (and keep asking to talk to the person's manager until you get as high as you can) and tell them if they refuse you'll notify the authorities
 and the company that hosts their website and take legal action (even if we know you won't because it's too much of a hassle, they won't be certain).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>How far you want to go in terms of changing all your other passwords, pins, logon information, account information (including all your financial data if on the computer) and such is a decision you need to make for yourself. They are not all related
 to resolving the computer issues and your best bet outside of anything computer-related is to contact those companies or the local authorities and see what they advise (or seek out an attorney for advice).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>P.P.S. If you wish to report it and live in the United States, here are some links you can try:</span></p>

</span><a href="http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx</span></a><span> This one is the "big gun" and while the best (like getting the BAU to take your case at the FBI), they really only focus on the major cases.
 I imagine enough complaints from enough people (or the right person or perhaps someone actually victimized or the company being misrepresented) about a particular company would make it a major case, but frankly don't know how they work or prioritize what they
 do. Still, since if they do get involved they can probably do the most to resolve the matter, I'd include them if I were harmed.</span></p>

<p>Thank You for your quick answer &amp; the helpful information.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be visiting many of the sites you suggested so I can become more familiar with scams &amp; to make sure my computer is secure.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>One more question - &nbsp;was it a mistake to tell&nbsp;the caller yes he was speaking to Carol after he told me who he was.&nbsp;He said he had to verify who he was speaking to.&nbsp; He ask me if the&nbsp;address&nbsp;he had listed for me was correct also, which it was.&nbsp; I did not
 verify any other information for him because I became suspicious &amp; told him I didn't believe him when he kept trying to reassure me he was from Microsoft Security Systems &amp; was only wanting to help me fix any computer problems I might be having because of
 an internet&nbsp;virus in our town.&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>
If he told you your address and you confirmed it, it is unlikely he could do anymore harm by you confirming it. &nbsp;
<div>One more thing you need to remember, as does everyone. &nbsp;Caller ID is very easy to spoof. &nbsp;You should never believe it is accurate, so you can not trust someone who calls you out of the blue as being who they say they are. &nbsp;NEVER provide any confidential
 or sensitive info unless you know for a fact whom you are talking to. &nbsp;If they have you even slightly convinced they are legitimate, thank them, hang up, and call that bank, credit card agency or whatever yourself by looking up the number in a phone book.
 &nbsp;By doing that you are safe as you know you have reached the legitimate company you want to talk to.</div>

            <p>Well...&nbsp; looks like I fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After several hours of chat support from Skype, their top people had no idea - referred me to Windows 10 support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is achieved through the nifty <strong>Contact Support</strong> app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>...but that wouldn't load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried a PowerShell script that... fixes broken store apps... and it just broke them further.<br />
</p>
<p>After that... things were even more broken... Live tiles had cryptic values instead of names - and the tiles were darkened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... I refreshed my machine, ran updates, and the <strong>Messaging + Skype</strong> app is back to normal..

<h2>            AirDrop sharing in Word</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to share documents via AirDrop? It would be just great option for iOS users.</p>
<p>If not, can we talk about future update in which it would be added?</p>

    <title>How do I permanently delete contacts&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geraldlynch52  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I permanently delete contacts&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How do I delete contacts that are no longer relevant? I used to work for an online teaching service and as part of that position I had to add about 20 or so contacts that I now have no use for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed them from my contact list, but every time they sign in their log in appears on my screen no matter what I am viewing. I have no real reason to block them just in case I work for that company some time in the future and just want to stop seeing
 them every time they log in.</p>

            Hey, thank you for helping me mate. I will try to answer following questions: Phone model is Microsoft Lumia 950<br />
1. No, I have latest updates on my phone and everything works really good except Store.<br />
2. I don't think that I understood you well, but&nbsp; I didn't try updating Windows Store in particular. How should I update my Windows Store?<br />
3.I reported this problem via Feedback hub on my phone but they didn't answer me anything.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; Also I followed steps from this link https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13390/lumia-what-to-do-if-i-cannot-download-or-update-apps-from-store (steps below 'On your phone') but nothing happened.&nbsp;

 any problems or updates to help fix the problem.&nbsp; No other problems printing and it prints photos fine from iPhone or ipad.&nbsp; Office word prints fine to paper.&nbsp; Just this photo printing problem.

            <p>But only one is the Answer. :) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you use icloud, calendar and contacts are sucked into the icloud and stored in a new data file format, accessible only by the icloud. If you remove the iclud addin, the appointments and contacts are still in the icloud but not in Outlook.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you quit using the icloud addin you need to copy the stuff back into the Outlook folders. My preference is to open the Icloud folders, select all and use the Copy to folder command (copy, because I still want them on my device) before signing out. Alternately,
 you can sign out of the icloud and let the icloud copy them back to the Outlook folders - choose the 'make a copy'&nbsp;button&nbsp;when you sign out.&nbsp; (I prefer to do it myself.)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you choose the manual, do-it-yourself method, use a list view in the calendar.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Outlook.com, under Settings-General-Mobile Devices I see three items: ChatService, UniversalOutlook and WindowsMail. I tried deleting them (especially the ChatService, which didn't seem to be connected to my devices) and I couldn't. There's a pop-up window
 saying that they can't be found.</p>
<p><br />

    <title>Copy and pastes a cell without changing a formula. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy and pastes a cell without changing a formula.</h2>
                    In Excel 2016 in Office 365 if you moved a cell by either drag/drop or copy/paste you would not change the formula in a different cell.&nbsp; Such as in cell D5 the formula is =C5-B5.&nbsp; If I copy/insert cell into B5 so what was in cell B5 is now in B6 the formula
 in D5 then becomes =C5-B6.&nbsp; How do I turn off this option.&nbsp; Excel did not use to do this.&nbsp; I want to be able to do this without having to use something such as an index function.&nbsp; There are times in the same spreadsheet that I will reference a cell or formula
 and as the sheet evolves and I move information around.&nbsp; I do not want to have to use an index function at the front of every single formula I enter.

<p>I think you are mis-remembering how it was done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just copy the cell and paste it over the existing cell. Don't use "Insert copied cell" Also, you should not get a message like "There is already data here. Do you want to replace it?" and you should not be inserting using Shift-Drag.&nbsp; All those affect the
 formula.</p>

    <title>Internet Explorer and Google Chrome unresponsive after power cut - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julia wood  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer and Google Chrome unresponsive after power cut</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago my PC was plugged into the mains and we experienced a power cut for a few minutes - after the power came back on everything was fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went to boot up my PC the next day and it started system recovery, the screen remained at a sort of buffering stage for about 30 minutes so I manually shut it down and restarted. Ever since, it gives me a message stating "runtime error 217 at 000168DD"
 when I try to load Google chrome I get another error message and Internet Explorer simply won't respond. I have tried everything - performing a system restore to a date before the power cut, performing a system repair through safe mode nothing has worked.
 I am using Windows 7 and Internet Explorer 11 if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any ideas on how to fix this issue please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you :-)</p>

<h2>            Active Sync not Recognizing mobile device</h2>
                    
<p>Help!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I am trying to sync my pda through my laptop with our server.&nbsp; I get the error msg that says the device (pda) is not recognzied.&nbsp; I want to transfer files from the pda to the server and also utilize a field program that requires active sync to
 sync compressed files created in the field with the full program files on the server.&nbsp; I have loaded active sync on the server in the assumption that once the server recognzies the mobile device on a direct link this should also work when i remote in to the
 server using my lap top.&nbsp; I have not tried a direct wi-fi link from the pda in to our system, but I hoped that acitve sync on the server would recognize the pda linked to the laptop in the same manner&nbsp; the 'remote desktop' feature recognizes attached drives
 on the lap top which includes a usb connected disk drive.&nbsp; Any ideas???? Thx.</p>

    <title>Transfer Office 365 Subscription to a Separate Microsoft Account. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theshadowmaster  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfer Office 365 Subscription to a Separate Microsoft Account.</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little while ago, Microsoft informed me that I would be allowed a free upgrade from Office 2010 to Office 365. They gave me the ability to download the software onto three separate laptop or desktop devices, and several other mobile devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the time, I was using a certain Microsoft Account with a Hotmail address. Unfortunately, since that time that particular account has been succumbed to junk email and hence I have created a new account using an Outlook address and continued to only use
 my original Hotmail address for the purposes of Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, soon I may be purchasing a new laptop which will mean I will move from a system operating Windows 7 to a system operating Windows 8 or perhaps Windows 8.1. As the new operating system is much more integrated, and uses your Microsoft Account much
 more, I decided now was a good time to sort out this issue once and for all and move my entire four year subscription to Office 365 University to my current account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only problem is that I have found no way to do this. I have scrawled through various other threads but all the advice given by employees of Microsoft has all failed to solve the problem, not only for me but for various other unhappy customers. I was
 hoping that the issue now had a straightforward solution that could be revealed to me via this thread. Is that the case?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>TheShadowMaster</p>

<h2>            Couldn&#39;t install Error&#58; Is your internet connection working&#63;  Do you have enough free space on your main hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title:</strong> Couldn't install</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I finally got my brand new laptop today (Lenovo Y510P), &amp; it was ordered with Microsoft Office 2013.&nbsp; I received the product key in the mail, so I went to activate it, &amp; it worked perfectly fine.&nbsp; However, I managed to mess up my computer while experimenting,
 so I had to reset the computer to how it was at a previous point.&nbsp; At that point, Microsoft Office was not activated on my computer, so I imagined that I would just activate it again, because, as far as I know, I can activate it as many times as I want on
 the same computer.&nbsp; However, every time I try, a popup appears saying:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Couldn't install</p>
<p>We're sorry, we had a problem installing your Office program(s).</p>
<p>Is your internet connection working?&nbsp; Do you have enough free space on your main hard drive?</p>
<p>Please try installing again after you've checked the above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, my internet connection is obviously working, &amp;, seeing as how I just received this computer brand new today &amp; haven't put much on it yet, I definitely have enough space on my main hard drive.&nbsp; Just in case, I even tried what your resources say to do
 if I have no space.&nbsp; It still doesn't work.&nbsp; So, why is this happening, &amp; what do I do to get Office 2013?&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            Or you could use a PC with Nokia PC Suite to transfer/copy/synchronize the contacts. That way all you need to do is to connect the cable and the rest is done from the PC.

<h2>            Project 2013</h2>
                    
<p>As the subject states,</p>
<p><br />
My company does not want to push out Office 2016 via O365 just yet. In order to prevent that I would need to get Project 2013. Does anyone have that link by any chance? I had already gotten the Office 2013 link from the sticky-ed post above but I would need
 2013 Project as well as Visio if possible. Thanks</p>
