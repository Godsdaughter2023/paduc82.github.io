<h2>            How to prevent non-admins from adding others to group chat&#63;</h2>
                    So with the new cloud based skype chats, most of the old commands are useless, so please, anyone know how to allow only admins to add people to a chat, and not anyone else?<br />
<br />
I know about the whole, /set allowlist and only allowing those people to join, but its quite tedious for a large group of 60 members. anything faster out there?

<p><span>Hello chloe_Pie, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to the Skype Community forum! </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please be advised that <strong>only admins</strong> are allowed to add or promote people in a group chat.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are the <strong>creator of the</strong> <strong>group, </strong>you are able to edit member roles and ‘demote’ an admin back to a member role.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To display the list of members and their roles, you may use <strong>/showmembers.
</strong>From there, you may set their roles using the <strong>/setrole</strong> command.
</span></p>
<p>

<p>well I have not experienced this. All members of this room could add members, whether they are admins or speakers (checked using /show members). &nbsp;so perhaps this was true of the old chats but not with the new cloud based chats?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way around I could find was by creating an allowlist, even so, its not the ideal soloution.</p>

<h2>            IE11 - Unable to use Favourites and Bookmarks - Error&#58; Class not registered</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After installing IE11 Preview and afterwards, IE11 Release on my Windows 7&nbsp;SP1&nbsp;64 bit machine, I can't use Favourites any more.</p>
<p>Bookmarks from Favourites don't open - don't open page and no error, when adding bookmarks error appears Class not registered.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have uninstalled IE11, IE10 and IE9 several times, and then reinstalled IE11 again, but no success.</p>
<p>As Slovenian is default OS language, and 64 bit OS version, I suspect it is somehow the cause.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anybody have any suggestions for solving the problem?</p>
<p>Thank You and Best Regards,</p>
<p><br />

            <span>Hi Stark,<br />
<br />
Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
This issue might occur due to some third party add-ons or third party programs causing the issue.
<br />

    <title>Excel 2016 Crashes deleting charts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikesmall4399  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 Crashes deleting charts</h2>
                    <p>i have an excel workbook that contains 7 scatter charts embedded on a worksheet.</p>
<p>when you close the workbook excel 2016 crashes.</p>
<p>when you delete the worksheet excel 2016 crashes:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2a664d30-c573-4245-b216-91d38eee75b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2a664d30-c573-4245-b216-91d38eee75b8" /></a></p>
<p>i have traced what happens using vba to delete the worksheet:</p>
<p>deleting the last chart that was created always results in the crash</p>
<p>if you simply delete the worksheet it results in excel crash.</p>
<p>if you delete the charts one by one - excel crashes on the delete of the last chartobject created</p>

<p>all the charts are x y scatter and changing the templates etc, makes no difference.&nbsp; irrespective of the order in which the charts are deleted - deleting the last chart created results in a crash.</p>
<p>i am running windows 10 pro with all the latest updates installed.&nbsp; office 365 for business with all the latest updates installed.&nbsp; i done all the usual checks including sfc /scannow</p>
<p>i have spent many hours rebooting, re-installing office and so forth.</p>
<p>any suggestions would be gratefully received.</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>From your description, I noticed that you have tried some troubleshooting steps. Therefore, could you confirm if you performed the following steps to troubleshot the issue? If not, could you try it to see if there is any improvement?&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Start Excel in safe mode via the method 3 in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2758592" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the article </a>to check the result.<br />
2. Check if the issue is related to the COM add-ins. We can disable then via clicking
<strong>FILE &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Go &gt;</strong> clear the check boxes<strong> &gt;</strong> restart app.
<br />
3. Perform a clean boot to check whether it is related to some third party services. Also temporarily disable the Antivirus software.
<br />
4. Scan Excel for known issues with Office Configuration Analyzer Tool in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/2939112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the article</a>. <br />
5. Check if you can find the Abbyy Finereader on the computer: <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/35686e6b-b7db-447f-907b-d552c9b6aa34/excel-2013-error-microsoft-excel-has-stopped-working?forum=officeitpro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            For sure you will not get 10525 since 10532 superseded it.&nbsp; If there is a new build to the fast ring you will not get 10532.&nbsp; When the think that it is getting close to the release to the general public they should put out an ISO or an update so the slow
 ring can do another check.<br />

            <p>There won't be .iso files for 10525 and 10532. &nbsp;They are not stable builds. &nbsp;The whole point of the slow ring is to only receive stable builds. &nbsp;"Slow" is maybe a misleading name. &nbsp;Maybe it should be called "Stable." &nbsp;There might be an .iso for the next
 stable build, but by then you will have it via Windows Update anyway. &nbsp;I have seen an .iso for 10525 on the web, but it has been pulled. &nbsp;It was not a Microsoft site. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You make a choice between getting an early peek and helping swat bugs (Fast ring) or take fewer chances on running into a bug and testing for usability and functionality only (Slow ring). &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi All am new to here!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am loving my TyTnII and it's my first windows PDA/phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have a slight problem, i need to be able to sync with web outlook, have entered all the details as requested but it won't sync as the security certificate is not valid.&nbsp; Is there a way to tell WM6 that the certificate is trusted so that i
 can sync?&nbsp; I have already asked about getting the certificate validated, aparently this is not an option tho

<p>You need to copy the certificate to your device. Here's how you do that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Access your email using Internet Explorer on your PC. You will notice a padlock in the status bar at bottom right hand of your screen. Double click on it. The certificate window will open. Click the Details tab and click Copy to File button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Next. Select DER encoded binary X.509 (.CER). Click Next</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Type a filename and click browse to save the file to a location of your choice. Click Next and Finish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Navigate to the location where you saved the certificate and copy it. Connect your device to your PC. Paste the&nbsp;certificate to any location on the pda. Tap to install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to access your email. Let us know if this works.</p>

            Hi Linley, thanks for your help.&nbsp; I have done this, but I still have the same problem, it's mainly to do with the name of the certificate not matching the website name.

            Unchecking the use SSL will start sending it clear text. This isn't something you probably want to do and some servers only allow SSL connections.<br />
<br />
To get this working on my phone I copied the certificate onto the phone then installed it by browsing to it on the phone and choosing "Install" from the menu. It works perfectly now!<br />

<h2>            Resource Usage View - Assignment Summary Line Not Adding Up Correctly</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have trawled through numerous forums and this support site but am yet to find a resolution to the following issue, I hope someone can help! :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently using MS Project 2010 (SP2)&nbsp;along with PWA/Project Server 2010 and I'm having some issue with the assignment summary line for&nbsp;in the resource usage view not adding up hours correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a resource that is working on multiple projects that are stored in project server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first open up server I&nbsp;ensure the "Load assignments" tick box is checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I open up one of the project schedules and navigate to the resource usage&nbsp;view.&nbsp;It's&nbsp;showing some confusing figures at the summary line that sometimes doesn't add up the hours&nbsp;under the "Other Projects and Commitments" section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reviewed the tasks in all the project schedules that the resource has been assigned work and they are all set to "auto schedule" and are a combination of manual and flat&nbsp;based work contoured assignments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I&nbsp;have all schedules from project server open&nbsp;(checked out and not read only) the summary line that adds up resource work hours&nbsp;changes to the correct figure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a bug in MS project or is there a setting that I am missing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy to&nbsp;send a couple of example screen shots to anyone who is willing to help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pete</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UPDATE: 28/07/14</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like there is some sort of bug and it doesn't seem like there is a fix. I have however found that you can find some useful reports in the "Resource Availability" section of the Resource Center in PWA that may assist in identifying specific resource
 over allocations. Will update this post if I find a fix.</p>

</p><p>Over the years, there have been numerous reports that the Resource Usage view does not show the correct numbers when the PM selects the Load Summary Resource Assignments option is selected.&nbsp; I suspect that this is a bug, and because of this, I personally
 use the Other Projects and Commitments option only to see the other projects to which a team member is assigned.&nbsp; If you deselect this option when you connect to Project Server 2010, do you see that the numbers are correct in the Resource Usage view?&nbsp; Let
 us know and we will try to help you.</p>

            <p>Hi Dale,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your reply. It's much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do unselect the "Load resource allocation" checkbox upon opening project the resource summary line does sum up correctly however the ability to see resource allocation is crucial for our program as we have engineers that work across multiple projects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any other ideas on a way I could view this info?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any reports/views that I could easily pull out of server/PWA to display this info?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's crucial that each of the project managers in our team who&nbsp;are the owners of the schedules be able to view resource allocations across the program in order to identify any over allocations. I see this as one of project servers core functions and it would
 be disappointing to learn that this is flawed and has been for quite some time as it totally defeats the purpose of server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for the rant! It's just that I'm new to project server (have been using MS project stand alone for 8 years) and it's not currently living up to my expectations as a collaboration tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>

</p><p>Why don't you create a master project containing all of the projects in the program?&nbsp; Then, when you open the master project, you will be able to see the big picture of how your PMs are using the resources across the program, including seeing cross-project
 overallocations.&nbsp; When you create the master project, I would recommend you insert each subproject in Read-Only mode, otherwise you will lock your PMs out of their projects while you have the master project open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beyond this, you could build custom reports in the Business Intelligence Center in PWA&nbsp;for this purpose as well.&nbsp; Just a couple of ideas.&nbsp; I hope others in this forum will share their ideas as well.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestions Dale.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately forming a master project schedule would not work as you would have to insert every schedule in our division (40 plus schedules) &nbsp;which would make the file clunky and slow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have however had a look at some of the reporting in PWA and there are a few reports that are useful. Good suggestion!</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 stops responding when attempting to forward HTML formatted email to other office 365 users.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a strange issue, one of my end users is unable to forward email that comes in as HTML format to other office 365 users. &nbsp;But i remove all the office 365 users on the email and send it to an external user on gmail or something it fires off with out
 issues. &nbsp;I can convert the email to rich or plain text but then i lose formatting. &nbsp;</p>

<p>hi james,</p>
<p>to troubleshoot the issue, i’d like to confirm the following information:</p>
<p>1. if the affected user create a new <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
outlook profile</a>, is there any improvement?<br />
2. if possible, please try another computer and see if the issue persists. this will help us identify if the issue is related to the client side.<br />
3. have you checked owa(<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook web app</a>)? does the issue occur too when using owa?<br />
4. about “end users is unable to forward email”, did you receive any error message when forwarding the emails? if so, please share the screenshot of the error message for analysis. to upload a picture, please click
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> under the reply box and then click the <strong>
insert/edit media</strong> icon.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=846ec6e9-c0e9-44ca-8166-11768bf15a78" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d846ec6e9-c0e9-44ca-8166-11768bf15a78" /></a></p>
<p><br />
5. does the issue occur only when forwarding the emails in html format? how about sending a new email in html format to office 365 users? also, does the issue occur to all html format emails or specific ones?</p>
<p>we’re looking forward to your updates.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />
aaron</p>

<p>1. I tested this previously and it did resolve the issue.</p>
<p>2. the issue occurs on other machines, this also occurs on a office 2016 install on a windows 2008 R2 terminal server.</p>
<p>3. owa works without issue. </p>
<p>4. The end user does not receive an error message, outlook stops responding when we hit "SEND" until we either end task on outlook, or disable the network interface. If we disable the network interface the message will go into the outbox, At which point
 the next time you try to send it the issue reoccurs. If i take the same email and remove the office 365 users and send it to a client address or even a gmail/hotmail/outlook address the issue doesn't occur. &nbsp;Im able to see my online status in the forwarded
 email. &nbsp;</p>
<p>5. This issue is occurring with a single specific email at this time. Html, rich and plain text emails are not having the problem. the problem does not occur with other emails. Other emails are forwarded with out issue.</p>
<p>I deleted my email address out of his cache by using the drop down on the to: field, then manually keyed in my address afterwards. I'm able to send html formatted email, the problem is this is a specific email.</p>
<p>This is coming off the end of a very very rough o365 migration from office 2007 with an internal exchange server.

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>Thanks for the detailed information. Since the issue is bit strange therefore, I would like to confirm the following information to determine whether it is a specific email or client side issue.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Which <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/What-version-of-Outlook-do-I-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c#bkmk_32" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook 2016 client </a>version are user using? Please provide us with detailed about this (<em>e.g. Outlook 2016 MSO (16.0.6001.xxxx) 32-bit</em>).<br />
•&nbsp;Where did you install Outlook 2016 client from the Office 365 portal on the <em>
<strong>Software page</strong> </em>or else?<br />
•&nbsp;How did user set up the Office 365 account on the Outlook 2016 client, via <strong>
<em>Exchange/Pop </em></strong>or<strong> <em>IMAP</em></strong>?<br />
•&nbsp;Please check this issue via starting <em><strong>Outlook in safe mode</strong></em>, which starts Outlook without add-ins loaded to check whether an add-in is the problem. For your reference see under
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/I-can-t-start-Microsoft-Outlook-2016-2013-or-2010-or-receive-the-error-Cannot-start-Microsoft-Office-Outlook-Cannot-open-the-Outlook-Window-d1f69da6-b333-4650-97bf-4d77bd7abb85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Start Outlook in safe mode and disable add-ins</a><br />
•&nbsp;Have you tried to check this issue via manually force to download the latest offline address book on the Outlook client to see whether the problem still occurs?</p>

<p>We tried launching this under safe mode and the issue still occurs when forwarding one specific email that is HTML format. I tried having the user test this as rich text and the same issue occurs, the event log doesn't indicate anything other then event
 id 1002 "outlook has stopped interacting with windows and was closed."</p>
<p>This issue occurs with 16.0.6001.1078 and also 16.0.6729.1012 after completely removing and reinstalling outlook.
</p>
<p>I tried manually forcing a download of the address book to no resolution. </p>
<p>the email is only 170Kb i have larger emails with a longer chain than this one and they go out from the user with out issue.

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>Thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>Since the issue is kind of odd, I’d like to collect some more information for investigation:</p>
<p>1. I noticed that the issue occurs when the user forward the specific email, as a result, if the end user select the email and click
<strong>Reply</strong>, then modify the <strong>To</strong> filed to add the Office 365 email addresses and send the email, does the issue persist? Also, if the user create a new email and then copy/paste the content of the affected email, does the issue occur?<br />
2. If you turn off your computer firewall temporarily and test it again, is there any improvement?<br />
3. Since the issue only occurs to the one specific email, may I know if you have any specific requirement to forward the email, such as forward it every period of time?</p>
<p>Any update will be appreciated.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Aaron</p>

<p>1. Yes, the issue still occurs if we remove all addresses and just add another office 365 user such as my self which wasn't a part of the original chain. If i use a gmail address the email fires
</p>
<p>2. Firewall is disabled and the pc has been restarted multiple times</p>

<h2>            Mising items when synchronizing windows mobile 6 device with outlook exchange server</h2>
                    
<p>Hi There,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to synchronize my outlook mobile 6 device (HTC Kaiser) with our companies outlook exchange server. This is working fine for emails however I do have "randomly" missing calendar entries. I am mentioning randomly missing as I have
 not yet identified the difference between missing items and not missing items, I can however give the following details:</p>
<p>- Some missing items do not have attachements</p>
<p>- Some missing items are onetime events and not reoccuring</p>
<p>- All missing items are not more than three weeks in the future and I am syncing six month in the future</p>
<p>- The missing items contain both, entries created directly in my outlook on my pc and also meeting requests I have respondet to. For both types other events are synchronizing fine</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know how I can get more information on the s&lt;nchroniziation log as this might provide the reason why the items are missing.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p><br />
Chris</p>

            Same for me ... the only logic I find is that I see the problem for all contacts and calendar items where there is something in the "notes" field. All others seem to synchronize fine. I'm using Activesync 4.5, Outlook 2003 and running on an HTC TytnII
 (Kaiser).

<p>Well, I finally found the cause of my calendar items not syncing to my phone. It turns out that all calendar entries created through OWA do not get synced. If I take on of the non-syncing items, open them in Outlook,
 change a character and save the appointment, it wil show up on my phone's calendar within minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is also why&nbsp;you can have all sorts of entries not syncing. I used OWA to accept meeting requests, but also to create appointments myself. From now on, I'll only use either my phone or Outlook to update my calendar - should get rid of my
 problems.</p>

<p>I have a similar issue but it isn't addressed by the OWA fix, as I never use OWA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my case I more often have appointments on my phone (HTC Hermes) that have gone missing from outlook.&nbsp; It is particularly (and possibly exclusively) when they are meeting requests that have been modified after they were originally sent (and
 accepted) and when they have reoccurance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was using Windows Mobile 5 on the same device with the same crazy calendar (and exchange account)&nbsp;and never had this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way I can export the version of my calendar that exists on my device, so that I can import it directly to the exchange server (via my Outlook client)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another strange side effect of my upgrade to WM6 is that appointments that were dismissed hours ago pop-up again, showing overdue times in the 16 hour, 24 hour or even 5 days range!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I the only one who is experiencing this?</p>

            Nope - you're not alone.&nbsp; This still happens to me with no pattern identified as of yet.&nbsp; I've taken to tagging appts that I create via OWA so I can go back in Outlook and touch them.&nbsp; That seems to work ok, but is time consuming.&nbsp; Anyone have other ideas
 for how best to troubleshoot?<br />

<p>I have fixed this calader bug(not)!!!! I have terminal server at the office that has Outlook 2003. Now I have 2 Outlook open, desktop has Outlook 2007 and my terminal server has Outlook 2003. Outlook 2003 fixes the bug in Office 2007 and my calander syncs.
 This is not a fix but tmp for me because i´m getting Exchange 2007&nbsp;next&nbsp;year,&nbsp;when Server 2008&nbsp;comes out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This fix did work for Windows Mobile 6 HTC TyTN II and Nokia N95 8GB.</p>

It works for me, I'm using Mcafee GroupShield on exchange 2003. Activate background scanning and proactive scanning resolve the problem.<br />

    <title>chart date x axis - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rene29  say:</h3>
<h2>            chart date x axis</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Dates A2:A92<br />
<br />
Currently the x axis is plotted as 0 Jan 00 through 15 Mar 23.&nbsp; <br />
Chart axis options is set to auto.&nbsp; Number is date 14-Mar&nbsp;&nbsp; [$-409]d-mmm;@<br />
<br />
To have it auto select the dates based on A:A&nbsp; would work best because the workbook is a template for past and future years.&nbsp; I don't want to mess with determining that 3000 means 18 Mar 08 in excel speak.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            Looking at it again the data is plotting correctly.&nbsp; The dates are messed up when the auto option&nbsp; is checked in the format axis window.&nbsp; If I change the min and max axis to 40543 and 40676 it works.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Rahul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I just like to ask several questions to isolate the issue that you're having right now on your device. When did you encounter this issue? Is it after the latest test builds? Or even before the latest test builds? Have you performed any workaround to resolve
 this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I suggest that you try to perform a <strong>clean boot</strong> on your device.&nbsp;<span>A
<strong>clean boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This method will help you isolate the issue and see if a third party related software, or any background running triggers that issue. You can check
 and review an article about the process for the <strong>clean boot</strong> from our support site on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Please make sure to follow the steps for Windows 10 since the article tackles other Windows version.</span></p>

<h2>            No back Up</h2>
                    
<p>I made the mistake of buying a Nokia N76 (When new Very good looking phone) After owning a few Sharp phones.</p>
<p>Very impressed with Sharp, compared with the Nokia N76. Even the Motorola V at a third of the priceis a better option.</p>
<p>I am one of those many N76 owners that have watched the chrome peel off the case, in very short time. IE less than 2months use. No I do not have any warranty as this phone has no back in NZ , because it was never sold here.</p>
<p>I have contacted Nokia (now over 9 calls over seas.) to just try to buy a new case????????????????</p>
<p>Absolutly lousy service. I have contacted Malasia Aussy Germany USA. just trying to buy a new case for my phone.</p>
<p>I have got No-where. And they talk about customer care! They do not give a Rat's **bleep**. How can a phone that cost me over $600nz be a throw away item? But it is as far as they are concerned. No Parts???????</p>
<p>How can they sell a phone and have no parts available, this phone is still sold in the USA.</p>
<p>I will not be owning another Nokia after this experience.</p>

<p>Hello, clawnz,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree, Nokia Care SUCKS. They've got the worst customer service ever, and as you said, they don't give a rat's **bleep** about their customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once I had a similar problem with my N81.&nbsp;My phone fell and the gaming buttons and the d-pad were broken.&nbsp;Took the phone to&nbsp;my local Nokia service center in Mexico and they treated me like a criminal (even though I made it clear I was&nbsp;GOING TO PAY for the
 repairs). They&nbsp;told me I would need to leave my phone for several weeks while they ordered de part, and wanted to charge me 75 dollars for the job, so I decided to&nbsp;change the housing myself. I imagine Nokia does not like people giving this kind of advice,
 but their lousy "customer service" forced me to do it, since I was not willing to be a month without my phone and pay so much money for some stupid repair.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased a non OEM housing which&nbsp;was solid and actually better&nbsp;than the original. I just paid 15 dollars for it. The housing included 2 disassembly tools which were very helpful. Anyway I did not have warranty either because I had dropped my phone, and
 the warranty doesn't cover that.&nbsp; Afterwards, I downloaded a disassembly video, and decided to go for it. At first, it seems like a daunting task, but&nbsp;it's not that difficult, provided you do understand what you need to do before actually disassembling the
 phone.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just Google your phone model and the words "buy housing" and you will find lots of places that sell OEM and non original housings (the difference in price is about 40-50 dlls).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I won't post any links because maybe the mods will ban me or something..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plenty of resources for people in your situation, so give it a go, mate!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this info helps.</p>

<p>Thank you for that Caloseap. Thanks to you I have found a couple of sites for new housing.</p>
<p>I see mods are complaining about so called bad language. Why should we not be annoyed with such rubbish being pushed by Nokia! One does note that we are not talking about the cheaper phones here.</p>
<p>The only way to make Nokia sit up and take notice, is if sales drop, so make your stand and do not buy Nokia.</p>
<p>I have been trying to get some sense out of Nokia for the past month. As I have said before I have talked to Malasia USA Australia and Germany, which is where one of my phones came from.All at my own cost. Nokia have just opened up a Nokia Careshop here
 in Auckland. And I am waiting for them to contact me, Fat Chance of that, but they said someone would.</p>
<p>And yesterday I got a reply to one of my latest complaints, stating that as the phone never sold in NZ there is no back up in NZ for this phone.( I bloody well know that). And then asking me for the OEM no so they could see where the phone came from and
 it could then be returned there to fix the housing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How many times must I go around in circles saying the same thing?</p>
<p>Nokia are Bloody usless.</p>
<p>You can find my complaints on many other forums as I intend to rattle the ship, untill they get it right.</p>
<p>They have just got to BIG to care.</p>

<p>Hello, clawnz,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am glad it could help.</p>
<p>Yes, I saw how the mods got upset. Sorry but there is no other way to describe how the Nokia Care centers treat their loyal customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also don't understand why they can't provide parts for their (lately) lousy phones. After inheriting my fixed N81 to my wife I decided to buy an N85. Big mistake..&nbsp; I am now facing the same problem, as the dpad around the naviwheel developed a crack. This
 phone has been treated with uttermost care, and it broke from normal wear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't send it for repairs because it was made in China..&nbsp;&nbsp; They won't honour the warranty of a China made phone here in Mexico. That's a very stupid policy. It means you can't buy a phone they sell in other countries, and if you do, you have zero warranty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again, I will need to buy the part and install it myself. I won't bother going to the Nokia service point because if I tell them my phone was bought in China they will probably&nbsp;sue me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps I should open a Nokia repair shop, from all the experience I will get disassembling phones&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know for a fact Nokia itself doesn't even bother reading these forums and the only reason for their existance is so that users can help each other and fill the hole their lack of customer service creates. I must admit that's a very smart money saving strategy,
 and it works. In the end the users know more and are more resourceful than their ignorant and rude technicians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck fixing your&nbsp;phone, clawnz!!</p>

<p>as far as i understand it...it doesnt matter WHERE the phone was made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what matters is which country the phone was meant to be distributed in. if the phone u bought was meant for the china markets while u actually reside in mexico, then there will be a possibility the nokia service centres will decline to repair the phone under
 warranty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>however if the phone was meant to be distributed in mexico, ie: u purchased it from a legitimate dealer or ur network provider, then i see no reason y they should refuse to repair ur phone unless they find evidence that the warranty has been voided for whatever
 reason</p>

            <p>Hi patrickrivard,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in this forum. I'd be more than happy to assist you regarding your inquiry on how to add another account in the newly updated Outlook.com app.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can add an Office 365 account and also that is a Hotmail account, and to add an account just follow the steps below. Here's how you can add multiple accounts:</p>
<ol>
<li>From your Inbox, swipe the screen to the right, or tap on the small arrow in the upper-left-hand corner.</li><li>Tap on the up arrow next to your account nickname to bring up your list of accounts and the "Add account" option.</li><li>Tap on the "Add account" option and follow the steps to add your new account.</li><li>(Optional) To delete an account from the Outlook.com app, go to Settings while you're in the account you want to delete, then under Manage account, select Remove.</li></ol>
<p>If you have other questions, please feel free to ask and we are more excited to answer them for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            My sincere apologies. Merging of 2 Skype accounts is not possible. 
<br />
<br />However, if you want to continue with only one account, you can transfer Skype Credits and Contacts to your other account so that credits are not wasted and contacts are not lost.
<br />
<br />Transfer Skype Credits through Gifting

<br />
<br />Optionally, if you want to close an account after the required transfer but if this is attached to a Microsoft account, then Microsoft account will also get closed which has its own ramifications.

    <title>Pivot Table&#58; Is there an alternative to using slicers, or can I - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> porter444  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pivot Table&#58;  Is there an alternative to using slicers, or can I hide slicer on print&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a report I am working on that will be printed, and used in supplier reviews.&nbsp; Management doesn't want to show all the suppliers listed at the top of the report, only the one specific supplier's information displayed on the report after selection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see two possibilities, both I cannot figure out, hoping you might provide some information or another option:</p>
<ol>
<li>Alternative to Slicers - I'd like to use Data Validation, or Pivot Table Report Filter to choose the supplier.&nbsp; The issue with Report Filter is that I cannot move or format the field.&nbsp; Being in a fixed location, and no flexibility make it a not so great
 option for now.<br />
</li><li>Hide Slicer on Print - If I could hide the slicer when the report is printed I think I would be fine.&nbsp; I could put a cell behind the slicer with the selection formatted the way I want.&nbsp; That way I have the interactive capability on screen and the management
 requirement met on print.</li></ol>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>
</p><p>A third alternative could be that the slicers can be placed on another worksheet and whatever selections will be made in the slicers, only those will appear on the Pivot Table.</p>

            If the document is not read-only and not protected in some other way, it could be that you have an Office subscription that has expired. That would be true only if you have Office 2016 through Office 365, not if you have a perpetual license for Office

<h2>            Can&#39;t see myself while video skyping&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I haven't used Skype in a month and now when I log on from my Win10 desktop with my Logitech camera, I can video chat and be heard and seen by others, but do not have the small inset window where I view myself while I chat. &nbsp; I don't know what happened
 or what I did to delete that and I can't seem to find any tool button to anywhere on Skype to make that reappear. &nbsp;&nbsp; I also seem to have TWO Skype icons on my list of programs and am wondering if that is part of the problem. &nbsp;HELP!

    <title>Unable to establish a Synchronization Relationship - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ldleiter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to establish a Synchronization Relationship </h2>
                    Problem:&nbsp; Unable to establish a Synchronization Relationship between my new handheld and my work PC.<br />
Setup:<br />
The Handheld is a HP iPAQ 111 Classic running Windows Mobile 6.1.<br />
The Dell PC runs Windows XP Professional on a business LAN, with Outlook 2003.<br />
I have downloaded ActiveSync 4.5 from the Microsoft website (the CD that came with the iPAQ was scratched), and installed it.<br />
I am connecting the handheld to the PC using the USB-2 to mini-USB cable provided with the handheld.<br />
Expectation:<br />
The various documents and help files tell me that when I connect the handheld to the PC for the first time, ActiveSync will open a Synchronization Setup wizard that will allow me to specify what Outlook modules to synchronize with the respective handheld modules.&nbsp;
 Cancelling the wizard will cause me to connect in a Guest mode that allows communication but not synchronization.<br />
Reality:<br />
Each time when I connect the handheld to the PC, ActiveSync "thinks" for 20-30 seconds and initiates a Guest connection.&nbsp; I am able to explore the handheld from the PC and transfer Office files via the Guest connection as advertised, but cannot establish the
 Synchronization Relationship.&nbsp; All menu items related to Synchronization are grayed out on both machines.<br />
Troubleshooting so far:<br />
I have restarted both machines.&nbsp; I have removed and reinstalled ActiveSync on the PC, using both the ActiveSync installation program and the Windows Add/Remove Programs function.&nbsp; I have toggled Advanced Network Functionality on the handheld.&nbsp; None of these
 steps has materially affected the results.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on what else to try will be greatly appreciated.

<p><br />
Sorry about the slow response; I am obliged to work on my tools during my spare time, of which there has been little.<br />
<br />
IT says the firewalls are mainly at the portals and not on the individual PCs.&nbsp; I also question the firewall hypothesis in that the PC talks to the Device in the Guest mode.<br />
<br />
ActiveSync is new.&nbsp; My previous handheld was a Palm IIIxe (2001 vintage) synchronizing via Palm Desktop and Chapura PocketMirror.&nbsp; In the spirit of your question I tried removing PocketMirror and reloading ActiveSync, but to no avail.<br />
<br />
In ActiveSync, the Toolbar shows Sync and Schedule grayed, and Explore active.&nbsp; File Synchronize, Mobile Device, and Delete Mobile Device are grayed, only Connection Settings is active.&nbsp; Tools Options, Schedule, Security, and Add Server Source are grayed.&nbsp;
 Tools Add/Remove Programs, Explore Device, and Advanced Tools are active, but the only Advanced Tool that is active is Edit File Conversion Settings.</p>
<p>On the iPAQ, Start ActiveSync toolbar has Sync grayed.&nbsp; Menu is active, but none of the Menu options are active.<br />
<br />
Outlook on the PC synchronizes with an exchange server.&nbsp; My Palm had no such capability.&nbsp; I have not attempted to get the iPAQ to synchronize with the exchange server.&nbsp; Wireless networking is not implemented in my location.<br />
<br />
If you have more ideas, I'm still trying as I get opportunity.&nbsp; Thanks,<br />
Larry</p>

                    <p>I am running Micorsoft Security Essentials. &nbsp;I use Windows 7 and usually use Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Periodically MSE pops up and tells me that it is not running and that I should turn it on. &nbsp;Then before I can do anything it shuts my entire computer down and reboots. &nbsp;This is very annoying. &nbsp;I have no idea why it is doing this as I am not turning it off.
 &nbsp;Any ideas?</p>

            <p>HI - Thank you for the through reply. &nbsp;A lot of that may be beyond my abilities but I did run Malware bytes. &nbsp;I had that on my computer but it also seemed to have stopped. &nbsp;It is now running and I keep getting 3 Malicious website (outgoing) that it blocks.
 &nbsp;they are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>carenntolem8.biz&nbsp;</p>
<p>system-security-error.technical-support.info</p>
<p>searchnet.blinkxcore.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these are located in C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe and are "outbound"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some further research on the blinkxcore and after looking in all the various places people suggested I could not find it, yet the message persists (along with the others)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I used to run Norman (not to be confused with Norton) which is a service you pay a yearly fee for. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was having serious problems with my computer locking up and crashing a lot, esp. if I used Excel or Word so I took my computer to a friend, as she is studying this stuff. &nbsp;She removed Norman, installed MSE, found over 100 updates that hadn't been uploaded
 (for some reason), installed Chrome so I can use that instead of IE. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since that time my computer has run better. &nbsp;Now it is starting to act up again and the problem seems to be connected to MSE but with the reports from Malware bites, I am not so sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did check MSCONFIG - the list is long, I did some look ups of what was there to figure out what they do and I think most are needed. &nbsp;Some on the list of "start up" were disabled and the date coincides with when my friend worked on it, so I believe she
 went through this. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 folder pane line spacing and todo bar will not shrink - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kentleach  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 folder pane line spacing and todo bar will not shrink</h2>
                    <p>The problem is that the mouse mode line spacing in outlook 2016 is MUCH worse than previous versions.&nbsp; This is a VERY common issue from what I can see online.&nbsp; I have been using outlook since it existed and 2016 has major spacing issues which translates
 to less productivity since we can't get all of the same info on the screen as we could in previous versions.&nbsp; By default install and on "mouse mode" the spacing between the rows is 19-20 pixels !!&nbsp; that is a HUGE waste of space.</p>
<p>I have 6 monitors all of which run 1280x1024 so each screen has an "older" resolution so optimum use of space is more important to me and everyone I know, over "smart" features and pretty layouts.&nbsp; Outlook is about working efficiently not looking pretty
 and 2016 is missing the mark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The request is simple.&nbsp; Do not take away from the features / function with a new version, EVER!</p>
<p>Request #1</p>
<p>Please add the ability to define the line spacing on the folder pane in mouse mode!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A second issues is it seems Outlook was not tested very well for common desktop screen resolutions.&nbsp; I cannot seem to get want I had before.. which was the folder pane, reading pane and todo bar all on the screen at the same time.&nbsp; the reading pane switches
 to "normal" and it will not let me shrink the todo bar to the same size I had on 2013 and same for the folder pane, if I shrink past a point then it switches to minimized.&nbsp; UNLIKE prior versions.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So once again productivity is impacted since I can only see a little over 1/2 my folder and only 5 emails at a time since I can't use reading pane... there is much wasted space on the right and left of the todo bar which I can't shrink as well as the folder
 pane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Request #2&nbsp; &amp; #3</p>
<p>#2 Allow me to shrink the todo bar and the folder pane as much as I need to, do not auto minimize.</p>
<p>#3 Allow me to FORCE the reading pane and adjust column sizes.&nbsp; Have a checkbox in options to turn off the ability to automatically switch to "normal" if it does not fit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>OR tell me about some registry entry that can help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOT happy about "upgrade" </p>
<p>
</p><p>-Ken </p>

<p>Put a name for the dropdown in its Title (in the content control's Properties dialog).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Put the following macro in the ThisDocument module of the template and modify it according to the comments. Note that the text in quotes in the "If CC.Title" statement must match what you put in the Title property with the same capitalization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user's choice will be copied to the table when the cursor exits from the content control, either by mouse or by keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the place in the table where the text must appear isn't the entire content of the cell -- for example, if it's part of a sentence -- then you'll have to put a named bookmark in each of the three locations and change the macro to set the correct bookmark's
 .Range.Text to the CC.Range.Text.</p>
