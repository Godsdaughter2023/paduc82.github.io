<h2>            Outlook settings need setting after windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Since the Windows 10 upgrade, my Outlook settings are never set.</p>
<p>It is always back to the default settings every time the Outlook is opened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is past the 30 days to un-install the Windows 10 upgrade.</p>
<p>What can be done to fix this glitch after the update?</p>

<h3> avizu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem using serial port with windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a SIM card based modem (used to remotely update an electronic gate controller) that connects to my computer via the serieal port (COM1).</p>
<p>The modem comes with it's own piece of software which worked fine on my previous computer with windows 7 (I had a similar problem, but then I just needed to update the driver).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now a new computer and I am unable to connect using this modem (it seems that I am using latest drivers for the serial port).</p>
<p>Is it possible I need an older version? if so , how can I get one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My motherboard is a GIGABYTE H81M-D2V.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The UART, or Universal Asynchronous Receiver / Transmitter, is a feature of your&nbsp;microcontroller useful for communicating serial data (text, numbers, etc.) to your PC. The device changes incoming parallel information (within the microcontroller/PC) to serial
<p>
</p><p>As per the description which you have provided it seems that your modem is not getting connected with your Windows 7 computer, so I would suggest you to contact

<p>Hi ehill1014, <br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forums.</p>
<p>It is not possible to use Windows Media Player to rip movie files from a CD to your computer's hard disk. However, if you can see the movie file on the CD in Windows Explorer, then you probably can copy and paste that file to your computer's hard disk instead.<br />
It is also not possible to rip a movie file from a DVD using the Player. You need to use a program designed to legally copy movie files from a DVD to a computer.</p>

            only allowed me to get my AOL inbox emails.<br />
On my other computer with Windows 7, Windows Live installed, I did not have to setup a Hotmail account. The account setup was my AOL account. All the folders from AOL were installed.<br />
My question needs to be revised: "How do you install your AOL account with all its folders in Windows Live Mail using Windows XP?

<p>That support page suggests the idea of clearing your system cache or re-downloading your profile.</p>
<p>As for "hacking", if you believe your account to be at risk, it may be a good idea to change your security settings/passwords.</p>

<h3> anjilslaire  say:</h3>
<h2>            WatchDisneyJunior app refuses to activate</h2>
                    
<p>I've downloaded the WatchDisneyJunior app on my 360. I ran through the Sign In with your TV provider wizard in th app, entered my TV provider and activation code at
<a href="http://watchdisneyjunior.com/activate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://watchdisneyjunior.com/activate</a>.</p>
<p>Then I get redirected to sign in with my TV provider, which works fine. Then I get a successful activation message on
<a href="http://watchdisneyjunior.go.com/activate?device=xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://watchdisneyjunior.go.com/activate?device=xbox</a>.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p><br />
Back on my Xbox 360, it's still sitting at the Activate screen with the code and the activation never completes on the console.</p>
<p>I've tried getting a new code, clearing the app cache, deleting &amp; reinstalling the app, rerunning the activation process repeatedly, nothing works.</p>
<p>Also, I have 2 xbox 360 consoles and this is the same behavior on both consoles. The regular Disney Channel app activates just fine.</p>

<p>Any ideas? I have a valid Gold subscription &amp; participating TV provider.</p>

            <p>Hey, anjilslaire! Sorry to see the activation issues! It sounds like it's likely an issue with the app itself.</p>
<p>The service itself looks like it only <a href="http://watchdisneyjunior.go.com/help#c=7&amp;t=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">requires you</a> to be located in the US and have a participating provider with the channel on your service. As long as you meet those, then I suggest submitting feedback through the <a href="http://watchdisneyjunior.go.com/feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Watch Disney Junior Feedback page</a>.</p>
<p>I also noticed that you're in the Xbox 360 preview. I've sent you a private message with out to submit feedback to the appropriate teams in addition to reaching out to Disney. You can check those here. :) Thanks for understanding!</p>

<div><span>Back in the days of DOS, the PrtScn key used to print the screen. But in all versions of Windows, this works differently, and the name of the key is now an anachronism. The key does *not* print the screen. PrtScrn captures
 the whole screen, and Alt-PrtScrn captures the active window.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>Either one captures the image to the Windows clipboard. Once it's in the clipboard you can paste (Ctrl-V) it into any application that supports graphics (Windows Paint, other graphics programs, even your favorite word processor).
 You can edit or add to the image as you wish, then print it.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>This ability to manipulate the image in a program before printing it is an improvement over the original DOS method of just printing it. But if you'd like that old facility back, there are several third-party freeware/shareware
 programs that can do this, such as PrintKey2000 at http://www.sharewarejunkies.com/00zwd2/printkey2000.htm</span></div>

    <title>Xbox Customer Service Experience Sharing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Customer Service Experience Sharing</h2>
                    
<p>I chatted with Xbox support today and wanted to share my experience. &nbsp;Below is the transcript of the chat. &nbsp;The guy (Josh G.) took almost 2 hours of my time, was gone at times for up to 10 minutes between subsequent chats and repeated himself (likely cut
 and paste with minor edits) on how he was trying to help me and how he was trying to figure out the code for me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end when i told him this is going on too long, he told me to contact the retailer. &nbsp;Essentially the issue was that i had purchased a gold membership live card and the security foil on it was so tightly glueed that it took the paper behind it with
 it when taking it out due to which the code is not readable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the transcript. &nbsp;Remember there were up to 10 minutes gap at times from his response which followed by patronizing comments on how he was trying to help me.</p>
<p>I am hoping that someone higher up in the Xbox customer service support will read this and try to figure out how they can streamline the service for their customers and what their agents do for 10 minutes or so at times between chat responses. &nbsp;Thanks</p>

You are now chatting with 'Josh G.'</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Hello, thank you for contacting Xbox Customer Support. My name is Josh G.. How can I help you today?<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Hi Josh</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;We purchased x-box live gold prepaid card thru Groupon</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;By the way, I hope you don't mind if I ask for your name so that I can address you properly?<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Sure.xxxxx</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;xxxxx is fine</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;After taking the security strip off the card, the 25 character code is not readable</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;The security strip took off the code&nbsp;</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Also all instructions on it were in spanish</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Groupon told me to contact Xbox directly</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Hi Irfan , how are you doing today? &nbsp;I hope you are doing great despite the issue that you are experiencing today.<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;I am doing ok</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Will do better once my son can start using the gold membership</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;I can see here that you’re having issues with the gold code that you get because you can't read it now, is that correct?<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Yes the 25 character code is not readable after taking the security strip off</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;you are right</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;I’m very sorry to hear that you’re having issues with that now Irfan, not a problem, I’m already here to help you out with your concern and let me provide you with the best options that we could do for your concern
 today, alright?<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;ok</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;May I please have your gamertag and account email so I can pull up your account here? and also your good contact number so I can process a callback incase we got disconnected with our chat session Thanks!<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;call back is &nbsp;Let me get the gamertag from my son in a minute</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Sure, Irfan thanks :)<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;xxxxxx</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>xxxxxxxx</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Thank you so much for providing those information here, Irfan.<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;No problem</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;I sent a code to the phone number that is linked to the account can you please check that for me?<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;I got two of them on my email</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;The last one is</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;the one that came up a few seconds before that was&nbsp;</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Thank you for providing me the verification code that you’ve seen on your screen to let us see the details on your account. Please bear with me for 2-3 minutes to review your account here on our end. Would that be alright?<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;sure</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Thank you so much, Ifran.<br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Hi, Ifran thank you so much for patiently waiting.<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;no problem</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;I have successfully pulled up the account here and here's what we are going to do now.<br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;We will check the code here for you, can you please send me a photo of the code please?<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;sure</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Alright thanks, :)<br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;I have sent an email where you can reply with me there and attach the photo alright?<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;I just emailed</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;The code cannot be read after taking out the security strip. I could figure out the first 10 digits which I wrote down, but the rest could not be read</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Also instructions were in spanish so could not follow</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;I understand that, Ifran we will check that here for you alright?<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;ok</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Thank you so much please bear with me as I pull up the picture alright?<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;ok</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;I am checking that in here, however seems that it is very small is that a paper?<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;The paper on top that you see has been peeled off by the security strip that was hiding the code. Let me email you the back of the card. It is the typical X-box live pre-paid card</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Alright thank you so much, Ifran I can't clearly see those digits, Ifran.<br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Please send a new one thanks.<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;What digits are you looking for</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;the 25 digit code?</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;The Code, Ifran.<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;That is the issue</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Yes.<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;and the reason for the contact</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;the 25 digit code has been stripped off when taking off the security strip that covers it</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;If i could see it, I would not be contacting</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;When the security strip was taken off that covered it, it took off most of hte paper that was underneath it that had the code</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;So it is not readable anymore</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Yes, I understand that, however seems like we can't fully check it as it is fully removed in the paper, Ifran.<br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;I understand that, Ifran we can actually check the code by guessing here in our tools to check if it is the correct code combinations, however seems that we can't read the 15 digits remaining, I just thought that there
 are some parts that it is only blurd, Ifran.<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;I can take a picture of the backside of the security strip and email too if it can help. It shows some traces of numbers too</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;But is very hard to read if not impossible</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Yes, no problem with that, Ifran I know how hard you really want to get the correct code that is why I am here to help you ifran &nbsp;I don't have any goal here but to help you with your concern, I hope you understand how
 I am also very willing to help you as much as I can.<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Yes, I know that. Thanks. I appreciate it</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Thank you so much for understanding, Ifran.<br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Can you please send me another photo of it please?<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Sure. The inside of the card, where the security strip was and code is shown</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Yes, have you sent already?<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Just sent</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;two pictures. One is a redo of the previous one. Other is the backside of the security strip</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Alright let me check those for you.<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;sure</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Please give me another moment, Ifran thanks.<br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;The photo that you send here now is now downloading please bear with me.<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;sure</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;hi, Ifran still there?<br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;yes I am still here</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Just pulled up the picture here.<br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Please give me more time, Ifran.<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Well if you can get us online with the gold membership then that would be good</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Ok...</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Were you able to pull the pictures. Thanks</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Yes, I am now trying my best to guess, the codes, Ifran.<br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Just to set proper expectation to you, Ifran that I will try to do my very best to help you find the right combination of the code, however if we can't find it, I hope you understand that we will try to find another
 best option for you alright?<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Ok. I have to get going on something in the next 15 minutes. If we could resolve it by then that would be great. Thanks&nbsp;</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Yes thank you so much for your cooperation, Ifran.<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;How is it going? Any progress</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Still trying to guess the right combination, Ifran.<br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;My tools shows error.<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;May be we need to go to Plan B then</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;This pre-paid card has been bought and money paid for. How can we get a replacement code</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Oh! for the code replacement it is actually from the retailer however, we'll still try to do our very best to see if we can get the right code here.<br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;I am trying my best to find it, Ifran.<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Hi Josh. It has now been 90 minutes since we started this chat. Kindly let me know what is the next step for us to get going.&nbsp;</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;There has to be limit to the same thing again</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;And please don't reply that you are doing your best every time. There are 10 minute gaps between your responses</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;If you cannot help can i get the second tier support please&nbsp;</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>info:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Your chat transcript will be sent to <strong>
[Mod Removed]</strong> at the end of your chat.</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Yes, Ifran I perfectly understand where you are coming from, I hope you understand that I am checking the code here in my end that is why it took some time for me to response as I am also trying to guess the right code,
 Ifran.<br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Sorry about that, &nbsp;Ifran.<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Josh it has been 90 minutes with the similar chat responses (likely cut and paste with minor modifications) from you</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Covering two things I am trying to read the code and I am trying to do my best</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;This is too much....</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Can i get level 2 support please</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;I perfectly understand where you are coming from, Ifran I know that you have lost your patience in waiting, I hope you understand that we are trying to decipher the code here that's why it take so much of your time,
 and if we could only replace this code for you I would really love to do, however you have purchased this to the retailer. We can actually ask for a replacement with this to your retailer, Ifran.<br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;I suggest to please do contact your retailer and ask for a replacement for this code, don't worry I we have already documented this case here and checked the code, however we can't seem to found the right combination
 that is why we suggest you to contact your retailer and ask for a replacement.<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;I contacted them first and they directed me to contact Xbox customer service</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Can i get a tier 2 support please</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Don't worry we have documented this case here for you and I will provide you a reference number of this chat session so they can acknowledge your concern, Ifran. All you have to do is to provide the reference number
 to the retailer so they can replace the code for you.<br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Oh! yes that's why they refer you to contact us that is to try if we can decipher the code, and since we can't get to find the right code, we will provide you a reference number as a proof that you have contacted us
 regarding the issue and so that you have a proof that we requested for them to request your code, I hope you understand, Ifran.<br />
</span><b><span>you:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Can i get both the reference number and xbox tier 2 support contact information. Please</span><span><br />
</span><b><span>Josh G.:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Yes, Ifran no problem with that, Ifran. Here is the reference number of our chat session case, Ifran

<p>Yeah I don't even bother with support anymore, just fellow Xbox players as support only tells me things I have already tried and read their same old script every time. As far as buying it off of Groupon not such a good idea. If you were going for cheap best
 to go off Ebay or Amazon, there is another site I can't remember the name for but occasionally the have a 12 month card for sale for $30.</p>

<p>Hello PompousDragon6, </p>
<p>Please take into consideration that the Support agent which you contacted was doing his best to "guess" the code, even when this is not Xbox Support's issue. Seeing as you bought an Xbox LIVE membership from a third-party retailer (i.e. Groupon) the rights
 to Support regarding the product then shift to Groupon, not Microsoft. Have you tried contacting Groupon regarding your purchase from them?</p>

<p>He could have told me that right up front without wasting 2 hours of time 'guessing' the code. &nbsp;How long does it take to guess the code when i sent them the picture knowing that it cannot be deciphered. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there any metrics used by Xbox Support management to gauge the efficiency of their support people and the time that they waste of their customer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Being condescending and replying after 10 minutes gap with the excuse of deciphering the code is neither customer service nor trying your best. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello PompousDragon6,</p>
<p>I Agreed with Blitz you did purchase the product from a third party, That should not supports problem at that point he was trying to do his best to "guess" the code to help you out instead of saying I could not help you today because you did not purchase
 this card from us. &nbsp;He was kind enough to attempted to help "Being condescending and replying after 10 minutes gap with the excuse of deciphering the code is neither customer service nor trying your best." Your comment there.... You have to understand there
 are about 100-200 who knows maybe more People requesting chats at one time and there staff is limited, &nbsp;Not only are they doing chats but answering phones as well. Look at the bigger picture because if he would have said "oh I cant help you" up front more
 that likely you would have still posted a something about this issue.</p>

<p>There's nothing we are able to assist with here. If you have a damaged code, your best option is to go back to the retailer to get a replacement. If you need assistance with any other support issue, please post up a new detailed thread so that our community can help you out.</p>

<p><strong>I read the system requirements for Windows 10. </strong></p>
<p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>4GB of RAM is plenty for a standard computer that doesn't do highly demanding tasks (IE 10+ web pages open, Photoshop, video editing, etc). Your computer MIGHT be able to handle 8, but it would be highly dependent upon the model and type of RAM it has. Since
 you only have a LGA775 Pentium D, I'm thinking you either have DDR or DDR2. If you have DDR, no upgrade is possible, 4GB is it. With DDR2, you MIGHT be able to hit 8GB (again, depending on the mode) but 8GB of DDR2 can be pricy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BIOS is an update you would get off the manufacture support website (Drivers&nbsp;&amp; Downloads | Dell US, HP Customer Support&nbsp; - Software and Driver Downloads, etc), under the page for your specific model, which the website would ask you for when you visited
 the page. Updating your BIOS is something you should be very careful doing, and make sure you are using the newest one (most support pages list when the update was uploaded to the site, so you can easily tell which one is the newest), and make sure you're
 looking at the updates for your model. Some model numbers are only 1 or 2 numbers different from each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>90% of desktops do have a little button cell battery on the motherboard, which ensures the internal clock for the BIOS keeps going, even when unplugged. If that battery were in need of replacing, the computer would let you know in some form or another, either
 by telling you the battery is dying, or by constantly asking you to reset the clock. Replacing the battery is easy, and can be done any time. Those batteries are also expensive as far as batteries go (~$8). If you want to do it anyways, the battery number
 is CR2032, and you can get them almost anywhere you can get batteries. Once you get the door open, the battery will be quite easy to spot, so, again, replacing it is very easy, you can do it anytime. If you're not constantly getting messages saying your battery
 is dead, or to reset the clock, I wouldn't bother with it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And lastly, upgrading your CPU. On the support website for your specific model of desktop, along with updates for your drivers and BIOS, somewhere else on that page should be a CPU Support list. It's different for every manufacture, but most manufactures
 do publish the list. The CPU Support list will tell you every CPU your computer can run. Once you find newest, most powerful CPU you can run (at least a Pentium D 900 series, 945, 950, etc), you can order it online, and once you have it on hand, you can get
 it installed. To install it, unplug everything from your desktop, and lay it down on a table. Pull the door off, and on the motherboard, you should see the heatsink. It'll be right on the top center of the motherboard, with a fan on it, and probably 4 screws
 or some other kind of device to hold it down securely to the motherboard. The type of heatsink it has will be dependent on the model of computer you have. If you need help, YouTube and a search engine&nbsp;will be your friend. Once you get it off, you'll see your
 processor. It'll have some old thermal paste on it. A clean rag will take that off of both the&nbsp;old processor and the heatsink. Then you can get the processor out, CAREFULLY. There will be 775 pins on the motherboard that the processor was pressed up against.
 YouTube will be your friend again if you need any help getting the processor out. BUT, if you bend any of those pins, you'll need to straighten them out, without making it worse. VERY DELICATE. I don't&nbsp;think many shops would take on a job like that anymore,
 because of the age of your machine.&nbsp;So, CAREFULLY remove the processor, and then do everything you just did backwards to reassemble it. New processor in, clean both the surface of the new processor and your heatsink with alcohol, apply some new thermal paste
 (I mentioned what that is and where you get it in a previous post), reattach the heatsink to the motherboard, make sure your fan is plugged in (the one on the heatsink), door back on, hook it back up, and you should be good to go. When you first boot it back
 up, it'll ask to go into BIOS so it can configure the new CPU, so you'll go into BIOS, then you can just save and exit. It did everything it needed to do automatically.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should have covered everything, but there's always a chance I missed a step. I've done so many jobs like this, everything just becomes automatic for me, and I can skip things that most other people need mentioned in steps like this. If you have any questions,
 or need any more input from me, don't hesitate to ask. If you want, you could also have me double check what you'll be upgrading, you can reply to this post with your specific Desktop Model Number, the model number of the CPU that is currently installed, and
 what you think you want to upgrade do. I'll double check everything, and let you know if everything will work before you make any purchases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of Luck</p>

                    I purchased a hp laptop with windows defender built in. It also came with a free trial of MacAfee that has expired. Do I need any other virus/malware protection besides the built in Windows defender and if so what would you recommend?

            Hi essiejohnsen,
<br />
<br />Windows 10 now contains a full and competent Security Suite . . .
<br />
<br />Windows Defender has, over the last few years become a fully featured Security solution 
<br />
<br />It is on a par with paid for Anti-virus software, the virus definitions are updated regularly, it will not slow our PC down, works well with Edge and it is Free 
<br />
<br />Defender now has a new feature - Controlled Folder Access, which protects against a ransomware attack
<br />
<br />Honestly, you do not need more protection than Defender can supply . ..
<br />
<br />
<br />You should uninstall Mcafee totally from your system, the Mcafee uninstaller does not completely remove that security suite, they provide a tool to remove all remnants of Mcafee from your system, you should use that:

<p>Keep in mind that you're asking about a Microsoft product (Windows Defender) in a forum sponsored by Microsoft. You shouldn't expect to get an objective answer here. Particularly with 'independent' advisors from Directly. In the same way, you wouldn't ask
 whether McAfee antivirus is good in a community forum run by McAfee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want objective information that you can use to make a decision, you can find that on the internet. For example:</p>

</p><p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/best-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Best Antivirus Software for Windows 10 in 2018</a> - from the popular Windows Central website</p>
<p>
</p><p>Virtually all paid antivirus programs have free trials, so take advantage of them. When you do, also consider how easy the program is to use, and whether you like the user interface. As you'll discover, most antivirus programs - including Windows Defender
 - work very well, so your choice may simply be a matter of which one you like the best.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows Defender is your choice, that's fine. But just because it comes from Microsoft doesn't automatically make it better. The October 2018 Update disaster (v.1809) also came from Microsoft.</p>

            Hi Essiejohnsen
<br />
<br />Windows Defender has come a long way from the days of Microsoft Security Essentials. 
<br />
<br />It includes a decent Antivirus scanner thats more robust and uses heuristics and the cloud to detect and remove malicious code. 
<br />
<br />There is also a built in offline scanner you can use to scan Windows outside of the installation.
<br />
<br />Windows Defender also includes a Firewall, Network Security and protections again newer types of attacks such as Ransomware. 
<br />
<br />So, its pretty robust, especially when combined with other security features such as Windows Smart Screen Filter. I think when used with a Standard User Account, some common sense - don't just download software from suspicious websites or open strange emails with attachments. 
<br />
<br />Also, keep a regular backup of your computer, system restore points; you really can't go wrong. 
<br />
<br />You can also supplement it with third party solutions such as the ESET Sysrescue offline scanner and Malwarebytes.

            Hello Essiejohnsen,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Windows Security/Defender itself is sufficient to protect your Windows 10 system against security threats. I am using it for years and it never disappointed me. Just make sure you keep its virus and spyware definitions up-to-date and it will do its best to safeguard your device.
<br />
<br />Regards.

            Hello,
<div><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</div>
<div>Your interest in Windows 10 is much appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
I understand your inconvenience that you are unable to find Cortana in your region. Cortana is undergoing intensive learning of other languages.</div>
<div><br />
If you want to activate Cortana, please refer to the below steps and check if it helps:
<div><br />
Cortana is now available in the aforementioned regions. However, users are required to make some changes in the settings to be able to get the voice assistant. Here are the changes you need to make:</div>
<div><br />
1.&nbsp;Change the language settings (Settings &gt; Language) to any of the different English version -- English India / Australia / Canada -- in accordance with the place you’re based in.<br />
2.&nbsp;You are no longer required to be living at US to have Cortana on your phone. Change the region settings (Settings &gt; Region) to India, Australia, or Canada<br />
3.&nbsp;Similarly, you are required to make some amendments to the Speech settings (Settings &gt; Speech) as well.
<br />
4.&nbsp;For Australia: English (United Kingdom); For Canada set it to English (United States); and for India: English (United Kingdom)</div>
<div>
<p>Refer to the following link and check if it helps.</p>

                    I've read that these two running together cause no conflicts as long as you disable the sandbox in Avast or comodo firewall but my main question is which is the best way to install them

Avast First then restart then Comodo firewall or vise versa any help would be great thanks.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Frankly I would run Avast and forget Comodo or any 3rd party firewall. Use the Windows Firewall
<br />
which is extremely effective. Most routers today also have a built-in hardware firewall which works
<br />
well with the Windows software firewall.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Low cost 3rd party software firewalls are pretty much problems waiting to happen. They all have<br />
compatibility issues and offer only a few enhanced controls. In fact their issues often actually lower<br />
the overall security instead of raising it. The Windows Firewall has no compatibility issues and is<br />
extremely secure if you know enough to bypass most of the hype. Quality software firewalls cost<br />
thousands. Most routers have&nbsp;hardware firewalls built in and those are considerably better additions<br />
for the buck than any cheap/low cost software firewall.<br />

Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave File System, Web,
<br />
and Network running (Script and Behavior are also recommended in Ver 6+).<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free<br />
<br />
Windows Firewall<br />
<br />
Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)<br />
<br />
IE - Protected Mode<br />
<br />
IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)<br />
<br />
I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Two versions of Avast are available 6.x and 4.8x<br />
<br />
Avast 6.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />

<br />
Avast 4.8x&nbsp;- Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web,<br />
and Network running. (Double Click&nbsp;Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields -<br />
Terminate&nbsp;those you do not use.)<br />

<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here<br />
or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />

<br />
PCmag - Prevx - Editor's Choice<br />
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp</span></a>
<br />
<br />
Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.<br />

Hope this helps.
