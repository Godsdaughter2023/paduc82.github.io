            My sincere apologies. Changing the font size is only available for Windows desktop and Mac. You may try to visit the Native Settings on your iPad and from there change the Font Size you are using.

<h2>            How do I use the mousepad in microsoft professional 2010 word to copy and paste</h2>
                    ok so I bought a laptop acer apire one to finish the editing process in writing a book and I can't seem to get the non-button mouse pad to bring up the correct menu when I use the&nbsp;commads to bring up the&nbsp;right click menu.&nbsp; You must hit control and touch
 the pad on the&nbsp;right to get the menu to come up but when&nbsp;I do it while in microsoft word 2010,&nbsp;nothing happens, it says something about a selection not being valid. But when I go out onto my desk top and want to do something such as minimize or close a document
 it allows me to do so with the same&nbsp;command.&nbsp;&nbsp;I need the copy&nbsp;and paste menu&nbsp;to come up when I highlight a word or phrase and its not working.&nbsp; I only get the edit menu, such as font style and color.&nbsp; Help Please!!!??!?!?&nbsp;

<p>
I'm interested in following this thread as I'm experiencing the exact same problem with MS Projects 2016 on my company computer. Flickering happens only on MS Projects, nothing else. It's random and happens for 10-15 seconds when flickering starts - ends. No
 other MS applications do this, none. And I don't have wallpaper app slideshows running as one suggestion was to stop that.</p>

<p>Hi Niermann,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try the following suggestion first and share the results with us:</p>
<p>1. Open Project &gt; click File &gt;&nbsp;<strong>Options&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Advanced&nbsp;</strong>&gt; select&nbsp;<strong>Disable hardware graphics acceleration under Display</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Perform a&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot&nbsp;</a>to determine whether background programs are interfering with the installation.</p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Start your PC in safe mode in Windows 10</a></span>. if the problem doesn't happen in safe mode, you'll
 know default settings and basic device drivers aren't causing the issue.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, to help us clarify the scenario, please provide some more information:</p>
<p>1. The version of Project. (You may check Project version in File &gt; Account and show up a screenshot of this page.)</p>
<p>2. The OS version.</p>
<p>3. Do other applications have the same error message or just Project?</p>
<p>4. Are both the Project and your desktop flickering now?</p>
<p>5. Does the flickering issue happen immediately after you open Project or&nbsp;after you do some operation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>This may not be related to your issue but are you using a macro that uses the screenupdating property? If so, there was a flickering issue associated with screenupdating and it was fixed by the March 2017 Public Update.</p>

<h2>            Inserting page numbers in Microsoft Word for Mac 2016</h2>
                    When I attempt to insert page numbers in my Word documents, instead of numbers appearing, the word "Page" surrounded by brackets appears
<p>at the bottom of each page. I have tried to fix this problem but haven't yet discovered a solution. Today I called Microsoft technical support and the representative I spoke to didn't know how to fix it. Does anyone from this forum know how to solve this
 problem so I can insert page numbers?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do you connect Lumia 635 phone to a WIN 10 PC, via WiFi&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to "add a device" to my WIN 10 PC via my WiFi connection.&nbsp; The phone is a Nokia Lumia 635 and is connected to my home WiFi system.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>These are the steps I have taken. </p>
<p>1. On the PC, I go to Windows Explorer / Network.&nbsp; I click on "Add Devices".&nbsp; </p>
<p>2. On the phone, I go to Settings / Internet Sharing.&nbsp; I turn internet sharing on.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>3. The PC sees my phone via WiFi.&nbsp; The PC requires a WPS Pin.&nbsp; </p>
<p>4. From the phone "Settings / Internet Sharing", I see a "password".</p>
<p>5. The PC tells me that the password does not work, as I have entered it for the WPS PIN.&nbsp; Further, the PC tells me to either "try adding ....again", or "check with the phone manufacturer for additional setup instructions".&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question remains, how do I connect my phone to my PC, via WiFi? </p>
<p>
</p><p>(This question has also been posted under "Settings".)</p>

<p>I want to be able to add my phone as a connected device to my PC Win 10.&nbsp; The first purpose is to move files, specifically photos from the phone to the PC.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Through "Internet Sharing" on my phone, my PC can 'see' the phone.&nbsp; It seems that I don't have the right information to complete the connection.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>It is curious that I am finding instructions to make the connections, but the connection doesn't happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; From what I am reading this should be simple, but it is becoming obvious that it is not simple.&nbsp;

</p><p>Is the "can't" about not moving files?&nbsp; Or is it about not connecting, in which case the files don't move?&nbsp;

<p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply Michael. It gives me a better understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So like you I wanted to move files (specifically pictures) to my PC and visa versa using Wi-Fi. The main reason was even though I could use Bluetooth to move files it was just to damn slow.
</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I want to be able to add my phone as a connected device to my PC Win 10.&nbsp; The first purpose is to move files, specifically photos from the phone to the PC.&nbsp;
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I solved that issue sometime back when I found a neat program called "Shareit".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a description of what it does:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 90px"><em>SHAREit, A fantastic application that can complete transferring files between devices in seconds! Cellular data free! Genuine multi-platform! PS：When transmission via Wi-Fi, transmission speed will be affected by the equipment
 and the surrounding.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 90px"><em>-Fantastic · Photos, music and video are easy to share with anyone at any time, brings people together. · Transfer files between phone and computer at any time, transferring is no longer limited. -Cellular data free · Devices
 could transfer files anytime as long as they are on the same LAN. · Without LAN？ Devices could connect to hotspot that are created by one of them, always could transfer files at any time. * Transfer files over hotspots if not using cellular data. * Doesn’t
 support transfer files over hotspots that are created by Windows Phone. </em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 90px"><em>-Multi-platform · SHAREit is compatible with Android, iOS, Mac, Windows and Windows Phone. Share the happiness to the people who are around you at any time. Official Website:
</em><a href="http://www.ushareit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>http://www.ushareit.com/</em>
</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find it in the store for your PC here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/shareit/9wzdncrdsz0p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/shareit/9wzdncrdsz0p</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>AND you can find it in the store on your Windows Phone. Open the store and search "share.it", download and install and then you will be all set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install on both! It really works well for me and is my go to app for transferring files!! I did have to "plat around" a bit to figure it out ... not long maybe 10-15 minutes to understand how it worked. I think it will become your gto app for transferring
 files!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Through "Internet Sharing" on my phone, my PC can 'see' the phone.&nbsp; It seems that I don't have the right information to complete the connection.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>So I rarely used Internet sharing on my devices in the past. Years and years ago I did but not recently (until I got my unlocked 950XL). Because it is unlocked AT&amp;T did not block it yet on my AT&amp;T phones it was blocked. Unfortunately I cannot test it on
 my other phones since I changed the SIM when I got my 950XL. It uses a smaller SIM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>It is curious that I am finding instructions to make the connections, but the connection doesn't happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; From what I am reading this should be simple, but it is becoming obvious that it is not simple.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>To avoid that issue prior to my purchase of my 950XL, I used a small Wi-Fi device (Internet on the Go!) that I purchased at Walmart for about $75. I purchased data from them and chose the option not to let it run out in 30 days but rather use the forever
 keep it active. More of a pain than what it is worth to be honest.</p>

            The problem isn't that the folder is missing, it's there. I shows 9 entries. It's just when I add additional users&nbsp; or folders they don't show in the list, I can't resize the window if they [would] show below those 9, and there's no scroll bar on the window
 to scroll down. And the users/folders appear to be added to the Favorites list because the option is no longer available on their account.

            That is the Favorites folder list. (You said 'users' in your original question which led me to think you mean the People favorites). 
<br />
<br />There is probably a limit but its at least 20 (that how many I have currently). :)  How many you'll see on the screen (without a scroll bar) depends on the height of the outlook window - on one of my computers I can see 16, my laptop can only show 13. 
<br />
<br />Which version and build of Outlook are you using? See File, Office Account for the information. There was a bug in one recent build where some folders wouldn't show up on Favorites. 
<br />
<br />You could try opening outlook with the /resetnavpane switch but this will reset the Favorites to the defaul. You'll need to add the folders back to the Favorites list and I can't guarantee it will fix the problem if its related to the bug. 
<br />
<br />To use the switch, close Outlook. Right-click on the Start button and choose Run or press Windows key + R  to open the Run command. Type or paste the following into the Open field and press Enter or click OK to restart Outlook. (There is a space before /.)
<br />
<br />outlook.exe /resetnavpane

            You always get better responses when you ask in the correct forum. You posted in the Outlook.com forum. Desktop Outlook is off-topic in that forum. I moved your post to the desktop Outlook forum where it is on-topic.

            <p>Adding items to the right-click (shortcut) menus in versions of Word after 2003 requires macro programming. An introduction and a few examples are at
<a href="http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/customize_shortcut_menu.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/customize_shortcut_menu.html</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have any macro background and find Greg's article difficult to understand, post back and describe the commands you want to add, and which menu(s) you want to add them to. There are a couple of dozen shortcut menus, each one assigned to appear
 for a specific type of text or object being clicked -- text, table, cell, picture, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might find it easier to put copies of the commands you want onto the Quick Access Toolbar. In most cases, you can right-click the command's button where it appears in the ribbon, and choose Add to Quick Access Toolbar. Then it will be available for all
 locations where the command is defined.</p>

<h2>            Weird &#34;Message To&#34; Issue on Android Tablet--Because I don&#39;t HAVE Contacts List.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I use Office 2010 Outlook on my PC and the Outlook app for my Samsung (non-wi-fi)&nbsp;Tablet. I don't have a Contacts list for either account (Hotmail). When I want to send an email on either device, I enter the first letter of the person's name or email and
 the field auto-populates.</p>
<p>This morning I had something very strange happen. I went to send an email to a friend, and I entered a "G". All these names of people I don't know appeared on the list of names to choose from. I made a list of them, A-Z. I noticed a pattern to these names.
 They appear to be names associated with my former boss, who also has a Hotmail account.
</p>
<p>Which begs the question: Why are HIS contacts showing up in MY auto-populate list? Again, I don't have Contacts, so they haven't been added to my Contacts, just to the list of names to choose from to put in the "To" field.</p>
<p>An important thing to note is that these names DO NOT show up in my Office Outlook Application on my desktop PC. When I checked under "Contacts", the list was indeed empty.
</p>
<p>I have never synced any contacts with my GMail account. I have a whopping eight names in my GMail Contacts list, as my Hotmail account is the one I use most often.</p>
<p>I immediately changed my Hotmail password, and I change it regularly. </p>
<p>The last time I received an email from this person was 12/18/2015.</p>
<p>Any ideas as to what might have happened, and more importantly, how I can clean all this crap out of my Outlook app on my tablet?
</p>
<p>Uninstall and reinstall the only way to go?</p>
<p>Thank you for any insight and help you might be able to provide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply. </p>
<p>The thing is, I don't HAVE any contacts in my Hotmail account. All I do is type the first letter of the email address in the "To" field, and the system auto-populates the rest for me. These are people I don't even know, but I think they're his contacts because
 they work at the same company that he does, and in the same field that he does.</p>
<p>I have never had contacts in my Hotmail/Outlook account.</p>
<p>My brother in law's Yahoo account was one of those hacked a couple of years ago. He received the email telling him to change his password, but thought it was a phishing email, so he didn't change his password. (Don't even get me started on that one!) His
 account sent out spam to everyone in his contacts list, including me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never had to use a contacts list. I just type in the first letter of a name, and the field auto-populates.
</p>
<p>That's why this has me stumped. I want to know how his contacts ended up in&nbsp;my "To" List.
</p>
<p>I appreciate your help. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>In Outlook 2010, the ‘autocomplete’ list of contacts with email addresses is totally divorced from the Contacts list.</p>
<p>Since you are using an Exchange account for email (almost all Hotmail users have been migrated to Exchange-based Outlook Mail), the autocomplete list is synched between most clients such as Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible your Outlook 2010 is linked to Exchange via EAS* instead of 'full' Exchange protocols (EAS is the default after migration). If so you should delete your mail account in Outlook and then recreate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To delete the autocomplete list in Outlook 2010 and anything synched to it:</p>
<p>File / Options / Mail / Send messages …&nbsp;&nbsp; and then click on the Empty Auto-complete List bar on the right, and let Outlook synch with Outlook Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether this will synch (via Exchange EAS) to Outlook Mobile I know not. </p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

* - the lightweight protocol used by mobiles to talk to Exchange</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply. I have never&nbsp;linked/synced any of my accounts.&nbsp;I checked as you suggested, to verify this.</p>
<p>This person is my former boss, and we are only connected via LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Immediately after this happened, I sent him a private LinkedIn message to tell him I had something very important I needed to discuss. Then I sent him a Facebook friend request, to reach out in another way because all the phone numbers I had were disconnected.
 (He's probably gone all cellular.)</p>
<p>He accepted the Facebook friend request several days later. Turns out he's been on vacation. I read your reply about Social Media Accounts, and thought about LinkedIn.</p>
<p>I sent him a Facebook Messenger message, telling him there was a problem and to check his email. I sent the email, explained what happened, and sent him a list of the people and email addresses that had appeared in the "To" field of my tablet that I was
 sure belonged to him. I asked him to check if they were his Hotmail contacts or LinkedIn contacts, or both. (I had written them all down, A-Z.)</p>
<p>I still think that it's weird that this happened ONLY with my Android tablet, and didn't happen on my PC. The names and email addresses were only there for a day and a half, then disappeared.</p>
<p>I haven't heard anything back from him regarding the incident, just wanted your expert advice/opinions as to what may have happened.</p>
<p>My Outlook "Recent Activity" looks clean, and I have a strong password which I change regularly. &nbsp;</p>

<p>My Outlook 2010 Desktop/PC, via Office 2010 IS indeed linked to Exchange via EAS, Exchange Active Server. My Android tablet is&nbsp;linked via Connect for Hotmail app.</p>
<p>I discovered that the desktop Outlook 2010 is linked via EAS when viewing my Recent Activity under My Account/Security.
</p>
<p>I noted a successful Automatic Sync an hour ago, one three hours ago, one on 10/22, 10/21, 10/18, etc. I also saw four
<em><strong>unsuccessful</strong> </em>sync attempts via the <strong>IMAP</strong> protocol--</p>
<p>one on 10/18 from an IP address in Sweden, one on 10/13 from an IP address in Mexico, one on 10/1 from an IP address in Russia, and one on 9/29 from an IP address in the UK.
</p>
<p>I regularly review my "Recent Activity" in my account to look for signs of unusual logon activity, but have never paid attention to&nbsp;successful/unsuccessful sync protocol or locations. Should I ignore these as normal?
</p>
<p>Botscout.com does have the Mexican IP address listed as "Caught" on 9/25, and the Swedish IP address has been "Caught" 63 times, and has a threat rating of 35 on ProjectHoneypot.org.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I looked in my Web-based Outlook account under Options/Accounts, I noticed that it said that the IMAP uses Port 993 and Security is SSL. Is there any way to change this to TLS?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and advice.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This is what I thought was strange. The autocomplete was happening on the Android device, but not on the PC. The PC was using the EAS Protocol, and the Android was using Connect for Hotmail app.</p>
<p>Please see below regarding question about whether security for Outlook can be changed from SSL to TLS (I was not aware Windows 7 used SSL at all) and also the question regarding the attempts to auto-sync my Hotmail account via the IMAP protocol from foreign
 IP addresses. Thank you very much for your help.</p>

<p>After created, I don't assign license for them. But they can login to Office 365 and can go to SharePoint Site. (if have permission)</p>

            Hello. I'm Rey, a Community Expert willing to help the users.
<br />
<br />Yes this is a normal behavior. Even if the user has not any license assigned he still is an active user in the Office 365 Portal and can login with user and password. The difference is that a licensed user once logged in will see all the features that comes with the license as Mailbox, OneDrive, Calendar, Office application etc.
<br />
<br />Best Regards

</p><p>Thanks for you reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My company has plan to setup hybrid for Office 365 and on-premise.</p>
<p>We have 10000 user as bellow:</p>
<p>&nbsp;+ 2000 account need to use OneDrive, Exchange (need license E3)</p>
<p>&nbsp;+ 8000 account only use SharePoint Online to upload and download document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If above behavior is normally. I can create 8000 account on Azure AD and no need assign license for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They can login and use SharePoint Online normally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I am concerned that in the future, Unlicensed user will be locked by Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Neo - what do you mean by "public" site? Public sites were deleted long ago. You definitely need a license to access SP Online. But we shouldn't be guessing - please post a link to the documentation about this.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>what is your video card (AMD nVidia or intel)? can you play any other 3d games?</p>
<p>
</p><p>DirectX 11 is included in windows 10 (as is 12), and I've played old games with 9.0c as well. Graphics drivers are updated more frequently than any other type of driver so it is a good thing to check as suggested.<br />

the more information you can provide the better able anyone will be able to help you.</p>

<h2>            Build 9879 working great</h2>
                    I saw a lot of strange things in 9860 but after moving to 9879 I have not had any issues at all. During install it did not recognize my sound card but had the same issue in 9860. I just installed the drivers for it and it solved the sound card problem.
 Looking forward to new builds. The performance of 10 seems the be outstanding compared to Windows 7 Pro.

            The "big cell phone gui" comes in Windows 10 also. There's a switch in the taskbar/start menu properties. Which is a good thing for those that like the start screen.

            <p>Apologies for not being very clear, I like reading WSJ, NYT, The Economist modern apps, but what I really dislike is that these apps covers the entire screen so &nbsp;I need to somehow move the mouse to right now and then to see what are going on like the current
 clock time, network status, battery status, etc. What I really want is a permanent task bar, and some nice modern apps that can be resized.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also switching apps is the pain on the neck, you need to move the mouse to the left of screen, or the top left corner, alt-tab or win-tab or clicking the app on the task bar is much nicer, more ergonomic.</p>

    <title>Dynamic table mail merge code and efficiency - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andre-app.licious-group  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dynamic table mail merge code and efficiency</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping someone can help to make this mail merge coding task smaller and more efficient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a number of training modules (&gt;30) that are selected as either Commenced, Ongoing or Assessed in an external forms app. This data is then merged into a Word template. Part of the incoming data is inserted into a table's applicable columns as a tick
 as well as the training module name if the apprentice is busy with the training unit. Only training units that are relevant to the trainee apprentice are selected from the 30+ available units and only those selected units must appear in the table as well as
 indicating if they have Commenced, Ongoing or have been Assessed by the trainer when they visited the trainee apprentice on site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An example of the table that I created with the column headers and example of the incoming data that may be present:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Commenced</strong></td>
<td><strong>Ongoing</strong></td>
<td><strong>Assessed</strong></td>
<td><strong>Unit #</strong></td>
<td><strong>Unit Name</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align: center">"tick"</td>
<td>
</td><td>
</td><td>CPCCOHS2003A</td>
<td>O H&amp; S Unit 3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td><td style="text-align: center">"tick"</td>
<td>
</td><td>CPCCOHS2016A</td>
<td>O H&amp; S Unit 16</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td><td>
</td><td style="text-align: center">"tick"</td>
<td>CPCCOHS2001A</td>
<td>O H&amp; S Unit 1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I could not get a dynamic table merge to work so what I did was I created the table in the template document and limited it to 10 rows (they wouldn't need more rows because only a selection are relevant to a trainee) and then in a Text Box layered directly
 over the table I inserted the following merge code (only a snippet is shown below because it is extremely long). It checks if a unit was selected as Commenced, Ongoing or Assessed for that trainee visit. It then puts a tick in the appropriate column (by lining
 up with the column under the text box) and also writes the unit code and unit name above those columns at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5489604e-6f16-4c9b-935c-74fbcbeb1699?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5489604e-6f16-4c9b-935c-74fbcbeb1699?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem with this is that it is extremely long to code, so I'm assuming there is a better way to do it and it's also difficult to get the ticks and text to correctly align to the underlying table's columns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas with examples of the correct way to code this would be appreciated.</p>
<p>What I'm hoping for is that if a unit is selected then it will make a row in a table and write to the columns as needed. And creating table rows as it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Andre</p>

<p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The data comes from a platform called ServiceM8.</p>
<p>This is a screenshot of the form being created&nbsp;<a href="https://gyazo.com/ffdac7c6064384ed8a8fa771e3f662d2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://gyazo.com/ffdac7c6064384ed8a8fa771e3f662d2</a></p>
<p>The form output template is built in Word and then attached to the ServiceM8 electronic form. When the electronic form input has been completed it sends the field data to the Word template and creates the form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll send you an example of the Word template via email so you can see the table that I would like to make dynamic instead of having a text box as a layer over it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Andre</p>

                    <p>Sorry all, I can see this question has been asked before but the moderator that assisted at the time asked for a 'private message' with the email address effected.&nbsp; I can't see how I can post this message without logging a new question??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question is this; I have set up a new hotmail account temporarily for a stag do I'm trying to arrange.&nbsp; This new account won't let me send out group messages without verifying my account.&nbsp; It pops up with a window for me to submit my mobile but then
 fails and says to try again later.&nbsp; I have tried sporadically for the last few days now without success so I'm at the end of my tether.&nbsp; I appreciate that this is to try to stop spammers which I'm all for but at least make sure the functionality to verify
 the account works.&nbsp; I can see posts here for the same problem dating back months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen a response previously saying to remove the country's prefix, in my case 0 but this still doesn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is what I would do but BEFORE you do anything, I strongly urge you to backup your PIM data.&nbsp; A great way to do that is to use PIM BACKUP, a free utility you can get here at<a href="http://www.dotfred.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.dotfred.net</a></p>
<p>Now that you have backed up your data in case of any issues, do the following:</p>
<p>Sync your contacts with the MyPhone site and make the adjustments you want.&nbsp; Now remove the connected phone from the MyPhone site.&nbsp; Don't worry, you are only removing the connected phone, NOT the data.</p>
<p>On you device, delete the contacts.</p>
<p>Now sync your device with the MyPhone app to the MyPhone website.&nbsp; When it connects to the MyPhone site, it will see there is NO CONNECTED PHONE so it will re-establish a connection and will download the Contact data stored on the MyPhone site to your device.</p>

<h2>            Account help</h2>
                    Hi. I'm having a problem and need some help. My computer updated my skype and when it reopened it asked me to sign in. It had been a long time since I'd signed out or in and I forgot my password. When I tried to have it reset it asked me to login to my
 Microsoft acct. I didn't remember&nbsp;that password either so I reset it. When I did that and logged in it just created a NEW skype acct. I don't want a new skype acct..&nbsp;I want to get into my old one with all my contacts! Is there a way to get into the old account???&nbsp;
 I don't want a new acct.&nbsp; I searched my old one and can still see it..&nbsp;but I can't get into it :(

            I also have the same problem! I no longer have access to the email account to which security information is sent in order to reset my password. I have tried resetting it by completing the Microsoft form but it keeps rejecting me each time even though I
 complete all the information required. I just want to speak to a person to seek assistance - it's impossible and very frustrating! I use that account for work and need to keep all the contacts and previous chats! Hopefully someone on here can help.&nbsp;

</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you log into Skype using your Microsoft&nbsp;account,&nbsp;the system&nbsp;will automatically create a new Skype account for you using that Microsoft email address. As an advice when resetting your password, please make sure that you're typing the Skype Name, email

&nbsp;
<p>If you've forgotten your Skype sign-in details, please follow the steps below:</p>

    <title>Why am I getting duplicate emails when managing my Gmail account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chiragf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why am I getting duplicate emails when managing my Gmail account&#63;</h2>
                    I followed the instructions on this page to manage my Gmail account from Outlook:<br />
<br />
http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-outlook/archive/2012/08/09/upgrade-from-gmail-to-outlook-com-in-5-easy-steps.aspx<br />
<br />
Until a few days ago, all new email to my Gmail inbox was being forwarded to my Outlook.com inbox, while my historical Gmail messages were in the separate Gmail_Inbox folder. However, this past weekend, two things happened:<br />
<br />
1) ALL of my Gmail messages got imported to my Outlook.com inbox, including the historical messages which were already in my Gmail_Inbox folder. Most of these historic messages seemed to be getting imported twice, AND they show up as unread, even if they had
 been marked Read in Gmail. So I essentially have a LOT of duplicated and unread old emails.<br />
2) Almost all new messages sent to my Gmail inbox are also duplicated when I look at them in Outlook.com<br />
<br />
I did look in my actual Gmail inbox, but there's no duplication there. The problem seems to be during the importing/forwarding between Gmail and Outlook.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

            <p>Hi ChiragF,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you said that you Gmail messages were forwarded to your Outlook.com inbox, have you enabled your forwarding settings on your Gmail account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Were there any changes made on your email account before the issue occur?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked the link you provided and it provides infomation on how to upgrade Gmail account to Outlook.com. I noticed that there are many suggestions provided, for clarification what are the steps you have followed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi Melanie,<br />
<br />
I actually figured out what the problem was, but forgot to update the thread. I had set up Outlook.com to receive email from my Gmail account, and I had also set up forwarding on Gmail, so I was getting the same message twice (Gmail would forward it to me automatically,
 then Outlook.com would pull it from Gmail separately). I turned off forwarding from Gmail, and now I get just one copy of each email.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response!<br />
<br />

            I too was receiving duplicate emails on my iphone. &nbsp;I had previously turned on forwarding in my gmail account. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>My solution: &nbsp;<span>I simply went back to the gmail account where I had turned forwarding on, and left the option "forward a copy of incoming mail to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***" untouched, and selected from the pull down menu "and Archive gmail's
 copy". &nbsp;Problem solved. &nbsp;No more duplicate emails in my inbox. &nbsp;</span></div>

            Alright, lets see if I can help you out.. The problem lies in that you authorized Gmail's App at some point in time access to your Microsoft Outlook account or could be vise versa, regardless.. log in to your outlook email account (im using the windows
 10 outlook mail app, maybe you have to use this one specifically for these instructions to properly guide you). Select the setting gear bottom left of mail window. Select manage accounts. &nbsp;Select Outlook account. Select change account settings. The previous
 step will direct you to a your Microsoft settings account webpage. After logging in if necessary there is a selection of options running horizontal near the top of the page and to the very right you will see Security and Privacy, select it. This will take
 you to another webpage where you will find Applications and Services after scrolling down near the bottom-right end of the webpage. Select it and you should be able to see something of the sort, &nbsp;"you have granted the following applications (mine showed an
 account linked to my mac which i had authorized and another to my mobile device) permission to blah blah blah.. forwarding to your inbox." Select edit, remove.<br />
<br />
hope this helps<br />

</p><p>When I open Outlook, I get the message - Repairing Main Profile - Copying Records to a new profile. &nbsp;It then stops because my main profile is massive - says I need 340GB and to free up disk space. &nbsp;Since I have a 500GB hard drive and I am assuming my corrupt
 Main Profile is about 340GB, I can pretty much never clear enough disk space to make this work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on El Capitan 10.11.6 and Outlook 15.26.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use IMAP, but most of the items I need to salvage are not on my email server as I move them to local folders to keep them for future use without overburdening my email server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated! &nbsp;Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>

            An external 3TB drive is about $100 these days. It's probably a good investment for you right now.

<h2>            E71 - How can I stop it flashing&#47;pulsing&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I love the facility to have the centre thingy-bob flash when there's a message or mail unread, but it just seems to do this constantly now and I"m not sure why? I get 4 'small squares' in the top right hand corner, I'm convinced it something to do with this?
 Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Karen

            You have two areas on the E71 which cause "flashing", the first is the notifications...<br />
<br />
This can be found under:-<br />
<br />
Tools | Settings | General | Personalisation | Notification light.<br />
<br />
This will let you know when you've had txt msgs, calls etc..<br />
<br />
The other (Breathing light) is found under:-<br />
<br />
Tools | Profiles | (select yr profile) General | Personalise | Breathing light (on/off)...<br />
<br />
If you switch off the "breathing light" then when the screen drops into power saving it will display a clock screensaver.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />
