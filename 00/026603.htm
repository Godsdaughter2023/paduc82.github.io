<h2>            Why can&#39;t I open or copy files from the web&#63;</h2>
                    In the start menu, I typed "msconfig" and nothing was there but something called "programs" I clicked it nut it said that the internet was blocking it. I followed a few steps they gave me but it didn't seem to work.

<h2>            Attaching pictures inline in Outlook Mail</h2>
                    <p>I guess I am using Outlook 2016, sometime in the recent past outlook changed. &nbsp;I can no longer figure out how to attach pictures inline - I can't even see a thumbnail when when it attaches like to the top of the email. &nbsp;I am really pretty unhappy with the
 changes but most I can deal with, but this one really frustrates me! &nbsp;I am using Safari on a Mac. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a screen shot of the instructions for adding a picture inline:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fd62a61-3e53-425f-b2da-fc5c3ead41f4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5fd62a61-3e53-425f-b2da-fc5c3ead41f4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I see on my computer:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59d907f4-830b-407d-9e9a-017cafde8ad4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59d907f4-830b-407d-9e9a-017cafde8ad4" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>They are not at all the same! &nbsp;I can't find the menu in the insturctions (yes, it is acutually a picture for 'calendar', but its their instructions so I assume it is the same in mail...I don't use calendar, butI did check and no my calendar menu doesnt have
 the magic 'Insert' button either! &nbsp;Is this a Mac thing? &nbsp;I'm going to be really pissed if it is a Mac thing!</p>

<h2>            Need Help to Restore a Word 2013 file &#40;Win7&#41; Overwritten</h2>
                    <p>Need help, please...&nbsp; Yesterday, I opened a Word 2013 document (Windows 7) that I created two weeks ago, made a lot of changes to it, and accidently clicked "Save" instead of "Save As" to save the new file with the changes.&nbsp; I didn't realize it until I opened
 the&nbsp;file again.&nbsp; I need to recover the version of the file before the erroneous save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The document is on my work computer.&nbsp; The "Restore Previous Versions" and Restore Points are disabled (by Sys Admin).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the AutoRecover file location and it is empty.&nbsp; The "Always create backup copy" is not checked by default, and I didn't realize that until now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using the trial version of Recuva, but it wasn't helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that Windows saves multiple copies of files and data in different places that are unknown to the average user.&nbsp; So, I'm hoping that one of our community experts can help me dig out a&nbsp;copy of the overwritten file.&nbsp; I don't care if it's in bits and
 pieces and I have to put it back together again.&nbsp; As long as I have the basic information that was in it, I could probably work with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you...&nbsp;</p>

            IF you saved and closed the document, there is not much chance of recovering anything.&nbsp; If you still had the document open, you could use Undo, even after saving it with a new name.

<h2>            Mark all items of conversation as complete</h2>
                    dear,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What is the easiest way to mark all items of one conversation as 'complete'</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Of course all emails can be selected via the shift button, then right mouse click, then look for follow-up, then click 'mark complete'. That are 3 clicks and one hovering.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to do this via a 'quick step' created action or the like?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            <p>While you can ceate a quick step to mark complete, you'll need to select the messages in the conversation yourself.
</p>
<p>if you use complete the most, set it as the quick click - that will eliminate the right-click.

<h2>            Can not attach files from One Drive to Outlook Emails</h2>
                    For the past two months I have not been able to attach a file like a pdf to an email that I am composing in MS Office. It gets about 90% loaded then stops. But if I copy the same pdf on to my PC hard drive, it attaches to the email without any problem.
 How do I get the files to attach from One Drive?

            Hi,  StephenKanyr
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor. I hope it helps. 
<br />
<br />Try resetting the OneDrive sync app on each computer and make sure that you are sign into the same account in each app. 
<br />
<br />Press the Windows key + R on your keyboard. 
<br />
<br />Then copy and paste this text into the Run window that appears and press Enter:
<br />
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset
<br />
<br />That will reset OneDrive
<br />After a couple of minutes, the OneDrive cloud icon should show in the system tray.
<br />
<br />If it doesn’t start, open Start, find OneDrive and start it
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            Open an office application say Word or Excel. Keep all other closed. Sign-out and Sign-in again. Close all office apps. Now you can open office apps.

Your featured templates should be available.

If not available, you may try Quick Repair also.

            Good Day

My Name is Phillip Roos and i will be happy to help the best way possible and in a timely manner.

Please try the following solution of repairing your office package:

The first thing you can do is to navigate and select the start button
2) Type in control panel
3) Navigate to "Programs".
4) Then select "Uninstall a Program"
5) Then find your office installation and right click (Usually say Microsoft Office 2016 or something similar)
6) Select change
7) Now a window will pop asking for "Quick Repair" or "Online Repair"
8) Select the Quick Repair option and reboot
9) If the problem continues select the Online Repair option and reboot

Please let me know if this helped or not, i will happily assist you further.

Kind Regards
Phillip Roos

            <p>Taking an action on a worksheet using VBA clears the undo stack. &nbsp;So, every time you enter a value in that sheet, your code is taking an action - putting in the date / time stamp in column B.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could keep track of all the old values on another sheet - a bit of a pain, and it can be buggy, but it can be done: &nbsp;&nbsp;John Walkenbach has example code and a power utility that offers it, IIRC. &nbsp;You just need to decide if having the date/time stamp in
 column B is worth not having undo available, or if adding in some level of undo is worth the added complexity.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 OneNote appeared to be signed in but actually wasn&#39;t, no idea where it was saving data, and I&#39;ve now lost 2.5&#43; months of notes.</h2>
                    <p>I was upgraded to Microsoft Windows 10 in mid-February 2019, and prior to that I was using OneNote 2016 without issue.&nbsp; When I started using the Windows 10 OneNote, I routinely tried to sign in using my work email account (only Microsoft account I have)
 but it constantly said "Needs Attention" even after I attempted to "Fix."&nbsp; I figured it was syncing just fine to wherever it was (had the Sync Automatically feature enabled) since I closed OneNote and logged off the system nightly and every morning my notes
 would be there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, 4/30/2019, I was taking notes on a call and copying/pasting screenshots of slides into one of my Notebook pages when it started to crash the Windows 10 OneNote app.&nbsp; Every time I would Ctrl+V, it would crash - this happened at least 3 times.&nbsp;
 Then OneNote finally came back up saying it was having Sync issues and could not sync my Notebooks, and reverted to a OneNote 2016 version saved to my local drive that was from February 2019 (presumably when I switched from OneNote 2016 to Windows 10 OneNote
 app).&nbsp; I checked my OneDrive, and it is the "new" old February 2019 version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also cannot even create a new Notebook in Windows 10 OneNote now - it appears to create the notebook then nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have lost critical data and notes that I cannot replicate, nor do I understand what happened or where Windows 10 OneNote was saving my data all this time.&nbsp; The IT techs at my company admitted that they have little experience with OneNote thus I have Googled
 every possible question (the only Backup files are from mid-February, tried copying/pasting the AppData/Local/Packages back to AppData/Local/Microsoft/OneNote/16.0 location) and resolution to no avail.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I am at a loss and don't understand where it was saving my data nightly in order for it to *poof* vanish.&nbsp; I appreciate any ideas whilst I lament my lost notes.</p>

<p>Hi Sheibult,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenience and trouble caused by the issue, I fully understand the frustration about it and understand the notes are important to you.</p>
<p>It seems your stored the notebook in OneDrive, since the OneDrive restore feature can only restore the notes within one month, I'm afraid the notes are lost, really sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description, the root cause of the sync issue and notes disappeared issue should be "it constantly said "Needs Attention" even after I attempted to "Fix."". It may have the risk
 to cause notes loss, it would be better if you back up your notes when it happens at the first time and try fixing it.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the sync issue still occurs now and you cannot even create new notebooks in OneNote for Windows 10, I'd like to help you do troubleshooting. You may try following to see the outcome:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Sign out and close OneNote application. Go to Windows settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps &amp; features&gt;find
<p>2.After repair, OneNote will reopen, please sign in and check if you can create new notebook and check if the sync issue still happens.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the sync issue remains, please share with us information below for further troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.A screenshot about "When I started using the Windows 10 OneNote, I routinely tried to sign in using my work email account (only Microsoft account I have) but it constantly said "Needs
 Attention" ".</p>
<p>2.Your OneNote version. (check it from the 3 dots in upper-right corner&gt;Settings&gt;About)</p>
<p><span>3.Which account do you use to sign in OneNote? Work or school account that you use to
</span><a href="http://portal.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>sign in Office 365 portal</span></a><span>?</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<p>Hi Tina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I attempted to follow your troubleshooting steps above, but the OneNote App has "Move" and "Uninstall" blurred out under Apps&gt;Apps &amp; Features and does not allow me to click on "Advanced Options" (it's not even a visible option)
 - see below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a79aeb4-494c-47e4-be18-0a86ce5e6b20?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a79aeb4-494c-47e4-be18-0a86ce5e6b20?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are the requested screenshots, and I use my work email to sign into OneDrive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I am thinking my OneDrive wasn't configured/account mapped correctly and OneNote 10 App was syncing to an old OneDrive account that I can no longer access (far stretch, but I can't imagine my notes for 2.5 months were never syncing to somewhere,
 they always were there the next day when I restarted OneNote).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help me here, my IT department has pretty much given up but I refuse to do so until I've exhausted every option.&nbsp; Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi Sheibult,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your update. I could understand your concern, </span><span>I'd like to share with you information below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the notes haven't been synced to OneNote online, I'm afraid they cannot be found now.
</p>
<p><span>OneNote for Windows 10 only supports cloud-based notebooks(saved in OneDrive for business or personal OneDrive), so when sync issue happens, the best practise is to backup the notes which haven</span><span>’</span><span>t been synced to OneNote online,
 or manually copy and paste the unsynced notes to OneNote online, ensure they appear in OneNote online, then reopen the notebook from OneNote online to OneNote desktop app. This would help to prevent this notes loss issue
</span><span>from </span><span>happening.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If there was a time that the notes synced to OneNote online, you may use the OneDive restore feature,
</span><span>try restoring OneDrive to a previous version and see if you can find a previous version of notebook which contain the
</span><span>notes</span><span> you need.</span><span> </span><span style="font-weight: bold">However</span><span>, as I mentioned before,
<strong>this feature only supports one month restore</strong>, it cannot get all notes in 2.5 months. Really sorry about this.
</span></p>
<p><span>Reference: </span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/restore-your-onedrive-fa231298-759d-41cf-bcd0-25ac53eb8a15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Restore your OneDrive</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;
</span>(</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span><span>: back up other files you have created after the time you want to restore.)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the account Need Attention issue in OneNote for Windows 10, please make sure you can access your OneDrive for business on the web. You may try following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1</span><span>.Go to Windows Settings&gt;Accounts&gt;Access work or school&gt;click the work or school account</span><span> you are using</span><span>&gt;</span><span>click
</span><span>Disconnect.</span></p>
<p><span>2</span><span>.Then open OneNote, sign in your </span><span>work or school</span><span> account, see if you can create new notebooks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Tina</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since I am on my work account and all other O365 programs are connected to it, I did not want to disrupt the sync for any of those (they seem to be okay...).&nbsp; I've switched over to EverNote, and I appreciate your guidance to try and fix my issues.&nbsp; Thank

<h2>            Someone called and claimed to be from &#34;Windows Tech Team&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>First time poster. Hope you can help me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received an unsual call from people claiming to be from "Windows Tech Team" saying my computer had downloaded malcilous files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I questioned why they would call and not email me etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I won't go into the detail of the call but these things haopend:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. They gave me a CLS ID number. They said this would match the one on my computer and this was verification of the genuiness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. In the run box, they asked me to type "cmd" and oress enter. This took me to a long list with tbe CLS number showing and matching what they gave.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Closed down the box and this time they wanted me to enter "evenpvwr". Although I typed it out, I did not press ok as it just felt wrong. It was at this point that I said I was uncomfortable going any fhrther. A "senior technician" then came on the phone
 to persuade me to carry on. He then got aggressive when I said no so I hung up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate I ran "cmd" but given I did not run "evenpvwr", I assume they could not have got access to my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may follow these steps and check if you can open the Formatting Task Pane:</p>
<p>Click on Axis, on the ribbon click Format.</p>
<p>Click Format Selection and check if the formatting task pane opens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, then you may open Excel in its application safe and check if the issue occurs:</p>
<p>Click <span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span>, go to <span style="font-weight: bold">
Programs,</span> go to <span style="font-weight: bold">Accessories</span>, click <span style="font-weight: bold">
Run</span>, type <span style="font-weight: bold">excel /safe.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong> There is a space between<span style="font-weight: bold"> excel
</span>and<span style="font-weight: bold"> /</span></span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the application works fine safe mode, try disabling the add ins for the application and check the result,</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Click the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">File</span><span> tab.</span>
</li><li><span>Go to </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Options.</span> </li><li><span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Add-ins.</span> </li><li><span>Clear all the options.</span>&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>If the above steps does not help, then you may repair Office 2013 following the steps from the article below:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2822317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2822317</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that still does not help, then change the default printer to Microsoft XPS Document Writer/OneNote following the steps from the link below:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-default-printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-default-printer</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are able to print properly on Microsoft XPS Document Writer or OneNote, then you may have to update your printer drivers or contact the printer manufacturer for further assistance.</p>

    <title>Contact appears to be forever linked to a group - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertaforester  say:</h3>
<h2>            Contact appears to be forever linked to a group</h2>
                    I have a specific contact that always shows "not online" when I try to call. He can be contacted from other accounts, so I do not believe the problem is on his end. I notice that when his contact comes up in the main screen, there is another name under
 his (a name that I know). I believe the problem may be that Skype thinks this is a group address, but it is not and I cannot figure out how to clear this. This may be a residual from a group made a long time ago. Deleting his contact and refinding it does
 not clear the problem. Help?

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7e8abe73-bbf0-43b8-92e1-9811e1bf92a2" title="RobertaForester">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the prompt reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For you to verify if that contact is blocked. You just have to open your&nbsp;Skype app. Click on the triple dots icon<strong> ( . . . )
</strong>beside your Profile Photo and choose on <strong>Settings</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Under the<strong> Contacts </strong>Section, choose <strong>Blocked Contacts </strong>
and you should be able to see a list of your contacts whose currently blocked and an
<strong>Unblock</strong> button beside each. If you don't see that contact being blocked on your end. I would suggest to let them know the steps on how they can check their account if they had blocked yours.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have further inquiries. </p>

            <p>Hi Dimitri Stephan</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting on the forum. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the files are MP3 they should show up on the Xbox Music app normally. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Try a soft reset to "update" the phone connections (it does not erase any content): you just need to press and hold the power+volume down buttons at the same time until the phone restarts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists after that, try to sync the music in a different way (try different music from different sources, different pc or device from where you take the music, etc.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, </p>
<p>

<h2>            How can I edit a Contact Group name in outlook.com&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Someone asked this same Question at <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/opeople-ocontacts/how-can-i-edit-groups-in-outlookcom-i-find-only/b2ef36a3-b7e0-4bbe-aae8-150966148d26">

</p>
<p>This "Answer" says "Outlook.com lets you edit, add, delete and rename groups. This functionality is called "Manage Groups" and can be accessed from the "Manage" drop down menu in the header when on the
<a href="http://mail.live.com/mail/contacts.mvc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">People page</span></a>."
</p>
<p>But all I see is:</p>
<ul>
<li>ADD PEOPLE</li><li>CLEAN UP CONTACTS</li><li>RESTORE DELETED CONTACTS</li><li>EXPORT FOR OUTLOOK.COM AND OTHER SERVICES</li><li>EXPORT FOR OUTLOOK 2010 AND OUTLOOK 2013</li></ul>

<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>I just solved it myself and it wasn't as that other page had described. The trick was to go to the People page and then highlight the Group name in the column on the left where it is mixed in with the Contacts. THEN you can click on EDIT and the name can
 be edited.</p>

<h2>            Changing Verified Network</h2>
                    
<p>I was invited to join a Yammer Network. &nbsp;However, when I look in my profile I see that this Network is shown as an "External Network" and that my "Verified Network" is a completely different Network that I did not want to join. &nbsp;I would like to delete this
 "Verified Network" and change my current "external Network" to be my main / verified network. &nbsp;However, there doesn't seem to be a way to do this. &nbsp;So can somebody please tell me if this is possible and if so how do I go about making this change?</p>

            This is true. There is not a "More Mail Settings" link or anything under the gear. I have been having this issue for over a month of my emails disappearing, it's getting frustrating because I have had this email account for over 15 years and don't want
 to have to go through the work of changing email accounts.

    <title>Open letter to Microsoft regarding Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Open letter to Microsoft regarding Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've included a letter I just sent to Steve Ballmer and Joe Belfiore highlighting some key points I think could greatly improve some of our problems with Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8. I would greatly appreciate it if everyone would raise the status of this
 comment. I feel that if this letter gets enough attention, there could certainly be some improvements to our situation. I realize the forum may not be perfect for this, but I figured it was worth a shot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Ballmer and Mr. Belfiore,</p>
<p>First off, I'd like to take the opportunity to thank you for reading this e-mail. I realize that you are quite busy and I'm sure that you get thousands of e-mails each day, so thank you for taking the time to read mine.</p>
<p>If I may, I'd like to give you a little background on myself. My name is Bill and I'm currently a graduate student. My area of study is in a field called Human Factors, which encompasses areas of user experience, interface design, design intuitiveness, which
 I'm sure you would agree are key points that Microsoft has been focusing on with the introduction of Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8. While I don't consider myself a UX professional, at least not yet, I do consider myself as someone who is well-informed when
 it comes to technology, and personally, I've been a big champion of Microsoft and the recent changes Microsoft has made to head in a brand new direction. In fact, I'm so much of a champion that I've ditched my iPhone for a Lumia 920, upgraded my laptop to
 Windows 8 the day it came out, and ditched Gmail for the new Outlook.com.</p>
<p>If I may, I'd like to offer you 4 key things you could do that would greatly improve the experience on Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8. Make no mistake about it, I think the software is a great start, but I think they need work, and I feel that these points
 would certainly address some of the issues.</p>
<p>1. Please unite Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8. Currently, the 2 devices are almost totally segregated, with no real means to sync the data on a computer to a phone. The Windows Phone app, while fairly attractive, is just not as functional as it needs to
 be. I hate to name-drop other products, but what will convert people to Windows Phone is an experience similar to or better than that of Apple, where changes made on the PC sync to the phone, and changes to the phone sync to the PC. Currently, this doesn't
 exist, and it's really frustrating the Windows Phone faithful, particularly those that previously used Windows Phone 7 or the Zune Software.</p>
<p>2. Empower Windows 8 apps, don't cripple them. It seems clear to me that the Xbox Music app on W8 is designed to be the absolute media hub on Windows. But an absolute media hub requires that the software be full-functioned. While I understand that it is
 very early in the app's life, and that more changes are coming, to be unable to add/remove or change song information, as well as album artwork makes the software feel less like something I want to use, and more like something I'm forced to accept. Similarly,
 echoing my first point, translate the beautiful look and feel of Xbox Music to WP8. Why is it that the song info and album artwork that I have set up in Xbox Music on my computer don't translate to my phone? When Xbox Music has the properly specified album
 artwork and artist information, it is the most beautiful music app out there. But that app must be powerful and consistent, not just beautiful. The same goes for the Calendar app. I should be able to manage my calendars from the app, not from the Windows Live
 website. I understand that again, a transition process is in play here, but you want people to want to use W8 apps for their beauty and their features. Right now, Microsoft's focus comes off as being more about beauty and less about features.</p>
<p>3. Teach Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 what the word “sync” really means. Too many times I've noticed throughout using WP8 and W8 that the software doesn't pick up on changes the user makes. For example, when I delete or move pictures in the Pictures app
 on W8, for days, those thumbnails still persist, with the app failing to show the appropriate contents of the photo library. The same thing occurs with Xbox Music, where songs just don’t show up, regardless of being located in the library. These apps should
 always poll their library’s contents every time the app is opened and closed, constantly updating the index with the most recent information. In essence, there should always be a refresh command that is executed every time an app is opened or closed. This
 same “refresh” behavior should be in apps like the Mail app in WP8. It shouldn’t be the case that when I read an e-mail, I need to press the “Sync” charm before I delete it in order for the e-mail to not be marked as “unread” when it’s in the trash. Similarly,
 when I delete an e-mail, I shouldn’t have to press the “Sync” charm in order for that e-mail to be placed in the trash in Windows 8’s Mail app. Every action in mail, be it reading, deleting, moving, or marking, should instantly transmit a “Sync” command so
 that the server and all the clients have up-to-date information, and that when new actions are performed, the clients know to refresh themselves and reflect the most current information. Even the lock-screen background on Windows Phone 8 could use this. When
 you update the Bing photo of the day, if my lock photo is a photo of Bing, the user should have the option to have that background change every day, or stay the same. These are small touches that I know would greatly improve the experience of both Windows
 8 and Windows Phone 8. Leverage the speed that both of these software programs have, don’t slow things down my making users press and “Sync” charm and wait for things to update.
</p>
<p>4. Focus on the little things even more. So many things about W8 and WP8 that make it great are the little touches, like customizing the menus in apps and eliminating some of the fiddly parts of apps in lieu of cleaner designs. Personally, I don't think
 anyone can argue about abolishing the right-click menu in W8 apps. The solution for allowing the camera app to pull other apps into the app and use their specific functions using Lenses is downright elegant. And coming from an iPhone, I can't tell you how
 much I appreciate a keyboard that offers appropriate suggestions and lets you teach it words, instead of constantly just changing things around. But there are so many little touches that are missing, as well, and in most cases, people notice the have-nots
 more than the haves. Why is there no support for a picture password on WP8, particularly when that's such an emphasized feature in Windows 8 advertising? Why, when entering advanced information, into an e-mail account, is there no option to specify a port?
 (Yes, I realize that adding ":587" etc. at the end of a server solves that issue, but most people don't.) Why is there no shortcut to go to the top of a webpage, like tapping at the top of the screen? Why does the menu bar at the top disappear when certain
 apps are opened, or why don't I have the option to keep that status information present at all times? Why doesn't the Mail app allow me to select what address to use when replying when I have a linked account, or at least understand where an e-mail was sent
 to and pick the appropriate address automatically? Why is there no week view for Calendar? Why is there no global search on the phone? Why can't I highlight specific characters in a word, or cut words? Why isn't there undo or redo functionality when typing?
 Why does highlighting text seem so finicky in general? These are relatively simple changes, but ones that would improve usability to such a degree that competitors like Apple and Android would have no advantage over you.</p>
<p>Make no mistake about it, I'm thrilled with the direction Microsoft is heading in, and I'm happy with my purchases, but as the 3rd phone ecosystem, Windows should find its niche, and then capitalize on it. You currently have an ease of use that's close to
 Apple, with a customizability that's slightly less than Android. You can absolutely thrive in that space. I don't need 1800 widgets and be susceptible to viruses to have a good phone, and I don't need a phone that is boring, restrictive, and who's yearly improvement
 centers around a better camera and a loyalty card holder. I love what WP8 does. I love being able to use a true version of Office on my phone (which I used to write this e-mail). I love living in a Microsoft ecosystem with Skydrive, W8, and all the Xbox extensions
 that are currently developing. But the major selling point to consumers will be if the user experience from WP8 is truly a no-compromise solution (excluding the app selection). If it is, then people will be attracted to the hardware, speed, and ecosystem that
 WP8 offers, which is something that Android can't offer, and up to this point, Apple hasn't been able to offer.</p>
<p>I really hope that this e-mail will not fall on deaf ears. I hope that my feedback is constructive and that it will help improve the overall experience of the new direction Microsoft is taking. Please, if you have any questions or would care to talk, feel
 free to contact me. I look forward to seeing Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 improve.</p>

            I couldn't agree more. I was an early adapter of Windows 8 and I am a big fan of the OS but i find the lack of compatibility that WP8 and W8 share a very frustrating situation. At this point my Thunderbolt was much more compatible with Windows than my
 Windows phone is. I am having difficulty finding an app that allows me to stream the media from my WHS 2011 (or any other Windows PC) to my WP8 yet with android apps like Skifta I had complete control of my Media both at home and on the road but with WP8 I
 have to move things to skydrive and download them onto a phone without expandable storage instead of simply streaming them. I figured on a lot better experience I had even hoped to be able to play media from my WMP remotely like I can with W8 or W7 computers.
 Since the ecosystem is just starting I am trying to patiently give it time for apps that allow me to use my devices together to be developed but it is hard when just a week ago I had while not seamless integration at least some level of integration.&nbsp;

            Thanks Derek. Be sure to keep pushing this letter to friends or other users. The more people we get to see it, the more we may be able to get Microsoft to hear our issues. I have faith they'll get things fixed, but they'll never know what to fix if they
 don't hear from the masses.

            Couldn't agree more. I just sent a long email to them I am so frustrated and pissed off with sync not available . It literally has been a disaster. Hope I get solution soon or else I am surely giving up.

<p>From what I understand there is some long term goal to unit the two systems. Windows Phone 8 was a step in that direction with the phone and the desktop finally being based on the same code (in the kernel). &nbsp;Prior to the Windows Phone 8 release Microsoft
 also released the Skydrive SDK to allow developers that are making applications for the phone and the PC to have a method of saving data in a manner that will be available to a user on all their devices. Though here they didn't limit functionality to Microsoft
 systems. If a developer also wanted their Android or iOS device to be able to sync content over Skydrive support for this is available too. &nbsp;Skydrive is a part of a larger cloud strategy that among other things has the goal of allowing users to migrate from
 system to system and take their content with them.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Joel, that's excellent, and I agree, it is apparent that the use of a single kernel is designed to help simplify all their devices from a security, usability, and maintenance standpoint. Specifically though, I was referring to "unify" in your quote with
 regard to the fact that WP8, while a Microsoft product, still feels like a foreign entity in the Windows ecosystem. Non-existent sync support and poor media management make Windows Phone 8 feel like some ancillary product that carries the Windows name. Purchasing
 an iPhone can be a literal extension of all of your media to your device. Just plug it in and go. The iPhone and computer sync with one another. WP8 doesn't feel like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My feeling was, Microsoft should want to encourage people to pick up and grab a Microsoft phone for, if nothing else, the extremely deep integration that it can offer with the rest of Windows. That is my complaints, which seem to be echoed by&nbsp;a large number
 of people who bought a WP8. </p>

<p>All, just to let you know, I also submitted these ideas to Joe Belfiore via Twitter in the hopes that these get added sometime soon to WP8, as well. In my opinion, these are features that WP8
 is missing that would really level the playing field with regard to iOS and Android.</p>

            I'd been toying with switching to a macbook air and have phone and computer more easily sync<br />
then tried windows 8, really liked it so decided to change to a windows 8 phone.&nbsp; logical right?<br />
<br />
Imagine the disappointment with all the items you mention above.&nbsp; and the very basic things I cannot do, like look at my calendar in week view-seriously, this is simply a basic need for those who have more than one thing going on in our life<br />
<br />
And today I received a voicemail over email, the way my co sends my messages when I am out of the office and I get a mess that says my phone cannot play.&nbsp;
<br />
I am EXTREMELY frustrated, and second guessing my decision to stick with microsoft vs. apple<br />
<br />
I'm looking online for fixes to the two issues that came up today, if any of you know how to solve let me know. but the not syncing windows 8 with a windows 8 phone is simply ridiculous.<br />

            <p>Agreed - and I would like to add a couple to this list:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;A) Use Profiles (i.e. Meeting, DoNotDisturb, Silent, Selective-user defined, etc...)</p>
<p>&nbsp;B) Use Profiles HAVE A TIMER function to revert to the "Normal" mode</p>
<p>&nbsp;C) Easier to move data (pictures, music, videos, etc.) from one classification to another</p>
<p>&nbsp;D) SORTING/Grouping/Filtering on the data content (Name, Date, Type, Tags...)</p>
<p>&nbsp;E) "Page" advance - the list of items gets rather long to constantly scroll</p>

            <p>After using WP8 and W8 now since release (well, W8 since relase of the realease preview), I can not tell you, how right you are with your letter!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One more thing though:</p>
<p>My first enthusiasm using windows 8 has clearly diminished since I got my WP8. The reason is simple: The WP8 UI is just great. It's intuitive, logical and beautiful.</p>
<p>Apart from the Live Tiles, there is, however no connection between the 2 UIs (shure, E-Mail client has the same icons and stuff, but this is not what I am talking about).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<ul>
<li>Switching between different "parts" of an app on WP8 works by wiping left or right. Why is this not the same in W8? There you still have some buttons somewhere on the screen (as in the people hub on W8 in order to look at the news people posted on fb, twitter
 etc.)</li><li>App closing: works on W8 by wiping downwards from the screen top. Why not so on WP8?
</li><li>etc. etc.</li></ul>
<p>If the goal was really to deliver a single user experience, I think its still a long way to go.&nbsp;Other things as missing podcast support for non-us residents etc. of course are other topics in other threads that need to be fixed as well...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But still: I worked with every major competitors OS and would never&nbsp;switch back, not on the mobile nor on my laptop.&nbsp; Just keep on improving :-D</p>

            If you double tap the shift key (up-arrow) while typing, it locks caps. So that's already there. However, as for the rest of the features, +1!!

                    Very frustrating efforts to sign in to Microsoft Office that I just bought.&nbsp; I keep getting messages that there is no account associated for my e-mail that I used to purchase it.

 info.</p>

<h2>            Can you merge a Skype account with a Microsoft account&#63;</h2>
                    I have an old Skype account that isn't linked to my outlook account, but my&nbsp;outlook account is already linked to Skype. Is it possible to merge the two accounts?

            My sincere apologies. Merging of 2 Skype accounts is not possible. 
<br />
<br />However, if you want to continue with only one account, you can transfer Skype Credits and Contacts to your other account so that credits are not wasted and contacts are not lost.
<br />
<br />Transfer Skype Credits through Gifting

<br />

<br />
<br />Optionally, if you want to close an account after the required transfer but if this is attached to a Microsoft account, then Microsoft account will also get closed which has its own ramifications.

<h2>            How do I move all my emails from my POP folder back to my Inbox</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>All my emails, going back over 10 years, got sent to my Gmail account when I tried to link the two accounts from Gmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my Outlook account, these emails got put in the 'POP' folder in the 'Deleted' folder. I understand what the POP folder is but I want my emails to appear in my Inbox, not the POP folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get all my emails from the POP folder to my Inbox? At the moment when I 'Select All Emails', the 'Move To' dropdown options disappear, presumably because I have highlighted over 1500 emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know how I can move all my emails to my actual Inbox and stop my account from using the POP folder?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've unlinked Gmail from my Outlook account anyway. All I want is for my Inbox to work how it used to.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's possible that there is an Inbox rule set up on your account that is filtering your new emails to be redirected to your deleted folder. First, make sure this setting is not set up on your account so that your incoming emails will not be routed on a different
 folder. We see that you tagged your post under <strong>Outlook.com</strong>. Just for clarification, how do you manage your emails? Are you using the
<strong>Outlook desktop app</strong>, the <strong>Outlook Mobile app</strong>, or the
<strong>Outlook website</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To organize your messages on the Outlook website, check this <em><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Organize-your-Inbox-with-Archive-Sweep-and-other-tools-in-Outlook-com-19eee6b9-09a1-4db6-b5d6-37644190884f?appver=OWC150" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support
 article</a></strong></em>. Go to the section: <strong>Move to</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the Outlook desktop app, refer to <em><strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/move-or-copy-an-item-to-another-folder-19768dfe-86c4-40bf-b82c-1c084b624492" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Move or copy an item to another folder</a></strong></em>

<p>Hi Amylove,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using both the Outlook website and the Outlook Android app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The inbox is no longer sending my emails to the 'Deleted' folder. All new emails now get sent directly to my inbox, which is what I want. But this was not my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that I still have over 15,000 emails in a folder called 'POP' which is a sub-folder in my inbox. How do I move all of these from the 'POP' folder to my inbox?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tick the 'Everything in this folder is selected' box, the 'Move To' dropdown option on the Menu bar disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c879f8f1-635c-48a6-8a76-86c4972f7d19?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c879f8f1-635c-48a6-8a76-86c4972f7d19?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am worried that over 15,000 of my emails that are sitting in my 'POP' folder will be deleted by Outlook. Can you guarantee that this will not happen?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>POP downloads email from the server then deletes it. The downloaded emails will be accessible using the same device only. If you try to access the emails from a different device, the messages that have been previously downloaded won't be available on that
 device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
