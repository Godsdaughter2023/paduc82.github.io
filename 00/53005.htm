<h2>            Some DVDs show as blank after upgrade to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 prevents some DVDs from being read, they show as blank.<br />
Some DVDs show as blank after upgrade to windows 10</p>
<p>This is 100% the operating system, NOT a hardware problem.</p>
<p>This is a purchased disc,&nbsp;NOT a writable disc that was burned on a burner.</p>
<p>(It is a school lesson video)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the facts </p>
<p>Computer read a specific DVD with video content fine, played the video and shows in explorer with folders for video/audio content.</p>
<p>EXACT same hardware was upgraded to Windows 10, explorer shows blank disk for the same DVD.</p>
<p>Computer reads, writes, and plays video on some discs fine, others appear blank.</p>
<p>With some discs (including writeable, rewriteable, and pressed discs) all functions work (of course you can't burn a pressed disc), it seems EXTREMELY unlikely to be a hardware or driver failure.</p>
<p>THE ONLY VARIABLE IS WINDOWS 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second computer EXACT SAME RESULTS! Totally eliminating all variables except windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same disk on 2 other windows 10 computers appears blank, both computers read, write and play some discs.</p>
<p>Same disk on 3 other windows 7 computers shows content in explorer and video plays!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly something about Windows 10 prevents reading certain DVDs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide a solution (hopefully not to abandon Windows 10), I have a classroom of computers that are useless due to Windows 10!<br />

            <p>Install some third party burning software and you'll get DirectPlay Windows feature and</p>

<p>I tested all three from the list and Ashampoo is fine from my opinion. </p>
<p>To prevent misunderstanding it would be good to give information of version Windows 10.</p>
<p>In command prompt type <strong>winver.</strong></p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply, unfortunately this isn't the issue, the issue impacts multiple versions of Windows 10, Pro on my laptop, Home on one desktop, and pro on another desktop.<br />
<br />
This is NOT about DirectPlay, which can be downloaded directly from Microsoft without other software as a windows feature.<br />
<br />
DirectPlay would impact viewing almost any movie via a movie player, these computers easily play other movies, even purchased commercial movie DVDs.<br />
This is about Windows 10 and how it reads the contents of a DVD at the drive level, since the operating system shows the disc as blank, when a video can't play, the operating system does not show a blank disc, it just can't play the video (due to encryption,
 lack of DirectPlay etc).</p>
<p>Some security leaves empty sectors on discs and this appears to be such a scheme. I've seen similar before, however the disc still showed content in Explorer, these do not. (And it isn't one disc, a whole set that play fine on other PCs.)</p>

            <p>I agree with your arguments, but I experienced same issues &nbsp;with my Samsung DVD drive.</p>
<p>After installing few apps,&nbsp;for burning, for playing movies, my DVD drive read DVD movies (original disk).</p>
<p>And, more important for me, now I can burn different disks even with WMP.</p>

            This did not help at all. I installed Ashampoo and DVDs <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
still</span> show as empty, even though they are purchased official SW distribution DVDs that show all files on a Windows 7 system. Even a Microsoft Office DVD appears empty and just shows a "desktop.ini" file waiting to be burned to disk.<br />

            <p>In some cases help to clean laser.</p>
<p>On other hand&nbsp;it would be good to check&nbsp;are all drivers&nbsp;installed&nbsp;eg. chipset,&nbsp;SM bus controller,</p>
<p>and similar.&nbsp;To see it&nbsp;right click on Start and open Device Manager and check are there some yellow</p>
<p>or red marks. In that list expand System Devices, therefore some&nbsp;others too.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply, but I feel pretty sure it is a Windows 10 problem, and not the hardware. All drivers are up-to-date, and no alerts appear in Device Manager. The DVD contents appear when I run in Safe mode, but not in normal Windows 10's File Explorer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The DVDs all work as they should in a Windows 7 laptop, but I get the same problem when they are inserted into my wife's Windows 10 system.<br />

            <p>I hope you not use some third-party antivirus software, cause you say that issue is&nbsp;gone in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am&nbsp;working with at least 8 computers, some of those computers are multi-boot&nbsp;Windows 7&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;10,</p>
<p>or Windows 8.1&nbsp;&amp; 10. They are&nbsp;all with Windows 10,&nbsp;different versions, Home, Pro, Enterprise, and</p>
<p>released preview (build 15019) and two laptops have 32-bit version of Windows 10 Home.</p>
<p>On the end, all that computers have different DVD drives, Samsung, Sony, Pioneer, NEC Optiarc,&nbsp;Liteon,</p>
<p>LG...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can you do more. Check&nbsp;windows for errors.</p>
<p>First scan C partition for errors.</p>
<p>Second,&nbsp;open command prompt as administrator and run <strong>Sfc scannow,&nbsp;</strong>when the job is finished</p>
<p>restart computer.</p>
<p>Try to read the DVD.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Your CD-R or CD-RW drive may busy performing another operations. Wait for the drive to complete its current task, and then try again.</p>
<p>If it's something you downloaded, it may be copy protected by DRM, in which case you cannot burn it to a CD or DVD.</p>
<p>Stop all other programs that are running.</p>
<p>Try burning a different file types and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>If you have any third party burning software, I'd suggest you temporarily <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
uninstall</a> <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a>it and then try burning the disc using Windows Media Player.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Reinstall the software after the test.</p>

<p>I've done all the possible fixes. 0xC0aa0301 is one of the MANY undocumented error codes that Microsoft support personnel always think are user error, hardware error, or anything but a Microsoft issue.</p>
<p>In this case, I've reviewed a dozen threads related to this issue, and M$ always spouts the same garbage, even though some of them specifically state that the CD will burn under XP or Vista, but NOT when running Windows 7.</p>
<p>&lt;Sarcasm&gt;So obviously, the problem has nothing to do with Windows 7&lt;/sarcasm&gt;</p>

            I have this problem too and it seems to have started after their last big update. I used to be able to burn using Zune and can now STILL burn using windows media player, too bad most of my new music is purchased through Zune and now I can't burn it onto
 a CD.

            Well this is a the most Vague response I ever read from pure technical stand point of view..
<br />
I have faced the exact same issue.. There is a bug in the internal windows 7 CD/DVD burner software , which just randomly gives this error
<br />
<br />
solution: Do not use this CD/DVD burn engine.. Download the following one from Cnet web site
<br />
<br />
Product name : "Active @ISO burner"<br />
<br />
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/Active-ISO-Burner/3000-2646_4-10602452.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.cnet.com/Active-ISO-Burner/3000-2646_4-10602452.html</a><br />
<br />
I have used it, and it works great (the same Drive, Same DVD type/manufacturer) only difference is the software..
<br />

<h2>            Call of duty&#58; Black ops 1 controller question</h2>
                    
<p>I was wondering.. What is your controller set up? Im using a regular Xbox controller but when I snipe on COD:BO, it's hard to aim. Does anybody know a good setting for game defaults thats really good for a sniper? Can you maybe post your gaming defaults
 for me to try? I'm just tired of moving it to the right or left and 5-10 seconds to aim but when I put 11 sensitivity, it's barely budging..</p>

<p>
</p><p>After making the change described in this post WMDC is able to start, but I am not able to connect my device to my PC with WMDC installed. I see the "Connecting" and "User Authenticated" messages on the device, but WMDC never shows "Connecting" or "Connected"
 and sits at "Not Connected". I hear the hardware add and remove sounds when cradling and uncradling the device</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, on another PC with Win10 N Creators update, (which did not have WMDC on it before the update) I am not able to install WMDC at all as I receive the error: The update could not be installed because at least one Windows component required by Windows
 Mobile Device Center is missing.</p>

<p>Whenever you unlock a Gamer Picture via a specific achievement, or otherwise, you don't need to go into the Avatar Editor to change to it. You would only need to go into the editor if you unlock a certain avatar reward like some games offer such as Mass
 Effect 3 for example where you complete a specific thing and you unlock something like a helmet for example that you can then equip on your Avatar.<br />
<br />
To change your gamer picture though just press your Xbox Guide button, scroll to the Settings pane on the far right, click Profile, then Edit Profile and you should see Gamer Picture. It will list
<em>Change Gamer Picture</em> and<em> Change Personal Picture</em>, the difference between the two is changing the personal picture only changes what you and your friends see and everyone else doesn't. So if you want to display a picture that is visible to
 anyone who views your profile or otherwise then you just click the top<em> Change Gamer Picture</em>.<br />
<br />
You can also just scroll to the far right when you're on the Dashboard to the Settings section and then click Profile, it accomplishes and goes to the same thing.<br />
<br />
Once you've done either you can just scroll to the Saren portrait that you unlocked for completing Mass Effect 1 on Hardcore and it'll be done.<br />
<br />
Of note and just for future reference in case you might wonder, once you beat Mass Effect 1 on Insanity then you will unlock
<a href="http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080305200916/masseffect/images/e/eb/N7insanity.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a> N7 picture.<br />
<br />
<em>(Hopefully that wasn't too confusing, it's actually pretty simple to change pictures but figured I'd explain more just in case)&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Why didn't more games do this? &nbsp; Plus, unlike avatar awards you had to do something challenging, most avatar awards are given for minute things like progressing through the game.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>With the rise in the avatar awards it'd be nice if devs also let you unlock gamer pics for those of us who prefer them.</p>

<p>Yeah I've always wondered the same Payton. But I just boil it down to something developers,
<em>or whomever goes about working on something like that</em>, obviously view that sort of reward system as a last minute thing as it's certainly not something crucial to the development process, as Avatar Awards and Gamer Pictures are just added bonuses for
 doing anything from something challenging to something so completely minute like you said.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed unlocking Saren and the N7 picture for completing Mass Effect 1 on Hardcore &amp; Insanity respectively.<br />
<br />
It was like a sense of accomplishment especially after Insanity as it wasn't a walk in the park even with a level 60 character with Spectre X weapons, and Colossus X Heavy Armor for example.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I would much rather get a gamer picture unlock than an Avatar Award any day. It's a cool rewarding system for some games out there but most of the awards you get either look really weird on your Avatar because the helmets are abnormally huge, or
 they're just silly imo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I personally wouldn't care either way whether games give out avatar awards or not, because as you said so few of them already do and most of the time when they do they're extremely silly like I mentioned before. Not all of them of course, some are decent
 but most aren't.<br />
<br />
As for your other point, that's very true especially nowadays. As long as the industry can make a quick buck even if on something so completely minimal that should probably be free, they will do it.<br />
<br />
Just the fact of the matter no matter how much I may dislike the trend, can't really do anything about it.</p>

<p>I liked the achievements in Mass Effect 1 as well because there was a point to going after them rather than just a few gamerscore.</p>

<p>Getting that achievements improved your stats or let you assign weapons or powers to other classes. It's a shame that even Bioware stopped doing that.</p>

<p>Yeah I liked that too because it added extra "perks" or so to speak to the game itself that opened up different ways of playing.<br />
<br />
Achievements from ME 1 didn't just mean, "<em>Oh look 25 Gs, cool, on to the next one</em>!", you were actually rewarded in subsequent playthroughs by the various bonuses that you got from the achievements. Thus making them actually worthwhile to not only just
 achieve them but care about getting them too.</p>

<p>Hello. I noticed this thread hasn't been touched in a very long time but I was wondering if you can re-earn the saren and n7 picture. I lost mine many years ago and recently want to get it back. I know if I delete my game history I can re-earn them like
 it was the first time, &nbsp;but id rather not do that. Is it possible to use my lvl 60 character and beat the game on insanity to unlock the saren and n7 pic?</p>

                    So when I recently started up my Windows 7 Home Premium laptop, I noticed that it scheduled a disk checking sooner than usual. This scared me a little bit, but I knew that it would keep letting me know every time I started up my computer if I didn't follow
 through with it, so I went through it. I realized it was deleting significantly more than usual. like it usually deletes a few small chunks here and there, but never this much. This was deleting masses and masses of files and started to really scare me, but
 I didn't know what would happen to my PC if I just shut it down out of nervousness. Anyway, so when it finished, I logged into my user account, then everything started as usual. Long story short, I soon began to figure out that no sound was being registered
 at all in Windows and I've tried every method on the internet to fix it. Please help as soon as possible.

            <p>Who knows what might have happened to your sound but without more information you can only expect guesses and things to try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do this so we can see what you have:<br />
<br />
Click the Start button/orb in the lower-left corner of your screen. Or, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
In the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Select/click msinfo32.exe and the System Information dialog box will open.<br />
<br />
Click on System Summary, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
For audio driver information, expand the Components, click Sound Device, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.
<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now about that chkdsk that runs when Windows starts...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Assuming you did not schedule a chkdsk to run on the next reboot of your system...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When things are normal Windows will not perform a chkdsk when your system starts (it is not on a schedule to do wo) so something
<em><a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Abby%20Normal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">abby-normal</a>
</em>was detected when Windows started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Windows starts it checks the "dirty bit" on every volume (usually every hard drive) in the system and if the dirty bit is set on any volume Windows will automatically run a chkdsk with error correction on the volume to try to clear the dirty bit.&nbsp; A
 clean run of chkdsk with error correction is the only thing that can clear the dirty bit on a volume so if you don't let it run and do its thing, the chkdsk is going to run again the next time Windows restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A volume can be marked dirty from things like an aborted restart, improper shutdown, power interruption, using the reset or power button, battery pulling, etc.&nbsp; Have any of those events occurred prior to this incident?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can query the dirty bit on a volume from the Command Prompt window with Administrator privileges.<br />
<br />
Click the Start orb/button and in the box enter the following:<br />
<br />
cmd.exe<br />
<br />
Right click cmd.exe and choose to Run as Administrator:</p>
<p><br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53f3f76f-144a-4249-8435-9da688305661" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53f3f76f-144a-4249-8435-9da688305661" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To query the dirty bit on drive C, in the Command Prompt window enter the following command:<br />
<br />
fsutil&nbsp; dirty&nbsp; query&nbsp; C:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15a456dd-a17e-4661-ae0e-81b176508cc0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15a456dd-a17e-4661-ae0e-81b176508cc0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sample output should be one or the other of:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Volume C: is dirty<br />
Volume C is NOT dirty<br />
<br />
You should check each of your volumes or each of your hard drives (C, D, E, etc.).</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 desktop going to recycle</h2>
                    When I select a desktop icon and click to open it, it sending my files to the recycling bin. How do I stop this from happening?

            <p>On the desktop screen where you would find shortcuts to programs, when we click on a shortcut, it sends the shortcut to the recycle bin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not downloaded anything new in recent days. I also preformed a full virus scan which yielded no malware or viruses detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I would go to the bottom of the screen and click on the windows picture to go back to the applications page, nothing would happen. I have a touch screen monitor so I had to swipe from the left to get back to that page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read online that sometimes things happen when the delete key is stuck on the keyboard. I checked this and it did not seem to be stuck nor did it change anything. I also read that the monitor could be in tablet mode, as my kids do use it that way. (this
 computer is used primarily by my 9 and 10 year olds, with supervision for homework and gaming) I checked all of the settings and nothing helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then took the batteries out of the keyboard. We had an issue not long after purchasing this computer where the batteries were dying in the keyboard and it kept opening the help screen. We though we had some kind of virus so we brought it back to Best Buy
 and the Geek Squad determined it was not a virus but the batteries. We changed the batteries and did not have another issue. Well low and behold, I take the batteries out and it stops happening. I replaced the batteries and it has continued to work appropriately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restored all of the shortcuts back to the desktop screen and it seems to be functioning well today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I hope that my solution is the correct one and can help someone else if this should happen to them as well.</p>

    <title>Completely corrupted file associations&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> federicoolmedo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Completely corrupted file associations&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My file associations are corrupt, and pretty extensively I think. I have tried a couple of different solutions such as just setting my default programs (itunes and word don't pop up), associating a file type to a program (.docx to Word and .mp3 to iTunes),
 and setting program access and computer defaults (going to the custom tab and changing the default media player has no avail, it just changes back to the default media player immediately after clicking OK). I have even browsed for the .exe extension of each
 file extensions respective program and opened it in windows explorer and still nothing (for example WINWORD.exe for .docx files).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time I try to open up iTunes, it prompts me with the message about how it is not the default player of media files. I have even disabled the option for it to cease prompting me with the message about it not being the default player of media files and
 it still continues to do it. The same happens with Microsoft Word. Also, each time I open up word it prompts me with an installation and configuration process. After it's done, it prompts me stating that it is not the default program for viewing and editing
 documents and asks me if I would like to change it. When I click yes, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also attempted a .mp3 registry fix for my default audio player and nothing happened. I have no idea what to try for Word since I cannot find a file extension registry fix for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I just reformat?</p>

            <p>Besides doing a system restore you can try to use windows all in one repair by tweaking.com. I personally have never had an issue with it and it has fixed numerous problems on different operating systems but it is a 3rd party software and you should use
 at your own risk. One thing is make sure that you follow the steps such as running the check disk before it runs the repairs because if it cannot detect issues then it may not be able to fix them.
</p>
<p>There is a pro version but if you scroll down you will come to the free version which is available as an installer or a portable where you can just run the program. There is also a list of repairs it does.

<p>
</p><p>To be able to use the free <strong>60 minutes of free call </strong>to mobiles and landlines, you need to link your Skype Account to your Microsoft Account. Here's how:</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://office.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Sign in</span></a> to Office with your

<p>2. In&nbsp;the Services and products section, under <strong>Skype</strong>, click <strong>
Activate your Skype minutes</strong>. The activation page is displayed.</p>
<p>3. In the activation page:<br />
- If&nbsp;you already have a Skype account, select <strong>Activate </strong>and sign in to your Skype&nbsp;account.<br />
- If&nbsp;you don’t have a Skype account, click <strong>Create Skype account</strong> under
<strong>New to Skype?</strong> and follow the instructions to join Skype.</p>
<p>4. After&nbsp;you sign in to Skype, it takes a few minutes to activate your Skype minutes. When the activation is complete, the message “Your Skype minutes are ready” displays at the top of the
<strong>My Account</strong> screen.</p>

                    <p>I’m dealing with 2 problems with my HP PC, which was upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 last year. The first problem is occasional BSODs, that are fairly infrequent. These can be one or two weeks apart, with no obvious common theme besides the system
 being fairly busy at the time of the crash. The other problem relates to waking from Sleep mode. Possibly they are related, but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System:</p>
<p>HP h8-1150z</p>
<p>AMD FX(tm)-8100 Eight-Core Processor, 2800 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 8 Logical Processor(s)</p>
<p>8GB memory</p>
<p>Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. BSODs details:</p>
<p>I have placed the two most recent minidumps at the OneDrive location below, along with the outputs from Driverview and Sysinfo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran MemTest86 (all four passes) and Windows Memory diagnostics, no errors were found by either.</p>
<p>No new hardware has been installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot run Driver Verifier because it essentially bricks my system. As soon as I enable this per instructions in this forum, and reboot, Windows will not start. It crashes as soon as the Windows logo appears, then it reboots, then crashes when Windows
 starts again, and it loops like this a few times until (fortunately) the Windows Automatic Repair tool jumps in and offers a myriad of repair options. I finally figured out how to get into safe mode from this menu, and from there I could reset Driver Verifier,
 thus unbricking the PC.</p>
<p>

<p>https://1drv.ms/f/s!AqVx3MG7yzxVdqUYtjmjbl2we5U</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Return from Sleep mode issue:</p>
<p>Sometimes when waking from Sleep, the PC becomes virtually unusable for a long time, anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour. All this time the hard drive light is on solid, the mouse either does not display or it moves intermittently, and the system clock may
 not update. The screen otherwise looks "normal" meaning everything displays where I left when it went to sleep. After this variable period of intense disk activity, the system becomes usable again and everything behaves properly. However, a couple of times
 I have experienced a BSOD while the system is in this phase of intense disk activity, especially if I try to force it to do something else. I never see this sort of behavior at any other time, and booting Windows is fairly quick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried try to monitor what is hogging the hard drive by using Resource Monitor and Task Manager, but the system does really not let me do anything (nor do those windows refresh) so there is nothing to see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note: this problem after waking from Sleep does not always occur. More often it will wake up and be usable almost right away, or within a few minutes. It does seem that the longer the system has been asleep, the better the chance of the problem manifesting
 when it wakes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mention both the BSOD problem and the wake from Sleep problem in this same post, because I suppose there might be a connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any suggestions.</p>

<p>Most of the articles on the HP site are actually generic to all their desktops. I saw nothing specific to my model, at least not corresponding to my symptoms. That said, the generic suggestions given there are quite helpful and I have performed some already.
 Here's what I have done:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Created a bootable DVD containing HP Vision Hardware Diagnostics and run all their diags over several hours. This included SATA tests and memory tests. Everything passed 100%.</p>
<p>I had previously run MEMTes86 with 100% pass result.</p>
<p>I have earlier run SFC/scannow with no problems found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noted that HP says they have no Windows 10 drivers for a system this old (about 6 years), but that Microsoft drivers should work fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now performed a clean boot and have been running with that environment for a couple of days. Both my problems manifested within a day. First, resuming from one (but not all) of the Sleeps took a very long time and locked up the PC with 100% hard drive
 activity for about 15 minutes. Then everything worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another occasion, when coming out of Sleep, the system was again unusable with 100% hard drive activity, but this time after about 10 minutes it crashed. I have uploaded that mini-dump file to the existing OneDrive location:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">https://1drv.ms/f/s!AqVx3MG7yzxVdqUYtjmjbl2we5U</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
So it appears that even when running with a clean boot environment, my problems persist.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have now stripped the system down to its bare essentials hardware-wise, removing a powered USB hub and a few other peripherals including webcam, USB BT transceiver, and a USB wireless mouse transceiver.
 That configuration had been working fine for years before these problems started happening, but i'm willing to try almost anything at this point. I'll use it like this for a while and see if the same problems continue to manifest or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
I'm receptive and grateful for any further ideas. I suspect a driver.</span></p>

<p>It is good you have passed those tests. I cannot read a dump.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) Did you fresh install v.1607 or v.1703?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2)</p>
<p>(a) Type "SysInfo" into Cortana, &amp; click the best match: "System".</p>
<p>(b) Click "Advanced system settings"</p>
<p>(c) At the Hardware tab, click the "Device Installation Settings" button.</p>
<p>(d) Ensure "Yes" is selected for "...automatically download manufacturturers' apps...".</p>
<p>(c) Then, try Windows Update to see what comes in.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>(3) Update those DriverView &amp; SysInfo reports at your onedrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I expect there to be very many fewer WER (Windows Error Reporting) errors in SysInfo.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; If DriverView shows outdated drivers, it's possible to get them from the device manufacturers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(4) Does anything very bad show up in Event Viewer?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; If so, show the details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the worst I get in my own fresh install of v.1703, but all is working very well for me...</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions and for any further review/advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I did NOT fresh install Windows. I performed a clean boot (per Microsoft instructions). I am running 1607.</p>
<p>2. Already set the way you suggest.</p>
<p>3. Done and uploaded.</p>
<p>4. Nothing obviously bad that I see. When the "hang" on resume from Sleep occurs, I get a lot of timeouts but that would be expected. See below. Note, I resumed the system at 7:29AM and it immediately went into a 20 minute period of being unusable due to
 intense disk activity. It did not BSOD this time. Also note, I am running with a clean boot environment so a few things don't work (like MsiInstaller). The ESENT errors are timeouts or more accurately warnings that something has succeeded but took an abnormally
 long time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry. I have fresh install stuck on the brain, having done <em>two</em>, now, to great success. Each took about 25 minutes, &amp; lightened the load of this Dell Inspiron 3542 considerably. It is many GBs thinner. It's quicker to boot &amp; runs quick. I was asked
 for the WiFi &amp; MSFT account passwords only - not for a product key (due to my digital license). All my major Dell/Intel/Realtek drivers came in automatically during the install. Only the Dell touchpad driver had to be separately installed for its extra functionality.
 (I did lose one key on the keyboard - a stronger Airplane Mode toggle than the other methods.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My top suggestion is to do a Greg Carmack type fresh install of Win 10, v.1703 (which is what today's Media Creation Tool will deliver)...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But, instead of Greg's picture, these days you'll end up looking like this (in AOMEI Partition Assistant)...</p>

</p><p><strong>Otherwise</strong><strong>...</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Uninstall Norton anti-virus. Reinstall after a week, if still desired</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to turn into MVP Robear Dyer, aka PA Bear, (&amp; need then to periodically hibernate),
<strong>but </strong>I'm sure his top advice would be to uninstall Norton &amp; <em>also
</em>run its removal/clean-up utility available at its site. Let Windows Defender activate, &amp; try it for a week. If unhappy, go ahead &amp; reinstall Norton. (I reluctantly did this with McAfee &amp; was happy enough never to reinstall it. I discovered during the uninstall
 that it hadn't actually fully survived the initial Win 8.1 &gt; Win 10 (build 10240) upgrade. It wasn't updating its definitions, that I could see.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Uninstall &amp; reinstall all major apps</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to McAfee, after my 1st clean install of Win 10, v.1703 (into a dual boot with v.1607) - I'm sure I discovered Seagate DiscWizard (a free version of Acronis) hadn't actually survived one of the upgrades Win 8.1 &gt; Win 10 (OS build 10240) &gt; Win
 10 (v.1511) &gt; Win 10 (v.1607). At least, it didn't have its device showing at top in Device Manager, that I recall. It showed up after installing it into v.1703 - right up on top!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After my 2nd fresh install of v.1703 (to wipe the dual boot), I decided not to install DiscWizard. Now I run it it off its Rescue CD. It still makes a much smaller image &amp; much quicker than Windows system image backup &amp; puts it all in one .tib...</p>

<p>Many thanks for all the ideas, much appreciated. As regards doing a fresh install, I'm holding off on that for now. A lot of work with no guarantee of success, and some chance of &nbsp;creating other problems. I think I would probably replace the PC rather than
 go down that path.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Status update: Still running in "clean boot" environment. Yesterday I manually put it to Sleep several times, and then woke it up after an hour or two. It always woke quite quickly, no issues. But when I woke it this morning after it slept all night, it
 behaved just like yesterday morning after sleeping the previous night (but it did not crash this time). For about an hour and a quarter there was intense disk activity (hard drive access light on solid), and although it had immediately re-displayed everything
 properly, nothing would update or respond, clock stayed frozen at time of the resume, no mouse response until eventually after about an hour mouse pointer would move sporadically. Eventually, the hard drive activity slowed down to normal and the system then
 behaved normally. &nbsp;I would love to figure out the reason for the different behaviors when returning from sleep (which seems to be based on how long it has been asleep), and also what on earth the system is doing with the hard drive that is so intense that
 nothing else can run. Any suggestions how to log what is going on so that I can review it later gratefully received. (No clues in Event Log, and Task Manager does not update in this state.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed via Resource Monitor that the system pagefile seems to be one of the files being accessed a lot (of course this is observed once the system is sufficiently available for me to run Resource Manager). I noticed it accessing pagefile.sys at 25,362,409
 B/sec at one point. A couple of weeks ago I set the page file manually to be 8GB minimum and 16 GB max (I have 8GB of RAM). It seemed to help performance under normal conditions, but made no difference to this problem.</p>
<p><br />
Addressing your numbered points:<br />
</p>
<p>1. Norton: Yes, in fact I was heading towards total temporary removal of Norton NIS already. I should have said earlier that even with the clean boot environment, NIS is the only(?) third party app still running, despite me disabling it in MSCONFIG (it must
 re-enable itself). So it could be misbehaving. This is my next step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. App removal/reinstall: Again, I will hold off on this. A lot of work (6 years worth of apps installed!) with no guarantee of success in my view.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Remove and reinstall non-MSFT drivers from Driver View list: OK, I can give this a shot. But i'm not clear how to identify the actual driver(s) on that list that correspond to the programs listed in Programs and Features (or vice versa). Also, when removing
 a driver, do I choose Uninstall in Device Manager? Then what? Reboot, or install the driver that I have hopefully found on a vendor's website? Or let Windows instal whatever it thinks is the right driver? I'm not familiar with this action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. In clean boot mode, Acronis software is not loaded so it's not backing up (USB drive is disconnected anyway). However I also have MSFT's File History enabled, and I suspect it is still active even in clean boot mode. However, I disconnected the USB drive
 so it cannot actually do anything. I could go and "disable" File History and see if that makes any difference. My cloud based backup (Mozy) is not active in clean boot mode. So, I think that of the list of suspects, it is just Norton that is actually doing
 something regularly at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. The Z: drive is an SD card reader located on an HP printer that is connected to the LAN via WiFi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Yes, per my earlier post :</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, I most appreciate your time and advice.<br />

<p>I have removed Norton NIS and shall run without it for a few days to see if there is any change in behavior. I used the NRnR.exe tool to do a complete remove. However, a couple of hours after rebooting a Norton pop-up appeared, so I guess removal is not
 really "complete" even with their tool. This pop up advised me that the version of Norton on my system (or hopefully NOT on my system any longer) was not compatible with Windows 10, and I was offered a version that was compatible. I find this odd because I
 had many times asked Norton NIS to check for a newer version of itself, and it always said I had the latest, even as recently as this week. If I revert to using it, I'll follow that link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your comment about Sleep converting itself into Hibernation after a time period was very interesting. However I don't think that is applicable on this desktop (not laptop) system as currently configured. First, whenever I go to wake the system the yellow
 power light is on, indicating it is in Sleep (if it is hibernating, there are no lights on the front panel). Second, my power settings say Hibernate: Never, and Allow Hybrid Sleep: Off, so i don't think it can go into hibernation. Please explain further if
 you believe otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll turn off File History after I observe whether removing Norton has had any impact. Yes, I know I do a lot of different backups but i come from the school that says there's no such thing as having too many(!), nuts or otherwise. And in truth, I turned
 on File History only relatively recently to see what it does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will consider the fresh install option in a dual-boot environment if i get nowhere with current steps. Good idea, definitely more palatable than overwriting the main installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver Verifier: unfortunately I cannot use that technique, as mentioned in my first post. It causes Windows to crash before it even gets beyond the initial logo display, then the PC re-boots, then Windows dies, system re-boots, infinite loop. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, all USB devices have been removed save mouse and KB. But I will take a look at that article anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks again. I'll post an update in due course.</p>

<h2>            SlipStreaming SP3 in Windows XP</h2>
                    <p>Xircal,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think this is a great post... But, I have tried this method which works great until after the SP3 is slipstreamed into the original CD and when I try to slipstream all the other downloads, I get an error about some "User-Mapped" drive. I have written
 to Dino who I am assuming wrote the software but have not received a response. I tried to post to the forum, but it doesn't send the final email to activate your registration. The only mapped drives are to my server (Sentinel DX4000) which are not where any
 of the files are located. If you have any suggestions, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            Bob, <br />
<br />
When I tried it, I only did a trial run as it were to see if it worked properly or not and only slipstreamed SP3. I needed to do that at the time because I only have an XP SP2 CD which means you can't run System File Checker.
<br />
<br />
But from the screenshots on the nLite site at <a href="http://www.nliteos.com/guide/part1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.nliteos.com/guide/part1.html</a> the process doesn't look complicated at all. That's not to say it will work though which in your particular case sounds like it went pear-shaped somewhere.<br />
<br />
As regards the forum, are you sure you have cookies enabled? Most sites won't work without them.
<br />
<br />
There's an alternative forum here which might help: <a href="http://forum.notebookreview.com/microsoft-windows-xp-vista/597947-make-lite-version-windows-xp-nlite-detailed-guide.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
In the meantime though, the wheels fell off both my XP machines within 24 hours of each other (CPU failures) and since I couldn't get hold of a CPU anywhere, I was forced to buy a dreaded Windows 8 machine.
<br />
<br />
I decided on a mid to high end laptop which is an Acer Aspire V3-772G which has an Intel i5 processor and 8GB RAM. Initially, I hated those Tiles, but after installing the free 8.1 upgrade kit, it's just three clicks of the mouse button to configure the machine
 to boot straight to the desktop. <br />
<br />
I also bought a USB 3.0 wireless mouse which makes using the laptop a piece of cake. It doesn't disable the Touchpad, so I can use both.<br />
<br />
After using 8.1 for three days now, I would never consider going back to XP. For a start, the machine boots to the desktop in eight seconds flat. Really amazing.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Also, if you want to search for anything, all you need to do is to hit the Windows key to take you to the Start screen with the tiles and then just start typing. No need to launch any Search tools. A panel opens on the right with matches to whatever you're
 typing. That's really cool.<br />
<br />
You can also do it another way by hitting Windows key + C to open the "Charms"panel on the right and then click "Search".<br />
<br />
As regards the tiles, you can just right click them and then either choose to uninstall the applications or links they belong to, or just hide them from view. In both cases, it's just a click of a button.
<br />
<br />
There are a number of keyboard shortcuts which perform different functions like Windows key + X which brings up a menu to most of the usual functions like accessing Control Panel, Device Manager, Power Options, Command Prompt and stuff like that.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
And even if you hide desktop icons like I do, you can access all of them from the "Desktop" link on the Taskbar.
<br />
<br />
It's really worth considering if you're in the market. My laptop set me back €799 which is about $1,090. But that includes VAT at 21% in the Netherlands where I live so laptops will probably be a lot cheaper in the US I suspect.
<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't tempt me, I have 3 XP machines (2) older Dells and a machine I have been working on for about 2 weeks (Intel D975XBX MB w/raid and a 955 Extreme Processor) which keeps randomly rebooting. My issue is: I know XP fairly well and am having a hard
 time changing to something I know nothing about and I don't know if you can get into the OS like XP or if they lock you out or make it very hard to access anything like what I have seen in WIN7. BUT !!! if I do make that leap, it will be for the I7 processor
 and 64bit OS. I have (2) WD Sentinel DX4000 (NAS) units with Win 2008 R2 for all my data and anything else I need for storage (I.E. movies / music / etc.) Then comes the decision of touch screen or not and monies for all the Programs to move to 64 bit. Again,
 decisions , decisions !!!!</p>

            Bob,<br />
<br />
i7 is the top end of the Intel CPU tree. The i5 which I have is one step down, but I don't have any issues with it as of yet. Actually, I described it incorrectly as an "E5" primarily because in the Netherlands, the letter "i" is pronounced as an "e".
<br />
<br />
But the OS is 64-bit. I don't think you can buy a 32-bit laptop anymore.<br />
<br />
I bought a SATA to USB docking station and was thankfully able to retrieve all my data off both XP machines with that. The docking station also allows me to use all the HDs as storage. This is what it looks like:
<a href="http://www.ewent-online.com/index.php?language=en&amp;page=product&amp;categoryid=10&amp;groupid=95&amp;productid=1383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.ewent-online.com/index.php?language=en&amp;page=product&amp;categoryid=10&amp;groupid=95&amp;productid=1383</a><br />
<br />
All you need to do with that is insert the SATA HD, plug it into a USB 3.0 port and it acts like a USB stick. No installation required and it only cost me €30 including 21% VAT. It'll probably be cheaper in the US because you guys don't have to pay the stinging
 amounts of tax that we poor Euro-ites have to contend with. <br />
<br />
Anything new takes a bit of getting used to of course, but 8.1 is fairly intuitive and after two or three days of using it, it doesn't feel any different to XP.
<br />
<br />
Also, having a wireless mouse takes all the hard work out of using a laptop touchpad. Learn a few keyboard shortcuts and you won't notice the difference between the two OS I assure you.<br />
<br />
As for programs, like Tricky mentioned, you can run 32-bit apps on a 64-bit OS, no problem at all. In Windows Explorer under Program files, you'll see a secondary folder called Program files (x86) which is where they all install.<br />
<br />
What a 64-bit system won't accept are 32-bit drivers, or non-WHQL certified drivers. But these are all free anyway, so cost doesn't enter into the equation as far as drivers go.<br />
<br />
Personally, I wouldn't bother about the touchscreen because it'll only be of any use when using the Start menu. But because you can sort the list of installed programs by "Most frequently used" or "Last accessed" as well as by "Category", it's a piece of cake
 just to open them with the mouse. <br />
<br />
Touchscreens are fine when it comes to tablets where you can lay it down flat, but not when you're using a keyboard, mouse and an upright LCD screen. It's easier and faster just to point the mouse at a program and double click.
<br />
<br />
A touchscreen will also add significantly to the cost of the machine. <br />
<br />
An i7 CPU is what you need if you're going to be gaming all the time with high end games like Crysis which has fantastic graphics, but not for every day use. The i5 equipped model is exactly half the price of the i7 flavor on the laptop I bought.<br />
<br />
The whole touchscreen idea with Windows 8.0 though came about when MS decided to enter the hardware market with their Surface tablet-come-laptop.&nbsp; I've seen it in the flesh so to speak and it looks like a nifty little machine. It's OK to take on vacation I
 suppose, but small screens don't appeal to me very much mainly because my eyesight has been getting steadily worse since I retired. :(<br />

            <p>Xircal / Tricky300,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am an old man 60 and some, and believe me I don't do any gaming, a waste of time.. I have a lot more to do with my time than play games (my wife is a different story... she loves solitare). I probably don't need an I7 processor but as it goes
 with computers, every day your hardware become obsolete... only (thinking about) purchasing some time. It will only be used for email / MS Office / Internet (researching whatever I am working on).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is a nifty little device for the hard drive, it would have been less expensive than my WD Sentinel DX4000 unit. My only saving grace is the Raid5 which writes parity across all the drives so if I loose one, I don't loose any data.. But if I loose
 2 stuff happens...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So from what you and Tricky say, my MSOffice 2010 will run on the 64 bit OS, the only other software would be Acrobat, Trend Micro, and misc little stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You guys have a great evening and we will talk later...</p>

            Well, I'll be turning 70 in a couple of months time, but my quest for knowledge continues unabated.
<br />
<br />
I don't know if there's any truth in it, but I read somewhere that keeping the grey matter active staves of Alzheimer's. :)<br />
<br />
I used to build my own PCs once upon a time, but my eyesight is deteriorating now and working in dark corners of a tower case when installing the motherboard has become a problem I regret to say. So I've settled for the laptop flavor now.<br />
<br />
One thing I've noticed already though with 8.1 is that System Restore takes forever to complete whatever it's doing. On XP you didn't have to wait more the about three minutes before the system rebooted to the desktop, but with 8.1, it takes around 20 mins
 during which the screen remains black most of the time. I thought it must be hanging when I ran SR for the first time today and was on the point of shutting it down manually when the BIOS logo suddenly appeared and saved my sanity.
<br />
<br />
The issues I'm trying to fix are a code 10 on a Bluetooth audio device in device manager and the system hanging on a manual restart. As regards the latter, I thought that was what had happened when I ran SR.<br />
<br />
But SR didn't fix either issue. There's a suggestion on the 8.1 forum for a post back in October last year to recover the system, but it took me three days to configure it the way I like it and I don't fancy the idea of undoing all that work again.
<br />
<br />
I can live with the Bluetooth issue since I don't have any of those devices, but will have to choose "shutdown" and then power on again instead of "restart" until MS comes up with a fix.<br />
<br />
By the way, try Foxit Reader which I use instead of Acrobat: <a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/Secure_PDF_Reader/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
As regards AV, all the major AV companies will have an 8.1 compatible release. You get Windows Defender with the OS though and unless you plan on going into the unknown regularly, it should be more than adequate to safeguard your system especially if you use
 Firefox instead of IE. There's a good security extension for Firefox called VTZilla which you can use to scan a link before you go there. The scanner scans with every AV currently available and then displays the result on how each company rates a particular

            <p>I used to be in IT for many years maintaining 14 servers (Exchange also) and 250 PC/Laptops (mainly Dells) but retired just before Server 2003 and Active Directory came into play. I have to agree with you, I too used to build PC's but as I got older, the
 eye sight (even with glasses) isn't what it used to be. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the AV, we ran Trend @ work for many years along with their (don't quote me) Office Scan which automatically updated all the local PC's and all the laptops, even in the UK. I have been very happy with it; as for Windows Defender.... not so many good
 reviews.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I run Acrobat Pro and also the reader, only issue I have is printing, if you don't keep the page open while printing, it like to print garbage....
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, enough about me... Lets talk 8.1... Hummmm, I don't like that there isn't a screen stating "Restoring System" or something to let you know what it is doing nor do I like the 20 min thing, but it's better than waiting a whole day for my Dx4000 4Tb unit
 to do a restore (on itself it actually rebuilds the drives) . </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing out there on the Code 10 ?? And I would agree with you about redoing everything again... Is there a way like in XP where you can remove the device and (maybe new drivers) then rescan...</p>
<p>And&nbsp;I know you know that already, I just didn't know if it was the same in that respect.</p>

            <p>Here i8s a site which discusses the code 10 error in general... Mainly points to the device driver..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.windowsanswers.net/articles/fix-code10?tid=code10goog&amp;gclid=CPPXxYnHwrwCFciCfgodsncA5A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsanswers.net/articles/fix-code10?tid=code10goog&amp;gclid=CPPXxYnHwrwCFciCfgodsncA5A</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is another suggestion I found which included the updates drivers??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi everyone,&nbsp; </p>
<div><br />
<div>If you have a Win 8.1 Machine with built-in Bluetooth from Qualcomm Atheros Communications, the Bluetooth may no longer work after you've upgraded to 8.1; this happened to me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you go to Device Manager, there is a Bluetooth section and in it there is a thing called "Bluetooth USB Module." &nbsp;Actually, the Qualcomm Atheros Communications Bluetooth is built into the Wifi Adaptor, but that does not really matter.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Acer (but probably other manufacturers as well) have not updated the drivers for this device to Win 8.1 yet on their sites. &nbsp;The Atheros website is also useless.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I found the Win 8.1 Driver (64 bit) here: &nbsp;<a href="http://drivers.softpedia.com/progDownload/Acer-Aspire-V5-573P-Atheros-Bluetooth-Driver-801305-for-Windows-81-64-bit-Download-306204.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://drivers.softpedia.com/progDownload/Acer-Aspire-V5-573P-Atheros-Bluetooth-Driver-801305-for-Windows-81-64-bit-Download-306204.html</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>I have an Acer Aspire Desktop, so I can verify that it works for Acer. &nbsp;Might also work for other PC Manufacturers, but not sure.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It's a big download (over 300 mb), but it fixed the issue for me:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Download the zip file; extract all</div>
<div>Open "Install CD" folder&nbsp;</div>
<div>Find "setup" and run it</div>
<div>Restart machine after it's done</div>

            Thanks for the thought Bob, but I've already been through all that without resolving the problem.
<br />
<br />
This morning I decided to get rid of it altogether and uninstalled it in device manager choosing to remove the drivers in the process.<br />
<br />
It hasn't resolved the restart problem however and I have to shutdown and then restart again manually.<br />
<br />
I've been following the advice on the following site, but still haven't resolved it:

<br />
8.1 troubleshooting tools are useless and just tell me that the system is functioning properly. Yeah, right, come here and manually restart and then try and tell me&nbsp; this is normal behaviour when it hangs on a black screen.<br />

            Bob, <br />
<br />
Sorry, saw your other post first and only found this one in a later email.<br />
<br />
During SR, you do see the message "Restoring System" initially, but then the screen turns black for a long time without any indication as to what's going on.
<br />
<br />
Because I faced the issue with a manual restart hanging, I assumed that was what had happened during the restore. It was only after hanging around for 10 mins and finally deciding to power off manually that the BIOS logo suddenly reappeared. My sense of relief
 at seeing that was audible!<br />
<br />
I'd already had an inkling that things might be OK because when I ran the 8.1 upgrade which is a 3.62GB download by the way, a similar thing happened with the machine just sitting there for ages with a black screen.<br />
<br />
I found this handy article on MS Technet this morning, but don't want to run fix /mbr because the machine boots properly on a cold startup. It's only if you choose to reboot manually that the problem occurs:
<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/ouc1too/archive/2013/10/22/windows-8-1-upgrade-reboots-to-black- screen-of-nothingness.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://blogs.technet.com/b/ouc1too/archive/2013/10/22/windows-8-1-upgrade-reboots-to-black-screen-of-nothingness.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Still, it's handy knowing about how to create a USB recovery disc and I did that just in case.
<br />
<br />
I shall keep digging. <br />

            <p>Perhaps it was not a good idea to upgrade the OS on your computer - might be not fully compatible with Windows 10. If you're looking for the game, always begin with the start menu and type the name of the game on the search field, or look in your apps.</p>
<p>To make sure the game is really installed, right click the start button + click on RUN + type: appwiz.cpl and then Enter. If the game appears in the list, it means it's installed. If not, so maybe check in the modern apps interface on start menu.</p>

                    <p>Please help! &nbsp;I upgraded my Window 8.1 to 10 2 days ago. &nbsp;It was working fine and then I shutdown and install updates last night. &nbsp;Now when I boot, it boots fine, I can log in, but as soon as I log in (5-20seconds later) the screen starts to pixelate and
 then it goes black and freezes (no mouse). &nbsp;Please advice!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I just noticed that while it is pixelating, if I catch it and hit the windows key, then escape out of that, it will sometime appear to go away without freezing. &nbsp;Any Idea what is cuasing this? &nbsp;It was workign fine before I installed latest update</p>

            <p>Hi SuJata,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I was able to boot into (now windows 8.1) for an amount of time to delete the Nvidia graphics driver from device manager. &nbsp;When I restart into Windows 8.1 it appears to be stable for now and I am not getting the pixelation leading to black screen computer
 freeze. So it appears the GPU drivers were causing the problems (most likely). &nbsp;Do you happen to know the procedure to follow now? &nbsp;Should I reinstall Windows 10 and then install the latest Nvidia drivers? &nbsp;I am not sure how to proceed. &nbsp;Thanks again</p>

            <p>Nirajan, thanks for your message, but I still have a problem. As suggested in your message, I made a correction to my Remote Desktop connection (RDC) settings in Display, and I checked "use all monitors". This allowed me to extend the entire RDC window over
 to the other monitor, but it does not allow me to extend work WITHiN the RDC to both monitors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Three other facts that might help you help me: my laptop runs 8.1, but the work computer I am remoting into is 7. Also, the RDC link was put into my laptop by work staff, so maybe I am using the "wrong" RDC? &nbsp;Also, I have a monitor I extend to at work also,
 so would this exclude me from also being able to extend remotely?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks.</p>

<h2>            I get an error code 8024000E while installing Windows Updates.</h2>
                    <p>I use a mobile hotspot to access the internet. At the end of August I couldn't connect, I was told by Verizon it was because of a microsoft update about malicous soltware. I was told to restore my computer&nbsp;back to 8/25/2012. I did. &nbsp;I called the 800 microsoft
 number&nbsp;and I let a microsoft technician remotely work on my&nbsp; computer. Now no updates will install, I continually get messages that certain program won't run and that I should uninstall microsoft intellipoint software and reinstall. I&nbsp;have done this two times,
 it does nothing. More and more things are failing. I tried calling to technician again and they want me to pay for a help service. I am at whits end. My latest message about updates&nbsp;was error 8024000E. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Original title:Since I let a microsoft support person work on my computer remotly I cannot install any updates. I have repeatly to get help to no avail. Any suggustions?</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />If you are using a single system in your office it is not required to buy a Volume Licensing for upgrading the Windows 10 Home to Pro edition. But if you are using several computers then, it is suggested to buy a Volume Licensing key so that you may use the same key to activate several computers when upgrading.
<br />
<br />So to conclude, I'll say yes. Refer Microsoft Volume Licensing:

<br />Regards.

            You can purchase up to 25 licenses from the Microsoft Store using one account. 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/d/windows-10-pro/df77x4d43rkt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/d/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also upgrade each machine cheaper to Windows 10 Pro using the Pro Pack option Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Go to Store.
<br />
<br />Click the $99 button to purchase the upgrade.
<br />
<br />Please note that volume licensing does not apply to Home edition. Volume license requires the machine is properly licensed with Windows 10 Pro, 7 Professional/Ultimate or 8 Pro.

            <p>Hi Praveen,</p>
<p>I'm using Vista</p>
<p>Not sure of the file type. It won't download Jpegs or Bitmaps and maaybe some text but it will download PDF</p>
<p>It's mainly pictures but I don't think it will download all text</p>
<p>The sequence is. </p>
<p>1 &nbsp;I open the attachment and it is cleared by my security</p>
<p>2 I then have 2 options "Save" or Open"&nbsp; </p>
<p>3 If I open then I can see the picture. </p>
<p>4 If I Download then that operation is completed and I have another option " View Downloads". If I try to do that or try to go to the downloaded file in My Documents then the screen flashes and the Explorer page appears repeatedly, so fast that I cannot
 delete them. Within seconds I have 20 30 explorer pages open. The only way to stop it is to turn off the power.</p>
<p>I have made no changes to my computer recently</p>
        </p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for providing the details.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When you are trying to open the file from <strong>My Documents </strong>(<strong>Download</strong>) folder, do you use mouse key or Enter key to access? If you are trying to use
<strong>Enter</strong> key to open, check if <strong>Enter</strong> key is stuck.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Regards. <br />

"I thought I mentioned using WIN7 operating system.&nbsp; I am using IE10.&nbsp; NO attachments I scan are being attached for sending.&nbsp; NO attachments I receive can be opened.&nbsp; A box pops up (open, save, save and open) and whatever I click it appears its going to provide
 that, then 'nothing' happens and I finally realize I'm just sitting here to select again and again and again.&nbsp; YAHOO could not be touched for years - now.......I'm constantly being asked to sign in.&nbsp; If I click on the help link it says I'm signed in yet YAHOO
 keeps saying for me to sign in.&nbsp; SO many YAHOO problems today that were NEVER there in years past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multiple versions: NO - multiple screens of IE - sometimes as many as 18 keep trying to load</p>

<h2>            Wake on Lan with Surface Pro 3 and Dock</h2>
                    Has anyone been able to get Wake on Lan working with the Surface Pro 3 and Surface Dock?&nbsp; I can't find any information anywhere stating if WOL is even supported or not.&nbsp; We've tried several settings and thus far nothing has worked.

            Did you try through the Device Manager? I'm trying the same issue and seems some Hardware isn't compliant. Couldn't really enable that on the BIOS either. Was looking for how to do this for WOWLAN, which is Wake-on-Wireless Lan, as opposed to just Wake-on-Lan,
 which requires an ethernet cable, or something like that.

            I'd sure like to find a way to do this too.&nbsp; We need to be able to wake the devices up to patch them.&nbsp; I purchased a USB 3 NIC and imagine that...it doesn't stay powered up, even though it has the settings to do WOL.&nbsp; Maybe there is a new BIOS version?&nbsp;
 I'm still looking too.&nbsp; Thanks,&nbsp; JK
