<br />
<strong>&nbsp;</strong><span><span><strong>Windows Mail cannot import a .pst file unless Outlook is installed on the<br />

<br />
You can install Outlook, copy the .pst to the Vista computer, open the .pst<br />
with Outlook, then you can import into Windows Mail.<br />
<br />
Or,<br />
If you have Outlook installed on an XP computer, import the .pst data into<br />

<h3> a deaf bat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot play game that I paid for</h2>
                    
<p>This issue is not new, and it's not uncommon. Many people who have paid money for Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 cannot download it since it was taken off of the marketplace. Not only have I already paid for and downloaded this game, but it will not let me play
 the full unlocked version.</p>
<p>Ultimate Mortal kombat 3 is on my xbox, when I go to play it, it's still a trial version, when I go to unlock it (I already paid for it, so just an authorization) it won't download/authorize me to play. Basically an error message comes up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHY</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why don't we have answers on this?</p>

<p>The problem is, it isn't in my history (because I had downloaded the game under this user name then I unlocked the trial version under another name some time ago. Now when I go to do that again under that other name, it comes up with an error code. So I
 already have the game on my hdd, it sees that i've paid for it, but does not authorize me to play it.</p>

<blockquote>I think I have some vague understanding of what you posted but I know I have no practical perception of it.<br />
<br />
Under Hkey_Local_Machine/Software, WOW6432Node heads a long list of 50 cascading programs/files. Does its presence as a registry key mean my 64 bits OS is capable of computing (old) items designed for 32 bits applications?
<br />
<br />
And then there is a blog online by someone wondering if it is a virus in his registry since he has a 32 bits OS. Because like he,&nbsp; I understand&nbsp; it is only for processing 32 bits applications in 64 bits OS...NOT vice versa (i.e., 64 bits application in 32 bits
 OS).<br />
<br />
BTW, why can't I post an attachment in this forum? Is it&nbsp; me or the forum's format?</blockquote>
<strong>The OS uses this key to present a separate view of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE for 32-bit applications that run on a 64-bit version of Windows. When a 32-bit application queries a value under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\&lt;company&gt;\&lt;product&gt; subkey,
 the application reads from the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\&lt;company&gt;\&lt;product&gt; subkey.</strong>
<em>(from </em><a href="http://windowsitpro.com/article/articleid/25995/whats-the-wow6432node-under-the-hkey_local_machinesoftware-registry-subkey.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><em>http://windowsitpro.com/article/articleid/25995/whats-the-wow6432node-under-the-hkey_local_machinesoftware-registry-subkey.html</em></span></a><em>)</em>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that the WoW6432Node mimics&nbsp;the 32-bit version of the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE registry key to run 32-bit programs, and that when a 32-bit program looks for information under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE it is redirected to WoW6432Node.<br />
<br />
The list of programs under the Hkey_Local_Machine\Software\WOW6432Node is probably the 32-bit programs that query a value under the WOW6432Node. And yes, this means that your OS is capable of running most 32-bit programs.<br />
<br />
This registry key should not be in a 32-bit OS but its presence does not always indicate a virus, although it may be one.
<br />
<br />
You cannot post an attachment in this forum. You'll have to upload to to a site like
skydrive.live.com, google docs, flickr, or picasa; make a link to it;&nbsp;and let everyone access it.<br />
I hope this answers your questions.&nbsp;

<h2>            How to install XP &#40;without SP1, 2 or 3&#41; on a SATA Hardrive&#63;</h2>
                    I want to upgrade my computer's harddisk to a SATA Drive. I have my original Windows XP that has no Service Packs included. When I try to install, I get error message saying that there are no hard drives on my computer... it does not recognize SATA drives.
 I know that SP 2 will recognize the SATA Drives... but, how do i do that? Is there a solution to this?

<h2>            minecraft windows 10 Unable to fully keybind controller and cant override 360 controller 3rd party</h2>
                    so i have set up Minecraft win10 on the PC and use a wired 360 controller for when the boy wants to play. However you are unable to Fully customise the controller keys (main issue being 'F' to switch main/off hand). I also cannot use 3rd party like Keysticks
 to manually map controller as it appears they dont fully override the native controller settings in game. So im stuck at this point unable to get around the in-game controller setup, either that or im missing a blatant slider option somewhere. anyhelp much
 obliged.

 you should do as part of normal Computer maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;full scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the<strong><span>Scan</span></strong>
 button to start scanning your computer<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.</span><span><br />
<br />
6</span><span>.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span><span><br />

<h2>            One conversation missing from Skype history</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who can help? I just browsed through my Skype-history and can see all the conversations/interactions I've had with my contacts for the past months. However, ONE conversation is missing. How can that be? When I open the contact I can see our conversation
 (calls &amp; texts) but the conversation does not appear in my overall Skype history. Does this mean the other person deleted the conversation or is it something I inadvertently did?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your thoughts!</p>

<p>Hello Juan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using the same device and the conversation/interactie was at the end of October.</p>
<p>The strange thing is that I see every conversation with my others contacts from that time (a few days before, a few days after) in my overall history, it is ONLY this one conversation that is missing from the day in between.</p>
<p>I can retrieve the conversation when I click on the contact I had the conversation with and then it is all there. But it is not listed in the history-overview of all conversations. That's why I think it is so strange that ONE conversation is not showing
 admit all the other ones...</p>

<p>Hi there again,</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire Collection won&#39;t run</h2>
                    <p>I've been chasing down a number of problems after I replaced my motherboard with a different model (the old board died).&nbsp; The last one seems to be a problem with the Microsoft Windows Solitaire Collection app installed from the Windows Store.&nbsp; When I try
 to run it, it opens for just a few seconds and then minimizes. There is an accompanying EventLog error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app Microsoft.MicrosoftSolitaireCollection_8wekyb3d8bbwe!App's package family (Microsoft.MicrosoftSolitaireCollection_8wekyb3d8bbwe) has more than one package installed. This is not supported, so the app was not activated for the Windows.Launch contract.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but the problem persists.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">A solution would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Consider the problem solved.&nbsp; Indeed the Event Log message about more than one package being installed is relevant.&nbsp; The solution is basically here:

http://www.information-computer.com/2014/04/fix-metro-apps-crashing-on-windows-8-or.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue in the link is&nbsp;regarding a different&nbsp;Windows Store application, but the solution is very much the same: find and delete the appropriate duplicate Registry key for the app that produces the error.&nbsp; Also note that it might be necessary to take ownership
 of the key in order to delete it.</p>

<p>I was playing on gold as an N7 fury and some guy was raging at me saying the fury is a "support" class and is useless on gold.</p>
<p>This same guy was playing as a geth infiltrator with the mantis. NO side arm at all. And we were in Firebase Glacier. On GOLD. Needless to say he wasn't exactly being useful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you ever seen someone with a really bad class choice or loadout?</p>

<p>I could go on all day about your question. I would say the Krogan warlord takes the cake. I played with one the other night and all he did was go for every kill. Against Primes he would go for the last hit after you had taken the shields down and their health
 down. He would do this with anything that you attack. You would figure he would help with the missions but no he just ran around killing while the other two and myself took the hack. As for weapons and other &nbsp;people 99.9% of the people I see have bad weapons.
 Its almost like the players of now dont know what a N7 weapon is.</p>

<p>Hello "FlyingHadoken" &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Given the fact that I very rarely play with other people (as I primarily solo-run Silver and Bronze. &nbsp;I have only tried to solo-run Gold once and I was successful on that first attempt; I am not going to attempt another Gold solo-run ever again! &nbsp;I was using
 my Krogan Battlemaster with my Wraith X against the Geth on Firebase Glacier Hazard Edition), the one common mistake that I've noticed is that some players run to the extraction point ASAP when wave 11 begins, causing the LZ to get over run by enemy forces
 instead of using the "30 second rule". &nbsp;Just in case a reader is reading this and is wondering what the "30 second rule" is, it is the strategy of going as far away as possible from the LZ when wave 11 begins and then running back to the extraction point once
 the timer hits 30 seconds. &nbsp;Another thing that I've noticed is that when some players use the Cobra Missiles, they aim directly at the enemy itself (the probability of completely missing that target is high when using this technique) as opposed aiming at the
 feet of the target to ensure a 100% chance to hit as opposed to the 50% chance to hit (average probability of hitting the intended target when aiming directly at it). &nbsp;Please understand that the two observations that I have commented on is in no way shape
 or form meant to be mean / rude to inexperienced players, I was just mentioning them (waiting at the LZ on wave 11 and how to use Cobra Missiles) so that the player reading this post will become aware of these habbits (it if applies to the reader) and become
 a better player as the last thing that I ever want to do is be mean / rude to anyone else.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Have a nice day or afternoon or night everyone! &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>As long as you don't use a stupidly heavy weapon like an Argus on an N7 Fury (for example) just use what you want.&nbsp; Fit the weapon around the character.&nbsp; Use what's best for you.</p>

<p>I disagree some what. I use certain weapons based on what the character is good with. In almost every characters special training it says decrease the weight of weapon by a certain percentage. It will say shotgun, smg, etc. This is the type of weapon that
 character is good with. Vorcha and Krogan are shotgun guys. Most Turians are good with assault rifles. Yes most infiltrator's use sniper rifles (why not get the extra damage with sniper &nbsp;while in or coming out of cloak). There are exceptions to this rule.
 Some characters dont have a type they are good with all types. Also the N7 Destroyer can carry anything, and make it better depending on your setup. He can have 4 shots with a Black Widow for instance. The Destroyer only really has to hit the devastator mode
 engage once in the beginning of the match. So weight of weapons does not apply to him, The N7 Demolisher (one drop pylon), or the Talon Mercenary (only grenade attacks). Also in every character picture on the character select screen each character is holding
 a different weapon. They are usually very good with this weapon but I never go by this. However they do make sense like the Juggy has a spitfire. Honestly the gun jumps a tiny little bit. A stability mode doesnt help but the juggys natural stability makes
 it shoot without a bit of jarring. So not only is this a good move for your character but you also get to use a wider variety of the weapons that you have worked so hard to collect. Give it a try you wont look back.</p>

<p>I've seen dumb moves like people equipping gear with a 12% Biotic power and 12% Pistol while using a soldier with an Assault Rifle and nothing else. My biggest complaint though is people that get all crazy about "Kill stealing". Honestly, everyone gets the
 same amount of XP and Credits, with the exception of the extraction bonus, so who cares who gets the kill? I'll play all day getting 75 assists as long as I get 80,000 on Gold every time.</p>

<p>Hello "PeteRock24" &nbsp;:) &nbsp;This is one thing that also aggrevates me on some the very rare occassions that I've played with other players . &nbsp;I totally understand in situations where a player(s) did all of the hard work and someone else (who was doing nothing
 at all) just swoops right in to get the kill and then run back to hide, rinsing and repeating this tactic over and over again. &nbsp;The situation is different when everyone is firing in unison as there is absolutely no way to time things correctly so that your
 attack will get the kill over your 3 other squad mates. &nbsp;Echoing what you said, eveyone gets the same amount of XP anyway, so it shouldn't matter who gets the kill &nbsp;:) &nbsp;Have a nice day or afternoon or night! &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>I don't get this "kill stealing" nonsense, when I'm playing I'm focused on the enemy and not the gamertags and weapon/power names popping up that don't do anything to assist in the objective of extraction. &nbsp;I keep shooting until the enemy falls down, then
 I aim towards another until it falls down and if a squadmate happens to come along and finish one off that I'm shooting at, then they have my thanks. &nbsp;If players are so worried about their kill counts, they oughta pay as much attention to what they're doing
 themselves instead of the other players' loadouts, they'd probably find their kill counts noticeably increase, by the way, assists are worth points as well, some 1000+...:-) &nbsp;</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>Hello "Arkham99" &nbsp;:) &nbsp;I too don't understand this "kill stealing" issue that some people have to be having problems with since everyone gains the same amount of XP in the end. &nbsp;To me, the most important thing is to have fun / enjoy the match and that the
 squad is alive and the enemy is dead &nbsp;:) &nbsp;That's my logic anyways &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>With all due respect to those players who aim to get the highest personal score possible when playing in a full squad, please understand that my statements in this post are not meant to antagonize anyone and / or start a flame war of sorts; this is just
 my opinion regarding this matter of "kill stealing". &nbsp;Again, the statements in this post are not meant to antagonize anyone and / or start a flame war of sorts; this is just my opinion regarding this matter of "kill stealing".</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>There is no "I" in the word team &nbsp;= &nbsp;Everyone has to work cohesively together to survive and successfully make it to extraction regardless of the difficulty setting that you're playing on. &nbsp;Obviously, support oriented characters won't score as high as assault
 oriented characters.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>My score is higher than yours &nbsp;= &nbsp;Respectfully, if having the highest score possible is so important to you, have you considered having a tournament on who has the highest score on a solo-run attempt instead of trying to out-do the rest of your squad mates?
 &nbsp;Look, lets say someone sets-up a private tournament on Firebase Whatever on Whatever difficulty setting against Whatever faction. &nbsp;Let all of the players compare scores afterwards and add a +100,000 point incentive bonus&nbsp;or something to those that acutally
 make it to extraction to&nbsp;the player's received&nbsp;score&nbsp;on the post game stats.&nbsp; Use this to determine the winner.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you're playing to get the specific faction challenges done (you know, the ones where you have to specifically beat Cerberus, Reapers, Geth, and Collectors), are you aware that "assist" also counts towards the points earned reqiuirement for
 this challenge?</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Have a nice day or afternoon or night everyone! &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>Is there a way to question the legitimacy of a permanent suspension? I wish that I could plead my case to XBL because I have already posted to the suspensions forum and I explained the situation but they said that&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">this
 forum is only&nbsp;to find out why you were suspended and not to debate the validity</span>.&nbsp;I know that people will say that XBL can do whatever they want because they are a private company, but is there a way to speak to a real human being and not an automated
 machine? Thanks in advance for all of your help.</p>
<p>PS: this is not my banned account and I will only release it to a real XBLPET member or Xbox Support member.</p>

<p>XBLPET validate each and every suspension and banning. &nbsp;There decisions are always final and can't or won't be over turned by them. (At least what I've always seen) &nbsp; I've never seen a suspension over turned. and yes. &nbsp;everyone wants to "Explain and plead"

<p>-</p>
<p>I would imagine they would need extensive therapy and valium if they had to hear everyone's "explanation" in person. Which is why they don't take phone calls.</p>
<p>- </p>
<p>But rest assured all banns and suspensions are review by a real live Microsoft Xbox Live Policy Enforcement Employee and not some automated system.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Now if you want to explain why they banned or suspended you, maybe an Ambassador or volunteer could help understand why. but to get it over turned won't happen.</p>

<p>No you won't, they'll refer to the Terms of Use, and have zero evidence to show you. should be illegal. Oh your brother honestly used your account and swore at a bunch of people? BANNED. Oh somebody got their IP flooded and blamed it on you? BANNED! It's
 how LIVE enforcement works. They'll ban you for something no developer, Sony, or Nintendo ever would, provide zero evidence, and then expect you to start paying $60 again without a refund if you just bought LIVE for the old account. Best part is I can go around
 spreading the truth and they can do nothing about it. Freedom of speech, and valid criticisms. Best bet is to play PC if you truly got banned for nothing, but if you did mod in a game you did indeed deserve it. But then again when has LIVE enforcement banned
 cheaters in games? Never, developers do it themselves in recent games, and nobody does it in older ones. Chances are you just played with an angry employee. It's been recorded and put on YouTube that rouge enforcers do indeed ban anything that moves. I don't
 doubt it would happen again. Go look up the banned system on YouTube and how it works, the program itself is so poorly designed I almost cried when I saw it. One of the employees explains how it works, "you can be banned with the push of a button", a button
 on the Xbox controller mind you. </p>

<p>Xbox needs to present any evidence. Period. EVERY complaint is reviewed by a real person. Every ban/suspension is issued with proper evidence to support it, whether you believe them or not. And Xbox enforecment bans cheaters and modders on an hourly basis,
 whether you believe it or not.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>And those "rouge enforcers" are usually highly edited conversations or encounters with someone from the enforcement team.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Also, you should look up the real meaning of Freedom of Speech, you might be surprised.</p>

<p>"And those "rouge enforcers" are usually highly edited conversations or encounters with someone from the enforcement team." LOL! Dude it's in game voice chat, you can't fake that. "Xbox needs to present any evidence. Period." False, I've never received any
 proof of any bans I've ever received, except one chat conversation with a troll where I got a small mute because I swore. The irony is that he did too, but hey no conflict of interest there. Sorry I couldn't remember his ridiculous gamertag. Your gamertag
 Bluntman1138, easy to remember right? How about asoidrhgiueh1, yeah not so much. I blocked him, like LIVE enforcement would suggest that I do. If they banned cheaters we would here about it, if you know this for a fact could I have some evidence? Or do you
 just pull this information from the mystical cloud you live on? Go look up "ThePro" On YouTube, probably a solid hour or two of him banning people for no reason, with voice evidence to back it up. Always so much fun to watch people defend the turd they stand
 on, just remember that you're standing on a turd. LIVE enforcement deals with swearing in Bio's, motto's, location, name, and gamertags, current games are monitored by developers, older ones are left alone. As for freedom of speech "Freedom of speech is the
 political right to communicate one's opinions and ideas. The term freedom of expression is sometimes used synonymously, but includes any act of seeking, receiving and imparting information or ideas, regardless of the medium used. In practice, the right to
 freedom of speech is not absolute in any country and the right is commonly subject to limitations, as with libel, slander, obscenity, sedition (including, for example inciting ethnic hatred), copyright violation, revelation of information that is classified
 or otherwise." This is my criticism of XBL, if it was slanderous I wouldn't bother with the product. As often as I don't run into cheaters, the ones I do have nothing done to them. Criticism is definitely allowed, to deny that freedom of speech is illegal,
 so why don't YOU look up the definition? Oh wait, I just showed you. BAZINGA!</p>

 anywhere they want.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way, Xbox LIVE is a Privately owned and operated Service or also known as an Intellectual Property. It is viewed the same by law as Private Property, ie like your house. You have every right to tell someone what they can or cannot say within
 your own house on Private Property and the US Government should never (should but they don't anymore) pass a law denying you that freedom. You as the owner of that Private Property have every right to refuse to allow someone access to your home and do not
 need to present any evidence as to why or why not.<br />
<br />
It's the same thing with Xbox LIVE. It's the house that MS built and if you don't like the rules, just leave. They have every Right to allow who enters and why or why not.<br />

 understanding of how videos are made in the first place. LOL "It's on It's in-game voice chat, it cant be faked."" JUST LOL!!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>And again, you have no real concept of Freedom of Speech. And copying and pasting the default definition for it from wikipedia doesnt help you much. Because on Xbox Live and the Xbox Forums, YOU HAVE NO FREEDOM OF SPEECH, Deal with it.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 will no longer update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trevordawkins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 will no longer update</h2>
                    <p>Due to harddrive low disk space error, I had to move my windows 10 from a SSD to HDD with larger capacity.&nbsp; I had other issues with my windows, where I lost access to the file properties box, in which I posted up on here but never ever resolved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I moved windows from SSD by cloning it to a 1 TB HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 starts up ok, but a little slowly which is expected compared to SSD drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to update Windows 10 but encountered the following update error code 0xc1900208.&nbsp; I researched the code, and then carried out the update troubleshooting.&nbsp; And applied the fixes is stated needed doing.&nbsp; Then I retried updating Windows 10, but have
 a while I got the same error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not confident in resetting the update setting manually with the register, as I cannot afford to lose my Windows Operating system, while I am studying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I go to update it, I get green ticks for the compatibility to update.&nbsp; So after all this effort and almost 4 hours later without being able to update windows 10 home,&nbsp; I decided to upgrade to the creators Fall version.&nbsp; However that also failed and
 came up with the same error code 0xc1900208.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer information:&nbsp; Windows 10 Version 1607 build 14393.1198&nbsp; x64 based processor.</p>
<p>Processor is AMD FX 4170 Quad Core Processor 4.2Ghz.</p>
<p>16 GB RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please offer any help with regarding this.&nbsp; or is there a way to reinstall windows without losing any on my programs.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Trevor,<br />
<br />
Corrupted Windows update components are one of the possible reasons why this issue is happening. We recommend using the Windows update troubleshooter and see if it helps. Click this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027322/windows-windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> and download the troubleshooter.<br />

<p>Thanks for your prompt reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded the troubleshooter, after each attempt&nbsp; to update and applied the fixes they recommended without any success.&nbsp; &nbsp;The update would get to 87% and then reset and start again.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I tried the upgrade to creators fall download got to 100%
 But I still got the error code.&nbsp; I am not sure what to do next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a suggest to make changes to the registry, but I am not willing to do that as I could make things worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further assistance would be appreciated to resolve this issue.</p>

                    <p>I have a HP Pavilion 15-p076sa Notebook PC (ENERGY STAR) which I got January 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since upgrading to Windows 10 - I haven't been able to wake my laptop whenever I put it to 'Sleep' mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because I can't wake the machine I've had to hold down the power button to shut down the computer and start it up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only is this annoying especially if I have a program(s) open but it can't be good for the laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't have this issue before the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise (in layman's terms) what I need to do to get this working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or I'll have to return to Windows 8.1.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Unable to change read only settings on folders</h2>
                    I am unable to change my read only folders. It says I have to change it using administrator settings, but when I click continue in the dialog box nothing happens. I checked in settings and I am logged in as an administrator yet I can't change anything.
 Help as this causes a lot of apps to not work that use the document folder as default

            Hello,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can refer to the below steps to provide full permission to a particular file or folder.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.Select the file or folder which you need to provide&nbsp; full permission.</div>
<div><br />
2.Now right click on that file or folder and click on Properties.</div>
<div><br />
3.Click on the Security tab.</div>
<div><br />
4.Click on the user account through which you are logged in. Clicking on the user will show you the permissions set for the user pertinent to the folder.</div>
<div><br />
5.After you have viewed the permissions that are already set, you can now click on the Advanced Button that is right below the "Permissions for Authenticated Users".</div>
<div><br />
6.Once you have clicked Advanced, a box would appear, the "Permission Entries" box, which shows all the permissions that are set for the users.</div>
<div><br />
7.Now, after you have spotted the&nbsp; user whose permissions you wish to change, click "Change Permissions".</div>
<div><br />
8.Click on the user you would like to edit, and then click the option that says "Change Permissions" which is right below the box. To change permission you have to click on&nbsp; edit.</div>
<div><br />
9.Once edit is clicked, you are going to get the same box pop up but this time you can actually edit the options. You can do that by clicking the "Administrators" user again, and this time, you are going to click the "Edit" option.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Hope this would help. If issue still persists post back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</div>

            <p>I followed your steps but when I tried to apply the new settings I got a windows security dialog box saying</p>
<p>"An error occurred while applying security information to C:\GregHopkins\Docume...\Amazon downloader Logs"</p>
<p>Failed to enumerate objects in the container. Access is denied."</p>
<p>When I hit continue the alert remains. I hit cancel and another dialog box comes up.</p>
<p>"If you stop the propagation of permission settings, it might lead to an inconsistent state where objects have different settings. If you made this change by mistake, you should apply the correct permission settings immediately"</p>
<p>Again hitting continue the alert remains so I hit cancel. Bottom line I could not get the settings to change.</p>

            I keep trying to fix this problem. When I uncheck the read only box I get a confirmation window and the a window that say's "you will need to provide administrator permission to change these attributes" click continue to complete this operation. But when
 I click continue nothing happens and the change doesn't happen. Before it just asked for my administrator name and password but it doesn't do that anymore.<br />

            <p>Yes you have an Administrator profile but are not the Owner of the folder or files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't hit cancel when you receive the <em>Failed to enumerate objects message.</em> Keep clicking OK. That did the trick for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ownership can be a tricky matter. Look for Folders and Files Ownership in google for precise tutorials.</p>

<p>There's a right triangle arrow at the bottom to expand, and see the my reply, but not at the top.</p>

<h2>            Surface RT and Workgroups</h2>
                    Trying to connect Surface RT to a home network.<br />
Can it connect to a Workgroup? Out of the box, it indicates the Workgroup is unavailable; but the "Change" button indicates it is the default WORKGROUP. I changed it to the name of my home workgroup, and it indicated that it was changed (required reboot, etc.)
 and If I open the Change Settings dialog, it reports correctly there, while still returning "unavailable" in the PC Properties.<br />
<br />
It is not finding the Homegroup I just created.<br />
<br />
Just wondering.<br />

            <p>I am also seeing this issue. That link does not really say anything useful. Sorry, but I also have an additional issue, and that is this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) I am part of a workgroup (I do not want to be part of a domain nor a homegroup for my setup)</p>
<p>b) I can access my other 5 systems from the windows rt 8.1 system, but I can not connect to my RT system</p>
<p>c) prior to updating to 8.1, I had this working fine. I could access my RT system from my other systems.</p>
<p>b) basically I could share a directory or a drive on my RT system, but I seem not to be able to do this now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any additional thoughts would be very useful</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I only got the surface a few weeks ago, so it was upgraded within a week of purchase. I think my issue comes from using a Microsoft ID on my Surface and a Local Account on most of the computers at home (which adds its own special problems regarding SkyDrive
 with 8.1)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have one other computer on which I use a Microsoft Account, but the other family members use local accounts. I cannot see that computer's shares from any other computer in the workgroup, on which I use a local account, nor can I see shares on the other
 computers from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure if your situation is similar, but I am guessing that you may have switched to a Microsoft Account when you upgraded, as it is a rather roundabout method required to keep a local account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 virus and trojans</h2>
                    I purchase a brand new computer installed w/windows 10. &nbsp;It was full of trojans, viruses and worms that took over the whole computer one of them is called kaboob face, another mint, cant get them off, computer screen is blue with warnings about computer
 being compromised. &nbsp;Hate windows 10, as this is the second computer windows 10 wiped out on me in a month. &nbsp;The laptop does not turn on after upgrading fro windows 7 to 10. &nbsp;Is there a way to get the virus off the new windows computer w/o it costing me money
 as opposed to sending computer back. &nbsp;And as far as the laptop, which is only 2 years old I cant even recover the files off off that computer.

            Hate this!... Same thing happened to me... Brand new computer, lasted two months... HP computer... Never again... Never had this problem with an Apple Mac... I spent over $70 on security and firewalls and basically wasted my cash on McAfee.

<p>
</p><p>I know that XP support is no longer active.</p>

Unfortunately no, the file for Windows Server 2003 is not supported, link to the WindowsXP file is no longer exist. You should look for the file WindowsXP-KB955704-x86-ENU.exe on a torrent.

            <p>I'm having the exact same problem, did anyone find a link for this (or can any microsoft mod just email me the file).</p>
<p>As to answer the questions posed above, I have an XP netbook which is never connected to the internet (used for word processing only for onsite jobs where internet is not available) and I recently purchased a 64gb SD card to move the data to a home computer.</p>
<p>I understand that microsoft will not continue to support xp and make it compatible with all new technologies etc... but is there any reason that a pre-existing patch for a basic hardware that was released years ago can't be maintained! Is it the 10 cents
 of server space to host a less than 1 mb file! I bought my netbook 5 years ago, and arguably since windows 10 came out there was no other viable windows update that could be considered an improvement, and now my netbook does not have the specs for windows
 10 and I am on a tight budget without the ability to purchase a new one currently. I did not purchase windows XP with the expectation that after 5 years all old patches and support would be retroactively made inaccessible.</p>
<p>Please do not throw loyal consumers under the bus and fix this link!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 stop error UNMOUNTABLE BOOT VOLUME</h2>
                    I have an older laptop and the thing might just be dying. However if i can solve this id like to. If i try to start it up one of two things happen. First, i get the error i mentioned... then it attempts to perform automatic repair... and eventually goes
 to blackscreen infinitely till i turn it off and try again. Anyone else ever see this before?

<p>Check the BIOS settings for the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A drive can work in a number of modes as far as the BIOS is concerned, the actual terms will depend on the computer but look for descriptions such as IDE or Legacy, AHCI or RAID. If the mode gets changed then this message can show where it starts to boot
 then crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try some of the other options and see if it will boot. If it does then the question is why has it changed, most commonly due to a end of life CMOS battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if the repair is dependent on accessing files from the drive then it will have problems. Try booting from recovery media and doing the repair from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That does not mean it can't be the computer but if this works then you have a respite.</p>

<p>No. You do not need the original GTA: IV disc to play TBoGT. You can simply use EFLC disc and you will still be able to play &nbsp;TBoGT with players from EFLC and original GTA: IV. R* fixed their "version" problem with TBoGT that was present in TLaD.</p>

<p>You do need a disc to play it, there are like 3 different discs.</p>
<p>This is just what I know, I'm sure there may be more to it that this but this is what I know as fact.</p>
<p>EFLC has that and TLaD</p>
<p>Then there is I believe a disc with all three GTA IV and its two add ons</p>
<p>Then you can use the standard GTA IV disc and load your downloaded Ballad.</p>
<p>Also believe you can get GTA IV on Games on Demand and load it up with no disc needed at all, as long as you have the DLC installed you should be good to go.</p>

<p>I No Way I, you don't need the original GTA: Iv disc to play TBoGT. That is what EFLC is for. EFLC has both DLCs (TLaD and TBoGT) already on the disc. So technically you don't NEED the original GTA: IV disc to play TBoGT. If you WANT the original GTA: IV
 disc, then follow what I No Way I said, OP. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>R* fixed their version problem from TLaD with TBoGT, allowing players from both the EFLC version and DLC version to be able to play together.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>It is hard to tell though because the OP didn't specify if he wishes to play the DLC-version or the one from EFLC.</p>
