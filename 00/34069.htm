            <p>When trying to play your local .swf files in the Windows Media Player, you will probably be met with a message saying that your Internet Explorer security settings do not allow this file type (ActiveX Control) to be opened. This stems from the fact that
 Windows Media Player uses as its own security settings the Internet Explorer Security. Therefore, these .swf files will play quite happily within Internet Explorer; the reason being that Protected Mode is OFF when a local disk file is opened. But Windows Media
 Player makes no such concessions, all ActiveX controls are forbidden.</p>
<p>The problem arises in the Local Machine Zone Lockdown feature. Windows Media Player needs to load the Flash Player control to play the SWF file. But this Lockdown prevents the automatic loading of the Flash Player control (remember, all controls are deemed
 unsafe in WMP)!</p>
<p>However, don't despair. This issue can be easily resolved by a simple modification to the Registry. There are two ways you could do this - pick the one that you feel more comfortable with.</p>
<p><br />
Method 1 - Automatic Registry Change (Use this if you have never used the Registry Editor before):<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Open a new Notepad document. Copy and Paste the following two lines of text to the blank document...</p>
<p>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Lockdown_Zones\0]<br />
"1200"=dword:00000000</p>
<p>Save the document as "wmp_swf.reg" (the .reg extension defines the file as a Registration Entry). Save it to a location of your choice. This could be the Desktop or your Documents folder. Close the Notepad window.</p>
<p>Now locate the file at the location where you just saved it. Right-click on the file and choose "Merge" from the menu. Windows may ask for permission to continue, so click "Continue" or "OK". That's it! Windows Media Player will now play all your local .swf
 files without complaint.</p>
<p><br />
Method 2 - Manual Registry Change (For the more experienced Registry Editor user):<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Open the Registry Editor (ie Run "regedit.exe" and give Windows permission to continue).</p>
<p>Navigate your way to the following folder...</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Lockdown_Zones\0</p>
<p>In this folder "0" (zero), locate the entry "1200 REG_DWORD 0x00000003 (3)" in the viewing pane.</p>
<p>Right-click on the "1200" and choose "Modify..". Change the highlighted value of "3" to "0". Press OK. The entry will now show as "1200 REG_DWORD 0x00000000 (0)". Close the Registry Editor.</p>
<p>This simple procedure now allows Windows Media Player to play local .swf files.</p>
<p><br />
Now you've completed this fix, it might be a good idea to change the default opening program for your .swf files to Windows Media Player. I find it more convenient than playing them through Internet Explorer.<br />

<blockquote>Is there a codec that will allow swf files to play in WMP?</blockquote>
<p><br />
Strange you posted that. Only yesterday, my relative e-mailed me a FLV attachment, and when I tried to open it in WMP, it said somehting like " WMP doe not recognize flv format, but it might be able to play it if you want to " So I clicked Yes . It actually
 played.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my suggestions are ....</p>
<p>1. Use a swf to avi converter such as this one :<br />
<a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/WEB-Design/Flash/swf-avi.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.softpedia.com/get/Internet/WEB-Design/Flash/swf-avi.shtml</a><br />
Note: it is a &nbsp;<strong>free</strong> video converter.<br />
<br />
2. Install VLC player. Also a free program. VLC can play just about any video file formats.<br />

<p>It thinks it is now&nbsp;installed on a new computer.</p>
<p>Just contact Microsoft and explain the situation to them that you changed the hard drive.</p>

<h2>            How to sync laptop with windows 8.1 to tablet with windows 8 pro</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have searched everywhere, nothing has solved the problem. &nbsp;So on my latptop with win 8.1, I have tried using Sync Center but it tells me "there are no new sync partnerships that can be setup on this computer," my Manage offline files link doesn't work
 so I can't go to a folder and click it to make it available offline. &nbsp;I even tried connecting the tablet to the laptop to see if I could sync it that way, but win 8.1 doesn't recognize the tablet it tells me it doesn't recognize it that it is malfunctioning,
 but I just recently bought the tablet so I doubt it is that it works perfectly fine. I am also not trying to store all my info into the onedrive to try and sync it that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>
</p><p>Or you can use a tool like Microsoft SyncToy to do the same job.</p>

<h3> mitchhoogerhuis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Killer Instinct ranked progression not being saved on Windows 10 Technical Preview 14316</h2>
                    <p>The problem I am currently facing is that when I play Killer Instinct online, anytime that I play on the PC version of the game, my ranked ladder progress is never saved to the servers. All of my other data (like matches I fought and experience gained) is
 saved except for the ranked ladder progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Xbox Support Twitter told me to come to these forums to ask for advice as someone else that works for Microsoft on Twitter told me that a privacy setting needs to be enabled. I have all of my privacy setting enabled and I'm not able to have the ranked
 ladder progress saved so I don't know if I need to adjust anything else.</p>

            Xbox Support was the place that told me to come here. I was told by them that the problem lies within a privacy setting in Windows 10 as I'm able to save my progress on the Xbox One version of the game.

            SOLVED: I found the fix to this. You can still block everything in the privacy settings, but everyone having this issue is using Spybot Anti-Beacon. You can block everything except ONE specific thing called "Telemetry Services", after that youre good!

    <title>jagged edges on Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikaelg73  say:</h3>
<h2>            jagged edges on Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>I have a question. I have an Xbox One connected with the HDMI cable that comes with the console. But in most of the games there are very much jagged edges? Is it something I have forgotten to configure or is the HDMI cable poor or is my TV not so good? Its
 a Sony 32 inch witch only 720p resolution. The games are playable so its not total bad, but its a little bit strange with much jagged edges on the latest console.</p>
<p>Need some help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi thebest73, </p>
<p>If you cannot change the resolution try messing with some other settings. For example if you're using 24hz refresh rate try using 50hz and vise verse. If that doesn't work try some other settings. Also, if you have another HDMI cable try using that as well.

Above is M?S's advice for it.<br />
<br />
It could be Malware stopping you.<br />
<br />
Scan your computer with&nbsp;the 2 Programs below, one at a time:<br />
<br />
<p><a href="http://www.spybot.info/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.spybot.info/en/index.html</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Spybot Search &amp; Destroy 1.6.2 is a very good, FREE Anti-Spyware Program.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update, and immunize your System with it.</span></p>
<p><span>Then SCAN with it.</span></p>
<p><span>Update it, and scan your System once a fortnight.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>For the Free version scroll down their page to either download from
</span></p>
<p><span>Download.com, or Major Geeks.com</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Important re: Safe Mode</span></span></p>
<p><span>If you happen to find a problem that you can’t uninstall / delete, reboot the computer, and go into Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>To get into Safe mode, tap F8 right at Power On / Startup, and use UP arrow key to get to Safe Mode from list of options, then hit ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>RESCAN your computer with your Anti-Virus, Malwarebytes and Spybot S &amp; D while in Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>If unable to install above Programs in Normal Mode:</span></span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes Trojans, Viruses, Malware, etc stop you installing and/or updating Programs to remove them.</span></p>
<p><span>If that happens, reboot into Safe Mode with Networking (from F8 list of Startup Options), and install, update and scan from there.

<p>Fire up WMP. Choose the Burn tab. Drag and drop in files you want to be burned. I suggest you open Windows Explorer at the same time, find where your files are, select them and drag them to the burn area in WMP.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 &#34;This App Can&#39;t be opened&#34; &#40;error&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone, About half of my Windows 8.1 apps do work because when I try to open them I just get a message like this one that says "This App Can't Open" In big letter and then below this it says "Check the Windows Store for more info about Video [or whatever
 the app names is] (error). This is shown in the screen shot (I just choose the video app as an example).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce8381ab-ee2c-4ede-a122-12e75790e137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce8381ab-ee2c-4ede-a122-12e75790e137" /></a></p>
<p>The apps the that do work do not have an (error) next to their name (shown in the screenshots)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/565e1bc6-0822-461b-a6e2-b2c9e79ba17f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/565e1bc6-0822-461b-a6e2-b2c9e79ba17f" /></a>&nbsp;I
 have tried to running sfc/scannow, chkdsk, chkdsk /f but they have not fixed anything. I tried to boot into clean boot via msconfig. I tried running the Apps Troubleshooter and it will ask me to "Reset and Open the Windows Store" (shown in Screenshot Below)&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f806701-0909-44b4-8184-1a4159efca5f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f806701-0909-44b4-8184-1a4159efca5f" /></a></p>
<p>After I click on the button that say "Reset and open Windows Store" I see a command Prompt Window quickly open and close and then I will see the spinning Gears with WIndows Store Icon and then it will take me to the Homepage of Windows Store and then nothing
 else happens. After than I closed the Windows store. Then I opened the Start Screen and go to the Apps View and scroll all the way to the end of the page to check if most of the apps still get that error message when I open them and see if they still have
 (error) in gray letters next to them (which they still do). After that I went back to the Windows Apps Troubleshooter and click "next" at the "Display adapter drivers might be out of date" screen. The reason why I did this was because I wanted to do this later.
 When I tried updating the drivers for my display adapter it did not fix anything. I will try updating the drivers for my Display adapter again to an even newer version. Anyways back to Apps Troubleshooter, after I clicked on the "next" button, I am taken to
 "Troubleshooting has completed" screen. In the&nbsp;"Troubleshooting has completed" screen it show the different thing that it did to fix my Windows 8.1 apps and next to where it says both "Service registration is missing or corrupt" and "Windows Store cache may
 be missing or damaged" it says "Not Fixed. Then Next to where it says "Windows Store configuration may be damaged" it says "not fixed" (these problems are shown in the screenshot below).</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b384904-0159-47ee-bab0-03df18fb18da" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b384904-0159-47ee-bab0-03df18fb18da" /></a></p>
<p>I have even tried updating Windows 8.1 and that did nothing either. I have even tried running scans with Malware Bytes Antimalware and scans of C:\ windows, Downloads, Desktop, Program Files(x86), Program Files, Users, and Documents folders on my computer
 using Norton 360 and they found nothing. I also ran a scan using AdwCleaner just in case and it found some things but then it removed them and after a reboot, the affected Apps still had the same problem. Do you guys think it would be safe to delete the apps
 that are having the problem and re-install them. Also do you guys think that the problem that I'm having with my Windows Store Apps could be caused by Malware. Thanks, hope you guys can help me.</p>

    <title>Laptop screen does not turn on after removing from dock - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vodac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop screen does not turn on after removing from dock</h2>
                    <p>I primarily use 2 external monitors with my laptop (HP zBook 15) closed on the dock. With Windows 7, when I undocked the laptop and opened it, the screen turned on and I could pick up where I left off. Recently upgraded to Windows 10 and now when I undock
 and open the laptop all I get is a black screen. The computer is on and awake, but it seems to not register that the external monitors are no longer connected. I have to completely restart the computer to get the laptop screen to work after removing it from
 the dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a setting I have missed somewhere?</p>

            <p>Since it's a hardware function, you might need&nbsp;a new driver from HP, I'd definitely check that out.&nbsp; Almost every manufacturer has a "attention anyone upgrading to Windows 10" page with new drivers you'll need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing you might try as well after undocking (or before?) would be to press WindowsLogo+P to select the "user internal display" option and see if it pops back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do check at HP, you can see if they know of that being a known problem on that model of computer (another thing they might have on their Windows 10 compatibility page). HP may even have updates planned to address it.</p>

Hi Historian, <br />
<br />
Please do the following. <br />
<br />
Go to <b>Start</b>, <b>Run</b>, copy/paste this command and click OK: <b>services.msc</b><br />
(<i>if you don't have Run on the Start menu, hit Windows key + R</i>)<br />
<br />
In the list of Services, can you see <b>Background Intelligent Transfer Service</b> a.k.a. BITS?<br />
<br />
If it's not listed, please proceed as follows to register the BITS service.<br />
<br />
Open the Windows Search tool, copy/paste the following and then click Search: <b>
qmgr.dll</b><br />
<br />
Search should show that file in the following locations:<br />
<br />
C:\WINDOWS\system32<br />
C:\WINDOWS\ServicePackFiles\i386<br />
C:\WINDOWS\system32\bits<br />
<br />
Provided they're all present, do the following to register the service.<br />
<br />
Go to Start, Run and copy/paste: <b>regsvr32 qmgr.dll</b> and click OK<br />
<br />
Do the same with this file: <b>regsvr32 qmgrprxy.dll</b><br />
<br />
Reboot the system and then copy/paste this command into the Run field:<br />
<b>%windir%\System32\rundll32.exe setupapi,InstallHinfSection DefaultInstall 132 %windir%\inf\qmgr.inf</b><br />
<br />
If you're prompted to insert the Windows installation CD, ignore that and in the dialog box at the bottom, change the path to<b> C:\WINDOWS\ServicePackFiles\i386</b><br />
<br />
Restart the PC again and then go to <b>Services </b>and you should be able to see BITS in the list.<br />
<br />
Double click it and then on the <b>General </b>tab, click the <b>Start </b>button to try and start the service manually. This is just a test to ensure that it's working correctly.<br />
<br />
If you get <i>Error 2: cannot find the file specified</i>, go to Start, then Run again and copy/paste the following command and then click OK:<br />
<b>Reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\BITS\Parameters /v ServiceDll /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d %windir%\System32\qmgr.dll</b><br />
<br />
Reboot again and then try once more to start BITS. It should work properly now, but in the unlikely event that it fails again, run the following command and then hit Enter:<br />
<b>Reg add HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\BackupRestore\FilesNotToBackup</b><br />
<br />
Reboot once more and then do the following.<br />
<br />
Go to this link and install the&nbsp; IE8 cumulative November update:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41074" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41074</a><br />
<br />
Finally, go to the Windows Update site and you should be able to download normally.<br />

<h2>            Dual boot stopped working - windows 7 and 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title - Dual boot stopped working</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am suppose to be able to boot into Windows 10 on one partition and into Windows 7 on another partition of the same hard drive. It worked fine for a while, but not any longer. When I start my computer now, I'm automatically taken to Windows 10 and no longer
 get the screen with an option to choose the OS. The tech that set this up for me is no longer available to help me, so I'm hoping someone here can do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run an AVG scan with no detection of a virus. I ran SuperAntiSpyware with no malware being detected. Twice yesterday, I restarted and was given the choice so I booted into Windows 7 to run AVG, SuperAntiSpyware as well as TuneUp Utilities and that partition
 is fine. When I turned my computer on this morning, I was back to being taken directly to Windows 10 - no choice the rest of the day.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>During the boot if the time limit have not set then you will not get the option to select which operating system you want to login to, it will directly login to the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I suggest you to change the settings as below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press “Windows+R” it will launch the run command box.</li><li>Type as “MSCONFIG” and click on “OK”.</li><li>Go to “Boot” option, under “Timeout” enter the value as 30 seconds.</li><li>Then click on “Apply” and click ON “ok”.</li><li>Now reboot the computer and check whether you get the option to choose the operating system or not.</li></ol>

<h2>            Help uninstalling or repairing update KB976422</h2>
                    <p>This update was installed to Windows 7 x64 last year, with no apparent problems.&nbsp;This is now causing installation of&nbsp;SP1 to fail with
<span>ERROR_NOT_FOUND 0x80070490</span>. Details are&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/fi-FI/w7itproSP/thread/82b19367-bcb0-4fb2-8562-15a56a0306a1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">in this other thread</a>&nbsp;(my conclusion was that I need to

 uninstall KB 976422, as nobody knew how it could be repaired after having studied all the logs).</p>
<p>Trying to uninstall KB976422 from the Control Panel starts correctly, but then fails after the logoff that is part of the uninstall.&nbsp;It fails in the same way via start /w pkgmgr...</p>
<p>Is there a way to manually remove this update so that it stops blocking SP1 installation? I have all the logs of the failed removal attemps available.&nbsp;Thanks!</p>

            <p>Here is how I was able to solve this:</p>
<p>- In Registry Editor, I deleted (after backing each one up) all keys and values&nbsp;containing "976422". Some values inside "PackageDetect" couldn't be deleted, but that was OK.</p>
<p>- After the above, and without rebooting, I uninstalled the KB 976422 update via Programs and Options</p>
<p>- This time (unlike when it failed) it did not ask for a reboot, but I rebooted anyway</p>
<p>- After the reboot I checked for updates and Windows Update again showed KB 976422, which I decided to install (because my removal was "dirty", I thought it's better to reach a more complete status if possible)</p>
<p>- After installing KB 976422 it asked for a reboot</p>
<p>- At this point I could install SP1 without problems</p>
<p>I would not recomment the method I used as an elegant or safe solution, but as a last resort option when no other alternatives seemed to be available (also see the previous thread I pointed to in my first post), it worked for me. Let's hope that in the future
 Windows will not have such problems (and require such "solutions").</p>

<p>Hello jondoe 321,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.</p>
<p>From where did you download the LG PC Suite? Was it from LG or another website?<br />
Is it supposed to be compatible with Windows Vista? <br />
What is the error message you are getting?<br />
Has it ever worked? If yes, what changed in your environment such as installing software, updates, etc?</p>
<p>Since it seems that you do have it installed, I would go to Safe Mode and see if you can run it from there.<br />
<span>Start the program in safe mode<br />
</span><span>1. Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key (it may be a different function key on your computer) on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems,
 you can press the F8 key when you see the boot menu.</span></p>
<p><span>2. When the Windows Advanced Options menu appears, select Safe Mode, and then press Enter.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Log onto Windows by using the Administrator account or any user account with the Administrator privilege.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: In Safe Mode, your system display and Desktop will look and perform differently than in Normal Mode. This is only temporary. To return the system back to Normal Mode, we
 can simply restart the computer.<br />
</span><span><br />
To determine whether the issue that occurs with the program is caused by another program that is running in the background, we recommend that you restart the computer in safe mode and then test the program. If the program runs correctly in safe mode, but does
 not run correctly in normal mode, there likely is another program that is conflicting with the program in question.
<br />
<br />
You might also want to try and install again, this time installing with an elevated privilege. Right click on the downloaded file or setup.exe and select "Run as Administrator".
<br />
<br />
Next, run in Compatibility mode:<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the program is not compatible, then you may try to install and run the program in compatibility mode.
</span></p>
<p><span>Use the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on the Program</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Properties</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Compatibility tab
</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Run this program in compatibility mode and select Windows&nbsp;XP or whatever operating system the program was running successfully.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p><span>If the compatibility is not successful, then try and run
</span><span>the</span><span> Program Compatibility troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the
<span>Start</span> button.</span></p>
<p><span>Then click <span>
Control Panel</span>. In the search box, type <span>troubleshooter</span>, and then click
<span>Troubleshooting</span>. Under <span>Programs</span>, click
<span>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</span>. </span>
</p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>If you cannot install a program, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the troubleshooter, browse to the program's setup file, usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something
 similar. The troubleshooter is not designed to work on programs that have an .msi file name extension.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply back and let us know if this helped to resolve your issue or if you still need assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3> bob is interested  say:</h3>
<h2>            Controlling the size of C&#58; drive&#58;  How&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I noticed that C drive seems to be out of control. &nbsp;I want to use tiny SSD drives, 1 for each OS I play with so I need to be able to control the size of the files. &nbsp;But Windows, whether XP or 7, seems to just balloon and gets bigger and bigger the longer
 its used. &nbsp;Documents and Settings: &nbsp;Is there any way of putting this fattening pig of a folder on a different partition? &nbsp;Will it affect performance at all if its not on C drive? &nbsp;Some Programs don't care where they're installed but I notice others demand
 to be on C. &nbsp;Like Microsoft Office which is a larger program. &nbsp;There are folders on C like Common Files that seem to increase in size as well. &nbsp;Can I delete some of these files from time to time?; &nbsp;WOW in C:\Windows is out of control as well. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;When you install programs (e.g. like Office) there's usually the option to do a custom install.&nbsp; If you select this option, you'll see where you can specify where to put the program.&nbsp; You can move the paging file to another drive via the advanced options
 tab of the Control Panel's System applet.</p>
<p>From the Windows 7 Help feature, here's how to redirect the Documents folder:</p>
<p>"<strong>To redirect a folder to a new location</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click the <span>Start</span> button <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcontent.windows.microsoft.com%2fBetterWhenConnectedHelpWS%2fGetContent.aspx%3fassetID%3d4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33%26amp%3bdocumentSet%3den-US%26amp%3bProd%3dWIN700%26amp%3bMarket%3dUS" />,
 and then click your user name.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Right-click the folder that you want to redirect, and then click
<span>Properties</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the <span>Location</span> tab, and then click
<span>Move</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Browse to the location where you want to redirect this folder. You can select another location on this computer, another drive attached to this computer, or another computer on the network. To find a network location, type two backslashes
 (<span>\\</span>) into the address bar followed by the name of the location where you want to redirect the folder (for example, \\mylaptop), and then press Enter.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the folder where you want to store the files, click <span>
Select Folder</span>, and then click <span>OK</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the dialog that appears, click <span>Yes</span> to move all the files to the new location."</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Two other things that can grow are the Recycle bin and System Restore backup images.&nbsp; You can set limits for both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

            <p>I usually do the first suggestion, already done the second. &nbsp;Also, its just common sense to have all your programs with all of their preferences and settings off of C so when Windows crashes and dies (it does this to all of us sooner or later) you can just
 quickly reinstall and your programs are back up to speed. &nbsp;For me it takes about 10 hours to get all my programs installed and working the same as before because it seems to be impossible to back up anything with any reliability. &nbsp;Its like Microsoft just wants
 to bury their head in the sand and not admit to the OS's limitations. &nbsp;Hey - Apple is exactly the same. &nbsp;Everything packed on the main drive. &nbsp;Its just total idiocy. &nbsp;Not sure if Linux is any better. &nbsp;Perhaps I should seek out portable installs in the future
 as often as possible?</p>
<p>You mention the Documents folder. &nbsp;I think you mean My Documents. I never use My Documents as that seems to be designed for clueless people incapable of even creating their own subfolder in the folder of their choice. And its just a shortcut. &nbsp;Whoever designed
 this layout should never be let near a computer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I'm in Windows Explorer I just go to File, New, Folder and BAM! &nbsp;There's a new folder. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Never use System Restore. And obviously Recycle Bin is emptied frequently. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I said I wanted to move Documents and Settings. &nbsp;Its that pig of a folder under C with Administrator, All Users, Default User, etc that just gets fatter and fatter and fatter. &nbsp;Application Data and Local Settings are the big ones to be concerned with under
 Administrator where almost all the data is. &nbsp;There must be a way of trimming this cow. &nbsp;What about MSOCache? &nbsp;Under C:\Windows there are more pigs. &nbsp;$hf_mig$ is almost a 1gb, Installer is 2gb, assembly is 2gb, Microsoft .Net is 1gb, ie8updates is 600mb, sysWOW64
 is 600mb, SoftwareDistribution is 300mb.<br />
Those are the worst. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Time to put Microsoft on a leaner consumption program!</p>
<p>Any suggestions for trimming the pig?</p>
<p>It would be so great to be able to use a 30gb SSD drive for just the OS but I don't know if this is possible with Windows always expanding.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to get some space on your C drive try to run a <strong>diskcleanup.</strong></p>
<p>For that press on window key and the letter R together then you will get a run window over there type as
<strong>cleanmgr </strong>then press on OK.&nbsp; Then initiate it after some time it will show the results you can select all of then and press on OK then it will be removed no need to worry only unwanted files will be displayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second way is that try to remove all the unwanted programs from the computer. To do that press on start - Control panel- select&nbsp; add and remove programs then remove all the programs that you are not using.</p>

<p>I noticed that C drive seems to be out of control. &nbsp;I want to use tiny SSD drives, 1 for each OS I play with so I need to be able to control the size of the files. &nbsp;But Windows, whether XP or 7, seems to just balloon and gets bigger and bigger the longer
 its used. &nbsp;Documents and Settings: &nbsp;Is there any way of putting this fattening pig of a folder on a different partition? &nbsp;Will it affect performance at all if its not on C drive? &nbsp;Some Programs don't care where they're installed but I notice others demand
 to be on C. &nbsp;Like Microsoft Office which is a larger program. &nbsp;There are folders on C like Common Files that seem to increase in size as well. &nbsp;Can I delete some of these files from time to time?; &nbsp;WOW in C:\Windows is out of control as well.&nbsp;

<span>You can <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
move your My Documents folder</a> (this is not the only thing in Documents and Settings, but often is the largest of the subfolders).<br />
<br />
As an example, the "Documents and Settings" folder in my user profile in my XP box is 8.6 GB.&nbsp; Of this, 4.1 GB is My Documents, 2.6 GB is Local Settings, and 1.8 GB is Application Data.&nbsp; Further, essentially all of the 2.6 Local Settings subfolder is another
 Application Data subfolder. </span><span>Use
</span><span><a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">JDiskReport</a></span><span> on your system to see what
 specific folders/files are taking up the space.</span><br />
<span><br />
You can look at the various subfolders in C:\Documents and Settings\user\Local Settings\Application Data and
</span><span>C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data to see which applications are taking up space.&nbsp; You can then determine if these applications provide some means of configuring where they put
 their data. <br />
</span><span><br />
I'm not sure what you're referring to as "WOW in C:\Windows."&nbsp; Are you running World of Warcraft?<br />
<br />
If you do frequent installs and/or updates, your \Windows\Installer folder may grow.&nbsp; If so, you may want to look into msizap.exe (but read up on it first).<br />

            <p>No - I'm not syphillis. &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>I already told everybody I don't use My Documents. &nbsp;My Documents is for beginners who can't create and organize their own files. &nbsp;My Documents is a stupid idea because its only a shortcut. &nbsp;It could be anywhere. &nbsp;People should never work with shortcuts.
 &nbsp;It gives them a false idea of the proper layout of their system. &nbsp;Just my opinion....</p>
<p>Msizap isn't compatible with XP 64bit.</p>
<p>The WOW file is in every Windows install. &nbsp;I'm surprised you've not heard of it. &nbsp;Its a big pig of a file. &nbsp;And it grows with use. &nbsp;I don't think you can even reduce it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Disk Cleanup is the most useless program Microsoft has ever come up with. &nbsp;I guess if you work with shortcuts instead of real files so you don't have a clue where anything is it might be of use to a beginner. &nbsp;</p>
<p>System Restore - never use it. Uses up lots of resources.</p>
<p>Disk Indexing -&nbsp; never use it. Uses up lots of resources. </p>
<p>Hibernation -&nbsp; never use it. Uses up lots of resources. </p>
<p>Browser cache - my browser's cache is emptied often.</p>
<p>----------------------</p>
<p>So instead of useless Microsoft links that will never admit to deficiencies in their hopelessly deficient OS, how about a way of actually moving Documents and Settings to a different partition? &nbsp;Or any of the other points I made? &nbsp;There seems to be either
 nubies here or Microsoft lackies. &nbsp;Anybody here that thinks for themselves? &nbsp;Not afraid of speaking their mind?</p>
<p>The problem is the actual design of the OS. &nbsp;That's why you'll never find a solution in the Microsoft world. &nbsp;You have to go outside of that world. &nbsp;Surely you people aren't as blinded as the Apple zombies! &nbsp;There is a world out beyond the gates of these
 large conglomerates! &nbsp;:)</p>

<br />
You never mentioned XP 64 (which was never particularly popular and not very widely used).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
WOW (aka WoW or Windows on Windows) is used in "normal" Windows XP (32-bit) to run legacy 16-bit apps.&nbsp; It consists of a few files, mostly WOW32.dll, and no folder at all.<br />
<br />
Are you contending that the <span style="font-weight: bold">file</span> increases in size?&nbsp; Or did you just mistype "file" for "folder" (or directory, if you prefer)?&nbsp; It seems unlikely that a system file is itself changing in size.<br />
<br />
In 64-bit Windows, WoW64 is used to run 32-bit apps.&nbsp; Given that there are far more 32-bit apps than 16-bit apps, it's not surprising that the WOW subsystem is bigger in your 64-bit Windows.&nbsp; And if you say so, I'll believe that there's a WOW folder in XP 64-bit
 too.<br />

This statement suggests that your real purpose in posting is to complain rather than seek help.&nbsp; You asked for ways to deal with problems caused by the way Windows is designed.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Complaining that there are other potentially better ways to write an operating system is not useful.<br />

            &nbsp;Since you choose to talk about bad ideas, I suggest that trying to put 10 pounds of stuff in a 5 pound bag is an exercise in futility.&nbsp; If you want Windows on an SSD, get a 64 gig one.&nbsp; As LemP points out, coming here primarily to complain is not such
 a great idea either.&nbsp; :-(

<p>Ah....I thought it was displayed somewhere in my profile. &nbsp;But obviously people aren't going to check that every time they reply. &nbsp;Good point. &nbsp;I'll make sure I mention that in the future and yes I realize its not widely used. &nbsp;Thanks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt; WOW (aka WoW or Windows on Windows) is used in "normal" Windows XP (32-bit) to run legacy 16-bit apps. It consists of a few files, mostly WOW32.dll, and no folder at all.</p>
<p>In mine there's this folder called SysWOW64. &nbsp;Its 10gb and growing. &nbsp;I googled it to see if its possible to trim or delete but the consensus was that its just one of those Windows things you just have to accept. &nbsp;Maybe in the future somebody figure out a
 way of reducing its size. &nbsp;Or maybe I just didn't find it online. &nbsp;I don't know how big it gets but I think mine has tripled in size in the last few months or so. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>I guess what grates me the wrong way about Microsoft is, like most any large company, they can never admit to the slightest deficiencies in either design or execution. &nbsp;Plus the links are mind boggling unhelpful. &nbsp;"Microsoft Help" is just not helpful in
 the slightest to just about anybody but the people that wrote the lines of code. &nbsp;Hardware Troubleshooter as well. &nbsp;What is incredible is these deficiencies never get fixed. &nbsp;And the public just rolls with it. &nbsp;Its like a car that always gets flats because
 the tire suppliers are lousy and the car manufacturer never seeks a better supplier. &nbsp;They just ignore it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That's where I'm coming from I guess. &nbsp;The thing is, unless more people voice their dissatisfaction, they will never change. &nbsp;If I was at the helm it would be infinitely more streamlined and logical. &nbsp;Guess that's easy to say and hard to do. &nbsp;But at least
 I'd admit my failings in the past. &nbsp;But perhaps if they do that they open the doors for endless litigations. &nbsp;</p>

                    I have a Lexmark s405 printer hooked up on my home wifi. I installed Windows 8 last week and I can't get the printer to install on my computer. I tried downloading the Lexmark software for Windows 7 and it wouldn't complete the download. I tried letting
 windows 8 do the download and after about 20 seconds it came up download failed. I tried both several times. Does anyone have a solution

            I've had difficulty getting the S405 driver to work on Windows 8, but it's now 100% after I did the following:<br />
1&nbsp;Find the Windows 7 64-bit driver LEXMARK_S400_wcr_64_en.exe from the Lexmark website.
<br />
2&nbsp;When downloading, don't run it, instead choose save as and select a folder to save it to on your computer.<br />
3&nbsp;Right click on the file name LEXMARK_S400_wcr_64_en.exe and select Troubleshoot Compatibility.<br />
4&nbsp;In the Select troubleshooting option window, select Troubleshoot program.<br />
5&nbsp;In the What problems do you notice window, select the first option:<br />
&nbsp;The program worked in earlier versions of windows but won't install or run now.<br />
6&nbsp;In the Which version of Windows did this program work on before? window select Windows 7.<br />
7&nbsp;When you click Test the program, it installs and works perfectly.<br />
