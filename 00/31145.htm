You also can hold Control key (Ctrl) and rotate mouse wheel to change icons size on desktop.<br />
<br />
To make your taskbar icons larger, right click it - Properties - then uncheck "Use small icons" - click Ok.<br />
<br />
Otherwise you may check to adjust screen settings, right click on desktop - Personalize - Display (bottom left, first item).</p>
<p>You will then see this window from where you can do lots of changes.</p>

                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been getting this "how do you want to open this .msi file?" prompt twice every time I boot up my computer and it comes back every hour or so. When click "ok" to use windows installer to open the file, it tells me, "the windows installer service could
 not be accessed. this can occur if the windows installer is not correctly installed. contact your support personnel for assistance" I've had my desktop for a little over a year now and so it's not a brand new computer. It also just disappears when I click
 outside of the prompt box. Pls help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi Melody, there is some installer stuck on your Windows Startup, you need to find that and delete it . . 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Task Manager and indeed Msconfig offer only limited control over Startup items . . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility that does not require installation 
<br />
<br />When the file downloads, unzip it. 
<br />
<br />Depending on your system, run Autoruns or Autoruns64 as Administrator 
<br />
<br />With that utility, you can right click and delete any startup item in Windows 
<br />
<br />Look for any type of application installer in that list . . .
<br />
<br />Just be careful not to delete any required process . . . 
<br />

<h2>            Computer powers on when in sleep mode</h2>
                    <p>I have an alienware area 51 pc. I upgraded to windows 10. When my computer goes into sleep mode it basically powers off and boots from start like it had been powered off by shutting down windows. This happens either when I do start - power - sleep or if
 it goes into sleep mode after the default time set by windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can wake the computer by pressing the keyboard or mouse but again it boots from scratch, unlike my work pc where it just wakes up and I enter my password and keep working. I have hit windows + x and clicked on the command prompt and typed in powercfg -restoredefaultschemes
 and hit enter and then exited and it was of no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the power troubleshooter and it detected no problems. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like my home desktop to be like my work pc and not boot from the beginning like I had powered it off.</p>

    <title>high pitch frequency noises when playing audio windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the_wren_nest  say:</h3>
<h2>            high pitch frequency noises when playing audio windows 8</h2>
                    <p>The problem I have occurs randomly when playing back audio of any form (youtube, mp3 in WMP, movies, etc.). Randomly, when I click to play a media file with audio it will be overlaid which painfully loud high frequency pitched squeaks and noises. Many layers
 of frequencies with a lower frequency that usually slowly progresses into higher pitch frequency. If I stop the playback of the file the noises stop. If I play again almost 9 times out of 10 the audio will play fine. I have been dealing with it by turning
 stopping and starting the media file until the noises go away. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea what may be going on or what I could try? I have deleted and re-installed new audio drivers to no avail. I hope my description of the noises makes sense.

            Hi Brandon,<br />
<br />
Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1:</b> I would suggest you to run audio troubleshooter&nbsp; and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
<p>
<span>a) Press the ‘Windows + W’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p>
<span>b) Type troubleshooter in the search box and then press enter.</span></p>
<p>
<span>c) Click hardware and sound and click on ‘Playing Audio’.</span></p>
<br />
<b>Method 2:</b> To update the driver using <span>Windows</span> Update
<ol>
<li>
<p>‌Open <span>Windows</span> Update in Control Panel by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping
<span>Search</span> (or, if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking
<span>Search</span>), entering <span><span>Windows</span> Update</span> in the search box, tapping or clicking
<span>Settings</span>, and then tapping or clicking <span>
<span>Windows</span> Update</span>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span>Check for updates</span>.</p>
<p>If there are any available updates, click the links to see more info about each update.
<span>Windows</span> Update tells you if an update is important, recommended, or optional. Each type of update might include drivers.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <span>Select the updates you want to install</span> page, look for updates for your sound card, select the check box for the driver that you want to install, and then tap or click
<span>OK</span>. </p>
<p>There might not be any available driver updates.</p>
</li><li>
<div>On the <span><span>Windows</span> Update</span> page, tap or click
<span>Install updates</span>.&nbsp; You might be asked for an admin password or to verify your choice.</div>
<p><span>Windows</span> Update will tell you if the updates were successfully installed.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Do get back and let us know the status of the issue, I will be glad to help you further. We, at Microsoft strive towards excellence.</span></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>This issue has been always occurring sine updating from windows 7 to windows 8. I have always installed updates from windows update hoping a fix would come with the updates. None so far. I tried the troubleshooter as well with no solution.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't seem to find a solution to the issue. Again, It is intermittent so perhaps I just need to assess what apps are open and programs are running when the issue occurs. It seems it must be related to how I am using the system at the time. If It were a
 driver issue you would think it would occur all the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will pay more attention to what programs are open and running when this occurs for future notes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ummm</p>
<p>ANY MP3 player really.</p>
<p>If you are truly looking for SIMPLE.</p>
<p>I would advise AGAINST, iPod or Zune, I have read too many posts on errors with both of them.</p>
<p>Really any MP3 player that DOES NOT come with it's own software, and can run off Windows Media Player is going to be your best bet.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 not being able to download - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> natasha234cd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 not being able to download</h2>
                    I upgraded to Windows 10, about a week ago, and it worked properly until I started messing with the wifi. Something happened and my network adapter was deleted, so the only way to fix this was to reset Windows 10 through control panel. Everything went
 fine until my laptop was stuck in an infinite loading screen of Windows 10 trying to install itself. It was stuck for a few hours and I decided to start all over again and reset my laptop, or install Windows 7 all over again. It installed Windows 7 completely
 fine and it worked well. Then I tried to download Windows 10 through the media creation tool. It started downloading and when it came to about 70 percent it just said that it was unable to download it and that I should reboot my computer. I tried downloading
 it but it gave me the same message a couple of times around the same percentage. So my question is if the problem may be that I have 198 windows updated since I installed windows 7 again.&nbsp;

    <title>Wacom Tablet not displaying after Window&#39;s 10 August update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trevorsmith8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wacom Tablet not displaying after Window&#39;s 10 August update</h2>
                    &nbsp; So after the August 2018 update of Windows 10 my tablet hasn't been working properly, to help understand the problem my tablet is a wacom cintiq (the fancy ones that display the screen as you draw) after the update I thought I had to update my driver,
 so I went to the website and downloaded the latest driver. After I downloaded it though it doesn't display the screen, the pen works just fine, but the screen isn't displaying. I checked under my device management and it seems it doesn't pick up the screen
 as a "display adapter" I uninstalled and reinstalled it, but it is still not working. I am the only one going through problems like this? Is this just something that Wacom needs to fix or is it something with my laptop? I'd appreciate any help I can get.&nbsp;

            Hi Trevor.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues with Windows Updates one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Being idle to the computer is not quite the same as the human view of being idle.&nbsp; Programs have the option to tell the system that they're not idle which could be happening here.<br />
<br />
Do you have something running on your computer which could possibly be sending input and therfore actually keeping your computer active?<br />
<br />
Also, out of curiosity, which screensaver to you have chosen and have you verified this behaviour with all of them?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jon<br />

<h2>            Using a power bank with the Surface Pro 4</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>with the not so great battery life on the Surface Pro 4, does anyone have suggestions on using a 'power bank' with the SP4?</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there any approved Microsoft power bank?</p>
<p>how does one connect the power bank to the SP4?</p>
<p>Can the USB point on the SP4&nbsp;be used to charge the device?</p>
<p>Are there&nbsp;any &nbsp;good third party or Microsoft approved DC charging cables?</p>
<p>alternatively are there charging cables with USB inserts into the power bank?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for your time and comments</p>
<p>

<p>You might want to look here for an external battery. http://www.mikegyver.com/products/</p>
<p>They are expensive but have a good reputation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the SP4 can <strong>only </strong>be charged thru the power/dock port.&nbsp;

    <title>Wrong WEP or WPA key&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wrong WEP or WPA key&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>So my network settings in my xbox have been the same since day one several years ago. Its connected to my wireless router through the duel antenna wireless adapter plugged into the back of the xbox. The security for the network is running WEP like it always
 has. Since a day ago however, my xbox can't seem to connect to the network leaving me with this message:</p>
<p>"Can't connect to your wireless network.</p>
<p>Your wireless network is secured with a WEP key or WPA passphrase. &nbsp;Your console may be using the wrong one.</p>
<p>On your PC, go to your router configuration webpage and write down your wireless network's WEP key or WPA passphrase."</p>
<p>Other gibberish that really isn't important. Like I said though, &nbsp;nothing has changed. The DCHP settings on my router have not been touched since it said in a solution to enable it. I'm giving it the right password to connect to my network as well. I also
 did as it told me to restart everything: My xbox network settings (back to factory), the adapter, and router/modem. I just really don't know what to do. It just came to an abrupt stop the other day without anything on my network changing. Any help would be
 appreciated! I hope I provided enough details, but any further information I would be glad to provide. Thank you!</p>

<h2>            How To Fix Hyper-V Problem&#63;</h2>
                    Hello Friends. Yesterday I posted A question about which windows I should buy. Later I ordered a Windows 8 Professional X64.<br />
After Installation of windows and other drivers of GPU,etc I went to "turn windows features" and enabled The "Hyper-V".<br />
<br />
After That I opened "Hyper-V Manager" And I clicked "connect to server" And Clicked "Local Computer" then I got a error:-<br />
<br />
An Error Occurred while attempting to<br />
connect to server "NARAYAN". Check That<br />
the virtual machine management service<br />
is running that you are authorized to<br />
connect to server.<br />
&nbsp;Hyper-V has not installed on computer <br />
"localhost"<br />
<br />
Please Help me I want to test a new Software by installing Windows XP Professional virtually.<br />
&nbsp;I could have try any other Virtualization Software but I didn't because I know that there is no company formed till now who can challenge the
<br />
softwares of Microsoft. MS Is always the Best.<br />
<br />

<span><strong>Thoughts for NHL 13</strong></span>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello NHL fans, I hope you are all enjoying the Stanley Cup Playoffs so far. Go Blackhawks! Oh wait... lol. In all seriousness though, as an NHL gamer that has been around forever,
 I have decided to post here a detailed list of what would be my perfect NHL 13 video game. (I do not have all NHL games played on this account, I have had multiple accounts since I have been on Xbox LIVE). My reason for doing this is so that hopefully I can
 get some feedback from you guys and I can hear some of your ideas as well as to what would be your perfect NHL 13 game. If you are a TRUE NHL fan, PLEASE read this and give me some of your input.&nbsp; And EA, if your reading this, listen up, because I speak for
 ALL NHL fans on here!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Keep in mind, these are just MY thoughts as to what I think would be an awesome NHL game. Please feel free to add your own or even add on to something I have written below. I would
 love for this to be an open discussion so we can all talk about the game before it comes out.<br />
</span></p>

<li><span><strong><em>Online focus</em></strong></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I mean by "Online Focus" is very simple. It means my perfect game would be more focused on the aspect of NHL on Xbox LIVE. This simply means that I would really like EA to focus
 on the online play for the NHL games geared TOWARDS Xbox LIVE. I feel like the games are updated and new features are added that the MAJORITY of NHL players hardly use. Be A Pro and GM mode is great, don't get me wrong when I say this. However, I think they
 are losing sight of where the majority of their fans are which is online in community and EASHL. Long story short, I think they should be more focused in enhancing the online portions of their game, cause all in all that's where the fun is and any true NHL
 fan could back me up on that.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong><em>Skating / Player movements</em></strong></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I think the title for this point is clear. I don't know how many of you have seen the "Road to NHL 13: Part III" video, but if you haven't, you NEED to! This video is amazing.
 If you really watch the video several times, you will realize how the skater movement is being made to look more realistic and fluid. I think this is a great and innovative focus and I'm glad to see they are taking the time to implement it in the game. Sometimes
 it's the little things that come together to make a game great and this is one of those little things. I want to leave this open to you all though, do we think this is enough, or do they need to implement more features that compliment this innovative feature
 itself? Let me know your opinion, I would love to hear it.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong><em>Refine the physics engine</em></strong></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I absolutely LOVE simply the thought of having physics in a game. When you look at games like Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3 by Rockstar Games, I mean, it just doesn't get any
 better than that. However, I believe that the hits that took place in NHL 11 were better looking and felt more intense than the hits in NHL 12. I just personally believe that the physics engine needs a boost of flavor. Some of the hits in NHL 12 just look
 silly sometimes. I know that every hit won't be the most perfect looking hit ever, but I do believe it can be better than what we have at the moment. Let me know of your thoughts.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong><em>Servers!!!</em></strong></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Again, I think the title speaks for itself here. I can't tell you how many NHL games I lag out of. In all honesty, it probably contributes to about half of my losses on my performance
 tracker... Now, before the trolls say... "Get off the Wal-Mart connection..." I must say this... I have a great internet connection and a great router. I find it funny that the ONLY, and I mean ONLY game I lag out of is NHL. Whenever I get on other EA titles
 or just other titles in general such as FIFA, Battlefield 3, Max Payne 3, Halo: Reach, Gears of War 3, I NEVER lag out of any game. I don't know if it is just me or if it affects anyone else out there. Also, I play with my brother online as well. We have two
 separate Xbox 360's that we play on. We play other games together all the time, and for some reason it's always NHL where we find ourself back at the main menu time and time again. You guys can add on to this if you want, but I think this is a huge problem
 that needs to be taken care of.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong><em>EASHL focus!</em></strong></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;I think a lot more focus needs to be placed on online play, as I have stated before. I'm not a programmer or developer, obviously, but I feel that simple things need to be added to
 the online play to make it more user friendly. Things like managing a club, recruiting other online players and friends, and overall look and feel need a tweek. I mean, you know it's bad when people are trying to recruit for clubs in the community chat box.
 They need to have a more centralized hub or network that surrounds online play. They need to create a centralized place where all transactions can be made fast and simply. I just feel as if the game is so cluttered with all this information and it takes forever
 to navigate through everything.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong><em>More frequent updates!</em></strong></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; As any gamer knows, games need updates in order to maintain a certain level of success. This game is TERRIBLE with updates... I am STILL playing with Marty Turco as my goalie with
 the Chicago Blackhawks... like... seriously? I haven't checked in a little while but still, long story short, this game needs more roster updates faster. If any of you have ever played any of the FIFA games, you will understand what I mean by quick updates
 that keep all the players in or out of the game depending on injuries, leaves, and transfers. And it's not even roster updates either. I just think in general this game needs more updates for just the overall gameplay as well. I see new glitch shots sometimes
 that I have never seen before and it seems like EA doesn't do anything about it to fix these things. This is frustrating, especially when you are trying to maintain a good club record and these are the things that are stopping you.</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span><em><strong>Community / Club</strong></em></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The only real thing I want to mention for this is goalies. When in community, I think they should give you the option to either allow or disallow goalies. I can't tell you how
 many games I have lost because goalies are just "messing around..." I think anyone who plays NHL knows what I'm talking about with this one.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><em><strong>Cheating, glitches, and lag outs...</strong></em></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Yes, we have all been here... The club games that you all of a sudden lose 3 - 0. The glitch shots and easy glitch moves to get around defensemen every single time to have a one on
 one with the goalie. I mean, I can't really say anything else here, they just need to straight up fix it. I hate losing games because of things like this. It's so frustrating to try and keep a good record when things like this happen. Don't get me wrong, I
 know that all games will have glitches and cheats, but they need to be faster and more successful at fixing these glitches. I remember back playing 09 the curve shot never got fixed and if you did it right it went in EVERY SINGLE TIME!</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><em><strong>Do NOT add player individuality</strong></em></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; They did this with FIFA and it failed miserably in my opinion. This is what it would be like for NHL 13. Well... Ovechkin is a better player than Kane, so let's make his stats way
 better... and... Brodeur is a much better goalie than Fluery, so let's make him so much quicker. If you are going to do things like this, DO IT RIGHT! It made FIFA so bad at one point. Keep in mind, these are just silly examples that I don't stand behind,
 it's just an example to show what I'm talking about. They made it to the point where Christiano Ronaldo could run down the entire field without even being touched... I mean, it just makes the game unbalanced. If you are going to do it, they have to do it in
 a way that makes the game balanced.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><em><strong>Improve the A.I.</strong></em></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; I'm happy to here that this IS one of the improvements that they are working on in the game. They state now that the computer players will not just focus on what is in front of them,
 but they will focus and pay attention to the entire ice... I will believe it when I see it, although I do have faith that they will do this correctly. How many times have you lost a game because a computer player passed the puck or gave it away in a situation
 that could have been totally avoided. Haha, I bet it's a lot!</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong><em>Improve human goalie movements</em></strong></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Make the human goalie movements more fluid and not so glitchy and "all over the place..." Some people can be so good at goalie, but let's face it, most are not. I think if they made
 the goalie controls a little easier and more fluid, more people would have a chance and be more successful at playing goalie.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><em><strong>And lastly, IMPROVE THE MENU SYSTEM!!!</strong></em></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; IMPROVE THE MENU SYSTEM! It is SO clustered and broken and it takes FOREVER to find what you want and it takes FOREVER to load! I think that's it for that one, just make the menu system
 more organized and faster.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for those who stuck with me in reading this. Please let me know what you think and don't be afraid to add some thoughts of your own. I would really be happy to hear from
 some of you because I want this game to be good just as much as you do.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; Take care!</span></p>

<p>That sounds good. I don't understand why the games would have to be full in order to do that though. I mean, you can still have players either not playing or playing poorly in games that are not full with players...</p>
<p>But I do like having the option nonetheless.</p>

<p>My buddy had an awesome idea last week while we were playing. Ok, here it goes....Don't freak on me but I agree with him.........Kinect! Nothing fancy or innovative, just simple things like voice commands for plays on the ice *PASS* *DUMP* *SHOOT*.......*KNOCK
 THE GOALIES HELMET OFF.....* Also for changing up the defense and face offs like holding the guy up. Simple shiznittery like that. I think it would be sweet. And maybe throw in the old *LOOP FACEOFF GLITCH* for S&amp;G's.</p>
<p>P.S......my copy of NHL 12 broke last weekend.....I'll miss the playoffs this month</p>

<p>EASHL &nbsp;has a lot of potential, but it needs to be fixed and improved big time. There needs to be better matchmaking for starters, because even though my team may not be very good, and I know we got into it late, getting hammered over and over by "pros" isn't
 a lot of fun. At least your pro should earn some points towards getting better after your team just got peppered. We finish our games no matter what, at least we should be rewarded for ir it. A W isn't everything. I mean it's not that other players are that
 much better but their players stats such as speed etc. are, it's just not fun nor is it fair. It reminds me of a turn based RPG, where you know you don't have a chance because your attributes are soo much lower. Also, improve the AI. I mean we as a team already
 suck, but they only add insult to injury with their crap plays or lack of. Just my 2 cents....</p>

            Driver compatibility would be the responsibility of the developer. We wouldn't have a clue if there plans to support that device or not. But, I would rollback to your previous version and find out from the developer when they specifically plan to add support for Windows 10 1709. Windows 10 1709 just released a few weeks ago, so, it will take developers to catch up.
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />If the problem persists, I recommend downgrading to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />You can downgrade to Windows 10 1703 by downloading the ISO at <a href="http://windowsiso.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsiso.net</a>

    <title>Can I use the money in my Microsoft account to part-pay for a purchase - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neil.mc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I use the money in my Microsoft account to part-pay for a purchase on the Xbox Marketplace&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, hope you can help. When MS Points were converted into my local currency I had £2.04 deposited into my Microsoft Account. Yesterday, I tried to buy something on the Xbox Marketplace that cost £3.39. What I want to do is spend the account money and then
 pay the balance on my credit card. Is this possible? I have a valid credit card attached to the account, but when I try and pay with it, it wants to charge the full £3.39. I can't select the Microsoft account balance in the first instance because the option
 is greyed out (I guess because the account balance is less than the purchase price. Any suggestions? Thanks! Neil.

<p>Are you trying to make this purchase on the website or the console? &nbsp;The website has issues since the currency conversion but making the purchase via the console should work. &nbsp;It will ask you if you would like to use the accounts currency as part of the
 purchase process. </p>

<p>I'm trying to make the purchase on the console. Payment defaults to the credit card. If I select 'Change Payment Options' I cannot select the £2.04 in my Microsoft account as an option. The amount is greyed out. Therefore, I can't even try to pay for anything
 with my outstanding balance.</p>
<p>Is there something I have to do to make the money available, or should it have happened automatically?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help. Sorry it took me a while to reply.</p>

<p>You have to start making the payment with your credit card. As you're making the purchase it will ask if you want to use the remaining currency in your account first and then charge the rest to your card.</p>

<p>No, the first step is change payment option. &nbsp;The MS balance is greyed out and cannot be selected. &nbsp;You can select a credit card there but then it takes you to confirm purchase and no extra step of using the MS balance toward the purchase.</p>
<p>Basically the MS balance is useless on most things except for the occasional XBLA game maybe. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Does game pass use you bandwidth&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have about 120 GB&nbsp;of bandwidth a month and I downloaded Halo 5 and it took 97GB but when I go to Games and Apps then go to Queue it just says installing so does it still have to download the games? Cause if that is how much it actually took then I'm screwed mabye that is why Game Pass is only $9.99 a month cause then u gotta pay extra for whatever bandwidth u go over</p>

            <p>No Game pass does not use bandwidith unless you download a game or if the game is connected in a multiplay game. &nbsp;Unlike playstations version of gamepass it does not stream the game code so the download is only once.</p>

            <p>If you're worried about going over your data cap, set your console to game "offline".&nbsp; Then, activate "online" only when you wish to download a game or play online.&nbsp; A buddy of mine has to do the same thing as he lives in a really rural area and runs off of a hotspot.</p>
