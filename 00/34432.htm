<h2>            Offline files and folders greyed out</h2>
                    I have several users that use offline files in Windows 7 that are having issues. Here is what happens;<br />
Users home directories are located on a Win2k3 server and they are synced to the local pc for offline service. The sync seems to work fine and after the folders syncronize I can place the folder offline and the files appear correctly. The problem arises when
 the users goes to our branch office..... <br />
when users are at this office they work offline, but the offline files and folders are greyed out and have an x on the icons and cannot access these offline files.

    <title>What is the role of Recycler Folder in drivers&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            What is the role of Recycler Folder in drivers&#63;</h2>
                    I am IT administrator in a company, one of my co-workers told me, what is the Recycler Folder in her hard drivers partition.<br />
I said it is built by OS windows XP and it is not a&nbsp; threat for your system, but she said her deleted files remain in this folder<br />
and she can not erase them. She thinks that is the spy software from someone to store her deleted files for restoring later.<br />
<br />
It would be grateful if someone could tell me the role of Recycler Folder in Hard drive partitions and also how to explain this to her.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            It's the Recycle Bin, tell her to empty the Recycle Bin.&nbsp; If files are stuck in the Recycle Bin you can delete the Recycler folder and Windows will recreate it when you reboot. From a command prompt issue the following command:<br />
<br />
rd /s /q c:\recycler<br />
<br />
If you have more than one drive you will have to issue the command for each drive, changing the c: with the appropriate drive letter. If you have more than one user on the machine all recycle bins will be emptied.<br />

<h2>            Last Windows 10 Update Problems</h2>
                    <p>When the last update had to be done on my laptop, it started the downloading of the update. After it started loading, it halted and ask for a bootable disk to continue. I have tried so many ways to get it to continue and nothing seems to work. So I was forced
 to go buy another device to get on the internet. Why woulds an update like this make my laptop unusable?</p>

            Hi Shirley, <br />
<br />
Windows was set to install the updates automatically for security of your device. If you've install any Windows updates (especially major updates), there's a possibility that the current hardware driver is not compatible and will cause a performance issue.
 To resolve this, you need to install the most updated drive for the device that is having an issue.<br />
<br />
For us to better assist you, we'd like to know if you're still having issues with your device? If so, please provide more information.
<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your reply.

<p>This is just a simple trojan. Did you not have any antivirus installed to start with? It sounds like your computer is infected with more than just this one thing. After you get the machine cleaned up, make sure to uninstall all older versions of Java and
 install the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
latest one (JRE 6 Update 21)</a> .</p>
<p>Go through these general malware removal steps systematically:<br />

Include scanning with David Lipman's Multi_AV and follow instructions to do all scans in Safe Mode. Please see the special Notes regarding using Multi_AV in Vista and Windows 7.<br />

If you can't do the work yourself (and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea), take the machine to a professional computer repair shop (not your local equivalent of BigComputerStore/GeekSquad).&nbsp;Please be aware that not all local shops are
 skilled at removing malware and even if they are, your computer may be so infested that Windows will need to be clean-installed. If possible, have all your data backed up before you take the machine into a shop.

    <title>Choosing a language in W10 - Suggestion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nic727  say:</h3>
<h2>            Choosing a language in W10 - Suggestion</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will post the same thing on Windows feedback app, but I will start here to discuss with the community and Windows 10 devs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My idea is to change the way you choose a language in Windows 10. Now you need to download languages, language packs, speech, etc.</p>
<p>But what about something very simple to regroup everything in only one page and make it easier for everyone?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Concept :</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f221fa77-8edf-4880-99ba-193b6f72c903" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is just an example of what could be done. I also forgot to add keyboard options/languages (possibility to choose multiple for this one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I like the most about my concept is that you can use French (France) Cortana outside France. The Cortana language is just the language you speak with Cortana and the language she write, talk... Also show the language in the "search box". In fact, the
 language is the kind of accent for this language. For example, English (Canada) and English (US) will not be exactly the same. But everything here is just what's available for now... The voice is just the kind of voice or intonation used by Cortana...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing to mention in the concept is that instead of move up french language to have some apps in french (except Edge), it will just be an option here. So you can have whatever language you want for app and whatever language you want for desktop.
 Maybe people like to have English desktop with German apps?</p>
<p>Maybe a Mexican want to speak English (Canada) with Cortana?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, instead of "downloading" each language, it will just download the language chosen here and if you choose another one, it will remove/delete the one before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and hope it will be here in the next update!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nicolas</p>

            I would like to be able to choose french (France) language for Cortana instead of waiting for the french (Canada). Also with an English desktop display... I'm sure it's possible, but you just need a bit of work.

<p><strong>Hi everyone,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I can´t read nor burn CDs from my DVD/CD drive on my Acer travelmate 2700. The DVD/CD drive is a Pioneer DVD-RW DVR-K14RA. I'm using Windows XP. I´ve tried to download a new driver but I couldn´t find any for this specific hardware. I've run the
 fixit tool and the only error it finds is "Media in CD/DVD drive is not readable", everything else is fine. I´ve restored the laptop to a restore point a few weeks old and it doesn't work either. I can´t remember when was the last time I managed to burn or
 read a CD on this laptop but it was certainly more than 12 months ago.</strong></p>
<p>From what I´ve read here I thought that deleting "UpperFilters" form&nbsp;<span><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>would work but it didn´t. I can´t see the "LowerFilters".</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I suspected this started happening after I installed Service Pack 3, then I uninstalled it but the problem persisted.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Can someone help me?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks.</strong></p>

<h2>            surface to sony bravia tv with mini display port to hdmi adaptor fails after 2 seconds</h2>
                    <p>I am connecting my surface pro to the sony tv, when I try and play home movies I get the first two seconds of audio and video then tv screen goes blank and I don't get any more.&nbsp; I have proved the connection works and the cables are good, I can even get
 sound after reducing sound quality (although the test failed).</p>
<p>Video works better than tryimg to view photos on slideshow which is really glitch and 9 out of 10 fail to display</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas where I am going wrong ?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Sandra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several possible reasons why this is happening.&nbsp; Let's try to sort things out.&nbsp; May we know if you're connecting the TV directly to your Surface device?&nbsp; Are you using a Surface dock to connect your Sony Television to your Surface?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're connecting your TV directly to your Surface, here are some of the things that we believe you would need to go through especially the part on
<strong><em>Set up your screens</em></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If everything in the steps in the first link has been done and you're still getting the issue, you may try to visit and go through the troubleshooting steps found in this

    <title>Windows 10 Store won&#39;t install any app or check for updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danielgruszczyk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Store won&#39;t install any app or check for updates</h2>
                    <p>For past few days Windows 10 Store had like 20 apps to update and would not update them, no errors, just "working..." forever.</p>
<p>Now I can see the list is empty and if I press "check for updates" again, the scroll goes on forever and nothing appears. Again, no errors.</p>
<p>When I try to install a new app after clicking "install" button it just says "working..." forever, again no errors and app won't install.</p>
<p>Same goes for general Windows Update, clicking "check for updates" and getting "checking for updates..." spinning forever.</p>
<p>And yes, I do have internet access, I wrote this post after all...</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI~~</p>
<p>Frankly speaking I am sick of Windows 10. I have followed Microsoft faithfully for a long time,&nbsp;used Windows Phones since WP7, now have Lumia 950, took part in Windows Preview etc. Now&nbsp;you gave me an ALPHA operating system on both my laptop and my phone.
 The stability issues and bugs are so serious you shouldn't have released this to public! I give it to the Redstone update and if this OS is still such a piece of sh** I will switch to a mac.</p>

                    <p>I have been using Speech Recognition for well over a year.&nbsp; This morning after the recent Update to Windows Speech Recognition failed to start.&nbsp; The error says that the Display Language is the problem.&nbsp; In my settings the display language is English (Australia)

<p>
</p><p>I cannot start Speech Recognition to find out if it is using English Australai, but I have never had a problem in the past. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Hi WayneHarris5
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />There are two actions which you can undertake. You can try them one by one and check after each.
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1****
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; Unfortunately, 3 after removing the last 3 updates;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>KB4480056, KB4482887 and KD448655 one by one the speech recognition is still not working. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The error message that comes up when the speech recognition tries to start is "Speech recognition could not start because the language configuration is not supported" &nbsp; I have my computer to English (Australia) in the control panel. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The message goes on to say "The recogniser language must match the language of the user interface. Please change the recogniser language in the control panel under Advanced Options"</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately I cannot start Speech Recognition to check what language it is using so that I can change it.&nbsp; I have tried changing the Windows display language to English (United Kingdom) and also to English (US) but neither of these changes
 worked.&nbsp; I still got the same error message.</span></p>

            I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not Reset or Reinstall of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<p>
</p><p>Xbox does not recommend buying codes from 3rd party websites to avoid problems like this. They are apparently telling you wrong info about the code.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it a trial or a full month or more of game pass? I would suggest talking to Xbox support about this, although they may not be able to do anything and you may have to buy game pass through the Xbox store and take this purchase at a loss if that website
 won't refund it: </p>

<h2>            How to fix &#34;Driver_IRQL_Not_Less_Or_Equal &#40;netwlv64.sys&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I bought this latop like 6 months ago. I have been getting this message pretty much everyday - "Driver_IRQL_Not_Less_Or_Equal (netwlv64.sys). At least 2-4 times per day. Somehow in between the 6 months there would be some days I wouldn't have this happen.
 I found it strange. Nonetheless, I have been searching online for a solution. I am so afraid to really do anything on my own not knowing for sure if it will completely kill my laptop. I can't afford to send my laptop put to have someone else maybe fix this
 either. I am hoping that someone here might have a solution to my situation. I have had other laptops &amp; none of them have ever done this. I have Toshiba Satellite P305 S8844</p>

            I was finally able to connect via ethernet &amp; download the driver. I have done what was asked. I have now unplugged the ethernet cable. I will repost tomorrow if the problem continues. I can tell you though that before doing anything tonight. All day today
 I wasn't getting the blue screen. My computer would just restart every 15 - 30 minutes for no reason. I finally shut it off until I got home 2 hrs ago.

<h2>            Is it possible to make windows 7 emojis colored&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I switched over to Windows 7 from Windows 10 today. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was on Windows 10, I had a playlist in Spotify with a emoji (<span>🔥)</span>and it was colored. Now, it's just
 black. I'm sort of missing it, I know it's just a little thing but am I missing an update? It says I have all windows updates.. is there some way to extract the window 10 code that makes it colored.. and put it in Windows 7?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to find shortcut target.</h2>
                    <p>Windows 8 start screen "desktop" tile:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the "OblyTile" app to create new tiles - works great for URL's, folders and apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I want to do is to create a new colorful tile to replace the existing start screen "Desktop" tile.&nbsp;I can't locate the target for the start screen "desktop" tile shortcut for the OblyTile app to point to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Loren</p>
Win 8 logo toggle key
<div>
<p>It seems that the keyboard windows key (between ALT &amp; Ctrl) toggles between the Start screen and the desktop. So, what I want to do is leave the desktop background the same but change the looks of the "desktop" tile on the start screen.</p>

<p>I have an app called OblyTile to create new tiles. Your merely type in the target for the desired program, URL or folder you want the new tile to control, then use OblyTile's icons or a new one created by Photoshop, or whatever, for the look of the new tile.</p>

<p>I can create the tile, but I can't find the target (command) for the desktop. If I point to the JPG picture in the windows\web\wallpaper folder, the keyboard windows logo key toggles between the start screen and a full-screen picture - not the actual desktop.</p>

<p>Does anyone know the command for the desktop and where it is located?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Adarsh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer these questions in order to understand the issue better. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you able to view the Pen Drive in Disk Management or Device manager?</li><li>Did you try connecting the pen drive to another computer and check if it works?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When looking for attached hard drives, USB flash drives or CD and DVD drives using Windows Explorer, you may notice that some drives are not seen in Windows Explorer or the drive may disappear after a short time or when Windows resumes from Sleep or Hibernation.
 This can be caused by any of the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Your drive does not have a drive letter assigned to it in Disk Management</li><li>The drive may be disabled or offline</li><li>Your USB driver may be corrupted</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> I would suggest you to run Hardware and Devices troubleshooter for Windows 8 and check for the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Hardware and Device Troubleshooter checks for any issue on the hardware and devices connected to the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer to the link below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the section “<strong>Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter”. </strong>
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uninstall and reinstall the USB driver for the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Press<strong> Windows and X </strong>key on the start screen and select <strong>
Device Manager</strong>.<br />
b) Locate the <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers </strong>driver.<br />
c) Right Click on the USB driver icon and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.<br />
d) Restart the computer. After restarting the computer, USB driver will automatically be installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Assign the drive letter for the pen drive from Disk management and check if it helps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows key + X, click Disk Management.</li><li>Right-click the drive that you want to change, and then click Change Drive Letter and Paths.</li><li>Do one of the following:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>To assign a drive letter if one has not already been assigned, click Add, click the letter that you want to use, and then click OK.</li><li>To change a drive letter, click Change, click Assign the following drive letter, click the letter that you want to use, and then click OK.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Connect the Flash drive through the USB and check if it responds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

<p>
</p><p>As the pen drive doesn’t work on other computers it appears that pen drive is faulty. I would suggest you to contact SanDisk support site for further assistance:</p>

    <title>Task Scheduler &#58; what is the impact of a user account with no - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clairvaux  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Scheduler &#58; what is the impact of a user account with no password &#63;</h2>
                    <p>What are exactly the consequences, on Task Scheduler, of having user accounts with no passwords ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read in <em>Windows 7 Inside Out</em> at Microsoft Press that scheduled tasks were incompatible with the lack of a password. However, I made some tests, and the reality seems more complex. I removed the password from my administrator account, then :</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I tried to change the schedule of an existing task under Task Scheduler &gt; change accepted, task executed.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>I tried to create a new task, to launch a program on a schedule, under Task Scheduler&nbsp;&gt; creation accepted, task executed.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>I tried to create a new scheduled backup profile with Sync Back &gt; got the message
<em>"Windows does not allow empty passwords to be used with Task Scheduler, would you like this restriction removed ?".</em></li></ul>
<p>So my assumption here is that Task Scheduler will only prevent <em>other programs</em> to create tasks if your current user account has no password, in order to mitigate the risk that some malware could plant a task by itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you would still be able to change or create tasks, provided you do it yourself within Task Scheduler.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, what would be that <em>"removing of restriction"</em> done by Sync Back ? Would it concern only the backup schedule currently being created, or would it change the general behaviour of Task Scheduler ? And could it be reverted through Task Scheduler,
 or would you be dependent on the third-party software having a command to allow this ?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 7 Home Premium, on a single-user, two-accounts (one admin, one non-admin), non-networked computer (except for Internet access, obviously). So no, I'm not connected to a domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Windows 7 Inside Out</em> (a book, not an article) covers all editions of Windows 7, and features specific to certain editions are explicitly mentioned as such. As far as I remember, that information about Task Scheduler was mentioned as valid for all
 editions, but I could not look it up right away (it's a paper book with 1 200 pages...).</p>

                    Unfortunately I DID!&nbsp; Now I really really need to know how safe my system is?&nbsp; I didn't delete anything but they did get remote access for about 10 minutes.&nbsp; Can't believe I was so completely stupid.&nbsp; Generally when I see a No. withheld on the phone my
 antennae is on double alert, particularly later in the afternoon because of the time difference.&nbsp; I rang Microsoft in Dublin who patched me through to a guy who said these Indian lads are after selling antivirus software and not hackers.&nbsp; But how do I know?&nbsp;
 I've changed passwords on the computer and pin numbers for the bank etc. but I've never had this happen before and I'm stuck out half way into the Atlantic with no backup.&nbsp; I'd love to get some reassurance please?

            <p>I suggest you stick with 32 bit Windows 8, its possible drivers are not compatible with the 64 bit version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When performing the upgrade process the upgrade assistant determines your existing architecture, downloads the same architecture and installs.</p>
<p>To change from 32bit Windows to 64bit Windows a clean install will be performed (will have to reinstall applications etc…) and it will be necessary to purchase Windows 8 as a DVD.</p>
<p>Below is a web page that has additional information regarding Windows 8 </p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>Upgrade to Windows 8</u></a></p>
<p>You can go to a computer running a 64 bit version (Vista or Windows 7) and do the download there and create a bootable copy.</p>
<p>32 vs 64 bit</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions</u></a>
</p>
<p>Windows 8 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 8 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than
 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 8 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 8.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 8 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers.</p>
<p>If you need to upgrade to the 64 bit version, you will need to do a custom over your 32 bit installed. You said you ordered the backup DVD with your order, so you will have the 64 bit disc.</p>
<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to Windows 8 64 bit. Lauch the Windows Easy Transfer utility in Windows 7 and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk,
 you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 8 64 bit disk.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/</u></a></p>
<p>Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 8 64 bit disk. In Windows 8 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How to do a custom install:</strong></p>
<p><br />
Boot from the Windows 8 USB or DVD media you create</p>
<b>
<p>Boot from the media you created to install on another partition</p>
</b>
<p>:<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/boot-install-partition-media-usb-dvd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u> http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/boot-install-partition-media-usb-dvd</u></a></p>
<p><br />
Click Install Now<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows&nbsp;8 Click Next.</p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>(At all cost, do NOT click anything named Format or Delete or Partition. So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. Click OK</p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers.</p>
<p>You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.</p>

<h2>            Skype 7.x search not working. Horrible disaster, complete programming failure.</h2>
                    <p>Since Microsoft took over skype despite many other problems with each upgrade the search feature degraded more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is impossible for me to grasp how Microsoft allowed this to happen, a most essential feature destroyed, it is the biggest mess and degradation I have seen in a major software in a long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People have been reporting and asking about it since months if not year as google reveals and all replies are highlevel ignorant half answers telling users to fill out another form to devs, but neither acknowledging the problem nor doing anything to fix
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a search term, which I know I have used in a given conversation multiple times within the last week. when I search with ctrl + f inside the conversation, the first result however is going months back, the recent ones are not found. seems a search
 indexing issue. search across contacts is an unintuitive helpless mess and not working any better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While in some earlier 7.x version at least I could export all conversations to html and then search there (which was already unbelievable thing to be required in order to find something a few days back, but at times better than scrolling through everything)
 on newest version I just did an export and it ends july 2018, what an aweful joke.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the question is, do you want to do nothing about this? Please don't send me another "well this is how skype search works, please fill out some form to give our developers more feedback" pseudo reply, after the community is telling you this since at least
 a year you are aware, so maybe acknowledge that skype product and dev team horribly messed up (probably product is more to blame than dev, who likely had stupid requirements and not enough time and ressources I would guess) and provide a proper community feedback
 when you are attempting to fix this!</p>
<p>
</p><p>before you ask for OS and skype version, latest mac osx, latest windows 10 update and on both the latest skype version, all as of date of this writing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wondering if you are really ignoring problems around skype until the ship has sunk and people stop using it. On skype business you already have given up, it was always 10 times work than regular skype and now you move to ms team chat, indeed an improvement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>big pitty all of this, since skype has been so incredibly great :(</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>We truly appreciate you for voicing out your displeasure. I understand how frustrating it is to be obliged to use an application which has been modified and which has become "unfamiliar."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since devices upgrade and technology constantly advances, Skype also has to evolve and keep up with the changes. With this being said, we have retired Skype version 7 to make way for new Skype (version 8). This is the reason why&nbsp;v7.xx isn't working anymore.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned, you are well-aware that we have created a link for your
<em><strong>suggestions, complaints, feedback, requests</strong></em> through the
<strong><a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype-ideas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype User Voice</a></strong>. We truly hope that you utilize it as it will help us better create the application that will suit most, if not, all your
 needs. </p>

<h2>            Lost mouse after Kaspersky update</h2>
                    Tried to install Kaspersky internet security xp, and then downloaded Kaspersky W7.<br />
After the install seemed to go well, and a re-boot was required, I no longer have a mouse cursor. Once I log on, I get a&nbsp;Kaspersky&nbsp;reboot required message lower right taskbar, and the round circle wait symbol intermittent in the middle of the screen. Various
 mouses do not work, other usb ports install driver but mouse does not work. If I boot from the W7 CD the cursor works for the first install page which I abort.<br />
<br />
This is a brand new machine clean install.<br />
Any thoughts? I can't do much without the mouse.<br />

            Does the mouse return and function if you uninstall Kaspersky?&nbsp; If you cannot uninstall it without the mouse, see if you can System Restore to before you installed it.<br />
<br />
The latest Kaspersky is version 2010.&nbsp; I'm guessing from the name you gave it, Kaspersky is meant for XP, not for Vista or Windows 7.&nbsp; If you still want it, you may have to upgrade to the latest version.<br />
<br />
If you do not want to buy the upgrade, I'd suggest giving Microsoft Security Essentials a try.&nbsp; It's FREE!&nbsp;
