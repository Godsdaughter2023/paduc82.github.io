<h2>            How can I recover my old messages&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would like to get back my old messages on my email which went back to about 2006. I've already tried the message-restoring link below the inbox, but nothing came up. I did also change my password as I had trouble accessing before, and wonder if this could
 have something to do with it?</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

<p>Such BS, I installed the new stock connector add on app and it is only valid for Excel 2013 or later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my Excel 2010 professional is useless for this purpose. Seems like just a money grab to get users to upgrade on a service that was already working well.</p>

<p>Google Yahoo stock quotes in Excel template. There are people that have made macro based templates that pull from Yahoo finance. If you're searching Canadian stocks you need to add .TO to after the stock quotes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to maintain both the MSN money and Yahoo version of my portfolios because you never know when one will crap out. Sometimes Yahoo stops working for 1-2 days and sometimes MSN money would stop. I trade stocks daily and can't trade blind.</p>

            I have been using Excel 2003 to pull quotes for many years, and this is the last straw. &nbsp;Decided to give Google Sheets a try to pull live quotes. &nbsp;WOW - should have done that a long time ago. &nbsp;Took less than two hours to figure everything out and rebuild
 (after importing excel docs) my spreadsheets. &nbsp;The 'functions' are simpler to use, making multiple conditions is easier, it is cross platform - so it is easily available on my smart phone (same login). &nbsp;BYE BYE Microsoft. &nbsp;MSFT is getting a bit too much like
 Krapple - money grabbing. &nbsp;I would encourage anyone having problems with pulling quotes to check out Google Sheets/Google Docs. &nbsp;To figure out the functions, do a search on 'google spreadsheet fuctions', and is the first one on the list.

<p>Regarding the above suggestion to use Google Sheets:</p>
<p>I agree that this solution is clean and easy. &nbsp;If you're looking to implement it &amp; don't find anything by searching 'google spreadsheet fuctions', search specifically for a function called "GoogleFinance". &nbsp;You can enter a function as simple as "<span>=</span><span>googlefinance</span><span>(</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">"GOOG"</span><span>)</span>"
 to get a current price (with flexible options to get other attributes than price, or attributes from historical data.</p>

<p>Worked for me as well. &nbsp;Very easy to use. &nbsp;I'm using Excel 2016. &nbsp;I like it better than my previous Yahoo and MSN setup. &nbsp;This app pulls from Yahoo though just so you know. &nbsp;Now that Yahoo is owned by AT&amp;T (I believe)...who knows if this feature will be
 working a year or so down the line. &nbsp;I also contributed $5, and if you do, also gives you the ability to move the stocks up or down in the list. &nbsp;Use the link in

<h2>            How to enable plain text only paste in Word 2016&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In Office 2013 I was able to set an option so every time I paste, it pastes as plain text. I can't seem to find that option in Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to change the behavior of the paste in Office 2016 to paste plain text only by default?</p>

            I've seen a few other posts relating to this, I'd love to have it too, sadly I don't think it's designed to work with the big IM's like those...<br />

Have a look at this post, seraphim made a good statement about it:<br />

            OK no worrys...<br />
<br />
Yahoo I will not use mobile as it costs way to much...<br />
<br />
MSN is good though... I have an app called eMSN and it works a treat.<br />
<br />
It only supports one chat session but what do you want for free LOL<br />
<br />
It does me.

<h2>            How to you update the top level Certificates</h2>
                    We recently moved our cert for our Exchange server over to TrustWave, but my Windows Mobile 6.1(HTC Pro) device does not recognize the new cert authority.&nbsp; The cert works fine in browsers to the OWA site.&nbsp; How can you update the certs on the mobile device?&nbsp;
 Windows Update does not accomplish this.

            Did you install the new certificate onto your device? Just copy it from your computer's browser to your device.

            So when accessing OWA from your device you don't get any certificate errors? If not you shouldn't have a problem with Exchange Active Sync. If you do get an error when navigating your OWA directory then you can export the root cert from your desktop and
 import it onto the device.

    <title>Spellcheck stopped working, shared tools does not exist in registry - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sofie kampjensen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spellcheck stopped working, shared tools does not exist in registry</h2>
                    <p>Less than a week ago, my spellcheck stopped working altogether, for every document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No words are underlined, and when clicking the language box, I find that it's set to an option of "English (United States)", with no spellcheck, despite having set "English (United States)" WITH spellcheck as the default option.</p>
<p>When marking the entire document and clicking on the language box, I'm told part of the document is set to no spellcheck, and that the used language is mostly Danish with Spellcheck. I correct this to English with spellcheck, and make sure the "do not check
 spelling or grammar" box is entirely blank. I close the language box, and it immediately reverts back to English without spellcheck, and marking everything and clicking the language box reveals nothing has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried removing and later reinstalling the Danish spellcheck. I've tried repairing and resetting word. I've tried looking into the registry to delete the "<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Proofing Tools\1.0\Override</strong>",
 but finds that the microsoft tab does not have a "Shared Tools" tab whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not been able to find anyone else who had the same issue, since removing the aforementioned registry key appears to work for others. My problems seemed to arise just as my computer (Dell, windows 10) changed the set language for the pc to Danish without
 my consent. After I finished setting it back (which wasn't particularly easy) spellcheck had stopped functioning.</p>

<br />My name is Akiva and I am an Independent Advisor.

<br />
<br />I suggest that the first thing that should be done is a repair of Office since this is due to an Office malfunction and this could correct it

<p>Which language is set as the default proofing language in Word? You should set the language you use the most as your default, and you should turn
<strong>off</strong> the "Detect language automatically" option in the Language dialog box.

<p>
</p><p><span>Also, note that there is a difference between the default proofing language and the proofing language of the currently selected text. Once you have successfully changed the default, existing documents must be dealt with one by one. Often,
 you simply have to select all the text and (re-)apply the correct language for that document. It is also a good idea to modify the language of the Normal paragraph style.</span></p>

 your Office license or product key</a></span>&nbsp;for the latest information on this topic.&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table>




<p>
</p><p>I installed Office 2013 and put in the product key when it asked me to. After typing in the product key, it allowed me to use MS Word once. After I closed MS Word and went to reopen it the next day, it said the product key I entered was incorrect (maybe
 I typed it in incorrectly). It asked me to change it. I tried opening MS word and clicking File -&gt; Account but was unable to change the product key from there.</p>
<p>I then went to control panel -&gt; uninstall a program and then clicked on Office 2013 and clicked 'change' but it gave me no option to change the product key. So I decided to uninstall and reinstall it.</p>
<p>I uninstalled it and then went to reinstall it with the setup file and now it is giving me an error saying:</p>
<pre><code>Error 25004. The product key you entered cannot be used on this machine. This is most likely due to previous Office 2013 trials being installed.</code></pre>
<span>The first product key I entered seems to be saved somewhere. How do I delete / change it?</span>

            <p>Hi Syman,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mention the site from where you are trying to download and install Office 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue generally occurs if you are trying to install Office 2013 trial on a computer where a trial was already installed. So ensure you are using the right product key to install and activate Office Professional Plus 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also refer to the section ‘My product key is not working’ under Technical Information in the following link and check if it helps.</p>

</p><p>I believe I mean to sync an outlook calendar with Onenote. For example - in onenote you can select a meeting, however this doesn't "collect or sync" meetings from all calenders in my outlook only my primary account calendar. Or atleast that's how it appears

<h2>            Podcasts not in order</h2>
                    I'm happy the new desktop sync app allows you to sync libraries of podcasts.&nbsp; It doesn't sync them in any specific order though.&nbsp; Not by name or date.&nbsp; This needs to be fixed.

                    I own an N73. After installing the latest version of PC Suite I plug my phone in and it connects. The problem i'm having is that the Found New Hardware bubble keeps popping up with two differnt hardwares. The first is Nokia N73 and the second is Nokia

            Are those Devices shown in Device Manager?<br />
(Right click "My computer"&gt;property&gt;Hardware&gt;Device manager)<br />
If so, right click the device and select "Disable" (do not uninstall).<br />
<br />
Those windows portable devices supposed to work with your Windows media player 11 for file transfer, which quite often doesn't work. Since you can do same by PC Suite File manager and Music manager, try make them quiet.

            It worked also for me with my 6280. But the difference was that when I read this post I had the mobile disconnected so I clicked "Enable" 'cause "Disable" did not appear.<br />

            I really can´t understand. I have some similar problems with my Nokia N95 and Windows XP SP2 and can´t found a correct solution. In first time each time that connect my phone to my computer via bluetooth or USB Nokia Cable DKE-2 a bubble of NEW HARDWARD
 FOUND show, and show the name of my N95 and later again NEW HARDWARE FOUND and NOKIA WINDOWS PORTABLE DEVICE DRIVER, and again rediscover, and again, againg, ever, in a never end loop. Searching in the internet I found at Nokia Discussion the solution, a middle
 solution because don´t fix the problem at all:<br />
<br />
Change into de registry this:<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\PC Connectivity Solution\Configurations\Nokia]<br />
The parameter: "WPDEnabled"=dword:00000001 by "WPDEnabled"=dword:00000000<br />
<br />
Until this, OK, work again fine and can use the PCSuite, etc correctly and the bubbles don´t appear anymore.<br />
<br />
Now I try connect my N95 as MEDIA PLAYER USB option to can see into my Windows Media Player and can put music, etc. because is the player that I use mainly. But SURPRISE, when I connect I have a similar problem, the bubble of NEW HARDWARE FOUND show again but
 now with the phrase: MTP DEVICE, and again start the never end loop of the bubbles. For this, I can´t found a solution.<br />
<br />
What is this? Its a problem of the Nokia software or what?<br />
I try all, unistall all, install again, install in other languages, etc, etc, all, and can´t found a solution to use my N95 at all.<br />
<br />
My machine have a Windows XP SP2 Spanish, with PCSuite 6.85.14.1 Spanish (I also try older versions and other languages).<br />
<br />
All help or solution are wellecome :) Thanks!!!

    <title>Permission problems with AD groups on site-collection and subsites - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abhitalks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Permission problems with AD groups on site-collection and subsites</h2>
                    <p>We have a <em>site-collection</em> called "<strong>Projects</strong>". Within this site-collection we have a
<em>sub-site</em> for each project. Say, "<strong>ABC</strong>" and "<strong>XYZ</strong>" etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each of the project team members have their own security group in AD. For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Employees in "ABC" are members of AD security group called "SG-ABC"</p>
<p>Employees in "XYZ" are members of AD security group called "SG-XYZ"</p>
<p>
</p><p>We want each team to have "<em>contribute</em>" permissions in their own sub-site, but only "<em>read</em>" permissions on site-collection. To keep it simple, this is what we have done:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Added "<em>Everyone except external users</em>" to the "<em>Projects</em>" site-collection's "<em>Projects Visitors</em>" SharePoint Group.</p>
<p>2. Broken Inheritance on both sub-sites and created new groups (when asked while breaking the inheritance).</p>
<p>3. Added "<em>SG-ABC</em>" AD security group to ABC sub-site's "<em>ABC Members</em>" SharePoint Group.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Added "<em>SG-XYZ</em>" AD security group to XYZ sub-site's "<em>XYZ Members</em>" SharePoint Group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now our understanding is that because all employees are already included in "<em>Everyone except external users</em>", they will be having read permissions via visitors group on site-collection. And then, members of specific AD security group will have contribute
 permissions via members group on respective sub-sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in this scenario employees keep getting an "Access Denied" page on sub-site unless the specific AD security group is added in the site-collection's members group (i.e. contribute permissions on site-collection). Even including specific AD security
 group in site-collection's visitors group doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any pointer about why this is happening and how to resolve this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please note that the problem has been resolved by the Microsoft support when I logged a ticket. The permissions were done just right and everything was correct. The problem was with the custom page-layout which was being used on home page and several other
 pages. This page-layout was referenced from the root site-collection where the layout (both html and aspx) were stuck at being unpublished. I deleted the files, re-uploaded the html which was then automatically converted to aspx. I then published the html
 and this time it got published along with the aspx. and the problem got solved.</p>

            <p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes the issue is a simple matter of maintenance rather than malware or actual problems.&nbsp; Since these are good things to do anyway and may well help and/or resolve things (or at least get them to an acceptable level), I'd recommend giving them a try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's my little blurb on improving space and speed in Vista or Windows 7 systems – and some can apply to XP as well but the reference articles and procedures will be different but you should be able to either figure out how to do what is suggested on XP
 or search Bing for an article which addresses that topic for XP or an equivalent program that works with XP (and it also suggests other things of value that you can consider or ignore - the choice is entirely yours). All of this is your choice, actually -
 I'm just presenting some options that may help and that have helped many others (and that I pretty much use myself though sometimes I do procrastinate I'm sad to admit and there are some things I won't do no matter how beneficial - for example, I refuse to
 delete my cookies (but that's a personal choice as I prefer the benefits of having them when going to previously-visited web sites over the limited amount of space recovered and speed gained given their small size)). Much of this should be part of normal maintenance,
 but that includes some other things (like creating periodic system restore points - probably at least weekly as they don't necessarily improve speed, space or performance and may in fact even do the opposite in some cases) not addressed here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great many things influence the speed and performance and available space of your system - mostly the existence of various files and what's loaded on the system. There are ways to handle this (and you should follow all the suggestions) - and of course
 the amount and type of RAM and the speed of your processor and motherboard (but I'm just going to discuss software solutions here - you can go to your computer vendor/manufacturer for hardware solutions if any are available (I, for example, am maxed out at
 2GB RAM by my motherboard and there is no better motherboard available for my model of laptop but if your system can handle it, Vista 32-bit can use up to 4GB of RAM (well, almost 4GB, more like 3.5 actually) and the 64-bit version can use even more). If space
 is the issue, replace your hard drive with a larger one, add a second hard drive (if it is a desktop system), or add an external hard drive. Those are hardware answers (which cost money). We'll now discuss software solutions (which are mostly if not entirely
 free - at least the options presented here - there are 3rd party programs that provide additional options but they really aren't necessary).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One very important thing to begin – do NOT use any Registry Cleaner or Registry Booster or Enhancer, or Repairer or Fixer software (or whatever it calls itself) no matter what it says (scans will tell you have thousands of errors just to get you to download
 and install the program or worse, buy it) or where you got it (even safe sites sell these products but they are not worth the headaches they can cause). Most do nothing of value and some can do great harm (to the point where you need to do a clean install
 to fix the problem – and that’s not even counting the fact that many such programs are actually malware in disguise). Vista keeps the registry clean on its own quite well and doesn’t need any help.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
To improve your speed and space, do Disk Cleanup using: <a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html</a><span> in Vista or </span>
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/818-disk-cleanup-open-use.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Disk Cleanup - Open and Use - Windows 7 Forums</span></a><span> in Windows 7</span>. Delete as much as you feel comfortable doing – nothing deleted there will
 harm your system in any way. This includes deleting the Temporary Internet Files. If you want to keep this from building, go to Tools / Internet Options / Advanced and check the box Empty Temporary Internet Files Folder whenever browser is closed and then
 that folder will always stay empty (except when you're using the program).</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Also do an Optimization: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance</a><span> in Vista or
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Optimize-Windows-7-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Optimize Windows 7 for better performance</span></a><span> in Windows 7</span>. Do all of the options (or at the very least, consider
 them - many can help a great deal).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least once every month or so, run CCleaner <a href="http://www.piriform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.piriform.com/</span></a> with as many options as you choose to delete (but be
<strong><span>careful</span></strong> because this program if not used properly and with caution and with you paying attention to what you are doing can delete important and even critical files that could cause a great deal of trouble).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Uncheck anything in the Registry section and in the Application Section, uncheck Microsoft Antimalware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Clearing out your temporary files can also save you much space and improve performance and while some of the above will clear a lot of the temp files, they won't cover them all. This will. I recommend running it every month or two. It is TFC by Old
 Timer </span><a href="http://www.geekstogo.com/forum/TFC-Temp-File-Cleaner-OldTimer-file187.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>TFC - Temp File Cleaner by OldTimer - Geeks to Go Forums</span></a><span> and you should download and save it to your desktop. When run,
 it will close everything else, so be sure to save anything you're working on and basically close all your programs. If it asks (and when done even if it doesn't ask), reboot to complete the process.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Restore can take up to 15% of your partition's space but that can be reduced. It's a trade-off. The less space you allocate, the fewer restore points you will be able to retain -but many people reduce this to save some space while leaving enough to
 save 3-4 restore points at least (which is usually enough - until you need them). Here's the procedure:

<br />
Go to Start / Search options and type in msconfig and enter and then double click on the program icon that appears. Go to the startup tab and uncheck any program that you don't need starting at startup. That will probably be the majority of items there - if
 not most of them (some are needed like the AV program and Windows Defender but most are there to make opening the source programs faster and make you think they're more efficient). This will free up a lot of RAM and help a lot in making your system faster
 (though perhaps not so much that you'll be able to notice the difference - but maybe depending on how much unnecessary stuff is loading at startup). When I did this on my system I removed over 90% of the entries and suffered no ill effects – to the contrary,
 I noticed startup was quicker, response times when working were better and I could open more programs at the same time and still have no problems, and shutdown was also faster. Better still, download Autoruns
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a>which is much superior to msconfig and click on the Everything tab and do what was suggested above (though here you
<strong><span>can’t</span></strong> delete everything as with the start menu in msconfig because there are some very important files and services included which
<strong><span>MUST</span></strong> not be deleted or it can cause serious harm to the system). If unsure, leave it alone.<br />
<br />
<br />
You also want to have good AV and AS programs on your system (so no malware is operating in the background draining resources). Windows Defender is a good AS program. The free Microsoft Security Essentials
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> is an excellent AV/AM program that has one of the least impacts on system performance and resources according to reliable sources and it does the job very well. If you're using MSE, you don't really
 need Defender and MSE will deactivate it when installed (but you would with many other AV programs - though some of them also deactivate Defender). (But you're already there, so this simply reinforces that you've chosen well).&nbsp; I would also suggest downloading
 the free version of MBAM <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</a> and running it monthly to catch anything that MSE might miss.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
<br />
If you follow this advice and do it periodically (at least monthly) then I believe you will have as fast and clean a machine as it is capable of going given the hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.&nbsp; If not, then the issue will need further troubleshooting to basically rule things out until we find the underlying cause - malware, corruption, hardware problem, conflict, other software problem or many other possibilities.&nbsp; Some we may
 do here and others we may refer you to other more specialized&nbsp;areas of the forum for furuther assistance - it depends on how things go.&nbsp; But let's see how this works first and then take things from there.&nbsp; I don't want to overwhelm you with too many things
 all at the same time and feedback from this may help determine the best order to check other options&nbsp;-&nbsp;or add or remove certain&nbsp;alternatives&nbsp;(because although I have a standard method for that too, I change it for everyone based on the unique circumstances
 involved when appropriate and would, of course, do so for you as well as best as I can from whatever you can provide to assist me in understanding things better).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>P.S.&nbsp; If it is the same computer as noted by PA Bear above, and you thanked me there implying that it might indeed have been a scam as I mentioned (which I hope but never verified you escaped), then I would very much like to know more about what occurred
 because if you did give them access or install software or visit sites they suggested or make changes they recommended or anything like that, then that would be very, very helpful to know (as well, of course, of what exactly happened in detail).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>P.P.S.&nbsp; If you were just checking in that other thread and nothing happened other than that (which is why you thanked me because that was why you were concerned at the time and that concern was based not only on their coincidentally timed contact but
 also or instead an effort to resolve this slowness problem which what may have caused of contributed to everything else), then Event Viewer isn't usually the best place to start for troubleshooting this type of problem though it very well (if not certainly)
 may play a part and be involved at some point in the process.&nbsp; But the process would be different than targeting one example and involve checking more/most events in a slightly different way with more filtering&nbsp;and then posting the results (or putting screenshots
 in SkyDrive for us to review) so we can see if there are any problems there that are truly problems hidden among the many that are misleading&nbsp;- and if we or others get to that point, detailed explanations can be provided to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, one
 step at a time.&nbsp; If appropriate and needed, we'll get to Event Viewer - but for now, let's try some of the higher probability options and, if needed, continue that way with other troubleshooting steps after you provide feedback and if anything more is needed
 should the above not be sufficient until checking Event Viewer becomes the most appropriate next step.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Think of it like a TV.&nbsp; If it turns off suddenly, then the first step is to try to turn it on (in case the cat stepped on the remote off button), then check to make sure it is plugged in and try another outlet or verify that outlet works to make sure
 it has power, and so forth.&nbsp; Then make sure the cable or other signal connection is properly connected and any related components are turned on as well.&nbsp; You don't start by opening the back and checking the circuit board for blown fuses or whatever.&nbsp; This
 is more or less the same in principle, though obviously there's much more to check and the order used may help find and resolve things faster.</span></p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
1. What happens when you try to access the internet on the system? Do you get any error message?<br />
<br />
2. Do you have a different browser other than Internet explorer? <br />
<br />
3. Is the computer on a domain network? <br />
<br />
4. Were you able to use the Internet explorer in the same computer before? </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>5. Since how long are you facing this issue? </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method: </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to uninstall internet explorer 8 from the system and then reinstall it on the system and check whether the issue is resolved. Follow the steps mentioned in the article given below.
<div><br />
How do I uninstall or remove IE as a troubleshooting step?<br />

            Hi, Winston. <br />
Thank&nbsp; you for your reply.<br />
1. There is no Internet Explorer icon and iexplore.exe does not exist on the hard drive (tried c:&gt;dir iexplore.exe /s). I can access the Internet using Firefox 11.<br />
<br />
2. Firefox 11<br />
<br />
3. Yes. This is my work computer.<br />
<br />
4. Yes. I upgraded to IE9, then removed it trying to downgrade to IE8, since our ERP system is only supported on IE8.<br />
<br />
5. A couple of days - since I removed IE9.<br />
<br />
THANK YOU!<br />

Are you sure?&nbsp; Have you tried elevating the Control Panel task to make sure that you are checking with Administrator authority?&nbsp;&nbsp; Tried using a different Administrator account?</p>
<p>That dialog is where it needs to be seen in order to turn it back on to change your symptoms.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suppose it is possible that you might have a GPO in place which would hide option that instead of merely make it unchecked but I haven't found an instance of
 anybody doing that or very clear instructions about how it would be done.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think it would be an IE GPO anyway, more like a W7 one, so you might get more tips about that in a W7 forum.</p>
<p>In the meantime you can try to find out what version of IE you still have installed by using msinfo32.exe and its Loaded Modules display.&nbsp;&nbsp; Simply sort that by Version descending and you will see some of the browsing-related modules that the OS needs to
 use.&nbsp;&nbsp; They will all have the same version that your&nbsp; iexplore.exe&nbsp; would have if it was still visible.</p>

<p>Not sure if it will help. But IE had a problem with crashing after opening. It was tied to an accelerated video selection in IE's advanced tab. Are you also using IE11? No matter. It,s possible that Edge is using some IE settings. I would open IE and check
 advanced settings to see if that is enabled. If so, disable it and then try opening Edge.</p>

            <p>Right....&nbsp; After struggling so long, the solution to my problem ended up something people would not dream about. Actually two issues fixed in one action. Associated file icons and Microsoft Edge not loading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First issue is about missing file and shortcut icons on Microsoft Office. I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10.&nbsp; Windows 10 moved the old
<em>C:\Windows\Installer</em> directory to <em>C:\Windows.old\Windows\Installer</em>.&nbsp; The registry points to files within the Installer directory to get it's file icons. Only recently installed applications had their files stored in
<em>C:\Windows\Installer</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've since fixed-up the <em>C:\Windows\Installer</em> directory and all the Office icons have come back.&nbsp; Every single one.&nbsp; Also, being able to change the configuration of installed desktop applications and being able to uninstall desktop applications is
 working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding Microsoft Edge, even the unfinished Microsoft Edge browser has begun to work again as that was broken. Same thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would start and instantly stop pointing at
<em>EMODEL.dll</em> being the culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, are the ACL's for and contents of <em>C:\Windows\Installer</em> correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I'm guessing after a Windows 10 upgrade, a month later C:\Windows.old may be automatically erased so maybe take a back-up of C:\Windows.old right now before you do anything else. Before the Windows 10 eradicated files you may need to fix a Windows
 10 problem after an upgrade.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I did make sure that the contents in <em>C:\Windows\Installer</em> were not replaced with contents from
<em>C:\Windows.old\Windows\Installer.</em> It's been a while since I did this fix-up and everything is still working. I really hate it when the fault actually lies somewhere else.</p>

<h2>            Word 2010 repeating characters then freeze</h2>
                    When typing in Word 2010, FREQUENTLY, letters will suddenly start repeating on their own and then Word will stop responding, forcing me to shut it down in Task Manager, and usually it does not save my file.&nbsp;&nbsp; There does not seem to be any common indicator
 other than typing in Word, which is the whole purpose for Word in the first place.

            <p><span>Hi Andy,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for asking. Before starting the troubleshooting steps just a few quick questions;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Does the issue occur only with the Word application or with other Office applications too?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Is it a laptop or desktop PC?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Do you have wired keyboard or wireless keyboard?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Open Word in safe mode and check if Word works fine in safe mode:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Close <b>Word</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on <b>Start</b>&lt; <b>
All Programs</b>&lt; <b>Accessories</b>&lt; <b>Run</b> </span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In Run window and type <b>
winword /safe</b></span></p>
<p><span>Note: There is a space between <b>'Winword'</b> and '<b>/</b>'.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you are able to work with Word without any problem then the issue might be due to add-ins. In order to disable the add-ins follow the steps given below:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In Word, click on <b>File</b>&lt;
<b>Options</b>&lt; <b>Add-ins</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Under <b>Manage</b> select
<b>COM Add-ins.</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on <b>GO</b> options beside
<b>Manage</b>, uncheck all the add-ins and click <b>Ok.</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Try to open Word and check if it works fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Also follow the troubleshooting steps provided in the knowledge based article mentioned below and check if it helps:</span></p>

<h2>            With new Word update, page numbers in text boxes don&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>This is my first post; please forgive newbie errors. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I've stumbled on a bug (if there is a better place to report this, please let me know). I've spent an hour with tech support to no avail, although they understood the issue.&nbsp;The problem began with the most recent update of Word (sometime this week).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Page numbers in the footer, in TEXT BOXES, do not update. Regardless of settings, they always display Page 1.</p>
<p>New docs, old docs, my text boxes, built-in footer text boxes -- none work. When I print to PDF, the page numbers update correctly. The TOC is unaffected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are a bunch of version numbers, I'm not sure which is relevant:<br />
Microsoft Office 365 Version 1711 (build 8730.2102 click-to-run) Office Insider<br />
Microsoft Word 2016 MSO (16.0.8730.2046) 32-bit<br />

            I'd suggest trying to repair the installation and see if that corrects the issue for you.

            Another possible reason is that your Track Change is ON...Could you go to Review tab and make Track Change Off (not by No Markup but clicking on Track Change) and reopen the document.

            It's not Track Changes.&nbsp; I closed Word entirely. Opened a brand new doc. Track Changes is not on and All Markup is selected (I think those are the defaults - I didn't change anything). I inserted a built-in footer with a page number within a text box (ViewMaster
 Horizontal) and all pages display Page 1.

            You can also try following one by one. 
<br />
<br />1. Login to Windows with a new user profile and see if problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />2. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />
<br />3. Sometimes, this is caused due to application not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.
<br />
<br />4. Many third party applications also cause the problem like Tuneup Utilities, Abby Finereader, Kaspersky Anti Virus  etc. See if you have any of them installed. Close them one by one and see whether it helps.

<p>Thank you for your time on this! I only have a quick answer, and then I'm leaving town, but will follow up again at the end of the week.</p>
<p>With tech support, we disabled all add-ins and ran in safe mode. That did not fix the issue. I will look at your other ideas when I return.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi - if this PC has been upgraded from W7 or 8 (which were the last systems to support DVD playback) then you will need to purchase an app or download a dvd compatible program such as VLC (free download from link below - avoid any unwanted extras!)</p>
<p>If it is a new PC, the manufacturer may well have included a program&nbsp;such as Cyberlink, so first check with customer support if you cannot find&nbsp;a player. (WMP will no longer play dvds) - R.</p>
