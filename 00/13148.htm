                    <p>Clippy is a popular meme, but I think he is helpful. Do you think that in the future you could possibly add him back to word?</p>
<p>Also, if you do add him back to word, will his friends be back too? Comment below if you like this idea.</p>

<h2>            Missing Templates from PowerPoint 2013</h2>
                    <p>I have limited templates to choose from in PowerPoint 2013.&nbsp; Any suggestions on where I can find these?&nbsp; Ex.&nbsp; I need the Droplet template.&nbsp; It isn't listed on my screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did download missing themes for Word 2013 and there is a Droplet there, but it is only color - not the slide background design.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you for your quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the Themes on my computer, but when I open PowerPoint my templates are not there.&nbsp; I only have about 6 to choose from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on the Droplet theme to open PowerPoint, it gives me a different slide background than what I'm suppose to have.&nbsp; It doesn't have the graphic rain drops or the correct color.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The themes work great on Word and Excel, but not the PowerPoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other tips, I can consider?</p>

            <p>I was able to resolve the issue of missing templates from Powerpoint using the following method shared by Phillip Donnici:</p>
<p>

    <title>Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7 Ult freezes in History pane - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr. green  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7 Ult freezes in History pane</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded from IE 9, which worked fine, to IE 11 on Windows 7 Ult. En.US notebook. When I'm opening History&nbsp;bar and select "By order visited today" IE freezes and cannot start while this bar is active. Only tweaking registry key that changes History bar to
 to Favourites allows to launch IE 11 again. Reverting to IE 9&nbsp;&nbsp;fixes it, but&nbsp; upgrading again to IE 11 revert the problem.
</p>
<p>Same was with IE 10. That's why I didn't use it. </p>

 IE 9 returns, it works without crashing including History "View by order visited today" bar. However installing IE 11 brings the problem back. I even have tried resetting IE 9 to defaults before upgrading to IE 11. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling
 several times without success. IE 9 always works fine, IE 11 doesn’t want to open History "View by order visited today" bar.

<p>Dr.&nbsp;Green's problem is almost exactly the same as mine:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -I also re-booted &amp; reset IE 10,11 w/default setting, IE froze</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -I also deleted browsing history in combo w/all of the above, IE Froze</p>

            <p>Hi Prof. Plum,</p>
<p>Don't think this is due to motherboard. Same happens on my Packard Bell notebook with Win7 Home premium Russian SP1&nbsp;64bit.

            <p><span>OK---</span></p>
<p><span>I think I know what the culprit is.
</span></p>
<p><span>I replaced my motherboard Sunday night, and I thought that I would get away with NOT a total reload of OS and all the rest, But I did have to do a fresh install of Win7 Ultimate, and I then
 did the update thing; AND all the updates were successful. I held off on updating to IE 10, because of said problems.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But then I remembered on my previous install there was a batch of updates that I NEVER did get to install successfully. (The Penny Dropped) So I updated to IE&nbsp;10 and the History WORKS.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My guess is that in that some of those unsuccessful updates in my previous install,&nbsp;were needed to make the later IE’s work…… I have No idea what ones did not install, although I do have a
 Ghost inage of that install, and will see if there is still a image reader for Ghost.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am going to go way out on the limb, and install IE 11 next.</span></p>

            <p>Hello, I have been dealing with the same issue. It's not hardware related and it's not update related. It's profile related - at least in my case.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are testing an upgrade from IE 9 to IE 10 and this happens for every user. The only way I have been able to fix is by deleting their profiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are in a virtual xenapp environment so I have a feeling this has to do with old IE9 stuff being stuck in the profile. Not sure what yet.</p>

<h2>            OneNote for iOS and reading offline</h2>
                    <p>OneNote for iOS seems to be a standalone app, but I was wondering if I sync with my desktop version will I be able to read my notes offline on my iPad or iPhone, or can I only read them when connected to the Internet?</p>
<p>

            <p>I guess I can answer my own question. I was able to sync, then go offline on my iPad 2 (no cellular, no wifi) and still read all the notebooks and sections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Offline I edited one note and then closed the app and turned wifi back on. When I checked OneNote on my Mac my changes had been synced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it looks like you can read and edit notes offline in iOS.</p>

            <p>Go to File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced and scroll down to the "Show document content" section. If the "Show picture placeholders" option is checked, clear the check box and click OK. All the pasted pictures should then appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the option was already unchecked or if the pictures still don't appear after unchecking it, try inserting a picture from your hard drive with the Insert &gt; Pictures button. Does that picture appear? If not, then the problem is not with the web browser.
 In that case, first try rebooting your computer. If that doesn't help, then try using the Windows Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features to repair the Office 2013 installation.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We can help you look into this by checking the comparison that we've done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Light blue colored bar in Microsoft Health app - represents that you haven't checked the summary that your phone has gathered from the last synchronization from your Microsoft Band 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dark blue colored bar in Microsoft Health app - represents that you have fully viewed a tile's summary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if pressing the "Sleep" tile that is light blue in color on your Windows phone drops out and goes back to the live tiles, the app itself is misbehaving. Here's what you can do to get it back up and running again:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>&nbsp;Reinstall the Microsoft Band app on your phone.</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 30px; text-align: justify">Here are the steps for your Windows phone:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px; text-align: justify">Step 1: From the Start screen, swipe left to the
<strong>App</strong> list.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px; text-align: justify">Step 2: Tap and hold the Microsoft Band app and tap

<h2>            Office 2016 language won&#39;t change</h2>
                    I have Windows 10 in English, but my Office 2016 is in a foreign language (one I know, but prefer to have my menus in English.) I've changed the language in the Office Preferences to have it match my OS, but Office remains in a foreign language. I've added
 a different version of English (Canadian) and made that the default language, but still no change. How do I get my Office GUI to be in English?

<h2>            Rule Causes Outlook to go into Not Respond</h2>
                    <p>I have a rule in place that moves emails with a certain subject to a specific folder. I have many of them, almost all of which that work without issue. There are a couple though whenever I get an email that matches the subject causes Outlook to go into Not
 Responding Mode. I always just end up restarting as it either never recovers or just takes way too long to recover to be worth the wait. When I restart the email was never moved to the folder I want.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to manually move emails to this folder with not issue, other rules the put other emails into the same folder work without issue, and I am able to view everything in the folder without issue. The emails that are causing the issue do not seem to
 have any issues when only going to the main inbox. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Both Windows 7 and Outlook 2013 are completely up to date.</p>

A conflict is possible, but I have all of my rules set to stop processing more rules once one of them has been met. So even if there is a conflict it should never reach the point where the conflict would affect anything.

            Hi Jackie213,<br />
<br />
After checking your reply, I'm a little confused about your questions. In your initial post, you asked if there would be an update of the OneNote module in Microsoft Teams. Do you mean that the OneNote tab in Teams will also update as the normal OneNote app
 or OneNote Online? If so, I would like to let you know that the tab is just like the normal OneNote Online.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang

            Please do something with this “integration” at last. I don’t want to accept the Skype calls on my phone (moreover, it works very unstable: after accepting no sound and only Skype restart and call back helps). I don’t want to see the Skype calls in my phone’s

            No fix in the 8.27.0.85. Have disabled the notifications for Skype, but now cannot be notified about the new messages and still have Skype calls in my phone’s history. Looks like Microsoft are not ready to break their “vision” of the Skype’s future to
 meet the customers’ needs&nbsp;(as always, and not only for Skype). So the customers have only one choice: to get rid of the soft that is becoming more and more useless. And leave Skype with any future...

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had purchased a laptop a few years back that came with a preinstalled Windows 7 Home Basic and McAfee. After McAfee expired I installed Quick Heal Internet Security. I updated the Windows 2 yrs ago and it turned to Windows 7 service pack 1.&nbsp;After that
 I&nbsp;tried to update windows once more but update failed perhaps because Internet link was fluctuating&nbsp;and somehow&nbsp;my system continued to work normally with the SP1.&nbsp;I have 4 partitions in HDD. One has this copy of windows 7&nbsp;and one has Windows 8. (Both Genuine,
 latter I got directly from Microsoft during a workshop but is yet to be activated). Other 2 are taken for data. The Quick Heal antivirus expired one yr ago and I have used this laptop on only a few occasions&nbsp;since then. But recently I had to transfer some
 files from a system that turned out to be affected from malware and virus problems. Now I suspect that my system may also be affected. So I started a check and found out following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. There is an unknown account in the security tab of properties of&nbsp;all the files and folders contained in&nbsp;the OS partition "both Windows 7 &amp; 8". And have access to read write modify&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>When searching microsoft community for answers I found few&nbsp;people saying that this could be due to some previous account created in my computer. But I am the first owner of this computer system and windows was activated in front of my eyes. Moreover I have
 never given anybody any remote access except once to my brother using Teamviewer&nbsp;but that too had a different profile ID and&nbsp;NO account on Windows directly&nbsp;and my brother has trashed his laptop after that. And Windows 8 has been installed much later after
 it.</p>
<p>Some users said that even after individually removing such accounts from security tabs, removing a few programs and even formatting the&nbsp;complete system&nbsp;they reoccured and from the few links I visited, I guess this issue has not yet been resolved. What should
 be done to reslove this problem and prevent it from occuring ever again? Should teamviewer be uninstalled and what alternative programs can be used if ever I need any such thing again?</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c01d0817-80d7-42f0-a2cd-2587ce23dae6" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I found in the Microsoft website that I should run Microsoft Security Essentials and Microsoft Safety Scanner that are available for free and then install antivirus as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>So&nbsp;First step,&nbsp;I uninstalled a few programs that I suspected, uninstalled the outdated antivirus, updated the Windows Defender and run a Quick Scan.
</p>
<p>According to it No unwanted or harmful software detected. Your computer is running normally.</p>
<p>Step 2 followed the link from Windows Defender&gt; Tools and Settings&gt; Microsoft Malware Protection Center&gt; Microsoft Website and tried to download Microsoft Security Essential. The website opened with Internet Explorer and as I clicked Download, a system prompt
 was generated with a yellow icon containing "&nbsp;! " mark and that "Do you want to run or save mseinstall.exe (13.1MB) from mse.dlservice.microsoft.com?" and "This type of file could harm your computer." with run, save and cancel options.</p>
<p>And this type of questions are asked whenever&nbsp;any executable file is downloaded but I also read on microsoft community that any malware present on system may try to prevent download and as I am not sure if there is any malware, it has entered now during
 file transfer or during the rare occasions when I used this laptop with expired copy of anti virus program, plus the unknown account. It all confused me and for once I even thought if I am downloading MSE from the correct microsoft site. I want to resolve
 this problem as soon as possible. Please help.</p>
<p>Also, While researching, it appeared that Norton, Bitdefender and Kaspersky are good&nbsp; antivirus programs. Is it so? Are they actually reliable? I am using Kaspersky on another system and has not established any vulnerabilites yet.
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/297d1ad8-bda7-43a2-9374-3286d395c563" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The Windows 8 was installed in a hurry&nbsp; on a partition with less volume. The primary boot occurs with Windows 8. I now want to expand that partition with some more GBs available in the Data partiton and then activate and use Win 8 along side Win 7.&nbsp;Is
 it possible? If yes then How should it be performed? Only 475 free MBs are available&nbsp;on that drive and that indicates I am basically on the verge of a crash if any new program is installed. This is worrying me. Is there a way that Win&nbsp;8 can be removed entirely&nbsp;without
 affecting Win 7? <em>I have the Win 8 setup and will install and activate it on some other device&nbsp; in this case.
</em>Some people say that I will need to format all the drives and all the OS and&nbsp;get a freash install. This is not acceptible for me.&nbsp;As my OS came as OEM, I don't have any installation CD.&nbsp;Also the restore is having a few issues that I am going to report
 to Microsoft just now. And I want to keep the genuine copy of Win 7. Please help and&nbsp;mention the steps also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe Microsoft professionals have helped thousands&nbsp;of&nbsp;happy and satisfised users and will help me also to get rid of this trouble,&nbsp;at the earliest. All the help&nbsp;will be appreciated. Any answer from any other person who can help will also be appreciated
 equally. Waiting for reply. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Sir, does this means that I will have to reinstall windows from the scratch? How&nbsp; is that done? I mean how to completely erase each and everythings from the disk and RAM? Usually we put a CD in the drive and simply format everything. But here "I dont have
 any CD", where will I get the same original windows again, I have the activation code though? [Also I have the key for the older version of windows 7 and it was upgraded to windows 7 SP1. I have read that Microsoft has stopped providing support for the older
 version.] If I manage to clear the disk and RAM completely by any method that you will suggest, how can I be sure that this thing has not affected the BIOS? And will not occur again? And let us suppose I take a back up of all the files in a flashdrive. Then
 this backup fill will have to be executed to get all my data back. How can I be sure that this will not infect the system again? Again if I choose to copy the files in say some external harddisk, I can once run it through a scanner, but by now all antivirus
 have failed. How can I be sure that it will not infect the system again in an attempt to recover data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly I found this thread that relates to my problem:</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/account-unknown-s-1-15-2-1/dfca2016-595a-4be2-b0d5-939a48d7bf83?page=1&amp;tab=question&amp;status=AllReplies</p>
<p>
</p><p>And here is my <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">additional findings</span> that is primarily indicating hacking, this I had written in reply to the answer suggested by another MVP in the above thread only, after going through the answers:</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>"</p>
<div>
<p>Sir, you are saying that this account is only executed during installations (like a service). I am unable to understand this exactly. Please kindly elaborate this. If so the work of this account is now over. How can it along with all of its temp files, registery
 files, logs etc be removed??&nbsp; You can check the following question asked by me in this community for reference:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/mse-protect_start/system-prompt-describing-microsoft-security/9dee8c06-65ad-4187-97ec-74826338e0ee</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following is the additional problem I have noticed afterwards:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This unknown account is showing even in the images, pdfs and docs ans even mp3s properties&gt;security tabs. It is every where in the program files and almost all files in C:. I also found a batch of files all accessed on a particular date and time together.
 How is this possible? (And this date and time is not surprisingly not mentioned in my internet history. And to my bad luck I dont remember if I accessed internet on that particular day) [This also questions if this flaw can penetrate windows system offline
 also.??] And this unknown account is present in the security tab of all of these files. Some of the pdfs are additionally showing a copy pdf of the original files with extension.part. Now when i checked explorer 10 history there is a computer section also
 and has the link for all the files I opened in my system with a html icon. Should not there only be the html files i have opened? Amazingly when i click this link, it actually opens those files. It clearly appears fishy. That means browser has its files in
 C:,&nbsp; C: is having link to whatever I view, open, execute, there is this unknown account; together indicates everything is going away. Moreover I now see all the files showing "This file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer"
 in the properties with a unblock after I changed a few settings of windows. But surprisingly I am still able to open these files. And all the downloads also has the unknown account. And now the most annoying part, a few files that I know were clean before,
 now shows this account as the owner for that files. This is very much irritating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing that I can relate to is all this happened after I updated my windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, this is a real big security flaw.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please now explain about each of these findings, what are your opinions regarding each of them and what should be done? Please do reply to this post.""</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Please address this also. It will be really helpful. How this problem came to Windows 7 if it is really a thing of Windows 8? Is there any correction method if I have actually discovered part of the problem. Also if you can tell me where can I view the history
 of my system means what files were accessed on what time and what date. It should have been recorded somewhere within the system. All in one list or folder or some kind of log?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is getting more serious now. PLEASE HELP.</p>

    <title>Whenever I try to uninstall a program, It opens that Programs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kingajl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Whenever I try to uninstall a program, It opens that Programs installer instead.</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday, I accidentally clicked a Pop-up installing a HD view of a stream, just a few minuets later random pages of Firefox (The browser I was using at the time) would open up, one of them '302 Error' and others were random adds. I immediately uninstalled
 Firefox, which stopped the adds appearing, but there were 3 unknown programs which were installed , when I tried to uninstall all 3 of them, that programs installer initially said it was going to Uninstall, but after clicking 'Next' it started a installer
 which I could not cancel out of. Luckily, before download was completed, I managed to get 'Task Manager' up and closed the installer. The next day, random adds appeared on my desktop, which were being showed by those 3 programs (Their logo was on it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how to safely uninstall there programs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 3 Programs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>KEYPLAYER media player 2.2.0-git&nbsp;</p>

            <p>First, you'll need to launch your antivirus program and perform a full scan. If you don't have one, try out one of those:</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Security Essentials <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
(freeware)</a></li><li>Avira Personal Antivirus&nbsp;<a href="http://www.avira.com/en/avira-free-antivirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">(freeware)</a></li></ul>
<p>Then, you'll have to uninstall the programs installed. If they cannot be uninstalled by default uninstaller, try&nbsp;<a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Revo Uninstaller</a>&nbsp;(30-day free trial).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will also need to check for any malicious addons in your Firefox. To do this, press [Ctrl+Shift+A], select Add-ons or Plugins. Remove those you didn't installed. If that wasn't helpful, type about:support in your address bar and press Enter, then select
 "Reset Firefox". Your profile data (such as bookmarks, passwords, history, etc.) will be saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Have a nice day.</p>

            <p>Hi Tony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This looks to be a permission issue. Let's try the following methods and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Clean the favorites folder and check. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may export the current favorites and delete the entire subfolders inside favorites. Later you can import it using the tool.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I too have this issue. A workaround I read about (which does work) is to open IE as an administrator - although it works it is a real pain.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I also read that this was&nbsp;a known issue that was going to be fixed, though where I read this I don't recall, and after several weeks it still persists. I tried the second method above and it didn't work. Method one looks a bit onerous and I can't
 be bothered - I do like IE but to be honest I think exporting to Chrome and use that instead might be the simplest and least annoying solution, unless there is any other news or a&nbsp;simple solution?? There are three users on my computer and the issue effects
 us all.</p>

            <p>This does not address my problem.&nbsp; I can add to my Favorites.&nbsp; My problem is I cannot access my favorites that&nbsp;previously exist in my favorites folder in IE 11.&nbsp; I can save a new website link to my Favorites and access it in my Favorites in&nbsp;IE 11.&nbsp; If I
 look in my Favorites folder, it's there along with all of my other favorites that I can't access.&nbsp; I know this sounds impossible, but that is the reality.&nbsp; If I try to create a folder or link that exists in my Favorites folder, it won't allow me to do it,
 because it already exists.&nbsp; I believe it's some kind of display issue as IE 11 obviously knows that my favorites exist. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just resolved the problem!&nbsp; I don't know how it happened, but with a little experimentation it's working again.&nbsp; Here's what I did; someone else can explain it if they can!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I'd try copying all of my favorites to a new folder&nbsp;&nbsp;which I named 'Favorite'.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then renamed my 'Favorites'&nbsp; folder 'Old Favorites'.&nbsp; I then tried to rename the 'Favorite' folder 'Favorites', but that didn't work; Windows didn't allow that.&nbsp;
 So then I just reverted back; I deleted the 'Favorite' folder and renamed the 'Old Favorites' back to 'Favorites'.&nbsp; Voila!&nbsp; My Favorites reappeared in IE 11!&nbsp; Don't know why, don't really care; they're back, that's all I care.</p>

    <title>Outlook calendar response tallies - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lise niggemyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook calendar response tallies</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to create a sub calendar within my account to manage a few different groups on a separate calendar. Specifically, I need to know when we are renting office space and staffing it, so I've called it Rentals in the image below. When I try to invite
 to the calendar, Outlook says it cannot tally responses for this sub calendar. It does send an invitation to the person, who can click the usual Accept/Decline options, but those don't seem to go anywhere or show on the calendar. Any ideas how to work around?
 I don't get why there should be a demarcation like this.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Lise,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing the details in your post. What need to be explained to you is you can only
<span>tally responses for appointments/meetings scheduled on the primary calendar.</span><span>&nbsp;That's why you received the error message as you are
 scheduling a meeting in the sub calendar.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regarding "</span><span>I need&nbsp;</span><span>to know when we are renting office space and staffing it", I'd
 like to recommend you to use a shared calendar of a shared mailbox. By doing so, you can use the primary calendar of the shared calendar to gather and manage responses. For more information about shared mailbox and shared calendar, please see:&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/email/create-a-shared-mailbox?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create

<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, if you think it is more convenience if you can tall responses for the sub calendar, you can send your feedback to our development team via this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/313228--outlook-on-the-web-office-365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/313228--outlook-on-the-web-office-365</a>.

<h3> mklanders  say:</h3>
<h2>            An error has occurred. Too many cell formats.</h2>
                    
<p><span>When I try to open a workbook that is rather large (30 tabs and calculating - budget workbook) I am getting an error message that states:</span><span>An error has occurred. Too many cell formats.
 Open workbook anyway?<br />
<br />
The workbook then opens with many of the formats and formulas missing (error messages)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This happens across multiple computers and some&nbsp;are worse than others (more format changes and #VALUE errors). I have to spend a lot of time reformating and although I can go into a formula cell and hit enter and it calculates, if I save it and reopen it
 I am back to the same situation of unformatted and error cells.</p>
<p>Greatly appreciate any help.</p>

<p>Hello&nbsp;TerryBowdenNZ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate the issue, kindly try these troubleshooting steps:</p>
<p>1. Sign in to Skype using a different device, dial your landline or mobile number and call it. Check if the same issue will happen.</p>
<p>2. Go to your profile and try removing the landline number, then try to dial your mobile number and check if Skype will still call your landline number instead of your mobile.</p>
<p>3. Completely uninstall Skype:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Quit </strong>Skype.</li><li>Press <strong>Windows key or click Cortana </strong>then type <strong>Skype</strong>.</li><li>Right-click the Skype icon and choose <strong>uninstall</strong>.</li><li>Once uninstalled, press <strong>Windows key </strong>and <strong>R</strong> on your keyboard at the same time.</li><li>On the <strong>Run dialog </strong>box, type in <strong>%appdata%</strong> and click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Open the Skype folder and delete <strong>shared.xml</strong>.</li><li>Look for your Skype name, open it and delete <strong>config.xml </strong>folder.</li><li>Restart your computer.</li><li>Download and re-install Skype:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-computer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a></li></ul>
<p>

    <title>Excel 2016 filtering question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rareruby63  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 filtering question</h2>
                    <p>Hopefully someone can help me.&nbsp; Excel has been updated on my computer to 2016.&nbsp; I'm not terribly excel literate, but I can do what I need to in my files.&nbsp; Previously, when I used a filter in a specific column, and searched for a word, say "intel", every
 line of data with the word intel would appear and I could just select all, or select just the items I want.&nbsp; I would then work with the remaining columns and enter what I needed to into the blank, filtered columns in the worksheet.&nbsp; Previously, once I filled
 in those blank columns, the filtered columns I had searched for the word "intel" in them went away, because I had the other column filtered to blanks, and I could continue on with my work, searching the column I had just filtered to "intel" to my next query.&nbsp;
 However, now with 2016, all of those lines of data that had "intel" in them are still there, so instead of typing my next query in the search box, I must first check "select all" and then reopen the filter box to put in my next search term.&nbsp; This actually
 slows me down quite a bit!&nbsp;&nbsp; Has something changed in the upgrade to 2016 that I can change to be like excel 2013?&nbsp;&nbsp; Excel 2016 has these extra steps when using the filter that I didn't have to do before!</p>

            <p>I don't think I am going to be able to use the problem step recorder due to sensitivity of the information in my workbooks...&nbsp; I will have to ask the boss when I can.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work with two workbooks open at a time, on two different monitors, one that is a file with many&nbsp;columns of cells, some columns with data I&nbsp;have to sort through (thus filtering to find what I need) and other columns with blank cells, also filtered, &nbsp;that
 I fill in based on the information gleaned out of the first filtered&nbsp;column.&nbsp;&nbsp; The blank columns are filtered to "blanks" so that as these columns are filled with the required information, I continue on with the "blank" cells.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a second open workbook that I use to "cut and paste" information out of to put into the blank cells in my "work" file.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was working with Excel in the 2013 version, once I cut and pasted the info into the blank column&nbsp;cells in my "work" file, I could go back to the filtered column, click on the filter, and all of the cells with my previous search query would be filtered
 out.&nbsp; Now, with version 2016, they are still there, and I must either check "select all" and ok, open the filter again, and put in the new query, or use the "clear filter" option to reset the file.&nbsp; I didn't have to do that before in the 2013 version.&nbsp; Once
 I had filled in the blank cells, that information was filtered out to the remaining blank cells.&nbsp; I could just go back to the column I was filtering from, and all of those cells with the previous query were filtered out. Now there are extra steps, which may
 not seem like much, but when I am working with 13,000 lines of data in a report, that's a lot of extra work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can, I will do the problem step recorder, but I'm not sure I am going to be able to do that.&nbsp; I am tempted to just try to go back to the 2013 version, but 2016 does work better!&nbsp;&nbsp; It processes data much faster, with no glitches thus far.&nbsp; I had quite
 a few excel crashes previously.&nbsp; So far, none!&nbsp; Except this filter issue!</p>

            Simplest way to explain it is that now I have to check the "clear filter from" in the filtered column search query, when I didn't have to before, it cleared the previously searched info automatically as I was filling in other columns filtered down to "blanks".

            My feeling is this is related to the toggle switch on the WiFi. Both my wife and I have the same phone, I turn my WiFi off over night she leaves hers on. Mine now won't connect to the WiFi unless I reset the power on both devices. However I can toggle
 WiFi on and off on my wife's phone and my work Android and they reconnect instantly. I have also had this phone for ten months and its only recently happened. Again any thoughts about fixing the phone?

            <p>Thanks for this, alas, still not solved, I am fairly certain it isn't router related as similar devices (wife's identical phone) and all my other devices have no issue. Having renewed the lease on the WiFi the issue still persists.</p>

            <p>Hi GiloEA,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was also experiencing this strange issue for the last few days which started bugging me from last week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If nobody is snooping around your WiFi to crack it, then you may try the fix which worked for me. You would have to change the authentication method for wireless on your router to WEP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Presuming that you are not on WEP already (Well nobody is nowadays :P), follow the below steps to change the wireless authentication method.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Connect a computer via LAN to your Wireless router.</li><li>Enter Router Login Page, should be mentioned on your router label as 'Default Gateway'. If you are unable to find it, use any Search Engine to find it.</li><li>Find the Wireless Security settings under router settings and change it to WEP (Either 64 or 128 Bit).</li><li>You would probably need to change your wireless password on the same page.</li><li>Once you have changed the authentication method and saved changes, reboot your Router.</li><li>If you have changed the password too, change it on your phone and other devices.</li></ol>
<p><strong>*The WEP authentication method is less secure as compared to WPA/WPA2 against snooping attempts, hence DO NOT use this method if you are concerned about your WiFi being misused.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you find any issues while changing authentication method, it's better to call your tech. support than messing the whole configuration. Do let me know if this works for you.</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>Cheers!</p>

            <p>Hi sbhbta,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. We understand that the vibrate notification no longer works on Android and that you have to check the phone periodically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it is already out of our support boundary. Please contact your mobile manufacturer for proper assistance.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you have other clarification, please don't hesitate to post. </p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Thank you. </p>
