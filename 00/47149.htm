<h2>            Xbox One &#38;amp&#59; Humax HDR-FOX T2 Freeview UK Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>Having some really annoying issues with my&nbsp;Xbox One &amp; Humax HDR-FOX T2.</p>
<p>Every now and then when switching on or changing channel it will just show coloured snow/interference. This interference will randomly freeze before going back to moving around. Sometimes when i change channel on the Humax the interferance will continue
 for a few minutes and then eventually it will resume showing the TV signal on that channel - however most of the time this comes along with no audio and intermittent freezing of the picture.</p>
<p>My Xbox is part of my overall system and fires up the TV and Humax on start which i'd really like to keep.</p>
<p>I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard Resetting the Xbox </li><li>Changing the Audio output on the Humax to Stereo </li><li>Upgrading the Humax&gt;Xbox HDMI cable </li></ul>
<p>I am in the UK using Freeview &amp; Freeview HD (Which can sometimes cause issues).</p>
<p>Any suggestions or thoughts appreciated.</p>

<p>I'm using a Humax box as well, it's the new one BT DTR-T2110 and it doesn't seem to have any issues like the one you have, maybe it's the type of box.</p>

<p>Thanks guys. Shouldn't be needing to upgrade the box really as it works perfectly when plugged direct into the telly, but interesting to find out that yours is fine.</p>
<p>Shame that MS can't get this sorted as its spot on when it works and really integrates the Xone into the system.</p>

<p>been having the exact same problem with my Humax box, seems to be an issue, though mines has got worse since about 3 days ago. Now got Humax plugged back into TV, really is a pain cause I liked the setup where the TV was controlled by my Xbox One. hopefully
 Microsoft can fix the problem.</p>

            Hi Katheryn
<br />
<br />Please explain this in more detail, where has the file/folder disappeared from, is that from inside Word or from Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Do you know the exact folder you saved to, and if you open Windows File Explorer, can you not locate that file?
<br />
<br />Does the file still appear in the Recent list of Word, if so, what is the reported location of that file?       
        </p>

<h2>            How to view previous error message.</h2>
                    <p>While copying a folder, I was unable to do so because the name of a file was too long. For some reason I am not able to find the file and need to know if I can view the error message that showed the file name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can view the last error message encountered while copying the data from one location to another?</p>

            <p>This is not a new issue but I tried a separate post based on the age of the latest posts. Those old posts never did get a resolution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the troubleshooter which was also mentioned in previous similar trouble posts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No updates pop up in the store.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>For anyone else who may be having this issue I did get the slideshow to display all files in the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My troubleshooting had a flaw so I am not sure if "re indexing" solved it or toggling "automatically enhance my photos" in the app settings solved it.&nbsp; If it happens again I will be more careful in my process.</p>

 dumb as a post when it comes to computing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm not from this bottle fed era where everything is done for the PC user because most of them are Nit-Whits with the attention span of a Goldfish.</p>
<p>Like many others I grew up on Windows 95,98, 2000, ME, XP, &amp; Vista etc. Using those versions you surfed the Net by the seat of your pants all the while fighting off viruses &amp; the like left right &amp; center. But we survived &amp; even with all the security holes
 it was a much better experience that I'm having now. </p>
<p>I know what I am doing &amp; I know what I want windows to do for me but windows 10 won't let me do things my way. It's so caught up in its own importance that it has become a loathsome boring &amp; predictable OS.
</p>
<p>All of the choices have gone &amp; in their place we have this,,this thing that paints everyone with the same brush &amp; tries to do everything the same for everyone. YES MASTER,, NO MASTER.</p>
<p>But the problem is that not all of us want it to be that way. I want to be able to choose my options &amp; if I blow it and make a mistake then so be it. I don't need a Nanny like Windows 10 to do everything &amp; all the thinking for me. I want real options again.</p>
<p>Give me the old days when computing was an exciting experience &amp; windows was still drive-able &amp; occasionally even a joy to use.</p>
<p>Win 10 = 3/10</p>

            Because best practice is widely accepted to have these sorts of services switched on.&nbsp; And yes there are many people out there who can do this manually themselves (and have done for many years) however there are a lot of people have no idea, hence Windows
 10 is built from a secure out the box point of view.

<p>I understand everything you have written &amp; I'm not disputing anything you have said, but for the life of me I cannot understand why the people who do know what they are doing are not given the option to choose &amp; turn things off. Like it's not as if it is
 hard to put in a switch, in fact many turn off options are already there,, but they just don't work. It is very frustrating.</p>
<p>For someone like me I can easily open gpedit and tweak the hell out of this OS to my liking but I should not have to.
</p>
<p>I believe that by making it so hard to tweak the security settings in Windows 10 it has actually made the OS more vulnerable because people who are trying to customize the OS to their liking could be accidentally shutting off needed security &amp; services.</p>
<p>I'm not the only one who feels this way because there is an entire industry out there devoted to making programs to customize how Windows 10 operates..</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that Windows 7 is still the most popular OS and it will be for a long long time. it is still quite secure and without all of the forced security that is in Windows 10. It is quick and fun to use as well.</p>
<p>Using Windows 10 is a chore.</p>

            I totaly agree with you. I grew up with DOS 1.2 when it went public, and all the subsequent versions of DOS and windows. As you say windows has become obnoxious and controlling, and it seems with every update there is a new problem to resolve.&nbsp;

<h2>            &#8220;Code 19&#58; Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information &#40;in the registry&#41; is incomplete or damaged&#8221; when tried to use USB headsets</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: <span>All USB Headsets do not work on my system, works fine on others.</span></p>
<p>I have a Win7 64bit custom built system.&nbsp; My problem is that all USB Headsets do not work on my system.&nbsp; When I first install them I get a Code 1 error in the Device manager, later this becomes a code 19.&nbsp; If I try to reinstall the drivers I get an error
 saying either the inf File was written for XP or eariler or is missing information.&nbsp; I have contacted the Headsets manufacturers Logitech (g35) and Creative (Tactic3d Sigma).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have installed these onto 3 other computers (2 Win7s and XP).&nbsp; The drivers lists on the Win7s are the same except for USBaudio.sys on both headsets.&nbsp; I copied the usbaudio for a 64bit system to mine in the same locations as I found them on it.&nbsp; Still no
 luck.</p>
If I use the generic USB Headset it works and the Usbaudio.sys in called in the driver list.&nbsp; I cannot afford to pay another $50 after paying $100 for these.&nbsp; I'm at a loss on how to fix this.<br />

<p><span>Hi PhantomX01,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Re-install audio drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Uninstall the sound drivers completely from Device Manager and then install the latest audio drivers for your computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Device-Manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Open
 Device Manager</a>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Expand
 Sound, Video and Game Controllers</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the Audio component and click uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>Once the drivers are completely uninstalled, download the latest drivers for your sound card from the computer manufacturer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now try plugging in your headset. If you’ve any drivers that came along with your headset, install them and then check if they work.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if you need any further assistance.</span></p>

<p>Thank you for response</p>
<p>As I stated when I try to install the driver via Device Manager I get either "..this INF file was written for XP or eariler" or "...the INF file has incomplete.."&nbsp;&nbsp; Also I was poking around and got this report.&nbsp; "This device has an incomplete registry information"&nbsp;
 I believe missue isn't with the device drivers it is the Windows file "USBaudio.sys" not being used by the device.</p>

            Also I have no trouble from the drivers themselves.&nbsp; USBaudio.sys is a windows driver.&nbsp; The problem isn't with the drivers of the headset it is USBaudio.sys itself.&nbsp; I've trying to fix this for some time now and have used all the support from both companies.&nbsp;
 Both are doing the same thing and both say this is a Windows problem and have nothing to do with the headsets or drivers.

<p><span>Hi PhantomX01,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Perform a System File Checker</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The System File Checker tool will help you in repairing the corrupted system files. I would suggest you to run the tool by following the directions
 given in the link below and check if you’re able to get the USB headset to work.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Re-install motherboard chipset drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If your computer came with a motherboard chipset drivers and utilities disc, I would suggest you to insert it and start installing the chipset
 drivers. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: Install the audio drivers in Windows XP Compatibility mode</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You can try to install the audio drivers for your device by choosing Windows XP as the compatibility level. Since the INF file was designed for
 Window XP or earlier versions of Windows XP, probably that would help you to get the USB headset to work</span></p>

            I've tried all that and no difference.&nbsp; I have no problem running the driver setup exe in either mode.&nbsp; USBAudio.sys is a system driver of Windows. I get that error within device manager when I try to reinstall or change the driver.&nbsp; Also I've noticed
 another thing.&nbsp; If I let Windows update try to update the driver Device manager it crashes.&nbsp; Curious if that might be an issue. SFC finds no errors.&nbsp; Welcome to my world on this.&nbsp; Sorry for the late post on this either this was read only or I couldn't log
 on.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I do have a question is there anything to download to INSTALL or FIX usbaudio.sys?&nbsp; I've looked on Microsoft's site and found one or two, but said not for my system.<br />

            I might have stumbled onto a possible cause.<br />
<br />
OK I went back and checked system32 folder for USBaudio.sys with view hidden files on.&nbsp; It was not in there.&nbsp; OK I tried to copy it back in there and I get do you wish to overwrite this file like it is in there.&nbsp; And it still doesn't show in system32.&nbsp; This
 may be the root of my problem.&nbsp; I have tried both cmd and safe mode to see if it is there and it isn't.&nbsp; I have run checkdisk and it seems not to find any problems and reports clean.&nbsp; Hope this helps

            I just spent 3 hours fighting permissions (for whatever reasons Users are locked out of there system files) to get the file in there.&nbsp; You what I got for my troubles wasted time and the error<br />
<br />
Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. (Code 19)<br />
<br />
If someone can tell me WHERE the registry for the device is and what the called drivers for the device is stored I can fix this myself.&nbsp; Have ability not the knowledge of where to look and don't have time to fight the permissions to find an answer.&nbsp; It seems
 I paid $90 for a paper weight.&nbsp; Sorry I VERY frustrated here<br />

<p>You don't need to go into W Fax &amp; Scan to add or edit them.&nbsp; Never used the contacts folder myself but had a play:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In File Explorer:</p>
<p>&nbsp; - click on the "Contacts" folder (found under C:\Users\Your User Account\Contacts)</p>
<p>&nbsp; - right click a contact and select Open - to edit an existing contact</p>
<p>&nbsp; - right click any blank space in the folder and select New / Contact&nbsp; - to create a new contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the Contacts folder was also used by some of the early version of Micorsoft's freebie Mail programs eg the old Windows Mail / Outlook Express.&nbsp; Can't confirm as never used them.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Another little tip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have found the Contacts folder in File Explorer, right click on it and select "Pin to Quick Access"</p>
<p>Now it will appear up the top so you don't have to look for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make things easier:</p>
<p>- bring up windows start menu</p>
<p>- click on settings</p>
<p>- click on Personalization</p>
<p>- click on Start (on the left side of Personalization screen)</p>
<p>- click on "Choose which folders appear on start"&nbsp; </p>
<p>- make sure File Explorer is turned on</p>
<p>- close settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when you open the Windows Start Menu you will see File Explorer.&nbsp; When you click on the Jump List next to it (the &gt; symbol) you will see the folders you have pinned to File Explorer's Quick Access</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last tip Get in and play with the new features of the O/S before whinging about them.</p>

            <p>You are right whining isn't helpful here but it relieves some of this senior's frustrations. &nbsp;Guess I'm getting too darn old for new stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been exploring W10 since Nov 6th and I am pretty tenacious about getting things to work. &nbsp;It took me a few weeks to finally get my Samsung printer to work yet my HP printer was not a problem from day one. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I learned that Contacts was somewhere under my user name but just couldn't find that but finally did yesterday and have set up Windows Contact on my desktop beside Fax and Scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I want to send a fax I must use the Windows contact because the W10 Fax program isn't compatible with my version of Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway thank you both very much. &nbsp;Next project is to get my USRobotics usb fax modem to function.</p>

<h2>            safe mode via msconfig</h2>
                    Hello -- <br />
<br />
I was having a issue trying to start in safe mode --&nbsp; I found in this forum a suggestion to turn on safe mode in msconfig - via&nbsp; boot tab&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I did as&nbsp; suggestion in the post -- restarted and the system started in safe mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Once in safe mode,&nbsp; I start msconfig to reboot normally, but there was no boot tab&nbsp; I did an "apply" to "run normally" but the system kept start in
<br />
safe mode --&nbsp; <br />
<br />
How do I get out of this? <br />
<br />
Thanks&nbsp; <br />

Start - type in Search box -&gt; MSCONFIG&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>find at top of list - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN</strong><br />
<br />
In MSCONFIG - Boot tab - Boot Options - uncheck SAFE BOOT = APPLY / OK<br />
<br />
============================================================<br />
<br />
If needed (and they should not be) :<br />
<br />
<p>StartUp Repair often works from a Windows 7 Installation Disk or Windows 7 Repair Disk
<br />
when it&nbsp;does not from Recovery or a Recovery Disk. If needed how to make a Windows 7<br />
Repair Disk is below. A Repair Disk can be made on any computer with a CD burner running
<br />
XP, Vista, or Window 7 as it uses no files from the Host computer.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>You can try some of these in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot.</p>
<p>If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy<br />
protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already<br />
own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come<br />
back and try Startup Repair again.)</p>

<h2>            Use Windows 10 Segoe MDL2 Assets font in web development</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>I apologize if this isn't the right place to ask, but I found nowhere else to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Segoe MDL2 Assets Font in Windows 10 App development before, but now I would like to use the font in web development.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to find any license information regarding using the font in the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should mention that I don't plan to embed it using @font-face in CSS, but rather convert certain glyphs to SVG and embed them in &lt;img&gt; tags in HTML. (example of the glyphs I'm talking about within Segoe MDL2 Assets: http://res.cloudinary.com/dvi6ot1t1/image/upload/v1428884689/segoe_i0d5te.jpg
 the Home Glyph).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to do so legally?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360&#58; dead in Japan&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hopefully Mr Takashi Sensui can reverse the slump else there goes my favourite jap games (idolmaster)&nbsp;...
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fl.yimg.com%2fus.yimg.com%2fi%2fmesg%2femoticons7%2f2.gif" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/news/xbox-360-dead-japan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SOURCE</a>]</p>
<p>[quote]</p>
<p>The Xbox 360's life appears to be coming to an end in Japan, with hardware sales falling, retailers beginning to turn their back on the console, and the system's last high-profile Japanese exclusive headed to PlayStation 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June, Microsoft announced that Japanese Xbox 360 sales had finally <a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/307906/xbox-360-hits-15-million-sales-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
passed 1.5 million units</a> since the system's release in 2005, but that should not be taken as a sign that its fortunes are improving. Media Create data for the year to date puts Xbox 360 hardware sales at just 72,721 units, a drop of 46.7 per cent on the
 same period last year. Sales of its rival, Sony's PlayStation 3, have also fallen year on year, but only by 17.1 per cent, to 735,637 units.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The slump in sales has, we understand, caused many Japanese videogame retailers to contemplate dropping the Xbox 360 altogether. Geo, the nation's largest specialist retailer, is drastically scaling back its Xbox 360 business, and staff at electronics retailer
 Yamada Denki in Ikebukuro, Tokyo, confirmed that the company is removing hardware and software from the majority of its stores nationwide, and is selling off its remaining stock at a heavy discount. It will still sell the console and games, but only in selected
 stores where the system continues to be sufficiently popular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Tokyo's smaller, specialist stores, Xbox 360 consoles and games are beginning to appear in bargain bins, or "wagon sales". Games can be had for as little as ¥100 (79p), with one store selling the
<em>Halo: Reach</em> hardware bundle for ¥9,980 (£79.30).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest indicator of the Xbox 360's struggles in Japan is the fate of
<em>The Idolmaster</em>. Namco Bandai's pop-star management game, first released in arcades in 2005, was an Xbox 360 exclusive, its 2007 release reportedly causing a
<a href="http://kotaku.com/241420/rumor-japans-xbl-sign+up-rate-highest-in-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
rush of new Xbox Live signups</a> and a sharp increase in sales of Microsoft Points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While PSP and DS releases followed, it was Microsoft's last high-profile console exclusive, and a sequel was released in February. It sold 34,621 copies in the week of its release, entering the Japanese all-formats chart at number ten, but the following
 week, it did not even make the top 40. The 2009 PSP release sold around 122,000 copies in its first week, and was in the top 40 for five weeks in total.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such it was no surprise when, late last month, Namco Bandai announced that it would be
<a href="http://www.andriasang.com/e/blog/2011/07/20/idolmaster_ps3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">porting Idolmaster 2 to PlayStation 3</a>, with the Xbox 360 version's DLC included.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With mobile games increasingly popular in Japan - the sector's rise driven by mobile social networks like Gree and Mobage - cross-platform connectivity is becoming increasingly important as companies seek to protect their traditional sources of revenue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sony is becoming increasingly aware of this, with the upcoming <em>Monster Hunter HD</em>, the first game released for PS3 as part of the
<a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/news/psp-titles-bound-ps3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PSP Remaster</a> series, allowing a single save file to be shared between PS3 and PSP. Microsoft, of course, has no portable console. With PSP still selling in huge numbers in Japan, and Vita set for
 release before the end of the year, it's little surprise that publisher eyes are drawn towards Sony: after all, cross-platform play means selling two games instead of one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kinect has done much to extend the 360's life in the west, sales of 8 million units in its first 60 days seeing it awarded a
<a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/news/kinect-passes-10m-sales" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Guinness World Record</a>, named the fastest-selling consumer electronics device of all time. In Japan, it was
<a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/news/kinect%C3%ADs-japan-sales-detailed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outsold on launch</a> by PlayStation Move - no great surprise given PS3's far larger installed base - with
<a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/news/kinect-struggling-japan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">one retailer</a> saying shortly after launch that, far from helping sell the console to a wider audience, it was only being bought by existing Xbox 360 owners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the console's gradual disappearance from store shelves does not prevent gamers making their purchases online - indeed, it is our understanding that Amazon now handles a substantial proportion of Japanese Xbox 360 software sales - it does complicate
 things for Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With an Xbox 360 successor widely accepted to be released in 2014, the firm may struggle to convince Japanese retailers to stock and prominently display the console when they have a decade's worth of proof that higher returns are available elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft clearly still holds the Japanese market in high regard - just last month it

appointed Takashi Sensui</a> as head of the newly formed Interactive Entertainment Business (IEB), leaving him to focus almost exclusively on Xbox 360. While reports at the time implied a lighter load for Sensui - his previous remit also covered Windows and
 Office software - perhaps the reshuffle was in recognition of the onerous task he faces to revive the console's ailing fortunes.</p>

<p>Not a surprise. Japan is a complete different culture compared to the US. The 360 sells well in other counties such as the UK and much of Europe because the culture is somewhat similar to us Americans. Or Japan obviously has a bad taste in games and rather
 worship a console that continues to fail. </p>

<p>Well the reality, the shops come in first until there ok.</p>
<p>But who moves the store to purchase and the customer, and this client is not happy with what we live in Japan tel.</p>
<p>Even with the support here in Japan which is a waste. Many times I had no answers to my problems.</p>
<p>I live in Japan in seven years. I have Xbox 360 from the first day it was released here.</p>
<p>Japanese has a different taste (Crazy), so to speak, but they appreciate things more here.</p>
<p>Xbox 360 an American unit, which tries to conquer the home of powers such as Nintendo, Sega (Death yet), &amp; Sony. What Microsoft did with exempting farmers here in Japan, for real do not have that even pro client.</p>
<p>marketing in Japan and horrible, the contents of the Live and horrible, so when he saw the Japanese and their Japanese Live Live sees the American, goes mad with rage, Japan has no content, like the U.S., Japan does not have the promotions that Americans
 have.</p>
<p>Japanese do not like that, or the network to all or Live and then bye bye.</p>
<p>I have more than 100 Japanese friends, everyone is tired of dreaming of a better live at the point of content, DLC, arcade Games, Movies. The films were better in early 2010, before films and videos were a waste.</p>
<p>The Japanese hate it, this and a list below.</p>
<p>1) To launch a game, and this game is asia version but not the Japanese, including their DLCs.</p>
<p>2) prohibited by Net DLCs, such as Call of Duty World at War, here in Japan sells the game, but not the DLCs.</p>
<p>3) Games that should be with the server online, but look for more User response, there is never one.</p>
<p>4) Support in general, oh it within a few who do not like to work.</p>
<p>5) The difference between the offers, promotions or never, only in America that has, Japan has no !!!!!</p>
<p>6) Lack of education of Japanese Americans when they are together in the room, racism heavy, and I can prove it.</p>
<p>But beyond that, Microsoft and politics, to change, instead of her wanting her everything she has to give to get what she wants. No offense, but while Microsoft did not understand how Nintendo &amp; Sony live here, in the example being "we go behind our users,
 we listened to them" there will be successful here. Here to talk more than died in the Japan game, which here was the house of games, this was not here and yet. The real success of the Xbox 360 out of Japan and FPS, so I just shot Xbox. Between Xbox and Playstation
 3, the real advantage to a competitor and mutimidia that the xbox does not have, among other related web access, and an Xbox 360 console to not cross them. Very limited in other areas.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>I hate to be the one to tell you this, but Japan has pretty much owned the video game business since they became involved in it. While the 360 does very well in North America, Japan still dominates the industry. While the 360 does well in Europe, the last
 time I checked, PS3&nbsp;outsells the 360&nbsp;there (by a much smaller margin than Asia), leaving North America as the only territory where the 360 leads. So if&nbsp;anyone wants to cry that a particular counrty is simply biased towards their "home-made" console, that finger
 should point to America more than Japan&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Japan doesn't have bad taste, they simply don't want all of their games exactly the same as each other,&nbsp;as Americans seem to.</p>

<p>Depends on where/what your looking for.....</p>
<p>You can find cheap dump bins in America too......</p>
<p>Premium titles are at a premium price for a reason....</p>
<p>Asking if the 360 is dead in Japan is just silly. &nbsp; &nbsp;The answer is yes.</p>
<p>Not because it's japan but, because the market is shifting towards Next gen consoles like the One and PS4. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>Xbox/Microsoft has always had low sales in Japan FYI-----</p>
<p>Just Remember, &nbsp;Nintendo and Sony are based out of Japan-- It's a different market...</p>
<p>If they could, Nintendo/Sony &nbsp;would love to dominate the market but, &nbsp;We enjoy human contact in America.... &nbsp; (weird I know)</p>

                    <p>Old title: Jigsaw Puzzle Frenzy puzzle packs</p>
<p>I have purchased some of the jigsaw puzzle frenzy puzzle packs only to have them disappear from the page after one day. &nbsp;I am paying for something that I have no access to anymore. &nbsp;They came back after another purchase, disappeared, purchased another, they
 came back, disappeared again, now I purchased another one yesterday, the ones I had purchased and disappeared came back and now they are gone again. &nbsp;I am paying ransom for these. &nbsp;I am a little more than frustrated, I am furious!</p>

<h2>            Cortana still crashing despite several fixes</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As above Cortana is crashing constantly despite reinstalling, re-registering (using powershell) and also freshly formatting the dive and resintalling win10 twice using two different USB sticks and a fresh version from the creation tool each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The exact issue is I click on the cortana box and it does open up the window, however the blue dots whiz across the top once or twice then the window closes. Watching the process in task manager reveals it disappears and reappears when the window closes.
 During the time the window is open the icons are not responsive and I cannot type anything in. Speech recognition also does not work and no sound is made once the window opens on saying, "Hey, Cortana". Occasionally the cortana search box will disappear and
 the microphone icon will appear off centre above on restart or after it presumably crashes and restarts.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have ran a chkdsk. sfc scan, checked all the hardware (ram, HDD, cpu) but it seems to be only on this particular laptop. I have even replaced the HDD with a new one and found no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine is an HP 255 G4 running Win 10 Home 1809 Build 17763.47 with no updates available as of now. All HP drivers are installed and up to date. The account is an offline one and, I am fixing this for a friend, he does not want it linked to a microsoft
 account.</p>

<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Reinstall Start Menu
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below and paste into Powershell &gt; Enter &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -Name Microsoft.Windows.ShellExperienceHost | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />2. CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to start Task Manager
<br />Locate Windows Explorer in Processes tab and kill it
<br />Now at the top File &gt; Run new task &gt; Put explorer.exe and Enter
<br />
<br />3. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter

<br />
<br />4. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<p>Hello Vijay, thank you for your quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Script ran fine and cortana is still acting the same. Restarted and again no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Ran the explorer.exe new task and it predictably created a new file explorer window. Again no change in cortana search. Again no change after restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Troubleshooter found no issues, i have ran this before too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Repair upgrade was also unsuccessful in fixing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not to sound ungrateful but isn't step 4 what I have already done already?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the event viewer references an issue with edgehtml.dll perhaps you have some more steps on fixing or troubleshooting regarding this indicator?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>

            Hi Brad
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Pro edition and higher editions include an option called Hyper-V which you can use. You have to supply your own Windows XP or earlier version license though, 
<br />
<br />Here is how it works:

<br />
<br />If you are not running Windows 10 Pro, you would need to upgrade to it.
<br />
<br />An alternative would be Oracle VirtualBox which is a free download:

            Is there ANY way for me to run virtual PC instead of hyper v in windows 10. Hyper V will not support what I need. My choices currently are, keep windows 7 and totally ignore windows 10, or purchase something like vmware, since hyper v, absolutely cannot
 do what I need.&nbsp;

<p>VirtualPC was created for Windows 7 only. It can't be separately installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Hyper-V is not the only alternative, nor is it even the best alternative, but that's what you'll hear about in a community forum sponsored by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>VirtualBox from Oracle and VMWare Workstation Player from VMWare are much easier to use. In addition, they are free and very popular. You will find plenty of illustrated tutorials on the internet that explain in detail how to set them up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of the two I would try VirtualBox first. It has always been free, whereas VMWare Workstation Player is the free version of VMWare Workstation, and VMWare, understandably, wants you to use the paid version so they're less generous with their support for the
 free version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got VMs for Windows XP, Windows 95 and even for MS-DOS. I also have a VM for Linux Mint. When I was part of the Insiders program for Windows 10, I ran Windows 10 inside a VirtualBox virtual machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's nothing wrong with Hyper-V; it just demands more technical knowledge than the alternatives. Try VirtualBox or VMWare Workstation Player - I think you'll be happier.</p>

            Virtual PC was NOT created for windows 7. It was actually created for the MAC computer, and was ported to windows, and first free release, I believe was in 2001. I know for a fact I have been using it on windows XP, but I think it was version 4, that was
 released for free, in 2001. I happen to like virtual PC, because you can set it to never make changes, so no matter what happens to a virtual machine, infect it, whatever, simply shut it down, and delete the change file, and you are right back where you were.
 It also has some other advantages that I haven't found in virtualbox, and vm ware I am familiar with, since I use it on my mac. It however does not offer the same advantages that I really need from virtual PC. I guess, I will simply have to run win 7, even
 after it's no longer supported by Microsoft.&nbsp;

            VirtualBox makes checkpoints whenever you like. So does VMWare Workstation, but not in the free version.

<h2>            Problem with Windows 10 Start Menu&#47;Cortana</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I downloaded and upgraded to Windows 10 today from Windows 8.1, and I cannot use the Start Menu. When I click it, nothing appears. In the resource monitor, it does start SearchUI.exe (Start Menu) but then it says its not responding, then gets suspended
 for a second and the SearchUI.EXE process ends. Any help on how to fix this would be much appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Sir Dtrain</p>

<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>Unfortunately Malaysia is not part of the Xbox Network yet and as such services aren't provided there normally.</p>
<p>That is not to say all is lost however! &nbsp;Due to the nature of these forums I am not able to detail how but I can tell you that you should look to "BRIDGE" your Xbox through your computer. &nbsp;By doing some good Googling work and having a tech-savvy friend you
 can use your Computer as a spoof IP by closing off connections in your router to force your Xbox to believe it is in the United Kingdom. &nbsp;This will then allow you to connect to the servers as approriate.</p>
<p>It's not supported Officially by Xbox but it's also not against the Terms of Service. &nbsp;You also may have some serious lag issues and latency problems and your security could also be compromised but as long as you understand those risks you are more than
 welcome to do this.</p>
<p>So just look to bridge your xbox from the Modem to your Computer to Your Xbox and make the Computer think it's in the UK, problem solved.</p>

<p><span>I can't believe an XBL Ambassador &amp; Community Expert is honestly explaining to someone how to violate the XBL Terms of Service. What you describe below most certainly is a violation of the XBL Terms of Service.
 ANY network manipulation is not allowed. If the use of a VPN is not allowed what would make you think the below method would be? Any attempts to redirect the XBL service from one region to another to gain access to it or any of its content is forbidden and
 will result in a permanent account/console ban from XBL when you (I mean this in general) are caught.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Xbox LIVE and Games for Windows LIVE Terms of Use
<p>4. &nbsp; Using the Service.</p>
<p>You must not:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>resell or redistribute the Service or any part of it; use any means we don’t authorize to modify, reroute, or gain access to the Service or attempt to carry out these activities;
</li><li>use any unauthorized third-party software, service, or device to access the Service;
</li><li>disrupt, or try to gain unauthorized access to any account, computer, hardware, or network related to the Service;
</li></ul>

                    i have installed the sp2 of vista through the standalone version and not through windows update, because i have the greek version of windows and i couldn't wait for the sp2 to be offered on windows update to get it so i got it from the standalone version.<br />
but&nbsp;when the service pack installed it didn't remove the previous language pack i had already installed on my pc (i thought it would be automaticly&nbsp;removed during the installation), and i removed it later after the sp2 installation.<br />
and now i can't install the new and updated language packs windows is offering me.<br />
any help????

            Hello Pavilion_alex, Nice to see your reply, welcome to the Microsoft Vista forum again. First please uninstall the previous language pack from going to program and features. Please download the setup file for 32 bit from the link given below and install
 it in a clean boot state. The link for the language pack is: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/942903 The steps to do a clean boot is :http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796 Hope this resolves the issue.Please do let me know about the outcome. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
