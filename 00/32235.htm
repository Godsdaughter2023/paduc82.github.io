<p>Hey all. Just defeated the Gaping Dragon (epic) I have about 37000 souls. Now, what do you reckon I should spend these on? Moss and Purging Stones, upgrading my attributes (I'm Level 26 I think), OR going back to the merchant in those sewers and buy some
 armor pieces of Dharhm? I can't remember the dudes name.</p>

<p>I would say, go to the garden area kill some tree monsters (they drop moss, which you will need). Also make sure you have a lot of arrows. Or if you have the money, buy the moss at the vendors, however they are pricey.</p>

<p>I'd say at least 20, make sure it's the stuff that cures poison and toxin. &nbsp; &nbsp;no curses are in blighttown. &nbsp; it's going to take you at least 5 of them until you learn the layout of the area. &nbsp; 5 for the swamps. &nbsp;10 more once your comfortable exploring the

    <title>Black screen after shutting down the computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lithwhack  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black screen after shutting down the computer</h2>
                    I don't know if this has to do with anything but this problem occurred after I updated my Windows 10 Pro to build 1903 using the Windows 10 Update Assistant. Now the problem is that when I shut down the computer normally everything works fine. It goes
 through the usual stuff until the monitor fells asleep and wakes up right away after maybe 3 seconds. The screen just shows black, no cursor no nothing and my computer doesn't seem to shut down by it self. The only way I can shut it down is by holding the
 power button on my computer or unplugging it.<br />
<br />
I really hope some has a solution for this problem, I've tried a couple of things that I saw online but they didn't work.

            HI Lithwhack. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) If this was caused by a Version Update then for 10 days you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool which is explained more here:   
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>.
<br />
<br />After 10 days you can reinstall the older version using downloads available from Microsoft TechBench here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />2)Next you can try fixes here:
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-will-not-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-will-not-...</a>
<br />
<br />3) Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />4) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />5) Run a Startup Repair to check over the boot files: 
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>XBL Rewards Program&#58; More harm than good&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mynameisgrundle  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBL Rewards Program&#58; More harm than good&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>When XBL launched its rewards program I was pretty excited. For years I've been a loyal customer. Paid for the gold service, bought DLC regularly, tried out new services on the dashboard, etc. I thought Microsoft was actually about to reward their customers
 with "Kool-Aid point" kind of stuff. What we got was not only of no real consequence, but was downright insulting to longtime service users.</p>

<p>Lets look first at the facet of the program that got the most attention; rewards for achievement levels. On the surface this seems like a nice idea, but they had to be careful. Achievements have no real regulations, with game rewarding you 1000 points for
 anywhere between 2 minutes (Avatar: the Last Airbender) and hundreds of hours (Rumble Roses) of play. It's simply not realistic to give rewards with any real monetary value. Gamerscore is to easily driven up through games with "gimme" achievements. Instead
 XBL rewards gamers with 2 things of no real value. A n avatar item once a year and, (at the highest level) a 2% monthly rebate on marketplace purchases. While I understand that one should not complain about being given free money back, let's really look at
 what you get out of this. At 2% that means that when you spend 400 points ($5) you get back 8 points. Even a gamer who regularly spends $50 on the marketplace a month (which I strongly doubt is the norm) would receive a "reward" of $1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, free is free. I appreciate that. But this is truly a halfway effort by Microsoft. It's meant to be a feather in their cap with their playerbase. Something to let them say "See! We care about our players!". However, I don't see a single player getting
 excited about these rewards. They simply have no impact on the individual. While Microsoft may notice the 2% back they're giving when multiplied by a massive amount of players. Those nickles add up on that scale. But are they getting a return on this investment
 through player good will? I sincerely doubt it. I buy a lot of DLC but at 2% I can't get excited about 80 points in my account after having spent 4000.</p>
<p>The second issue I've seen with this service pertains to it's "reward point" program. Now this is the part of the service where it really looks like we're going to get some value. Things like "play 8 community playdates in a month for 100 points" is a great
 idea. But as I dug through the (relatively light) selection of ways to get points I found myself getting insulted rather than excited. "Activate and use Netflix for the first time 100 points", "make your first marketplace purchase 100 points" . What about
 those of us who have been loyal customers for years? I use Netflix all the time, but no 100 points for me, because...well, they've already got me on the hook, I suppose.</p>
<p>Here enlies the frustration for me. I understand marketing ploys like this are meant to lure in new customers. That an existing customer base is not as important as the customers a company does not have yet. But come on, Microsoft, think this through. With
 Playstation Plus members getting access to whole major-release games as part of their service you can no longer sit back on the "well, we charge because our service is better" answer. Another generation of consoles is coming, with an opportunity for Sony to
 fix the flaws in their online system. Now is the time to generate good will and loyalty amongst your existing users, not cast about for late, late....very late, adopters of your service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, the rewards system is lackluster. It's not that it's bad, it's that it's unimpressive. It's not something I feel compelled to tell all my friends about, and it should be. Why waste the money, Microsoft, if none of your customers are going to notice
 or care?</p>

<p>It's because the program is actually run by a company only about 15 minutes away from my house. These rewards points are not coming from Microsoft. For they are only a client of ePrize who is the company the program actually belongs to. This is also why
 these points have an expiration date. They are not Microsofts points.</p>

<p>How do you get so many pts? I've been on Xbox Live Rewards since October and have gotten 420pts. Decent but that's what? 5$ Half of it was because my Gold Subscription renewed. I really hope Sony fixes their online and use more dedicated servers to improve
 connection speed and decrease lag. If Xbox Live stays the way it is, I'm moving to the PS4.</p>
<p>Sorry Microsoft, you're no longer the Gold Standard of online gaming like you were a couple of years ago. You rightfully charged your customers 60$ a year to simply play online but it's no longer warranted. PSN+ blows you out of the water in terms of actually
 rewarding their loyal customers.</p>

<p>And your issue with lag on the PS3 I am 100% certain is your wireless connection. Hardware is the one big con of the Playstation. For wifi, its only Wireless G vs Wireless N on the 360. If you plug on with an Ethernet cable though, you won't experience any
 problems. It runs just as flawless as Xbox Live. Hardware is also the reason they don't have party chat. The official statement from Sony says the console doesn't have enough ram to support it. This was Sonys biggest flaw this gen when they focused on Blu-Ray
 making them have to cut corners in other areas to keep costs to a minimum. The Live service is not a bit better because there is a fee attached to it. It has more features that people think are premium over their competition only because they will need a new
 console to handle them. I wonder what the excuse next gen is going to be when these features are in place</p>

<p>That's really too bad for me. I live in Canada so I don't think I have any access to the things you do. The best I got was a meagre 20pts for my birthday. I even searched online to see if it was serious. I told myself they probably meant to give me 200pts,
 not just 20 but it turns out they only gave 25 cents as a birthday present.</p>
<p>I agree with the last part of your post. Once the next gen PlayStation hits the stores, they'll have no excuse to charge for online multiplayer. If they do, they can be sure they'll lose me as a customer. They better start offering better deals than the
 crap they're giving now.</p>
<p>I don't have any problems per se with my PS3 and I do use an Ethernet cable. It's simply that I noticed when I play games, the connection isn't as good as on my Xbox. Be it COD, Dark Souls or MK. For me the speed and consistency of Xbox Live is better. I
 went to a friend's house and his PSN connection was like mine. It's definitely playable but it has some problems here and there whereas I never experienced problems on Xbox Live save for a few lags in Halo 3 and MK in the first month.</p>
<p>I honestly don't have a preference. I simply choose what's best for me. Fanboyism is useless, big companies still don't care about you. They care about your money. Why defend them like they paid you to when YOU are the one paying them?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft has lost the plot - who wants to update constantly&#63; Is Windows 10 a Linux distro&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 is officially a Linux distro:<br />
<br />
http://www.winbeta.org/news/windows-10-desktop-build-10568-has-leaked-onto-the-internet<br />
<br />
http://www.winbeta.org/news/windows-10-desktop-build-10568-screenshots-leaked<br />
<br />
http://www.winbeta.org/news/poll-microsoft-release-especially-buggy-builds<br />
<br />
They are serious about churning out constantly new Windows 10 builds, and these changes aren’t all under the hood, lots of them are GUI changes. And of course these upgrade will be forced on W10.<br />
<br />
Imagine that: A Windows that changes every few months. <strong>WHYYYYYYYYYY?</strong><br />
<br />
Just who the heck wants THAT?! What the eff is wrong with Microsoft. No one asked for THIS. People are in generally annoyed by the Windows Update procedure (“Please wait until Windows applies the updates.. don’t turn off your computer! You must reboot now!
 Windows failed to apply the update, failure code 0x9824392094!”) they don’t want even more of them.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And what about small businesses? The volume licensing to get the sanest edition (LTSB) is too costly for them, and that’s an userbase that will be extremely annoyed by this, think of doctor’s offices, smaller law firms etc.<br />
<br />
The constant updating is bad enough, but do you know anyone who wants his OS GUI getting reshuffled every few months? I am an “pro” and I would be pissed at this. It would also probably break GUI automation-tools like auto-it in some cases. And it has nothing
 to do with being afraid of change: If I buy a new TV I expect that I will have to learn the new remote control and the menus. But if the menus and the control would be changing every few months on their own, it would be just annoying and taxing on the brain
 (conflicting with usage patterns). A constantly changing OS GUI is the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't like Windows 8, but I at least understood why they went for it, even though they ultimately failed (trying to capure the tablet market), but this late 90s Linux distro path they are on now, I just don’t get it.<br />
<br />
Can anyone explain this for me?</p>

            <p>Search the Internet for "Windows as a Service".&nbsp; You will see that Windows 10 will be a constantly evolving OS just as Apple's OS X and all Unix (Linux/BSD) systems are.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The multiple builds you're referring to are test builds for Windows Insiders only.&nbsp; The Windows 10 that mainstream users have is still version 10240 which was released on 29 July, but is likely to receive an update to a tested build in November according
 to the press.&nbsp; The next significant update isn't likely until mid-2016 which is not dissimilar to all previous versions of Windows, including '7'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The core of Windows 10 is probably unlikely to change significantly - In fact it hasn't in the last 3 years since the release of Windows 8 apart from the reintroduction and revamp&nbsp;of&nbsp;the Start Menu&nbsp;, but I'm sure many users here who are having difficulties
 would gratefully accept any updates that improve their experience, including some changes to the interface.</p>

<p>
</p><p>There's one tiny problem with this. MS have said they will not tell us what is in the updates, so even if they add something we'll never know unless we regularly check every option in every program on the PC. And that's just not practical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like them adding stuff regularly, as long as they don't remove anything and as long as they tell us exactly what is changing.</p>

<h2>            itunes crashes while trying to sync.</h2>
                    I have 2 iPod touches and an iPad 2. &nbsp;When I download an IOs update Itunes crashes partway through the download. &nbsp;The same thing will happen if I try to sync music (more than say 50 files). &nbsp;If I only sync a few files the sync will finish. &nbsp;I have worked
 with apple for several weeks. &nbsp;It went up to their "Engineers". &nbsp;They came back with "it is an XP problem". &nbsp;Im not sure what to try next. &nbsp;I've uninstalled and reinstalled all Apple software (Itunes, Quicktime, Safari) per the support instructions. &nbsp;I have
 performed all of the Windows updates. &nbsp;Uninstalled/reinstalled AVG antivirus software. &nbsp;Nothing seems to work! &nbsp;The crash report says "AppName: itunes.exe AppVer: 10.2.2.12 ModName: msvcrt.dll ModVer:7.0.2600.2180 Offset: 000372e3". &nbsp;I have tried restoring
 the msvcrt.dll file from the XP disc.

            This is very confusing. Under Method 1, the Printer is already installed. What do you mean "after installing the printer?" And under Method 2, opening Windows Firewall does not provide an option to turn it on or off. This was not helpful. I still have
 the problem which I have worked around by using a cable to connect to the printer.

            <p>I'm on a wireless printer connection and CAN scan from the printer but can't print (printer shows offline). &nbsp;I tried to follow the intructions to disable SNMP but when I click on 'configure port' I get a message that says 'an error occurred during port configuration.
 this operation is not supported." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? &nbsp;I've been printing since December with no issues until this week and was on the phone for an hour with MS support yesterday who got it working, but now it's not working again, so I thought I'd reach out to people who actually might know how to
 fix this problem. &nbsp; VERY FRUSTRATING.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 won&#39;t download updates - &#34;Windows could not check for updates automatically&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows 7 won't download updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 7 Starter Edition netbook, Acer brand.&nbsp; It keeps saying that Windows could not check for updates automatically (Important),&nbsp; I bring up the Windows Update program and tell it to check for updates.&nbsp; After about 10 minutes, it simply says
 I need to check for updates.&nbsp; No error messages, no information, nothing more than that.&nbsp; It's been doing this since March 7, 2014.</p>
<p>I have tried the Fix It tool, and even used the Microsoft Advanced Diagnostic and Repair tool.&nbsp; Neither have any affect on it, and the AD tool just says that I still have a problem; again, no further information is given.</p>
<p>I have Norton 360 protection installed, and even it can find no issues or reasons for this happening.&nbsp; Short of doing a backup and totally reinstalling the system, what can I do to fix this issue?&nbsp; Is there a way to remove and reinstall just the Windows
 Update program?&nbsp; Any advice would be helpful.&nbsp; Thanks</p>

    <title>Who creates xbox avatar items&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> atlas x fusion  say:</h3>
<h2>            Who creates xbox avatar items&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have been playing xbox360 for a very long time, I got my xbox when Halo3 came out. I know how avatars work and all that, that's not what I'm confused about. For so many years I have been customizing my avatar and buying cool items and clothes and hats
 and costumes for him from the marketplace. But I've always wondered, who actually makes the avatar items and decides what items should be created and put on the marketplace? I have looked around for this answer for a long time but it seems nobody has the definite
 answer. Some people say that the developers of a game make an avatar item for that game and submit it to microsoft for approval, while other people have told me that developers of a game ask microsoft to just make the avatar item and split the profit. Although
 majority of people I ask are dumb and just say "derp microsoft sells avatar items lolololol". It seems like nobody knows the origin of how avatar items are made.<br />
<br />
Here's just a summary of I'm asking(this is just hypothetical): Black Ops 2 just came out and the developers are selling lots of games and know if there is an avatar item of a costume based off the game a lot of people will buy it. So what are the steps of
 taking a costume from the game, for example Reznov's clothing, and having it as an item on the avatar marketplace that people can buy and put on their avatars? Who designs the item? Who approves it? Who decides it should be on the marketplace? Who gets the
 money? How long does it take?</p>

<p>Well, Rare was the developer behind the avatar system. It would be the developer/publisher of a certain game to decide what they want to make available, then MS studios, and Rare still does this as well since they are owned by MS, &nbsp;take over and make the
 actual items based on designs given to them. </p>

            <pre>If you look closely at the Sticky Notes tile, you'll see that it is a "Store" &lt;c*&gt;app.
"Proper" / "Good" Store apps have a repair/reset option when you right click on them, sometimes hiding under the "More" option.  But this one doesn't. So you have to resort to a more fundamental approach to fixing it.
Win10 Store apps  / Metro / Modern / UWA / UWP
In Windows 8.1, Microsoft introduced Universal Windows Apps (UWA), colloquially known as “Metro apps” or “Modern apps.” In Windows 10, Microsoft took the idea even further and ended up with the Universal Windows Platform (UWP).
Based on my own experience, and the reports of many others it appears that the store and it’s associated “environment” is rather fragile, causing various problems with the store itself and store applications.

2016 07 19- 5 TIPS TO FIX WINDOWS STORE AND APP ISSUES IN WINDOWS 10
https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-tips-fix-windows-store-app-issues-windows-10/ 
Restart the computer
Win Store Trouble Shooter
Clear store Cache (WSReset.exe)
Reset Windows update (use the tool in the following link)
Reg hack for Connection errors
Re-Register the Store
Here are some additional instructions for the 5 tips defined in the article above 
Remember to test the problem applet between each of the steps.
#0 RESTART THE COMPUTER
Simply restarting the computer is one of the simplest trouble fixes we have. But it is all too often forgotten or skipped.  Too often programs get “confused”. While restarting the program may clear the confusion, sometimes they have an unseen compenent constantly running in the background.  The easiest way to reset them is to restart the computer. 
#1 MS DOWNLOADABLE WIN10 STORE APP TROUBLE SHOOTER
http://aka.ms/diag_apps10 
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-run-the-trouble shooter-for-windows-apps 
Note: both of these links above should take you to download the same diagnosis “CAB” file. 
Use the built in Trouble shooter
Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot 
Scroll down to the bottom 
Click Windows Store Apps
#2 WSRESET.EXE – CLEAR AND RESET STORE CACHE
http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-clear-reset-windows-store-cache-in-windows-10/ 
Run as Admin.
Be sure to run the WSReset (Windows Store Reset) program AT LEAST 5 times. It appears to fix one problem per run, SLOWLY working thorough multiple problems in subsequent runs. Unfortunately the tool is poorly written so it gives the user no indication of what it is doing or if it was successful or not. All you can do is run it several times in the hope that you run it often enough for it to clear all of the problems.
#3 MANUAL RESET WINDOWS UPDATE SUBSYSTEM
the problems remain, you have to revert to a manual process to reset Windows Update
Check that System Restore is turned on and configured 
https://www.pcworld.com/article/2955023/windows/how-to-turn-on-system-restore-in-windows-10-to-protect-against-bad-updates.html 
https://www.tekrevue.com/how-to-enable-system-restore-windows-10/ 
Create a System restore point. (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point )
Use the following process to effectively delete the folders used by Windows Update:
Follow the instructions in this page: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components - How do I reset Windows Update components? (Win7-Win10)
The first paragraph in the above process includes a link to the Windows update troubleshooter. Make sure to run through it also.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6eHDtylDYo How to Fix Win Update Errors
This is a Video of manual process very similar process to the one described in the link to KB971058 (above)
After doing the process in the above link, including restarting the computer Check for outstanding updates:
. – in start menu search for Windows Update
. - click on “Check for Updates”
. – updates are often sequention, they require an earlier one to be present before being installed. So you should repeat checking for updates until you get no more updates

RE-INSTALL ALL STORE APPS USING POWERSHELL
…*  In the Start Menu, search for PowerShell 
…*  right click and select "Run as Administrator" option.
…*  Enter the following commands one by one in the PowerShell window:
………  reg delete “HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\TileDataModel\Migration\TileStore” /va /f
………  get-appxpackage -packageType bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + "\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml")}
………  $bundlefamilies = (get-appxpackage -packagetype Bundle).packagefamilyname

RESET ALL STORE APPS / REREGISTER / APPS MISSING FROM WIN START MENU
Re-register all store apps, so they appear again in start menu.  For that, open a PowerShell window as Administrator. Copy and paste the following line into the PowerShell window and press Enter: 
Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose } 
Note:	if you re-register all applications, all your apps are back, however all your pinned apps will be reset (the right panel will be empty) so you need to re-pin everything that you want. Personnaly I did a screen capture before, to remember what I pinned and where (use the “snipping tool” in startmenu/windows accessories, with a delay to be able to open the start menu before the capture)

<p>Yes, this is true. Its frustrating. My biggest issues is where im in the king of the hill room and when i go to choose my character i am dropped out of the match immediately and im a handed a loss. Another issue is waiting forever to find a ranked opponent
 (this is where it is epic fail) SSF4 is superior in this aspect, almost instant. Yes i have high speed internet to whom it may concern. &nbsp;I love Mk and was there September 1993, 17 years old and couldnt wait to play my snes "neutered" version...and was so friggin
 jealous of my genesis buddies. it even had the endings lol. I just did not think players would leave in "Droves"</p>

<p>I second this, the lag is off-putting and there's nothing left for me on offline mode as I have played more than enough ladders and the tower is too gimmicky to keep me interested.</p>

<p>I'm tired of getting the timing of my combos down in offline practice mode just to go online and drop them because of the damn lag. &nbsp;I've never run into some kind of "infinite," or maybe I have once with Cyrax but it didn't seem like an infinite. &nbsp;Hector
 Sanchez said during ReveLAtions that the Xbox patch will be out next week, and I think that was this past Saturday. &nbsp;I went online and there was no update prompt when I loaded Mortal Kombat...what's taking so long? &nbsp;Namco fixed Tekken 6 online 10 days after
 it was released, Mortal Kombat has been out almost 2 months and the online still sucks.</p>

<h2>            &#34;product key you typed is invalid for activation&#34; - even though WGA passed...</h2>
                    <p>I've been handed a Toshiba Laptop to re-install (HDD failed).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Re-installed it using genuine MSDN W7 Pro OEM, used genuine OEM COA on the underside,</p>
<p>but get the "Product key you typed is invalid for activation" - no optinos available for telephone</p>
<p>activation, and even the 'slui 4' option does not go to the telephone activation page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MGA Outpu is below - this is really annoying, and the MS Telephone people are totally unhelpful.</p>
<p>Without an "Installation ID" the Activation Team won't help, and cite that it's 'Technical' issues,</p>
<p>Techincal say that I have to deal only with the OEM - the OEM have said that there is no reason</p>
<p>why the key and the media should not work together, and that it needs referring to MS.&nbsp; I pity the</p>
<p>poor person I spoke to in the US this evening, and really chewed their ear off for being so damn</p>
<p>obstructive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone can shed some light on this, or at least tell me what I need to do, I'd be most grateful.</p>
