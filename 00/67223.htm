<h2>            ms-smartsearch text box in start menu</h2>
                    I just upgraded to Windows 10, and on the Start Menu, there is a small text box on the left hand side that says "ms-smartsearch." It can't be moved or clicked, and it on the way of some program as I scroll. Seems like it might be a bug. Has anyone else
 experienced this and knlw however to get rid of it?

<h2>            Factory Recovery Partition Missing or Corrupt</h2>
                    We recently bought a dell computer.&nbsp; The "Dell Backup and Recovery" program gave us a notification last night.&nbsp; The notification, in part, was that "The Factor Recovery Partition Missing or Corrupt".&nbsp; The computer still works fine, but when we spoke to
 Dell about the issue, they stated that it's not a hardware issue but possibly a software/operating system problem.&nbsp; How could a problem with the software or operating system present itself in a way that a partition of the hard drive is missing or corrupt.&nbsp;
 Dell is currently sending us a USB Key to reinstall Windows 8.1 and we would rather not go through this hassle if this is not the actual problem. Could their actually be a problem with the operating system and the solution received from Dell be a good starting
 point, or should we seek an alternative?&nbsp; Thank you.<br />

<p>First run Dell F12 preboot diagnostics including any extended tests:</p>
<p><a href="http://dellwindowsreinstallationguide.com/f12-preboot-diagnostics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://dellwindowsreinstallationguide.com/f12-preboot-diagnostics/</a>
</p>
<p>If these pass it is not a hardware fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible its hardware or software at fault. Its most likely software as you would have serious issues with Windows in general if the drive was failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the software side of things malware or third party programs can resize the hidden factory partitions or make it corrupt. As its brand new however its also possible that a corrupt factory image was loaded, it happens from time to time on a rare case. The
 USB key&nbsp;Dell send out should reimage the entire hard drive giving you a working factory configuration and recovery partition.</p>

            <p>Malware does not touch a Recovery partition, except in the very rare circumstances that backups were accidentally added to it.</p>
<p>But then it would still be available, but showing low space/full message, whereas your message&nbsp;was not available or corrupt..</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as Dell is sending you a USB Key, that is paramount to admitting a factory Image Installion problem.</p>

<span><span>Hi

Start the in-place Upgrade.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Steps to perform an in-place upgrade:</span></strong></p>

<strong><span>Warning:</span></strong><span> Before you perform an in-place upgrade, you should be prepared for a worst case scenario that results in your existing data on your computer being deleted. This data includes
 personal data, settings, hardware driver information, and software programs. If a worst case scenario occurs, you may have to reinstall all programs. Make sure that you back up personal data to disks or to other external storage devices before you perform
 an in-place upgrade.<br />

            i am having the same issue. i can use the recovery options and the only option the temporarily fixes it is the reset function. its a little ridiculous to have to periodically completely factory reset my laptop and lose all my files. the fix posted would
 possibly be helpful but as windows 8 came preinstalled on the laptop there is no windows 8 dvd to boot from.i am eager to see a fix for this issue. if none comes in a timely manner i suppose one lost customer wouldnt affect microsoft income very much anyways.

            Howdy All,
<div><br />
<div>Specs of my machine: Toshiba&nbsp;Ultra book,&nbsp;Windows 8, SSD 256, instant turn on, built in battery.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This exact thing happened to me last night. I turned my computer on and boom!, black screen with only a cursor. Which suggests it's an&nbsp;operating&nbsp;system issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I turned the power off and restarted the comp the screen would appear straight away. As a result I couldn't access the recovery section by pressing and holding "0'' and the power button at the same time.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I left it the power on to fully drain the battery and then tried again in the morning. Although the Toshiba&nbsp;start up&nbsp;screen showed up the computer went to a black screen again. However this allowed me to attempt to reach the recovery partition. When I
 restarted again the&nbsp;PC&nbsp;went straight to the Black screen again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then the battery fully died again. I tried turning it on and nothing happened. I plugged in the power pack and turned it on while holding "0" and I got to the recovery partition. Knowing I could now get to the partition I chose the option "start windows
 8" and relief; it started. :)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Event view told me that a&nbsp;kernel&nbsp;power event&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;at the time the PC went into recovery mode. I get these if i remove the battery in my old laptop so I'm assuming the problem is that turning the computer on and off is not fully&nbsp;disconnecting&nbsp;the computer
 from the battery.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

<h2>            Join the Legion &#40;Quest glitch, possible spoilers&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Wutup.</p>
<p>I am trying to join the legion and the first quest they send me on is to clear Fort Hraggstad (or something like that...)</p>
<p>Now, I have already gone to this fort, and cleared it out so i figured the game would just give me credit....Nope.</p>
<p>I go back to the fort and it has been repopulated, no worries, I dispatch the occupants as required.</p>
<p>Now here is the problem: At some point during this, the quest took itself off of my map (though it is still on my list of quests) and is now impossible to show on the the map and there is no map marker for it. I went back to Solitude to talk to the legion...and
 the game treats it as if I havent completed the quest yet. I go back to the fort, it is now occupied by legion soldiers. I still dont have credit for the quest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone know of a solution for this, I have tons of earlier save files so I will try those later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Did you ever figure out how to get past this? This exact thing just happened to me and I'm stumped. I tried loading a save from a couple of hours ago but the problem might stem from when I visited the fort earlier which was over fifteen hours of game ago.
 Guess I'll just have to joing the stormcloaks or something.</p>

                    <p>I updated the Visual Studio Community 2019 as prompted to today (6/9/2019) and now it is saying that the side by side configuration is incorrect and won't let me use the application. It is a wonderful application and easy to use so this is very disappointing
 and I would like to continue to use it. Is there a way to fix that?</p>

            <p>Hi Dion,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A hardware malfunction may cause this error, and we recommend these troubleshooting steps to resolve this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Check for updates</strong><br />
Many stop errors can be fixed by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/install-update-activate/surface-book-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
updating Windows</a>. In the search box on the taskbar, type Windows Update, then select Windows Update. On the Windows Update page, select Check for updates.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remove hardware</strong><br />
Unplug unnecessary external hardware (printers, webcams, additional monitors, etc.) and see if the stop error is fixed.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remove software</strong></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some stop errors can be caused by apps or other software.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the Start button, then select Settings&nbsp; &gt; System&nbsp; &gt; Apps &amp; features . Select Sort by name and change</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it to Sort by install date. Select a recently installed or unnecessary app you want to remove, and then select</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uninstall.</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The issue may be related to corrupted application files.<br />
<br />
I suggest that you follow the below method.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Initialize Sticky Notes from its source folder, To do this:<br />
1. Open Computer.<br />
2. Locate the&nbsp; following file C:\Windows\System32\StikyNot.exe.<br />
3. Double click on StikyNot.exe<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you can open Sticky Notes from its source folder, the issue is due to corrupted shortcut icon. If it is the case, you need to delete sticky shortcut icon and create a new one from the source folder and pin it to the Start menu.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If this does not work, then you may try copying Copy StikyNot.exe from another available Operating System to the current computer and check.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks and Regards:<br />

            Hi Wayne.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Fanatec Products - User Review</h2>
                    
<p>I originally posted this a few months ago on the old forums, and thought I'd dig it up and repost it here for a couple of reasons.&nbsp; One, in case anyone was interested in making a purchase and wanted some feedback from someone who owns the equipment, and
 two...because I just picked up a set of the Clubsport Pedals (upgraded from my Standard ones, which stopped working properly after roughly 5 months.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I posted my original thoughts below, but I'll elaborate more on what happened with my standard pedals here.&nbsp; Basically, after about 5 or so months of use (maybe around 15-20 hours/week on average), the brake pedal started exhibiting abnormal behavior.&nbsp; It
 seemed like I wasn't getting full braking force, and the pedal itself seemed to be giving erratic lingering input even when my foot wasn't on the brake.&nbsp; This really became apparent when I was playing GT5, which has telemetry readouts onscreen as you play,
 for the gas and brake inputs.&nbsp; It was very clear that no matter how hard I depressed the brake pedal, the game was not receiving more than about 75-80% braking force, as the bar never filled completely up.&nbsp; Also, equally problematic (if not moreso) was the
 fact that when I would brake hard and then get back on the gas, the telemetry for the brake would show lingering, jittery input on the brake, which made acceleration and competitive driving an impossibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got in touch with Fanatec regarding this, and after a few quick email exchanges, they offered to send me a brand new set of the standard pedals as a replacement, free of charge.&nbsp; While I appreciated the offer, I had heard from some other people who owned
 the standard pedals and had experienced similar issues.&nbsp; I didn't want to take the chance that something like this could happen again in another few months down the road.&nbsp; So, I asked them if it would be possible to apply the cost of the replacement standard
 pedals toward a purchase of the Clubsport ones.&nbsp; To my surprise (and delight), they were more than happy to do this.&nbsp; The whole process couldn't have been easier...I sent them the $150 payment via PayPal on Thursday evening, and by Monday morning, I had them
 in my hands and was ready to go.&nbsp; Pretty awesome.&nbsp; To be honest, I had heard tales of customer service and tech support from Fanatec being less than stellar, but I've got to say they handled this situation very professionally, and really showed that they're
 willing to do whatever it takes to please the customer.&nbsp; If I ever need any kind of wheel or wheel accessories again in the future, I won't hesitate to look to them first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To talk a little bit about the Clubsport pedals themselves...well, there's really not a heck of a lot to say that you probably haven't heard already.&nbsp; They're very solidly built, all machined aluminum...they've got some serious heft to them.&nbsp; The difference
 in quality and feel between them and the chintzy Standard pedals is like paying for a bleacher seat at Yankee stadium, or enjoying the game from the VIP Booth.&nbsp; There's really no comparison.&nbsp; The one thing I did notice is that the throw distance of the clutch
 is a bit longer than that of the Standard pedals, but that's ok, not a major issue.&nbsp; The throttle feels much better and actually has some resistance, unlike the "dead fish" throttle of the standard pedals...and the fact that you can feel ABS vibration through
 the brake pedal itself (as well as the rim of the wheel) is a nice touch that really adds to the experience.&nbsp; Definite thumbs up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below is the original review I wrote from the old forums.&nbsp; (Super long post, I know...haha...it's been a slow work day...) ;)</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel I should also go a little further into a review of the wheel itself and some of the accessories I purchased for it, in case anyone is interested and is considering making a purchase.<br />
<br />
First of all, the wheel itself.&nbsp; It's quite impressive looking, and the alcantara-wrapped wheel is fantastic...it feels great, and it really does whisk away any sweat from your hands while driving, helping you keep a solid grip.&nbsp; Upon close inspection, and
 after using the wheel for a little over a month now, the buttons themselves feel a bit disappointing in their quality.&nbsp; They don't all have a consistent feel to them...some have a solid click, others feel a bit more "mushy", and there's quite a large gap between
 the edges of the buttons and the base of the wheel (especially around the d-pad and the start/back rocker button), giving the impression that they could come loose and pop off at some point in the future.<br />
<br />
The adjustability of the wheel itself is nice...being able to store 5 presets for different games, for things like force feedback amount, deadzone, etc. is pretty handy.&nbsp; The only two games I've used the wheel with so far are F1 2010, and Forza 3...and with
 the right settings (in-game and on the wheel), it feels great.<br />
<br />
I also purchased the standard pedals (the $50 ones, not the oh-no-you-didn't-just-pay-$200-just-for-pedals Clubsport ones), and they get the job done, but they're not terribly impressive.&nbsp; They're 100% plastic, which is ok I guess, but there are two issues
 that I have with them.&nbsp; One is that there is practically no feel at all to the throttle.&nbsp; It offers very little resistance, so you pretty much are required to play in your socks if you want to have any kind of pedal feel.&nbsp; The brake pedal offers pretty firm
 resistance, which is nice, and the clutch does its best to feel like a real clutch, with degressive resistance as you push it in.&nbsp; The other issue with the standard pedals is that if you're looking to actually use all 3 pedals, you WILL need to fasten them
 down with something.&nbsp; I bought Fanatec's RennSport Wheel Stand to keep everything in place, and the stand comes with a metal bar that affixes to the aluminum runners on the bottom of the stand.&nbsp; You set your pedals in front of this bar, and it does a good
 job of preventing them from sliding away from you.&nbsp; The problem is, the way the pedals are designed, say you need to brake hard with your right foot, and simultaneously depress the clutch pedal with your left to start a downshift.&nbsp; If you do it with any kind
 of zest, the pedals are immediately going to flip up away from you because there's nothing on the near end of the base to weigh them down.&nbsp; When using only one foot or the other (or doing left foot braking), you've usually got one foot
<b>not</b> on a pedal, and the majority of its weight is counterbalancing the unit without you even thinking about it.&nbsp; So, what I decided to do was take a quick trip to Home Depot and buy one of those ratcheting tie-downs...I wrapped it around the pedals,
 and the ratchet mechanism sits on the carpet, just about perfectly under the pedals in the gap caused by the thickness of the runners.&nbsp; It was about $8, and now they don't budge at all.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the RennSport stand...I'm kind of torn regarding it.&nbsp; I was looking for something I could use that would allow me to sit on my couch while playing, as I don't really have the room for a dedicated rig with a racing chair and all that.&nbsp; In that regard,
 it works perfectly and does what I was looking for.&nbsp; The main issue I have with it is that it's just not as stable as I had hoped it would be.&nbsp; Unfortunately I think it comes down to the fact that the manufacturers had to come up with something that was both
 adjustable <b>and</b> stable...and it would seem that the two are pretty much mutually exclusive.&nbsp; In order for such a rig to be really sturdy, you need hard welds at the high stress zones, but in order for it to fit a wide array of sizes of people, these
 points can't be hard welded and are therefore held together by bolts which need to be manually tightened and inevitably work their way loose, undermining the stability of the entire rig.&nbsp; After every hour or so of racing, I find that I need to go around and
 re-tighten most of the joints...it's surprising how loose they can become with some spirited driving.&nbsp; I do try to go easy on it, and I'm probably gentler with it than most people, but I still have to go around and re-tighten things pretty frequently.&nbsp; If
 you're a really enthusiastic driver, you might want to consider a different rig.&nbsp; Unfortunately I've never tried anything else (like Wheel Stand Pro, for example, so I couldn't say if that would be any better).<br />
<br />
Now, on to the shifters.&nbsp; For $50, you get both the 6+R gated shifter, and the sequential shifter.&nbsp; One thing to note...when I purchased the RennSport stand, I noticed that it came with an extra metal plate which I assumed was for mounting the shifters to.&nbsp;
 Upon examining the instructions, this metal plate (which screws onto the metal base that you attach the wheel itself to) is only for use with the Logitech (G25/27) shifters....NOT for Fanatec's own products!&nbsp; The only option given to you for attaching Fanatec's
 own shifters is by using decidedly less stable (and rather cheesy looking to boot) "chopsticks", one end of which you stick in the side of the base of the wheel, with the shifter sliding snugly over the other end.&nbsp; The problem is, it's not all that snug of
 a fit, and the shifter is just kind of floating out in the air with nothing solid underneath it.<br />
<br />
When I first hooked it up, I decided to use the gated shifter.&nbsp; You have to go through a series of steps to calibrate the shifter so that the game knows which position relates to which gear...and even referring to the online PDF manual on Fanatec's site, the
 steps for doing this were less than crystal clear.&nbsp; After fuddling around with it for 5 or 10 minutes, I managed to get it to work, and I was on my way.&nbsp; I hopped in an S2000 and headed to Catalunya to see what was what.&nbsp; One good thing about it is that it's
 a pretty short throw, so gear shifts can happen pretty quickly.&nbsp; Or at least they should.&nbsp; The problem is that the spring(s) that they use to give the shifter resistance offer a LOT of resistance when you need to move the stick off-center to the left or right
 (if you want to shift into 1st or 2nd, or 5th or 6th, for example).&nbsp; 3rd and 4th gear are easy, since they're just straight up and down.&nbsp; Because of this inconsistent resistance, I was finding it very difficult to actually select the gear that I wanted on
 my first try...I was missing shifts, going into the wrong gear, it was a mess.&nbsp; And to make it worse, because of the amount of effort required to get into a gear that wasn't 3rd or 4th, the instability of the chopsticks really became noticeable, and it just
 ruined the whole experience for me.<br />
<br />
I wasn't terribly hopeful then, when I decided to try out the sequential shifter to see if it was any better.&nbsp; After having put in probably about half a dozen hours with it so far (I actually just took delivery of the shifters themselves last week), really
 the only bad thing I can say about it is that whenever you shift, it emits a super-cheesy clicking noise that is a constant painful reminder that you're using a toy, and not driving a real car.&nbsp; That being said though, in practice, it really works great.&nbsp;
 It requires very little effort to flick the stick up or down, so the inherent instability of the chopsticks is kept to a minimum, and when using it with the clutch pedal, it can be great fun, and a really immersive experience.<br />
<br />
So...in a nutshell, the wheel, pedals, stand , and shifters are not without issues, but I don't regret buying them as I've had a blast with them so far, and I'm sure will continue to do so for a good long while.</p>

<p>Yeah, I pretty much only use either the paddles or the sequential shifter. &nbsp;As I mentioned above, I don't really like the gated shifter, and haven't used it at all beyond the hour or two I spent testing it when I first got it several months ago. &nbsp;It's too
 notchy-feeling, and the spring tension for pushing it to the far left or right is too great. &nbsp;It makes it really difficult to grab the right gear in the heat of the moment, plus the fact that using it tends to make my stand wobble more than I'd like because
 it requires a lot more motion/effort than the other two options. &nbsp;It's a bit disappointing, really...but the seq. shifter is fun, so it balances out.</p>

<p>One thing just to follow up...I started noticing over the past week or so that the throttle on the ClubSport pedals is starting to creak a bit.&nbsp; Not a big deal, probably just needs some oil somewhere.&nbsp; I'll have to look into it more, as I'm not sure exactly
 where the creak is coming from, or what type of oil is best to use once I find it.&nbsp; I'll post back here with the solution once I find out.</p>

<p>Fanatec continues to impress me.&nbsp; I wrote to them last night, explaining the squeaky throttle pedal, and this was the reply I got back this morning:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre><tt>About the squeaking of the pedals:
If you want, I send you some oil for the throttle pedal. Please lubricate it at 
the bolt where the little sensor is. Usually the squeaking comes from there. If 
not, you can oil that part you hear the squeaking. You also can lubricate the 
bolt that runs into the black box. We have a video tutorial on www.fanatec.com 
-&gt; support where you can see how to open the pedals.<br /><br /><br /></tt></pre>
<p>They could easily have said "oh...use such and such type of oil" or whatever, but the fact that they're willing to send me some, free of charge...that was unexpected and very cool of them to do.&nbsp; :)</p>

<p>It's been a while since I've updated this post...I guess it's become more for my own recollection than anything else, but whatever.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The oil that Fanatec sent worked well and stopped the squeaking. &nbsp;I do have to say though that the pedals are not the easiest things in the world to disassemble. &nbsp;In fact, a few of the bolts/screws are in such tight positions that I didn't have the proper
 tool that would fit, so I did the best I could by just leaving the pedals assembled and squirting the oil into the areas where the squeaks were coming from. &nbsp;It was a little messy, but a few paper towels later, problem solved and I was good to go.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Recently, however, another problem has emerged with my Clubsport pedals. &nbsp;I've noticed that they're exhibiting the exact same behavior as the old set of standard pedals did; regarding the erratic, lingering input on the brake, even when my foot is nowhere
 near the pedal. &nbsp;This is really disappointing, because the whole point of me upgrading to the CSPs was so that I would have a quality set of pedals and wouldn't have to deal with issues like this anymore.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Word around the net seems to be that the problem is caused by a faulty load cell and needs to be replaced (which Fanatec conveniently sells spares of). &nbsp;Two things trouble me about this...one, the standard pedals don't use a load cell, so why did I have
 the exact same problem with them as I'm having with the CSPs? &nbsp;And two, if I've spent $200 on a set of pedals, I feel like I shouldn't have to pay for replacement parts every few months to keep them in proper working order, especially when there are other,
 less expensive products on the market which last for far longer with no such similar problems.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>So...I've contacted Fanatec tech support this past Friday the 28th...we'll see what their response is, and I'll update this post with any news.</p>

<p>Got a reply from Fanatec support today, asking for a video detailing the problem. &nbsp;I explained to them that it's the exact same problem that I was having with the standard pedals, but I decided to humor them and play this one by the book. &nbsp;I had already
 downloaded their driver software for my PC, so I downloaded some free screen-capture software and made a quick video showing what was going on with the lingering phantom input on the brake.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I just emailed them my reply, with the video, so I'm guessing sometime tomorrow I'll hear something back.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If I had to venture a guess, I'd say they're probably going to tell me that the load cell needs to be replaced. &nbsp;In all honesty though, I think that's a symptom, and not the root cause of the problem. &nbsp;Judging by the fact that I had the same problem with
 the standard pedals as I'm having with the CSPs, and also by the fact that they're constructed differently (the standard pedals don't have a load cell at all) and use totally different materials, I'm starting to think that the root problem has something with
 the electronics and/or the firmware of the pedals themselves. &nbsp;But, that's purely speculation on my part. &nbsp;We'll see what Fanatec has to say.</p>

<p>Oh and just for the record, I took a trip to Home Depot (made two trips, actually) to find the right wrench and hex bit sets that would let me disassemble the pedals (I wanted to open them up and try lubricating the internals of the brake to see if that
 helped...it didn't)...all I have to say is...whoever designed where to put the screws and bolts on those pedals, I would LOVE to meet him in a dark alley somewhere and show him what I think of his work. &nbsp;Frustration does not even begin to describe the process
 of trying to make a hex wrench fit into some of these areas... X{</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to disable antivirus and check the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security
 threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your
 antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>Before updating, make sure you have installed all available updates to your PC.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also run a system file checker scan and check if there are any corrupt system files.
</span></p>

                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with my screensaver. When I set it to Bubbles, the preview is okay and it appears like it should appear- I can still SEE my computer screen, bubbles are transparent- but when it activates, screen goes pink and THEN bubbles appear, which
 is very annoying. I'd like to know whether and how I can fix this. Has anyone else had this problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also made screenshots, maybe it helps</p>

<p><span>Hi Danny,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It’s great to know that you have chosen Windows 8 and welcome to Microsoft Windows 8 Family.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the description, you would like to know if there is any program available in Windows 8 by which you can control the applications
 in Windows and also change the spoken words into text on your computer screen.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We do have a program in Windows 8 named “Windows Speech Recognition” by which you can use your voice for many things, such as controlling
 your PC, filling out online forms, or typing letters as you speak. Windows Speech Recognition makes using a keyboard and mouse optional.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are a few steps you need to take before you can start using Speech Recognition. You will need to set up a microphone for using this
 feature in Windows 8. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You will get all the details on how to setup and use the Speech Recognition facility from this link</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/using-speech-recognition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/using-speech-recognition</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful. Feel free to get back to us for any queries or issues related to Windows and we’ll be glad to assist
 you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Surface 3 Docking Station and Multiple Monitors&#63;</h2>
                    I see from numerous locations that the Surface Pro 3 and docking station can support multiple monitors, either through daisy chaining the DisplayPort or by using the displayport on the docking station as well as the one on the Pro 3 itself.&nbsp; I can't tell,
 however, if you can do multiple monitors from the Surface 3 (Not Pro).&nbsp; Anybody know?&nbsp;

            Surface 3 and it corresponding Docking station come with DisplayPort 1.1 (unlike Pro 3 which come with 1.2) hence you can't daisychained it.

            <p>there's a very subtle difference on the surface.com site about the docks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>surface pro 3 dock: "Connect to your HD <strong>monitors</strong>"</p>
<p>surface&nbsp;3 dock: "Connect to your HD <strong>monitor</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>so... technically it is on the product description.&nbsp;I haven't looked elsewhere.</p>

<p>"Daisy chain monitors (Surface Pro 2 and Surface Pro 3 only) </p>
<div>
<p>You can daisy chain monitors from a Surface Pro 2 or Surface Pro 3, or from a Surface Pro docking station. You’ll need two monitors with DisplayPort 1.2 input ports, and at least one of them has to have a DisplayPort output port. You’ll also need standard
 DisplayPort cables with at least one Mini DisplayPort end to make your connections.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 0">
<div>Note</div>
<div>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Daisy chaining is not supported on Surface 3 or the Surface 3 Docking Station. "</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>guess you didn't look on the official website that much. i found this information in a very short amount of time.</p>

<h2>            Minecraft</h2>
                    I bought Minecraft back in mid August, 2017. About a month later I decided to play Sims 3 as well as Minecraft. After downloading Sims 3 and playing I decided to play a bit of Minecraft but found that it was no longer on my laptop. I tried searching for
 it and all that came up was where I downloaded mods and skins for Minecraft. I can't remember what e-mail I used for Mojang so I can't try and redownload it through them. Please help. I really miss playing Minecraft.

    <title>Streets and Trips 2010 map zoom options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark durand  say:</h3>
<h2>            Streets and Trips 2010 map zoom options</h2>
                    
<p>I've used Streets and Trips for years.&nbsp; There used to be a feature that would allow you to mask a rectangle around an exact area on the map and then zoom inside the masked area to get that exact area to make full use of the map display (and to print it out)&nbsp;
 (This ability was extremely helpful and is why I purchased Streets and Trips instead of using mapquest, etc.)&nbsp; I cannot find that feature on Streets and Trips 2010.&nbsp; Often, the slider is imprecise and zooms too much or not enough greatly reducing the value
 of the maps it produces.&nbsp; Is the mask zoom feature I buy the product for still in there somewhere?</p>
<p>Also, Streets and trips 2010 directs customers here to answer questions yet I see no clear option to choose in the Select best forum...confusing...</p>

    <title>A Problem From Mini DIN Connector &#40;Serial Port&#41; In Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            A Problem From Mini DIN Connector &#40;Serial Port&#41; In Windows 7</h2>
                    <strong>Hi Dear Experts</strong> <br />
<br />
I think there is a problem or I better say a bug in Windows 7 <br />
My Main board is "Foxconn M61PVM" and My mouse and keyboard are connected to the Main board by Mini DIN Connector (Serial Port)<br />
I've got an XP installed on my computer I don't have problems with that and I also installed a Windows 7 , after working a little with Windows 7 and restarting my computer for a few times , My mouse and keyboard are not working , and I did every windows 7's
 repair and recovery to fix this,no results,Then I connected a USB mouse to my computer it worked at the same time, at the same place (Windows 7 Log in page)<br />
I reinstalled Windows 7 ,I got that problem as before<br />
And it doesn't make any difference between the versions (Beta,RTM,RC1) (32-bit or 64-bit) I tried them all<br />
My main board is not old , and it's a new one<br />
Is this a problem from Main board or from it's drivers ?<br />
<br />
<strong>Thank You Very Much</strong> <br />
<br />
