                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Acer Aspire V5-122 with Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I downloaded the MediaCreationTool64 to upgrade to win 10, the application got stuck on checking updates .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked Microsoft site and one of the suggested solution is to Manually reset Windows Update components.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that solution, one has to stop wuauserv service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run CMD in admin mode and I enter net stop wuauserv I get the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The service is starting or stopping. Please try again later</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I stop the service?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<h2>            Regrading Battery Drain in Windows 7 ultimate 64 bit after upgrading RAM</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have Lenovo G500 laptop which initially came with 2GB ram. I upgraded RAM to 6 GB and formatted and installed windows 7 64 bit.</p>
<p>Two problems:</p>
<p>1. Battery Drain increased.</p>
<p>2. System heating increased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am thinking to install now windows 10 pro 64 bit. Will it solve the problem?</p>
<p>Also Tell me why battery drains so quickly and about heating problems also.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>These are the possible causes of battery draining and system heating:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Many programs are running at the same time on your computer.</li><li>Faulty hardware.</li><li>More RAM requires more power, because the chips are all powered on when you start a computer regardless of whether it has data.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you change the power plan of your computer to Balanced.Go to Control Panel&gt; System and Security&gt; Power Options&gt; Balanced.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persist, we recommend that you contact your device manufacturer for better assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information on how to manage your battery life, you may refer to this
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/managing-battery-life-and-power-consumption-overview-technicalreference" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Did the computer come with Windows 32-bit? If you upgraded to 64-bit, I'd suggest to download and install all drivers for you computer&nbsp;&nbsp;- Ethernet, wireless, graphics, audio, etc, etc. You will find the drivers on the Lenovo support page -&gt; select the correct
 Windows version and download the drivers.</p>

<p>I doubt the addition of RAM would have these effects. &nbsp;It is probably coincidental with some other cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the age of your computer?</p>
<p>Age of battery?</p>
<p>Have you ever replaced the power supply cord to your system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heating is commonly caused by people using the computer when it is on a soft surface. &nbsp;There are air vents on the bottom that a soft surface blocks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using the system for gaming?</p>
<p>Gaming has a dramatically greater resource load profile. &nbsp;Did you do the RAM upgrade to be able to use games that use greater resources?</p>

<h2>            Unable to connect Wifi</h2>
                    <p>Original title: 7 always chooses wrong default connection type and is never correct on anything that it does</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i just recently put 7 on my laptop, and have been going insane because its sooooo inferior to even 98ME in every way, this latest issue is about to end my life. when i turn on my computer it detects several wifi signals, it has been told to only connect
 to my network and for some reason it asked if it was home public or work, this is wrong as they should never be options anyway. next up it ALWAYS defaults to public even after its been told a thousand times its home....and every single time it connect it ASKS
 YET AGAIN!!! i have deleted all info and re done it time and time again, and even if it remembers correctly, JUST to **** me off it will rename the connection with a number afterwards JUST so it can incorrectly connect yet again. is there any way to force
 it to default to home or remove from the code of the program the option to even select public or work?? this is to the point that i think i got a joke version of 7 by accident, or im on candid camera or something its really that bad.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is the issue specific to the Wifi!</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is it a laptop or desktop?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For a full list of steps to try, see the Wired and Wireless Tutorial on this page:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/help/wired-and-wireless-network-connection-problems-in-windowsAfter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/help/wired-and-wireless-network-connection-problems-in-windows</a></span></p>
<p><span>After reading through the thread, there appears to be some confusion regarding Wireless Networking technologies
 and configurations using Windows 7 and I would like to spend some time to try and clear things up with some basic troubleshooting / best practices for Wireless Network related issues.</span></p>
<p><span>1. First try and power off your modem, router and desktop/laptop. Then power on the modem, then the router, and then finally the desktop/laptop. Please do this in that
 order, allowing 60 seconds in between each device to enable the device to be fully booted and able to accept connections.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Update the drivers for your wireless network adapter via Windows Update, or by using the website for either the company you bought your PC/Laptop from or the manufacturer
 of your networking device.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Ensure that your router is set to broadcast it’s network name (SSID), ensure that you are connecting to the correct wireless network (SSID) and that you are using
 the correct WEP/WPA passkey on both devices. </span></p>
<p><span>a. Please use “Windows Connect Now” or “Wi-Fi Protected Setup” if available on your wireless router to ensure that the connection is setup correctly.</span></p>
<p><span>4. If you are trying to use WPA or WPA2, please ensure that both your network adapter and wireless router support this protocol. If you are having issues detecting
 your wireless network when using WPA or WPA2, try configuring your router to use WEP instead and see if you can connect.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Please note that the change between WEP/WPA/WPA2 will need to be made on both your computer and wireless router.</span></p>
<p><span>b. If you are only able to connect using WEP, then your networking hardware may need a firmware upgrade. If you are not comfortable doing this yourself, please call
 your hardware/router manufacturer for help in doing this.</span></p>
<p><span>5. If you are having a problem with your wireless connection after resuming from hibernate or sleep, or are having intermittent connectivity issues, try to adjust your
 Power Management profile to change your Wireless Adapter Settings to Maximum Performance.
</span></p>
<p><span>a. To do this click “Change Plan Settings” next to your Power Profile, and choose “Wireless Adapter Settings” and set it to Maximum Performance. You should do this
 with all of your power profiles. Additional guidance is available here: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/power-management" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/power-management</a></span></p>
<p><span>6. Call the support line for your router manufacturer. It is likely that neither Windows nor the router are having problems, it is simply an issue of getting the configuration
 settings on both set up to work correctly together. The router manufacturer will be the best resource to know how to configure their device. Most of the contact numbers are listed here:

If you're trying to connect a STB, you cannot proceed through the installation without a WMC certified IR blaster.<br />
<br />
[Apart from Windows Media Center compatible TV Tuner card ,You also need a Windows Media Center compatible Remote,IR Receiver and IR Blasters.]<br />
<br />
Open Windows Media Center and go to Task&gt;Settings&gt;TV&gt;Setup TV Signal click yes to whatever question come up.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Choose <strong>I Will Manually Configure My TV Signal</strong> select <strong>Antenna</strong>-it does not matter where you have your TV tuner plugged in. choose
<strong>Analog Only Antenna </strong>after you go trough this return to <strong>TV Settings</strong> and click
<strong>Finish</strong>.<br />

    <title>Windows Media Player Keeps Changing My Artwork&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player Keeps Changing My Artwork&#33;</h2>
                    I have a 2000 CD collection ripped in WMA lossless. After ripping a ripping session, I would spend considerable time cleaning it all up. You know editing artwork, album titles, track names, etc. Then WMP willy-nilly follows me around and screws up most
 of my changes.<br />
<br />
You can uncheck "Retrieve Additional Information from the Internet" but WMP will still run around trying to screw up some of your artwork. If WMP can't find any info on an album online, or maybe, if you changed it manually, the metadata ends up getting set
 to all zeros, like this, AlbumArt_{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}_Large.jpg. These files are hidden in the album directory, BTW. Then WMP will take a random one of those from somewhere and copy it everywhere else with {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}
 metadata totally screwing up hours of work. This was really **** me off! There is no way to fix or stop it!<br />
<br />
See more here for more here:&nbsp; <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-pictures/wmp-copies-the-same-artwork-on-hundreds-of-albums/c0e0488d-5064-4da9-8860-add87f329c3b">
Link<br />
</a><br />
Anyway, only solution, for me at least, was to go out and buy MediaMonkey. I pointed WMP to a complete different directory and never use it anymore. Never let WMP touch your library again or it will go around changing these things on you again. If you insist
 trying, make a good backup first. I suspect the W8 Music App is the same way since it appears to be tied into the WMP API like Media Center is. So don't let it touch your library either (without a backup) because it will probably do the same thing!<br />
<br />
With MediaMonkey you can edit and change things to your heart's delight without it messing with you. Their is a learning curve to MediaMonkey and you have to make some setting changes before you do an "Auto-Organize". But once you get use to it you will never
 go back to WMP. Start small with MediaMonkey, like 10 CDs, make a backup, then experiment to learn everything and tweak various settings. I tweaked my MM settings to keep the WMP album format since that was what I liked best.<br />
<br />
If Microsoft ever fixes this issue, or gives us an option to turn this "feature" off, then WMP would be a fine program that I wouldn't mind using! But as it is now, it is completely unusable for me. Only reason I revisited this is I was considering trying the
 W8 Music App and kind of forgot about the artwork issue with {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000} metadata.<br />
<br />
It takes me like all night to copy my library to a separate drive for a backup. I got better things to do than be a guinea pig copying it back and forth experimenting.

<h2>            Xbox One 1TB Call of Duty&#58; Advanced Warfare Bundle Problems</h2>
                    
<p>I pre-ordered the 1TB Xbox One CoD AW Bundle from GameStop and within 24 hours had to return twice to replace the system due to defects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First system had a power issue where within 2 hours of use it would not power up.&nbsp; According to the troubleshoot guide by Microsoft it was not a power supply issue but was a system board failure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second System had an optical drive failure.&nbsp; Put a disc in the drive would try to spin up and make a grinding sound. (disc did not turn so no damage to the disc). &nbsp;Tried this with a DVD and BluRay disc and all media would not be read.&nbsp; The drive would insert
 and eject just fine but would not turn the media.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Third system has been running since 7pm on 11/3 so far so good.&nbsp; GameStop was very good on replacing the system I am just glad they had a few extra in stock.</p>
<p>Has anyone else had any problems with this bundle?</p>

<p>Ii ordered my bundle off amazon and they were good enough to send me a replacement due tomorrow. I got to download the game but when i pressed on it to run, the xbox went haywire and started making grinding noises, similar to that of the harddrive &nbsp;not being
 able to be read properly and the game would just shutoff/reset/crash and return to the homepage. I even tried to format the whole xbox and redownloaded the game gain. Still did the same thinf. . I didnt even risk of trying to put a disc in it haha. This is
 very dissappinting, i didnt pay 500 bucks to miss day zero and have to wait another day to get my xbox replace and redownload the game. Atleast conpensate us for the time wasted and admit fault. What really bothers me is the fact that I cant return the whole
 bundle an get the sunet overdrive edition because I already used the code. What. Waste of time with Microsoft.</p>

<p>Yeah my console isn't reading discs either. The only one I have been able to get it to work is to insert the disc wait a sec and then hard power it off.(press the Xbox button on console for 10s) when I turn it back on sometimes it shows the disc. I'll be
 calling gamestop tomorrow. Let me know if you have any other issues?</p>

<p>BTW that grinding sound is actually a SFX from the console. Or at least that's what exbox is showing on the spec for the console. Similar to when you turn it on or off or eject the disc. At least that's what the sound is on mine, but yeah it really sounds
 like a disc grinding. Its not though</p>

<p>Well don't feel left out.. &nbsp; I have not been able to finish the download yet so I have not had a chance to try anything. &nbsp; I am not sure what incompetent idiot at Microsoft is responsible, but there should be something done to make it right with the customers!!
 &nbsp; What moron thought it was a good idea to make 1000's of people download a 50gig game on the same day? &nbsp; This was a bundle with a 1T drive that could have been preloaded at the factory!!! &nbsp; &nbsp;Someday maybe after I get the game downloaded I will figure out
 if the rest of the console works...</p>

<p>Returning mine will not read any disc at all, did xbox / Microsoft use a new optical drive? Why not go back to disk shelf like 360 ? Don't use radio DVD drives they eat discs all the time what a waste of changing things only to have many problems once again.
 Not sure if I want to risk getting the one til they fix it all. A bit irritated amazon won't even replace it only refund money now saying they do not have any more 1 TB drives. What a waste of 2 weeks! Not sure what to do now keep 360 ;) for now or go sony.
 Haven't hears bad things from play stations yet </p>

<p>is anyone having issues where the controllers are constantly disconnecting from the xbox one and then won't reconnect? &nbsp;We got this same console and the controllers disconnect every few days and to get them to reconnect we have to unplug the xbox for 20
 seconds then reconnect it. &nbsp;using the connect buttons on the controller/console does nothing for some reason (no issues like this on the regular xbox one we have). &nbsp;very disappointing.</p>

            <p>Hi
<span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/02159f98-e848-4227-882a-6cfc5d095a23"><span><span>Leanne2205</span></span></a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description I understand that you are having issue with DVD/CD drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s start with a question</p>
<p>What is the make and model number of you DVD/CD drive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want you to try the following methods to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><em>Run the Hardware and Devices
 troubleshooter</em></span></a></span>
<p>You can try using the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common problems and makes sure that any new device or hardware
 connected to your PC is installed correctly.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping
</span><span><strong>Search</strong></span><span> (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking
</span><span><strong>Search</strong></span><span>), entering
</span><span><strong>hardware and devices</strong></span><span> in the search box, tapping or clicking
</span><span><strong>Settings</strong></span><span>, and then tapping or clicking
</span><span><strong>Find and fix problems with devices</strong></span><span>.</span>‌
<span>You
 might be asked for an admin password or to confirm your choice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2: Check compatibility.</p>
<p>I want you to check if this device is compatible for Windows 8.</p>
<p>Follow the link for checking compatibility.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/en<span>-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/Home</span></span></span></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 3:</p>
<p>I suggest you go to manufacturer’s website and check for latest drivers for Windows 8 if you are able to find the drivers then download and install those drivers
 and check.</p>
<p>If you are unable to find drivers for Windows 8 then I suggest you to download drivers for your previous operating system and run those drivers in compatibility
 mode.</p>
<p>Follow the steps to install drivers in compatibility mode.</p>
<span>
<p><br />
a. Right click the driver installation file and select Properties then tap or click the Compatibility tab.<br />
b. Place a check in the Run this program in compatibility mode for: box. <br />
c. Tap or click the drop down box and select a previous operating system, then tap or click OK.<br />
d. Try installing the driver and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span>&nbsp;
<p><span>Follow the links about program compatibility for reference.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</span></a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope the above information helps.</span></p>

            <p>Similar to yours, I also got the same issue. Once I installed WinX DVD ripper my dvd/cd drive became invisible. Even after uninstall of WinX, it didn't restored back. I even refresh my windows 8 fresh, but that also didn't help either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But recently something strange has happened. I got a auto Windows Update on 17/Aug (May be Windows Defender Update - KB2267602) and after that I got my DVD driver visible automatically and things are back to normal.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To make the matter worst, today I installed WinX DVD ripper again and landed up with the same situation. Then after many try I didn't get my DVD drive back. So as a last resort, I went back to restore point "2 Days old". But still couldn't see the&nbsp;drive
 back. But once I ran "Windows auto update and got&nbsp;KB2267602 installed, the DVD started appearing in the drive.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am just sharing my observation. Hope it would help somebody to pin point the exact issue. May be something to do with "Windows Defender's permission" to access "DVD Drive" which might be creating the issue.

            <p>Hey there, JOKER!</p><p><br /></p><p>I'm sorry to see any issues with Party chat!&nbsp;The first thing we generally check is if you have Gold. Party chat is a Gold feature specifically, and it might be related to that.</p><p><br /></p><p>It could also be that your controller needs an update. I&nbsp;suggest checking out the Accessories section in Settings to see if there's an update for that.</p><p><br /></p><p>Let me know how it goes!&nbsp;We'll see what our next steps are after checking these items. :)</p><p><br /></p><p>--------------------------------------</p>

    <title>Problems with my HP Elitepad 900 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yuvalshamis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with my HP Elitepad 900</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>A few years ago I got <strong>HP Elitepad 900</strong>, was excited to use it but it had so many problems that I gave up for years. finally got tired of not using it and decided to post here looking for answers to the many problems this tablet offers.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Going to the Windows Store:</span></strong></p>
<p>When I got into the Windows Store it displays the message: "We weren't able to connect to the Store. this might have happened because of a server problem or the network connection timed out. please wait a few minutes and try again."</p>
<p>There aren't any problems with my connections, it has been like that no matter on which network I connected to.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Switching to a Microsoft Account:</span></strong></p>
<p>I assumed switching to a Microsoft account would help but when I press the "Switch to a Microsoft Account" button in the settings and after typing in the Email and password I get the error that says "We're sorry, but something went wrong. Your account wasn't
 change to this Microsoft Account. Code: 0x800b0101".</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Desktop mode:</span></strong></p>
<p>So on the Desktop mode I only have Internet Explorer available, which is disgustingly slow and annoying to use, tried to download Chrome but it doesn't allow me, it also blocks almost every website for "security reasons", even Microsoft's website.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Those are the main problems I encounter so far with the HP Elitepad 900, windows 8.1. It might have more but I can't do literally anything on this tablet with those errors, I'm very annoyed and frustated and would appreciate help being done.</p>
<p>I looked up for solutions on the internet but the only one I found was related to PC and the answers included going to task manager, copying files from C:/users/corrupted_profile/ and such, and I have no idea if it's possible to do on tablet, and even if
 it is, it will be very annoying and will take a very long time.</p>

========================================================<br />
<br />
The slow down of your computer is probably not due to defragmentation.<br />
<br />
Use the Clean Boot and other methods to try to determine the cause of and/or eliminate<br />
the issues.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER<br />
had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause<br />
strange issues).<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>Do these :</strong><br />
<br />
Start - type this in Search Box -&gt;&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; -&nbsp; RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Enter this at the prompt - sfc /scannow<br />

===========================================<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

    <title>&#39;Unacceptable Characters&#39; when trying to activate Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> number_9  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#39;Unacceptable Characters&#39; when trying to activate Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>So I purchased Windows 7&nbsp;Professional (64-Bit) (online, from Microsofts site using the student discount)&nbsp;a couple of months ago, and&nbsp;hadn't actually&nbsp;installed it until under a month ago. It's telling me I need to activate Windows right now and things. I
 don't have the original e-mail with the product key in it. So I did some digging and found a Product ID in my system page using the control panel. Why is it that when I type it in, it comes up with an error saying 'Unacceptable Characters'? I'm starting off
 with a 0, if that helps. Is the Product Key (which I don't have) and the Product ID (which I have), different numbers? If so, how would I go about getting the Product Key within the next 12 days?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>You cannot use a Product ID to activate Windows. You need the <strong>25 alphanumeric character product key</strong>to activate Windows.</p>
<p>How did you obtain your Windows 7 license?<br />
<br />
If you purchased the software online, your 25-character Product Key can be found on your account page or in your confirmation email. If you purchased the software from authorized reseller of Microsoft Windows software, please reference your original packaging
 for the Product Key.</p>
<p>If you are unable to find your product key, you will have to purchase a new product key.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not a normal computer as i said it's an Intel Computer stick ultra slim computer STCK1A32WFC.</p>
<p>&nbsp; This is not much bigger than a USB. It's to make any HDMI tv into a computer. It's saying error code Oxc0000225 and will not reboot even if you press F8. So the comuter goes to the blue screen with the error coce and after about a minute shuts down.</p>

            Sorry to say cant use a CD/DVD drive on a hub have tried. Had to get a program from Mircrosft online then could repair but lost my OME key from INTEL. So wont validate now. This you cant boot like a normalcomputer, as only one USB port so used a USB hub
 with four ports with a usb. You have to have a wifi software as well no internet connection port. It's running now but as i say lost my OME key due to thr rebooting from the USB.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>Try the Methods provided below and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>I would recommend you to perform clean boot.</p>
<p>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.</p>
<p>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:</p>
<p><b>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>Try performing SFC (System File Checker) scan on the computer.</p>
<p>SFC /scannow is a super-useful command you can use in any Windows version. When the SFC (System File Checker) command is used with the /scannow switch, the tool will scan all of the important Windows files on your computer and replace them as necessary.
</p>
<p>Missing and corrupt operating system files (like many DLL files) are arguably the biggest cause of major Windows issues. Considering that, plus the fact that SFC /scannnow is completely automatic and very easy to use, the tool should usually be one of your
 first troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on SFC scan –</p>
<p><b>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>I would also suggest you to download and run the latest Microsoft Safety Scanner on your computer and check if it helps:</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></b></p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>

    <title>Windows explorer keeps crashing, computer keeps freezing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> habibderbyshire  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows explorer keeps crashing, computer keeps freezing</h2>
                    <p>Hello dear Windows community. Explorer keeps restarting on my computer and the computer keeps freezing, the taskbar in particular. The window that is open usually doesn't freeze if it's a desktop app, but I can't switch windows because the taskbar is frozen.
 The constant restarting of explorer is also annoying, because it closes the explorer windows I have open. and it messes up the screen size for windows store games. I notice the disk utilization is very high (97%-100%) during the freezing, but I'm not sure
 if it's like that with the explorer restarting problem, because it happens in a flash. I just upgraded to Windows 10 1151, but that doesn't seem to have solved the problem. Is there a solution to my problem? Any help is appreciated!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your reply.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I appreciate your effort, sorry for the delay and inconvenience.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>CPU usage will go high, if there are some unnecessary applications get loaded with the operating system.<br />
I would suggest you to perform following steps and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Run System Maintenance troubleshooter and check.<br />
1.&nbsp;Press Windows key +X, select Control panel.<br />
2.&nbsp;Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons.<br />
3.&nbsp;Click on troubleshooting and click on the view all option on the left panel.<br />

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<strong>Method 2</strong>: We will check the functionality in safe mode with networking.<br />
You may use the steps mentioned in this link to boot to Safe Mode with Networking.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-my/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-my/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01</span></a><br />
.<br />
A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or
 determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Follow this link: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span><br />
<strong>Important note</strong>: After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.”</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong><span>: Bad sectors on the hard drive can be a cause for high disk usage. (Run Check disk)<br />
If you not run the 'check disk' scan or tried optimizing the drive, follow the steps from this article.<br />

            hi. thank u so much for your patience. i am trying to get my registry back in order. it seems that system32.exe comes up the most though. i had some jerk using my computer and all of it's resources for his own personal use and when i busted him he just went nuts and started changing files. i assume so i couldn't trace it or god knows what but as u well know, when 1 file is off then the problem just keeps going. since system32 is a big one it seems the computer is going down fast. i put a new browser in but it is not allowing me to use my back up discs to recover. even if i do recover should i be getting rid of as much of his bad stuff as possible. i am finding it everywhere now but the file extensions have been changed to important system files and programs so if i try to remove his **** it is usually attached to something the system needs. that's what it looks like to me and sounds like the m.o. of one of these losers. any suggestions would b greatly appreciated. also when i go to the area where

            hi, i see i don't even know how to ask a question. just read the link, thank u and here is some more info. windows 7, service pack 1. mcaffee total protection and this person has somehow made his phone part of its' operating system. when i try to activate
 all of those resouces it says " cant activate system32dll or exe." every time i try to open something i am asked what program to use. i try to use common sense but often that doesn't do it.
<br />
-i am trying to restore or back up by disc but it will not let me do either one.<br />
-i have not made any changes but clearly this other person has so i am not aware of status.
<br />
-i have looked through all of the microsft sites i can find and it tells me to restore or brings me here.<br />
-it is pretty much at the point where i cannot get online anymore as more and more goes missing.
<br />
-computer is only a few months old so my discs were made like 2 days after i opened it.<br />

<p>Okay, those pictures were detailed enough so I don't need to explain myself. Are there any other solutions that come to mind because I've been trying to figure out how to fix this issue for too long and I'm getting sick and tired of it.

            <p>Problem Solved! </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For those of you who have the same problem here is what you do:&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Click "Start"</p>
<p>Type in "cmd" in search bar and open command prompt</p>
<p>Type in the following command:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>ICACLS "C:\Users\YOU USER NAME GOES HERE\Desktop" /Setintegritylevel (OI)(CI)M</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Remember to Keep The quotes....then press enter and exit command prompt. This is the only way I know how to fix the problem without compromising your internet security. I suspect this bug is from installing the new internet explorer 10, but I cannot prove
 it.﻿</p>

<p><strong>Seems to me that everyone is having issuees with the blasted webcam. I've not installed any new programs or anything. HP dv6700 is only TWO years old and webcam stops working. The webcam is a built-in Microsoft. I've went as far as restoring computer
 to original factory settings. There is a problem with the webcam driver. I even ran the Microsoft Automated Troubleshooting "Fix It" and it confirms that there is a driver problem. It tries to reinstall the driver, but it fails. I've done everything from enabling,
 disabling, uninstalling, reinstalling and the very last measure was totally returning computer to it's factory condition. Webcam still has yellow box with exclamation. I've worked on this over the past few days. I even uninstalled and reinstalled YouCam and
 Skype. </strong><strong>With or without those programs, webcam remains nonfunctional. I manually tried to update driver, but I'm told I have the most up to date one. Once again, this happened suddenly. No new OS was introduced.</strong></p>

            <p>Hello LMD1980,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am happy to assist you on your inquiry. As for the error code that you get while importing photos from your iPhone to the computer using Photo Gallery, please provide us the detailed steps that you took. Note that Photo Gallery detects devices such as
 mass storage and camera devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a workaround, please try to import the photos from your iPhone directly to your computer. This is for us to verify if this method will let you import the photos with no issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I have tried to download my photos from my iphone to the photo gallery but thats when I get the error message and some photos did download but there was no picture just a file. Somehow I synced my photos to facebook so every photo I take automatically goes
 to facebook.<br />
<br />
I plug my phone into my computer, it says its downloading the pictures but only some downloaded with no picture and than I would get the error message.<br />

<ul>
<li>Please provide the exact steps you are doing when importing the photos till you received the error so we can isolate the issue?</li><li>What file was saved on the computer based on your statement <em>no picture just a file</em>?</li><li>Have you tried manually importing the files from your device to computer? If so, kindly try and give us an update.</li></ul>
<p>We'll wait for your response.</p>

<ul>
<li>What is your Windows Photo Gallery build version?</li><li>Please provide us the error message that you've encountered.</li><li>Does the issue occur before?</li><li>How did you connect your iPhone to your PC?</li><li>Have you tried turning off the camera when importing your photos?</li></ul>

            <p>the only indication of a "build" version of Windows Live Photo Gallery is "windows Live Photo Gallery.link. How do I discover the "build" version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not get any error message. The window that drops down when I click on "Import" is blank and does not respond when I click the "refresh" tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To what do you refer by question "Does the issue occur before?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I connected the iphone using the cord that came with the phone and plugged it into the USB port of my computer.</p>

            When I get to step e. (above) I get a window saying that there are applications for this software running and they need to be closed before continuing.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I've checked and all applications are closed. What do I need to do?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can't continue with the uninstall/step e/step f, and I would like to install the Windows 8.1 update.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please help!</div>

            Thank You! For the great work on helping the rest of us to get MS 8.1 installed. For those novices (myself included) you need how to type at the command line.<br />
<br />
Once you have your command line you need to point to the folder where you downloaded and unzipped the Sentinel HASP/LDK. To do this you need to use the command
<b>CD </b>which stands for Change Directory. and type the complete address to that folder (directory). So for example<b>:<br />
<br />
CD C:\John\Downloads\Removeit\Sentinel HASP\LDK</b><br />
<br />
The address must be exact otherwise you will see an error message in the command prompt. That's o.k. as you can just keep trying until you get it right. I had to remember how to change the directory and use the command prompt to get to the correct folder (directory).<br />
<br />
One important note: Remember the name of the folder (directory) where you downloaded the above software.<br />
<br />
I upgraded from 8.0 to 8.1 on a new DElLL i7, 17 inch notebook. It worked for me!<br />
