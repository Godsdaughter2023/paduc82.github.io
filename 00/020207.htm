<h2>            Outlook 2010 Transfer pst to new computer</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to transfer a pst (Outlook 2010) to a new Windows 8.1 PC running Office 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copied the files itself (18GB) and opened it in the new PC, yet the user created folders do not appear?&nbsp; The few default folder are there, but are all empty.&nbsp; The user created a series of folder to organize the information, but none of them appear in the
 new PC?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Outlook was shutdown at the time the PST was backup for transfer.&nbsp; And the PST still displays fine on that machine.&nbsp; I am going to try again, but am wasting countless hours here and getting frustrated at this point.&nbsp; Little alone the other headaches I have
 faced trying to recreate the user accounts.&nbsp; MS still has a LONG way in perfecting transfer of OLK.&nbsp; You can't even export setting, really in 2015!&nbsp; Anyways, moving on ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've since also performed a pstscan.exe, but it didn't help either.</p>

<p>Yes, i copied the file to an external HD, then copied it to the new pc. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried compacting the file, went from 18Gb to 15Gb.</p>
<p>Tried pstscan.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just odd. &nbsp;The file is sized that it does house the information, yet it won't show it?! &nbsp;And it does work just find on another pc with the exact same version of outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the size, not my doing. &nbsp;I've advised the same as you suggest, but for right now they won't hear of anything until the data is actually functional again!</p>

<p>
After compaction, what is <span>
the current size</span> of your PST file<span>?</span> In my
<span>opinion</span>, heavy PST file is responsible for slower performance of Outlook.

<p>I went from 18.7 down to 15.4Gb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It had done little for performance. &nbsp;On this machine, everything is fast (i7, ssd,...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What has truly made a difference however was going from a pc with Norton anti-spam.... To one without. &nbsp;Peevishly it would take up to 10 minutes to load (i am told) and now it is almost instantaneous, even with the 15GB pst.</p>

<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<span>
</span></p><p>I understand why you feel that way. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that the new version of Skype for Mobile (iOS and Android) is now 8.4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your contacts are saved across all supported devices due to cloud infrastructure. Skype on cloud means you can access all of your chats and shared images on any supported devices with the same Skype account and consume less battery power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the dial pad issue, you can see this as you tap on the phone icon. A pop-up window will appear and on the upper right corner you will see the option "Use dial pad".</p>
<p>
</p><p>For calling a mobile number in India, it is no longer available if you're calling within India. For more information,
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34487/why-can-t-i-make-calls-to-india-from-india?intsrc=client-_-windows-_-7.30.64.105-_-profile.getsubscription?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
click here</a>. It can be the reason that dialed the number incorrectly. Remember to select the country from the drop-down, or enter a "+" and then the country code plus the number you want to call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, uninstall, restart, reinstall, restart Skype on your device. You can also try to sign out and sign back in to make sure that you signed in to Skype using&nbsp;one device only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this answer your query. Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>

    <title>Using OLE to run a Word merge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markus701  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using OLE to run a Word merge</h2>
                    <p>I have code that runs a merge process to generate a Word file filling in data from the database into the Word document.&nbsp; I did this by creating a Word document separately outside the code.&nbsp; The code then loads this docx thru OLE, merging the info, and then
 opens the merged document in Word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this works fine, but the Word document has a header in it.&nbsp; The header appears fine in the final merged docx when using Word 2010, but does not appear at all when using Word 2003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone know if there is some setting I need to do in the OLE code that will set Word 2003 to get the header to appear properly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks for any and all ideas on this,</p>
<p>Mark</p>

            <p>I manually open the Word docx already configured for merging in Word in 2003, and save it.&nbsp; The header did appear in the document in 2003.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did not try actually generating the merged docx in 2003 yet.&nbsp; But when I generate the merged docx using OLE code
 and 2003, the resulting merged docx does not contain the header.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, in 2003, I removed the header that was placed there when editing in 2010 and added a header while editing in 2003.&nbsp; Still no header when using OLE to generate the merged docx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With 2010, all works as it should both manually and using OLE code.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try actually running the merge manually in 2003 to see if the header is retained in the final merged docx.&nbsp; Cannot do so until Monday.&nbsp; But if the header appears in 2003 in manual edit, I expect it should appear in the final merged docx.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you have something particular in mind that would suggest the header could appear in a manual edit but not get generated in the merged 2003 docx?&nbsp; A setting in 2003 maybe not necessary in 2010?</p>
<p>
Thanks for the idea.&nbsp; Will get back to you once I do the 2003 test.

            What I had in mind was if the header is there when the merge is performed manually, it would point to the OLE process as the source of the problem, but if it is not, then it is an issue with the mail merge main document.

</p><p>Thanks for your input.&nbsp; I ran the merge from inside 2003 (not thru OLE) and the header does appear.&nbsp; When I run it using OLE in 2003, it does not, but does appear in 2010 using OLE.&nbsp;

</p><p>When I run the OLE merge, Word 2003 opens without the header.&nbsp; I can edit the merged doc and add a header, but the header that was there in the original .docx used for the OLE merge is not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep thinking that there may be some switch that needs adjusted with OLE to get headers to appear in 2003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you have some more ideas.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Technical Preview &#47; Internet Explorer 11 &#40;Version 11.0.97879.0&#41; - How it handles certificates-Certificate handling and messaging</h2>
                    <p>The newest update to Windows 10 Technical Preview came with an update to IE.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing the update IE no longer gives me the option to "Continue to this website (not recommended)" when there is a certificate issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The site that I discovered the issue on&nbsp; is MY site and I know 100% that the site is safe but the certificate is and has been bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until this latest update I have been able to connect to the site without issue even though the certificate is bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This update obviously modified all the settings on internet explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone in and changed every setting&nbsp;that I can find regarding the certificate handling in options but the issue hasn't&nbsp;been resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas -- other than the normal canned responses of resetting IE blah blah blah which I have already tried?</p>

            Hi my name is Adam I'm an independent adviser, I would like to help you with your question today,
<br />
<br />If you had to receive a sms code or email code and then input that code into the site that is all it is to verify. You will not necessarily get a confirmation, 
<br />As long as you login to outlook.com and account.microsoft.com  you account should be verified and working fine if it need to verify it will tell you upon logging in.

<p>hi,&nbsp;</p>

<p>i'm trying to get all the zip codes mapped on the excel 3d map tool. i've used the official list of the zip codes from the portuguese post agency. although, there are two zip codes which, despite being mentioned in the table, are not traced in the map as
 you can see in the screenshot. is this a bug? how can i solve this?</p>

Try something simpler first and see if you can open the site's favicon image:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/favicon.ico" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://seekingalpha.com/favicon.ico</a><br />

Note: to make sure that you are rendering that&nbsp;with a fresh download and not from the TIF be sure to press Ctrl-F5 after you first see it.<br />

<br />
Note that my suggestion was not made to be a "solution" but a simple diagnostic.&nbsp; Diagnostics are intended to refine a problem's symptom description.&nbsp;&nbsp; So telling me it doesn't help, doesn't help the diagnosis.&nbsp; ; }<br />
<br />
BTW notice the host name used for the favicon I pointed out?&nbsp; It's not&nbsp;the host name that you are trying to use; that one is an alias and could easily explain your symptom if you do not have connectivity to the first name, aka the canonical name.&nbsp; So if you
 are having trouble getting a lookup done for that one you could try switching to a cmd window and enter the following commands:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ipconfig&nbsp; /flushdns<br />
and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ping&nbsp; -n 1&nbsp; seekingalpha.com<br />
and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ping&nbsp; -n 1&nbsp; www.seekingalpha.com<br />
and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ipconfig&nbsp; /displaydns&nbsp; &gt;displaydns.txt<br />
and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notepad&nbsp; displaydns.txt<br />
<br />
Then in the notepad window press&nbsp; F3 to search for&nbsp; seekingalpha&nbsp; <br />
<br />
E.g. after doing that I find this:<br />
<br />
&lt;extract displaydns.txt&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seekingalpha.com<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ----------------------------------------<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Record Name . . . . . : seekingalpha.com<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Record Type . . . . . : 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time To Live&nbsp; . . . . : 268<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data Length . . . . . : 4<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Section . . . . . . . : Answer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A (Host) Record . . . : 65.74.170.164<br />
<br />
&lt;/extract&gt;<br />
<br />
Without that&nbsp; A(Host) Record&nbsp; IE would have to do a lookup each time and thus&nbsp;with a marginal DNS fail to&nbsp;have connectivity with your host site&nbsp;on any of its&nbsp;requests using the alias name.<br />
<br />
BTW I just used that IP address to open the site's home page and what results in the Address bar after that is<br />
<br />
<a href="http://seekingalpha.com/?source=refreshed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://seekingalpha.com/?source=refreshed</a><br />
<br />
So I suggest trying either of those possibilities instead of the alias name that you are trying to use.<br />
<br />
And again, you should regard these suggestions more as diagnostics than as "solutions".&nbsp; ; )<br />
<br />
<br />

Note that nothing I tried including using the direct IP address has been successful.&nbsp; I cannot&nbsp;open the link you mentioned to "reset IE8", same "Oops this connection seems broken message".&nbsp; I am running Vista but my wife on the internet with the same wireless
 router running XP has no problem accessing the Seeking Alpha web site.&nbsp; Seeking Alpha is the only site I am having trouble with.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have been going to this site numerous time every day for over a year.&nbsp; This issue started about Monday (10/12/09) this week.<br />

It would be good if we could get a solution after diagnosing the problem successfully.&nbsp; Please use English.<br />

Perhaps you should try downloading it on your wife's machine and using "sneakernet" to get it to yours then.&nbsp; ; )<br />

Evidently not, otherwise you wouldn't have to resort to sneakernet to get the FixIT.&nbsp; ; )<br />

            This is classic.&nbsp; I figured out that I can indeed access Seeking Alpha if and only if I use the 64 bit version of IE8.&nbsp; My OS is Vista 64 but I was using the 32-bit version of IE.&nbsp; However, when I activate and use the&nbsp;IE 64-bit, the flash player and quick
 time players are not found or activated.&nbsp; When I try to download them I found out that Adobe Flash is not&nbsp;(yet, their working on it though) compatible with IE 64 or Vista 64.&nbsp; Therfore they recommend using the 32-bit version of IE... are you loving this yet?<br />
<br />
The quick time player download did not hook up with IE8 either and I could not even find a reference to 64-bit compatibility on their web site.&nbsp; So the good news is that I can now go to Seeking Alpha.&nbsp; The bad news is that NO Videos&nbsp;run at all on any site with
 IE 8 64-bit!&nbsp; Get it?&nbsp; This is probably why I was using the 32-bit version in the first place.&nbsp; Microsoft strikes again...Gotcha!&nbsp; Why again did I need a 64-bit OS?&nbsp; Two days down the drain.<br />
<br />
Now if someone could just tell me why all this happened.&nbsp; I just lost access to Seeking Alpha last week and had not changed anything myself (running 32-bit IE, etc.).&nbsp; Maybe I got "upgraded"...?<br />
<br />
PS, I could not even find this forum from my favorites link using IE 64 so I have the 32-bit version running again (so long Seeking Alpha).<br />
<br />
Another satisfied customer,

<br />
I think that means that otherwise your User-Agent string would have&nbsp; WOW64;&nbsp; in it.<br />
Perhaps that site just ignores such requests?&nbsp; You could use Fiddler2 to see what is happening.<br />
You could try using the&nbsp; User-Agent Picker tool to spoof a more acceptable UAS.<br />

            Thanks for the good wishes and hocus pocus suggestions to limp along with Microsoft but I have decided to keep it simple and dump IE altogether.&nbsp; Firefox is simple, actually enjoyable and works fine.<br />

Take care, over &amp; out;<br />

    <title>VLOOKUP &#35;N&#47;A ERROR - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeremyslosek  say:</h3>
<h2>            VLOOKUP &#35;N&#47;A ERROR</h2>
                    I am using a VLOOKUP formula to update a current price list with new pricing. The majority of the items have updated how they should but there are some part numbers that are discontinued or do not match exact. In these scenarios the formula turns up #N/A.
 Instead of it changing to #N/A is there a way to keep the current number in the cell but change the color of the cell so I can manually look at each error. Some items with the error do not need to change while others need to be deleted or updated manually.
 Here is the formula I am using currently-&nbsp;=VLOOKUP(N:N,'Order from Minneapolis'!$A:$E,3,FALSE)

            <p>Hi Jeremy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no (easy) way of changing cell colours programmatically, but...</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">=IFERROR(VLOOKUP(N:N,'Order from Minneapolis'!$A:$E,3,FALSE),YOURCELLREF) will return the original number. From there you can do conditional formatting to say if A1 = E1 (as an example), highlight the
 cell.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope that helps!</span></p>

            By "YOURCELLREF" do you mean to put the cell number that the error occured in? I tried this and it changes the #N/A to 0. Maybe if I duplicated the original worksheet and had all errors reference back to the duplicated page and only use that page as a
 reference for the errors? Then I should be able to make all cells in the duplicated page one color and when the "IFERROR" takes it, it should take the format correct?

<p>Sorry, I should've explained better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The YOURCELLREF would be the first value in the VLOOKUP, so it returns as you wanted, the original price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could do that, or filter bu cell colour, your choice on that one.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>My Windows phone received another update last week and appears to have resolved the problem, with Bluetooth connectivity and generating a voice message for text. I also thought you could use voice for an email response, but after reading more carefully online
 I see it is for SMS text message and accessing Cortana.</p>

<p>I've read each of the replies, Yet I don't believe we got an answer to why the BAND 2 cannot be paired to the PC. I have an iPHONE AND IT SUCCESSFULLY is paired to my BAND 2. &nbsp;I've done each of the things that have been noted here. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the problem lie with the Health App on the iPHONE?</p>

            <p>Sorry, but I had it paired with my laptop running Windows 10. </p>
<p>The Health App in 10 allowed it to be paired at one time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I no longer have a laptop with Bluetooth, so for me the point is now mute. But saying it is only for phones, well sorry, I don't agree. I think it is for any platform with Bluetooth, and the Health app.</p>

            <p>I was at one time paired with the desktop/laptop app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried it 2 weeks ago, the desktop app said it did not "...support Bluetooth at this time".</p>
<p>
</p><p>My experience with Microsoft hardware, namely Lumia devices, support is so pitiful that after awhile, I throw the towel in and move on to a different platform.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Change Windows Insider email preferences - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mate-93  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change Windows Insider email preferences</h2>
                    <p>I have signed up to the Windows Insider program with a Microsoft account that has four email aliases. Let's just call them A, B, C and D.</p>
<p>I signed up using the "A" alias, where the emails are being received too. I would like to simplify my account by deleting the&nbsp;"A" and "D" aliases&nbsp;leaving just&nbsp;the "B" and "C" aliases. The problem is that I didn't find any link where I could change the incoming
 emails to be received from "A" to "B" alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the end of each Insider emails it says: "If you wish to stop receiving Windows Insider Program emails, you will need to leave the program." However I don't want to leave the program and I want to keep getting the emails but I can't set which email address
 do I want to receive the Insider emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea?</p>

<p>AutoSave is directly related to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Collaborate-on-Excel-workbooks-at-the-same-time-with-co-authoring-7152aa8b-b791-414c-a3bb-3024e46fb104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Co-authoring</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not about being undemocratic or selective. There are technical logistics that need to be in place for co-authoring and AutoSave to work reliably. This requires specific locations of online storage and an internet connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not condemn Microsoft for providing a technology that does not work in all the nooks and crannies of a less than perfect world.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you rave at Ford or General Motors that you can't drive your SUV across the Sahara desert because there are not enough gas/petrol stations to keep you in fuel, or there are no paved roads and you get stuck in the sand dunes? Is that a problem of the SUV
 or a problem of the infrastructure that is lacking in the Sahara??&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a similar scenario. You can only enjoy the benefits of a new technology if your environment supports that technology. If it does not, you won't be able to use that technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's really that simple. For each innovative technology there are some key requirements and they are clearly defined. If you don't match the key requirements, please don't complain that you can't enjoy the benefits of the new technology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An example from the last century: if you don't have a color TV, you can't watch TV shows in color. They'll still be black and white, even if the broadcast enables color for clients with color TVs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same situation. No discrimination. Nothing undemocratic. Just a matter of what tech you have at your disposal.</p>

<p>Add me to the list of those who want to AutoSave locally. I don't know what this is about it being a new technology -- maybe it wasn't in the earlier subscription versions -- but I'm 98% certain that AutoSave was a feature of the older MS Office products.&nbsp;</p>

            You're confusing the new AutoSave that is part of the new co-authoring feature and only works with files stored in the cloud, with the old regular AutoRecover, which still exists. Just go File &gt; Options &gt; Save. It's all still there.&nbsp;

<h2>            deactivate spam filter</h2>
                    Is there any way to deactivate the automatic spam filter on outlook mail? It seems to be not so "intelligent" and it automatically blocks important messages. No helpful settings found, thanks.

            Hello MatteoTurri1, <br />
<br />
I understand that you are very annoyed by Outlook's poor spam recognition algorithms as it keeps filtering your important emails as junk.
<br />
<br />
I regret to inform you that it is not possible to turn off Outlook.com's anti-spam algorithms. The minimum setting is "Standard" Nonetheless, you can always go to your Junk Mail and select all then move to inbox, or setup
<strong>inbox rules</strong>. ;) <br />
<br />
Explore Outlook.com <strong>inbox rules</strong>: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-inbox-rules-in-outlook-com-4b094371-a5d7-49bd-8b1b-4e4896a7cc5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-in...</a> <br />
<br />
Here are some of the things you might like to do: <br />
<br />
1. Add the sender address to <strong>safe senders list</strong> <br />
2. Ensure that the address is not in your <strong>blocked senders list</strong> <br />
3. Check if you have any <strong>inbox</strong> or <strong>Sweeping rules</strong> that might be causing this
<br />
<br />
You may like to feedback it to Outlook.com engineers here: <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/601444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/601444</a> <br />
<br />
If you are using Microsoft Outlook application, however, you can change the <strong>
level of protection</strong> in the Junk Email Filter to "<strong>No Automatic Filtering</strong>"
<br />
<br />
See: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-the-level-of-protection-in-the-junk-email-filter-e89c12d8-9d61-4320-8c57-d982c8d52f6b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> chrisfischer  say:</h3>
<h2>            numbering</h2>
                    <p>My numbering system is not responding appropriately. &nbsp;Apparently, some adjustment that seemed natural to me, was a step in the wrong direction. &nbsp;The system as shown on You tube is simple. &nbsp;Attach Heading 1, create heading 2, and so on. &nbsp;I choose the scientific
 papter numbering from the list in the home tab, drop down in paragraph section. &nbsp;1, 1.1, 1.1.1, and so on. &nbsp;But the headings are not responding. &nbsp;What have I done, and what should I not do, and what should I do to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your help with this ackward moment.</p>

            <p>Hi, Suzanne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I switched to the correct list, as you described, and that did seem to help. &nbsp;However, a problem remains. &nbsp;Let me show it to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp;Name of Chapter &nbsp; &nbsp;heading 1</p>
<p>1.1 &nbsp;Name of Subsection &nbsp; heading 2</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp;Name of 2nd Chapter &nbsp; &nbsp;heading 1</p>
<p>1.2 &nbsp; Name of Subsection &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;heading 2</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the heading 2 isn't adjusting its sequence according to the Chapter number. &nbsp;In my experience, it looked like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp; Name of 2nd Chapter &nbsp; &nbsp;heading 1</p>
<p>2.1 &nbsp; Name of Subsection &nbsp; &nbsp;heading 2</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've made so many adjustments, I'm sure I need to undo something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>

            <p>Thank you for this. &nbsp;I just looked at this before posting. &nbsp;Very funny with the kids in the orchestra. &nbsp;Yep, that is just what my numbering system is looking like!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, I read picked up connecting the styles from the article. &nbsp;So, I did modify each style according to the article. &nbsp;It did not seem to create the links so as to generated the automated numbering mechanisms.</p>
<p>

            <p>Doug:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to the question, yes, more or less. &nbsp;After sequencing the styles, heading 1 based on no style, heading 2 based on heading 1 and so on, I then realized the the heading boxes in the styles are now numbered, which shouldn't be the case. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, the heading 1s (four instances) are not numbering in sequence, and the heading 2 is based upon the one instance of the heading 1 assignment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it looks somewhat like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;chapter 1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;as per heading 1 in style</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;chapter 2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;does not number</p>
<p>1.1 &nbsp;subsection for Chapter 2, but assigned, apparently, to chapter 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, as I pointed out, all the styles now have numbering assigned to them. &nbsp;So that Heading 1 &nbsp;shows &nbsp;1 Aa Bb..., and heading 2 shows &nbsp; 1.1 &nbsp;Aa Bb....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need to do the obvious, (remove the numbering from each heading style to begin again) or is there something else I should do at this point?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>

            <p>If you have linked the styles to a multilevel list, then you should expect the styles to show numbering; that's the way it works. To use the numbering you want, you should only have to apply Heading 1 to a paragraph (or click in a Heading 1 paragraph), then
 select the 1 Heading 1, 1.1 Heading 2, 1.1.1 Heading 3 numbering from the Multilevel List gallery. This will apply numbering to
<strong>all</strong> the heading styles, and your Quick Styles gallery will look like this:</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, there is a way to determine if a message has been delivered (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/gettingstarted/smartphone/sms.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/gettingstarted/smartphone/sms.mspx</a>).&nbsp;
 To bad that option to know it was sent was not there too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll link this to Linley who is very knowledgable with smartphones ... maybe he knows a way. (I've been a pocket PC phone person ... just got my first smartphone so it is a new learning curve)</p>

<p>you can do this by adding a new value in the registry. If you do not have a Registry editor, get one
<a href="http://www.phm.lu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have to go to Hkey_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\Inbox\Settings and create the followind Dword value called SMSNoSentMsg with a value of 1 to disable. If you want to re-enable it later, change the value to 0. If Settings key&nbsp;does not exist, you need
 to create it first.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 and htc 8x.</h2>
                    <p>I want to say to the community, thanks for the questions about our phones to microsoft.</p>
<p>I have the 8x too and also waiting impatiently for the window 10 up grade. due to project sparta having edge full screen issues when watching movies. I rather have the full working build, but keep up letting Microsoft know that we own the best performing
 phone in the family and we should not be left out of having an upgrade to this phone, So lets keep them at their promise to "surely have it supported" Microsoft git'er done.

            <p>DONT DO IT!!!!</p>
<p>I had automatic update on and notice I was getting an up date. Didn't think much about it and eight hours later it was still installing. I then rebooted the phone. HTC 8X and notice windows10 only thing, print so small you need two pair of 2.50 glasses to
 read anything to set it up. After you do you can use Ease of access to increase some fonts, But home screen fonts? no way too tiny to read. edge internet sites can be read normally. You can't reverse this as there is no image software in Microsoft recovery
 tool. So I bought a BLU phone as a temporary phone after a tech at Microsoft Store tried to fix&nbsp;the old one &nbsp;for me.&nbsp; While setting up the new BLU&nbsp;phone at home&nbsp;I got a update notification, that stated install this update, to stop your phone from rebooting.
 I guess my old phone was on sync because I had selected do not restore on the new phone.&nbsp;So I opted to down load the 8,1 update as I thought it said, To my surprise it began to update the windows 10 update onto this phone with out me having windows insider
 program I immediately shut down the phone and tried the hard reset and my phone died for about 40 min. I mean NO POWER! I called Microsoft and it was a nightmare. no one seemed&nbsp; willing to say we know there's a problem and we're trying to fix it. In stead
 it's your fault and go to the manufacture who no longer makes that phone, and don't have the software image to download (since Microsoft bought Nokia.) have no need to support the 8x. So the solution was send it to HTC and they would then request a board from
 Microsoft to replace for $200.00 and then send it back to me. After this nightmare I read the article that said Gabe had known that we should not have gotten the update. as I had known because it was said we wouldn't get it until the full windows 10 version
 came out or it was supported on our 8x. So getting it stated that it was now support and so down loading as some did may not have been their fault but the ones that got pushed on is definitely not their fault.&nbsp; On 9/18/15&nbsp;I read article that says Microsoft
 has placed priority on fix the 8X bug.&nbsp; I think that if they don't we should receive a discount on the new flagship phones that come out be cause the BLU or in my opinion Nokia phones don't match up to my 8x</p>

I started with Android and enjoyed it because phone companies were going coo-coo with the minutes pricing on phones. and Cricket was only carrying Android. As soon as Microsoft came out with the windows phone I wanted one. It was classy and like no other phone
 out there. When I saved up for a windows phone cricket was marketing them in a few store but not in my Region so I could not get one and held on to the cash. Unfortunately I had a friend pay my Cricket bill and she was convinced to get a new plan that cost
 me more and gave me less.&nbsp; I still had the desire for a windows phone and left Cricket because they had stopped selling M.S Phones and I bought the 8x. Now I did not say I had an unlocked Android because I loved the customization and the 8x afforded me, that
 as well as a reliable phone, and it was also unlocked. I don't want to go back to Android&nbsp; because its like getting lost in the a crowd where everyone looks the same. that said is why Microsoft should work on the housing of their phones I think the 8x and
 the M8 looks great in hand and was complemented often. on the 8x. Now on to the pushed w 10&nbsp; update. I have spoken with Microsoft and customer service has less or&nbsp;not been told the information that can be found on the web, and yet I received e-mail stating
 no more updates to my phone but MS is still looking for a solution. HTC has stated. they will not provide the image necessary to Repair the phone because its over 12 months. Although for $200.00 you can send them the unbroken phone and the can replace the
 board." By working with Microsoft"&nbsp;&nbsp;So Android is a good phone for a cheap price but when you go to the Samsung, Apple, Galaxy, and the&nbsp;rest,( All look like Android graphics(&nbsp;you know why?) pay insurance and then if something happens to your phone by the company,
 you're still forced to pay x amount of dollars ,or a bout a third of your cost for a new phone this is ridiculous. buy a good phone don't let the company&nbsp;use your phone for product testing&nbsp;and stick with a company&nbsp; like&nbsp;Apple or Microsoft&nbsp;where at least&nbsp;we
 have some control of the customization and information we are giving away&nbsp;for free and paying so dearly when&nbsp;we buy these new smart products. &nbsp;

            Thanks for the support. I was waiting for the full build too don't know why mine up graded automatically which Microsoft said it shouldn't have. that's my issue. I say all 8x users that wasn't to get this update also tell Microsoft that if we can't get
 the image because of a broken partnership we should get a third 1/3 off the 950 or 950xl minus the accessories I bought that 8x cash out and not had it that much&nbsp;longer than a year.

<p>Hello 7thSense,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your posting. Regarding calendar reminder plugins, by searching, there isn’t any official plugins, we are sorry for the inconvenience. Generally, you can adjust notifications
 via clicking your account tile on the right-upper corner-&gt;Settings-&gt;Notifications, for meeting started notifications, there are only two options: Banner or Off. Regarding your concerns, I understand that this may not meet your needs, you are welcomed to share

<h2>            Voice Command 1.6 and my version of Windows Mobile</h2>
                    
<p>I originally purchased my UTStarCom 6700 from Alltel and then got a bluetooth headset.&nbsp; I later (maybe a month after I got the phone) purchased Microsoft Voice Command 1.6.&nbsp; It worked great and then I had a problem with the phone that required a replacement
 phone.&nbsp; Here is my problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "new" phone has an older version of Windows that the "old" phone did and I cannot find anywhere to upgrade the version.&nbsp; The voice announcing of caller ID information does not come through the bluetooth headset anymore (the whole reason I got Voice Command
 in the first place) and neither Alltel nor UTStarCom are of any help.&nbsp; I currently have OS 5.1.195 (build 14928.2.2.0) and I need (build 15097.3.0.0) at a minimum.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me where i can get it?&nbsp; I am very close to telling Alltel to send me another
 phone witht eh correct software on it.</p>

<p>Hi Vamsi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s some information related to your questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>The user who is assigned “SharePoint administrator” role will have access to the SharePoint Admin Center and OneDrive Admin Center.</span></li></ul>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/667be7bb-fe16-4b9a-9af1-c63c38e7409b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/667be7bb-fe16-4b9a-9af1-c63c38e7409b" /></a>&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>The SharePoint administrator can access and manage SharePoint site collections except OneDrive for Business site collections by default.</li><li>Typically, the user who the OneDrive site is being created for is the only OneDrive site admin. However, you can set “My Site secondary admin” so this admin will be able to access and manage all the
<strong>new created</strong> OneDrive sites. For more information about this, please refer to
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-SG/library/dn957479.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to enable My Site secondary administrator for OneDrive for Business</a>.</li><li>For the existing OneDrive sites, the SharePoint admin only can set “access delegation for secondary My Site owner”. This admin’s access and manage permission will only be granted when he gets the email that alerts you “<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">the
 user’s My Site will be deleted in 14 days”. </span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">To set “My Site secondary admin” or “secondary My Site owner”, go to SharePoint admin center&gt;User Profiles&gt;My site settings&gt;setup my sites</span></li></ul>

<p>Hello. I've bought my phone back in the end of April, and now - suddenly, I have few issues. Out of nowhere, the phone has few bugs. First of all, the bottons don't work from time to time, the camera opens up automatically and sometimes even takes pictures
 automatically, and so does the flashlight that opens up automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. I also have the "system error" and "memory full problems close some applications" messages.</p>

            hi mate,<br />
<br />
have you checked if there are any firmware updates available for your device via Nokia Suite? if there is, please update to the latest version offered. If there is none, then try to re-install your current firmware via Nokia Suite (please remember that this
 and the following will delete all your data, so please backup all your personal data first)...or if that doesn't work, then perform a Restore to factory settings, and if that doesn't work either, perform a three finger hard reset.<br />
<br />
Failing that, you will need to take your phone to your local Nokia Care point for them to inspect:
