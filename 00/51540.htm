<h2>            How do I get the Games for Windows Live client to work on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ok so I am trying to install Virtua Tennis 4 on my Windows 10 Pro pc and for the life of me I cannot get the Games for Windows Live Client to work at all. I've checked all the posts about it on here and none of the links work or have already expired. I have
 also downloaded the separate Games for Windows Live client and that doesn't install/work at all. I also don not want to be referred to the Xbox forums cause that looks like a wasteland of posts with no answers or any help at all. I get getting the following
 error message "Failed to initiate Games for windows-Live." And then the program closes and I even doubt that it even installs at all since I cannot find in my programs list. What can I do? I am getting really frustrated here and shows to me that Windows 10
 isn't truly meant for gaming at all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh here's that market place Windows Live game client that doesn't work at all in case anyone feels like showing it to me. Like I said I have looked all over the damn place for a solution.</p>

            I've just given up completely. I bought my windows comp with a graphics card so I can play games on it but this is just hindering that idea especially when it comes to older games. I do not have any issues with my internet connection as I am able to go
 online hence I can reply from my lap top, I even tried to see if the Win 10 fire wall settings were blocking anything and changed those but still nothing.

    <title>How do I resolve an IRQ conflict&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> armanschwarz  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I resolve an IRQ conflict&#63;</h2>
                    Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I have a motherboard with only a single PCI-E slot, and have installed my sound card in it. I get a lot of popping and cracking, and previously when I had a Wifi controller in the PCI-E slot and a different sound card in the only free PCI slot, I also had the
 same problem. Using my USB headset for sound, I don't have any problems.<br />
<br />
Removing the USB controller from the other PCI slot resolves the problem. This leads me to believe it's a IRQ issue.<br />
<br />
I have the USB controller, the sound card and the Video card all on IRQ 16. I can't change the IRQ of any of them in the device manager. Removing, reinserting, reinstalling drivers, etc. has not fixed the problem.<br />
<br />
Other than removing my USB controller altogether, how can I address this issue? Short of just removing stuff and putting it back in and hoping for the best (which is what most of the recommendations seem to be) what can I do?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Arman<br />

No, I am quite certain that overallocation of a single IRQ is the cause because it is the only remaining explanation I can think of for the behavior I have described above. I want to know how I can change the IRQ of existing hardware components. I have attempted
 to change the resource of the PCI slots in the BIOS (where the PCI USB controller is located) but in windows it still shows up as resource number 16. How can I change these in windows? And how does windows allocate them in the first place?<br />

Ok so there is no way to avoid my sound card being on the same IRQ as my video card? (I only have one PCIE slot and one PEG slot so I can't move them around)<br />

            By the way I can't adjust the IRQ of my PCI-E slot in the BIOS, only PCI slots, and that seems to have no effect on the resource number for those cards in windows anyway (if I set the IRQ for the PCI slot where the USB controller is installed to 11 for
 example, then the USB controller in the device manager stays on 16 anyway)...<br />

<p>Can you get to the splash page through Internet Explorer for Xbox? You *might* be able to do that. If you don't have IE on your Xbox, you'll have to take your console to a friend's house or something and download it there.
</p>
<p>No guarantees, but it might work out if you try the browser to connect to the Wi-Fi before trying to sign into Xbox LIVE.</p>

<p>Look up your mac address on the xbox (system settings&gt;network&gt;your network&gt;configure &gt;additional&gt;advance settings) call your offices front desk and ask for their it department. Get the it department to add you xboxes mac address to a whitelist.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>90% of the time they will beable to do it and it takes less then 20 mins.you just need to talk to the network administrator. if they use att, comcast or sprint. the front&nbsp; offices usually doesnt know about the process but att and other isp's are very good
 about it. you just&nbsp; ask for the ISP (internet provider) they can give you a number to call.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If your unable to get your xbox white listed there are some alternatives but u will need to get consent to use them with out consent bypassing security on a network is a crime..</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>IE only works after you are on live.</p>

<p>1) Collect the MAC address and have the Internet provider for the apartment 'whitelist' the MAC so it bypasses the splash. The MAC is found by doing Settings | System Settings | Network Settings | name of wireless network | Configure Network | Additional
 Settings | Advanced Settings | Alternate MAC Address | and the current MAC address will appear on the left.

    <title>Need Help For A VL Build - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adventsoul05  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need Help For A VL Build</h2>
                    
<p>After attempting to try google to find the answer to my question (getting me nothing but necromage builds and other non-useful information) I am going to ask if anyone would be able to give me some pointers concerning a build for my next character. &nbsp;Before
 we get to that though these are what my preferences are.</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>I love an archer type character, I like being stealthy, I enjoy magic and I also enjoy Conjuration. &nbsp;With that being said I need help trying to build a character focused around a Vampire Lord and their respective magics. &nbsp;For instance I am thinking of going
 the Sneak, Archery, Conjuration, Illusion and One Hand route. &nbsp;I am unsure if that would be preferential when I will be doing a vampire lord focused character.&nbsp;</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>If anyone has any advice, build suggestions, links to Vampire Lord/Necromage Vampire Lord builds that actually talk about a build and not just describe every single perk in the game then I would be happy to hear about them and discuss them. &nbsp;I'm really eager
 to get this guy started but going in blind and choosing the wrong perks until late in the game will make me want to just start over. &nbsp;I sorta screwed up an Assassin/Archer I created and know I put points into the wrong perks.</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>Would love to do a Stealth/Mage/Archer type of character but build suggestions help me greatly. &nbsp;I would prefer hearing advice rather than "play how you want." &nbsp;My way of playing that is fun is finding the best possible optimal build for a character I create.
 &nbsp;Thanks in advance and I look forward to this discussion ^.^</p>

<p>Illusion and Conjuration definitely fit the character of a master type vampire, beyond that really depends on what you're doing with it.</p>
<p>Is the character kind of Robin Hood turned vamp type of idea?</p>
<p>Movie references give me good example ideas.</p>

<p>Hey there. Lets get right too it. </p>
<p>I personally say to boost your restoration to level 70 to take the necromage perk before you become vampire. That way you will feel all the benifits from necromage.
</p>
<p>Also you want t use 1 handed and bows as well as conjuration? Well the bound sword/bound bow will fiill all boxes on that one. You can also make your bound weapons soul trap for endless enchantment souls. Also for fights against enmy casters your bound weapons
 can take down their summon in one hit.</p>
<p>I understand that Atronchs will be appaling for you summo of choice but I personally used the resurect spells and the Dremora as a heavy duty back up. Ressurect will be especialy effective after the necromage perk. And usually feels right to use.</p>
<p>I personally choose Bretons over high elves for these builds as they start with extras in conjuration and I find them more versitile. Thei special power is dragonskin which negates most damage from an oppents spell and restores your magika. Perfect example
 of this at play is when I got jumped by 5 mages. Activted dragonskin, used bound sword in my right hand and contantly cast the first healing in my left. It allowed me to get up close and slash them while their spells fed my healing. After I dropped the first
 mage I resurected him and he supplied some nice summons and destruction magic from the back.
</p>
<p>The benifits of using necromage before you become a vampire means that the perk is active when you technically become undead and threfor your perks get bufed aswel as any othe perks you take from then on. Your spells get buffed too. So healing even with
 the most novice spell can be just as effective as a high level healing with necromage. All of the Alteration perks get buffed and they supply you with your general resistance and mage armor. Restoration perks can feed healing into stamina and magic so you
 can basicaly never realy run of of mana.</p>
<p>Easy to level your restoration is to aquire the turn undead spell early and trap a Dragh in a room with one exit and just bombard it. It can be done in bleakfall barrows. Also in reguards to how to level up your stats do 2 mana and 1 health in that ratio.
</p>
<p>Hope this helps :)</p>

<p>@Jameser78 &nbsp;If I had to describe it that would probably be it. &nbsp;Straight up Archer type that uses magic basically. &nbsp;I could go with Conjuration for bound weapons/bow. &nbsp;Not sure how else to plan it out though.</p>
<p>@Tr0lldem0rt &nbsp;Your post is EXACTLY the kind of post I have been looking for. &nbsp;Why can't people be more like you when describing things? &nbsp;Also since I want to do a Necromancer VL type of build going the Necro route could be beneficial wouldn't it? &nbsp;I'm not
 sure if I want to take 1h and bow since I prefer to kill at range but getting sneak attack 1 shots via backstab is just too tempting. &nbsp; Any advice on that?</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>Also in concerns to the Necromage build, aside from Restoration and Conjuration what other skills should I put points into to make the Necromage work? &nbsp;Would 1h and Archery still benefit the bound weapon/bow? &nbsp;Should I take Illusion? &nbsp;Should I take Blacksmithing

<p>After doing more digging and FINALLY finding someone on youtube who actually knows how to build Skyrim characters I have decided my next two characters already.</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>One, which will be my Assassin remade, is going to be a Nigthblade/Assassin type of character who will side with the Dawnguard.</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>My 2nd character will be an all out Mage type Necromancer/Necromage utilizing Vampire Lord once I join up with them in the DG expansion.</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>I figured that being an archer/assassin utilizing Vampire Lord is only good due to the passive effects for sneak and whatnot. &nbsp;But why choose the faction to get Vampire Lord and never use it since it doesn't benefit your playstyle if you assassinate/snipe
 from a distance with a bow? &nbsp;I know you don't need it but getting it and never using it makes no sense. &nbsp;That is why I chose to make a mage type character that will actually benefit the VL AND I will actually want to use the form since the form does the same
 thing as my mage anyways.</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>I still don't mind discussing builds though as it can still help me refine these two so feel free to keep commenting.</p>

<p>Glad you found a build. Mind sharing your insights? :p</p>
<p>Aswell as Resto an conj I would say take illusion becase you can get silent casting from that and then you dont really need the sneak attack bonusus. Just sneak into range, hit one guy with rage and let him get dropped r drop someone, Ressurect the corpse,
 you now have a little army to sweep the cave/area you are in. You want to put a few points into the mae armor perk in Ateration and the magic resistence perk to. Just some basic defence imo. You also ned aback up incase thigs get hairy. I had a few destruction
 spells on hand incase I had to get stuck in but mostly my back up was bound weapon with a stoneskin/ healing in my left hand.</p>
<p>Mages have so much they can do its really har to direct someone over a build. You might enjoy a vampire lord trickster build. Top 3 skills are Resto, Illusion and conju. Resto to 70 (this will always be the starting point for your build) and your main form
 of combat is illusion magic. Calming the guys that get too close and fear/fury anyone else. You basically get to stroll through most caves controlling the absolute flow of battle. And conj incase you need the back up as per :)</p>

<p>The character I just started, named Illirea who is a Dunmer, will basically be like a Nightblade. &nbsp;There are a few things I changed about the build to benefit it more to my own playstyle and make it alot different from your generic Nightblade. &nbsp;Think of
 it as sort of a mix between WitchHunter and Nightblade. &nbsp;Also wall of text ahead, you've been warned &gt;.&lt;</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>I plan on going Conjuration/Sneak/Archery/Illusion/One Handed. Restoration or Alteration. &nbsp;Now with all of those I don't plan on spending every single point on every perk in each one.</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>In Stealth I plan on taking 1/5 Stealth because maxing it out will only give me 20% more sneak and as certain posts I found stated you don't necessarily need 5/5 if you plan on taking other perks in Illusion or the left side of the Stealth perk tree. &nbsp;I
 also plan on taking Backstab, Deadly Aim, Assassin's Blade, Muffled Movement and Light Foot. &nbsp;I am still unsure whether Silent Roll and Silence would prove to be very beneficial for my build or not. &nbsp;Still pondering that.</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>In Illusion I plan on taking pretty much the entire perk tree. &nbsp;I've never created a character who actually used Illusion based spells before and am finding it actually fun in the current playthrough I am doing. &nbsp;Illusion is something I always wanted to
 try but never went with because I felt every build needed BS and Enchanting. &nbsp;Now I make characters who don't take many perks from either of those so I don't make myself TOO OP. &nbsp;Another reason behind doing Illusion is for Quiet Casting. &nbsp;I plan on doing a
 100% playthrough with this character using only the Bound Bow and the Nightingale Bow when I aquire them. &nbsp;I've always liked the BBow but never used it due to thinking it wasn't strong. &nbsp;After reading numbers about it that changed my mind quickly ^.^</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>Next up is Archery. &nbsp;I plan on getting 5/5 in Overdraw, 3/3 in Critical Shot, Eagle Eye, 1/2 in Steady Hand, Power Shot, Hunter's Disciple (even though it's not really necessary since I plan to mainly use Bound Bow although when I use a regular bow it could
 still come in handy), Quick Shot, Ranger and Bullseye. &nbsp;As you can see I definitely plan on taking the whole tree since my main focus is killing via ranged.</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>In Conjuration I plan on taking perks that benefit my Bound Bow. &nbsp;Although I am still considering taking a few extra like the Atronarch stuff just in case I get into a situation where escape isn't an option and I am more than likely to die. &nbsp;With that said
 the perks are as follows. &nbsp;Novice Conjuration, &nbsp;Mystic Binding, Soul Stealer (because I find myself having tons of enchanting crystals but never filled ones) and Oblivion Binding when I reach a point where Mages will summon the crap out of their minions. &nbsp;Other
 perks I am considering are Apprentice Conjuration and Expert Conjuration. &nbsp;If I feel like I will want Atronarchs then I will get all the perks beneficial to those as well. &nbsp;Like I said though, it all depends on how many perk points I have available and how
 my playsyle will evolve as I get going.</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>Now for my final perk tree I am still unsure on it. &nbsp;I don't know if I want to take One Handed just to get 5.5 in the first perk to increase One Handed damage. &nbsp;In Restoration I would just take Novice Restoration, Regeneration and the perk that increases
 Magicka regen by 50%. &nbsp;Alteration I am still figuring out. &nbsp;The main reason I would get it is basically to use Paralyze so I am not 100% on board with this tree just yet.</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>That is basically my plan with this character. &nbsp;I plan on making her a Werewolf, having her join the Companions, Dark Brotherhood and Thieves guild and I plan to side with the Dawnguard. &nbsp;If anyone has any suggestions I plan on taking consideration in changing
 up anything that might be unnecessary. &nbsp;If something suggested works better than what I suggested I might change it up. &nbsp;Thanks for reading and hope this helps you understand what I want in my Assassin character. &nbsp;Also my Mage is still in the works. &nbsp;But so
 far I plan on doing a possible Necromancer, WitchHunter or a Necromage to benefit the VL form.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>I've thought about it but I find alchemy to be more of a bother than it's worth. &nbsp;If everything dies in one shot there's no point in making poisons and in terms of potions I never use anything other than healing/magic or stamina potions. &nbsp;I occasionally
 use Invisibility potions but finding the ice wraiths proves a hassle half the time as they aren't always where I last found them. &nbsp;Although I do come across a TON of ingredients while venturing and usually just turn everything into random potions anyways.
 &nbsp;Maybe I might try it to get the 100,000 gold achievement.</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>I think I will split one handed to increase it's damage 5/5, Restoration to get the regeneration and magic regen perks and put points into Blacksmithing to get Arcane Blacksmith so I can upgrade already enchanted gear I find like the NIghtingale set or the
 Bow from the DLC. &nbsp;Although I am still open to suggestions. &nbsp;Also adding that so far this build is a blast. &nbsp;At low levels I conjure stuff to fight giants and mammoths while I shoot them at a distance and have been leveling both rather quickly that way using
 no boosting methods. &nbsp;Feels satisfying ^.^ &nbsp;Also my ratio is 3 in Magic 2 in Stamina and 1 in Health until I have done each twice. &nbsp;After that I plan on going 3 in Stamina 2 in Magic and 1 in Health.</p>

<p>Your levelin ratio sounds good. Although I might switch to the stanima 3 magic 2 and health 1 first purely because of the perks that come with archery will require more use of stamina and you can get long with low level spells just fine for now. Aside from
 that you have a good build on the go! </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I started my necromage vl build tonight. Playing on master dificulty I decided I need a base of operations so after the intro I got on the good side of the wood elf in Riverwood and started my walk to Marketh. I dont fast travel and rarely use carrages.
 I have fury in one hand and raise zombie in th other. My casing set up is as follows</p>
<p>Main type of attack - Conjure for raise zombie and bound sword when I can afford it.</p>
<p>Defence - Alteration because of the different skin spells and the perks are useful since casters carry no main defence</p>
<p>Suuport - Illusion. I like the trickster way of playing. </p>
<p>Sneaking around forsworn hideouts today with my archer bodyguard just furying the forsworn to take down eachother and let my acher finish off surviviors just for me to raise zombies in the middle of the figh ment I was happily sat at the back causing 3 different
 flows of the fight. Even took down a Brier-Heart at level 4 which is impressive on is own, let alone the fact im playing playing master.
</p>
<p>Restoration will be getting worked up as I go along, just not enough gold to buy the right spells but one it hits 70 I wont be goig out of my way to use it unless im nearly dead. But if this build evolves right, nothing will get close enough to hit me.
</p>
<p>I will also be leveling up (but not perticually getting perks for) sneak and 1 handed. The most effective way for you to utilise illusion is to sneak so that makes sence. Once I have the neromage perk I will be going vamp lord.

<h2>            Sonic Adventure 2 HD graphical issues</h2>
                    
<p>I don't know if these are graphical issues for sure or not, but...</p>
<p>I've been playing Sonic Adventure 2 like crazy all weekend, and I noticed a few things aren't looking right (i've played a lot of SA2B on GC in the past that helped me notice :p)</p>
<p>Here are a couple things I've noticed wrong :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-When you collect chaos drives or animals, they scroll to the right side of the screen, and are supposed to be unseen at that point. For some reason, a couple of them still stick out on the screen where you can see them.</p>
<p>-On the level select screen, the part of the map with the ARK has a big nothingness on the right hand side of the screen. Also, I think Final Rush and Cannons Core, are in the wrong places.</p>
<p>-When someone uses a hint computer in two player treasure hunting, it comes out sort of mixed up.</p>
<p>-The title screen (Battle version) is off center. The dark characters are somewhat cut off and the chao are not in the middle.</p>
<p>-The menu screen themes are off center. It's almost like they are zoomed in too far.</p>
<p>-In the last story, two of the scenes for some reason, where really dark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else noticed these things or something similar??? Any ideas on what I should do? I don't want to redownload if it's going to erase my data.</p>

            Sorry your having issues accessing your clubs.&nbsp; You can try restarting your Xbox by holding the power button on your Xbox for 10 seconds.&nbsp; If this doesn't help try removing and readding your profile.&nbsp; Hopefully, that helps.

            For me, apparently, the clubs froze the people inside and wont allow more players to enter. Whenever someone leaves the club, someone can get it. That's what's happening to me... Fix this plz

    <title>Xbox remote function in Microsoft Edge - Can&#39;t move - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> archerac3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox remote function in Microsoft Edge - Can&#39;t move cursor&#47;scroll&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a serious problem with the Remote function from the Xbox App on my android. It's lack of buttons (LB, RB, LT and RT) and Stick movement (Left and Right Sticks) are making it useless with certain apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of these apps is the Microsoft Edge. Due to the lack of a Left/Right stick with the remote I simply cannot move the in-screen cursor or Scroll Up/Down the page! Therefore making this remote function useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to the same limitation I also can't login to my profile and access some settings as I cannot input my 6-Digit profile password for it requires the bumpers and stick! It's an annoyance having to plug in the controller due to the remote limitations, especially
 when microsoft apps themselves are being limited.</p>
<p>I think the remote seriously requires an overhaul as soon as possible!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hey mauriciowaltrick</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to post this up on the Xbox Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually think that this is an excellent idea and would encourage you to post/thumbs up&nbsp;this on the
<a href="https://xboxideas.uservoice.com/?xr=footnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox&nbsp;feedback website</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to have having to plug in your controller, I can see the convenience of having a wired controller as to prevent any sort of wireless feedback, or lag, but have you considered purchasing an Xbox One wireless controller?&nbsp;You can even create your
 own unique <a href="https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/en-US/?xr=shellnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Design Lab</a> controller.&nbsp;You can take a look at this <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories?xr=shellnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
page</a> or even purchase one at your local retailer</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will now convert this thread into a discussion so you can share your ideas with other whom feel the same as you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish you a wonderful day!</p>

<p>Thanks! I'll try posting this as a suggestion in the feedback thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the controller, it works wirelessly as well. But when I have to use the Smartglass app as a remote is either because the controller is charging or because I'm using the controller in the PC while trying to do something in the xbox/big screen without
 having to unplug the controller from the PC and having to restart the whole game/software.</p>

            I'd also recommend the Xbox One media remote as a further possible solution: I've been using it for a while now and while it's a really useful addition especially for when watching media/dvds on the xbox and not wanting to use a controller

<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that we've sent out email notifications to give you an ample time to transfer your contacts before the complete deprecation of the Facebook&nbsp;sign in option. If you were not able to do so, I regret to inform you, but it's no longer possible

                    <p>I really need help figuring out what's wrong with the connection on this laptop/windows 10. The model of my laptop is ASUS and every 2-5 minutes, the connection keeps crashing. However, on my other devices like my iPhone, the connection is still running
 and very good. Can someone please help me figure out the problem as I do have studies coming up soon that will require for me to use my device with the Wi-Fi connection not failing on me every 2-5 minutes.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I had problems with the wifi adapter after the upgrade-- it wouldn't stay connected. and I couldn't figure out why. I went so far as to buy a dongle (USB wifi adapter), but it wouldn't install correctly. So I went into the settings under devices and was
 looking at the dongle under the device manager. Low and behold there is a device that was the INTERNAL wifi adapter--so I checked it. Specifically, I checked for an upgrade, and....BOOOYAH!!! it worked. I get to return the dongle cuz my wifi works again!&nbsp;
 I had no idea that the internal adapter was considered a device!!!</p>
<p>
So check the device manager--you might get lucky!</p>

<h2>            Desktop pictures will not center or tile.</h2>
                    I can't get jpegs saved from a digital camera to my computer to display properly as desktop backgrounds.&nbsp; They will not center or tile and vertical shots stretch out in a distorted manner.&nbsp; They view fine in all programs, such as windows pictures and photoshop.&nbsp;
 I am right-clicking on desktop, then personalize, then destop backgrounds, but the photo display options won't show the entire photo.&nbsp; I am using the basic Vista theme on a one year old Dell laptop (Inspiron 1721) and using Vista home premium.

            You should not be adjusting your screen resolution in order to make a background picture fit. This is extremely bad advice. Your resolution on your laptop is set to its native resolution (or should be) and this is the correct resolution for optimum display.<br />
<br />
You need to right click on the desktop and choose personalize.<br />
<br />
Then choose backgrounds.<br />
<br />
Now choose pictures<br />
<br />
Now click on browse and navigate to the picture you want to use.<br />
<br />
There are three radial buttons underneath, stretch, tile and centre. Choose whichever one you want to use.<br />
<br />
Bear in mind that if you are trying to stretch a normal screen picture to a widescreen resolution, it might look awful.<br />
<br />
<br />
I despair at some of the advice given out by the Microsoft Answers Support Engineers on this forum!

    <title>No Internet Connection on Samsung Galaxy S4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hankfalcon  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Internet Connection on Samsung Galaxy S4</h2>
                    <p>Skype (7.46.0.596) no longer works on my Samsung Galaxy S4 (Android 5.01).</p>
<p>I can log on to my Skype account, but then the message 'No Internet connection' pops up at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Again, this is after signing on to my Skype account on the Galaxy. Browsing and emailing work on the same device, all over a wireless connection. Does anybody have the same issue or any suggestions? I realize both Skype and Android are not on the latest
 version, but Skype is from the Google Play Store and I have it removed and re-installed multiple times without any change in functionality.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Hankfalcon,
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good Day!
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for that information and we apologize for the inconvenience.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please be advised that Skype is no longer supported your Android version 5.01 and your Skype application is already outdated.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This is the reason why you are having an error message of “No Internet connection” because of this.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since Skype has been transitioning from a peer-to-peer architecture to a cloud infrastructure.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Beginning July 1, 2017, Skype users on some platforms will no longer be able to sign in to Skype.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Unsupported Skype enabled devices, and platforms may experience problems with calls and chats, lost or dropped calls and instant messages,
 or could stop working completely</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As of writing the latest version of Skype for Android is 8 and for your Android version Nougat (7.0).
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>With that we strongly suggest for you to update both Skype application and Android version to avoid incompatibility issue.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have further questions about Skype for you Samsung Galaxy do not hesitate to reply on this thread.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you!
</span></span></p>

            <p>Frederick is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also&nbsp;correct this particular problem&nbsp;by opening <em>Task scheduler,</em> clicking on the

<p>Check the boxes* for <em>Standard menus</em>, <em>Standard toolbar</em> &amp;&nbsp;<em>Action pane</em> [which will mean that you will have every checkbox selected apart from
<em>Description bar </em>as that is pretty useless].</p>
<p>
</p><p>*&nbsp; While you are setting the checkboxes, notice that the display changes straightaway so you can see the effect of each setting as you make it [apart from
<em>TaskPad navigation tabs</em>&nbsp;- I do not know what that particular setting is for].</p>

<p>
</p><p>If the tree structure on the left is not visible then open <em>Computer management</em> instead, left-click to select
<em>Task scheduler</em><em>&nbsp;</em>on the left-hand side then right-click on&nbsp;it and use the same procedure from there.&nbsp; That would get things set up in that view and you would then have to use
<em>Computer management</em> every time you wanted to use those particular parts of
<em>Task scheduler</em>.&nbsp; That should be good enough for a few months until you either do a "Repair install" or upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; For a suggested Repair install procedure, see

<p>1) I don't see 'Task Scheduler [Local]'</p>

<p>
</p><p>1) Computer Management</p>
<p>2) Task Scheduler</p>
<p>3) One time only!&nbsp; Pick a generic already scheduled task -- Export it to the Desktop.</p>

<p>5) Modify it at will.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Joystick refuses to work on F S game.</h2>
                    <p>Although recognized in the control panel and the controls are fully functioning when calibrating when trying to use the joystick nothing works.&nbsp;&nbsp; The game is&nbsp; M&nbsp; S&nbsp; Combat Flight Simulator Europe</p>
<p>I have tried a Rawlings U S B nest also without success and three different joysticks.&nbsp; ( using Windows 10 )</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I believe is compatibility one but I can find no way of trying this because this feature is not in properties&nbsp; on the game disc I wondered if anyone has had a similar problem and if so did they cure it .&nbsp; Hope someone has an answer as this is
 old but a very good game, far better than the later version in some sections in my opinion and a pity to have the throw it away.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ken</p>

<p>What is a Rawlings USB nest ? Is your joystick old enough to use a 'game port' connector, and USB nest is a converter,</p>
<p>or is Rawling a flight control system ?</p>
<p>If your joystick has both game port and USB it is not likely to work properly on Win10(I have an old Logitech Wingman joystick like this that didn't even work on Win7 due to lack of driver support).</p>
<p>
</p><p>CFS 2&amp;3 require the older style <em>DInput</em> controllers with driver\profiling software that is compatible with Win10 to
</p>
<p>get full functionality from them (vs the inflexable <em>XInput</em> standard MS has forced on gamers by getting the game
</p>
<p>developers to use XBOX as the default controller configruation). </p>
<p>
</p><p>The plug and play 'XBOX'\XInput controllers don't work with these old games, and unfortunately, many of the
</p>
<p>DInput joysticks don't have Win10 drivers. We are expected to get XInput compatible joysticks, and play only newer gamesand be happy with the limited configruation options provided by the 'plug and play' options XInput provides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- There are a number of dedicated flight sim sites where you may find a fix, or a link to a joystick software that</p>
<p>will allow your perpherials to function fully on Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I never bothered using them, but there are several XBOX controller emulators and similar controller software,
</p>
<p>and you may find something that is useful. Unfortunately Win10's extra security measures, and 'driver signing'
</p>
<p>means a lot of 3rd party software such as this is no longer available on Win10.
</p>
<p>There are a few free controller software, but believe most of the good options have a cost.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By way of example, and I haven't looked closely, so don't know if force feedback will work with this, but -

<p>Thank you very much&nbsp; for your reply, you are the very first person I have contacted who has a grasp of the ins and outs of this problem.&nbsp; Over a period of several years I keep having another go at solving the problem but never had the background explained
 in such detail. before</p>
<p>The&nbsp; USB nest is a USB /gameport converter with a 4 option switch for various types of joystick, (it's&nbsp; on E.bay ) which claims to do the job and demonstrates it does work, but it was with a simulator I did not recognize.&nbsp; I have two versions of joystick
 , M S Sidwinder 2 and a Sidewinder Precision Pro but not a force feedback one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I posted the query I have just found out how to get to a compatibility setting, I was only trying to use the disk and little realized that if i went to the actual file in the computer I could change the setting, well I tried running in&nbsp; XP and 7 &amp;
 8 to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try the two links you suggest and have another try at some of the simulator forums again, but it does seem I am flogging a dead horse !</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I was clinging on was a unique feature it has in Free Flight, the graphics are so minimal they only show landing strips, no buildings even, but you can fly the length and breadth of the UK and the airfield will be where it is supposed to be geographically
 ( well according to the game makers !) and it is quite a challenge to find each one but good practice at navigation the old fashioned way.</p>
<p>The actual game situations are much better but nothing like the later games.&nbsp; But thanks for your trouble it is appreciated, I think I will have one last attempt before binning it .&nbsp; Regards&nbsp; Ken</p>

<p>It looks like you are half lucky being able to calibrate. This should indicate Win10 has installed a suitable driver, so it is odd</p>
<p>the game does not recognise it in the games settings.</p>
<p>I just dragged out the old (but not much used. I bought it not long before Win7, and that was that. ) Logitech Force joystick and</p>
<p>it is recognised by name in Device Manager, but no go with a driver from, disc, via Device Manager, or Control Panel\Calibrate.</p>
<p>CFS2 doesn't recognise it either.</p>
<p>The driver installer on the disc locks up on the first screen regardless of Compatibility settings used on the setup.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>By the look of it, it's only people playing the newer flight sims that have managed to get the Sidewinder 2 working on Win10.</p>
<p>Still not sure how that can work considering the DInput type. <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/acfacfd0-214d-4291-967d-b099cb389e29?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I believe part of the Win10 'vision' is pushing for unified drivers, but this only covers newer hardware, and I expect that may come</p>
<p>with the loss of some user options. <br />
</p>
<p>Yes, the old joysticks and MS wheels suffer the curse of being too well built. Shelved long before their time, most of them.</p>
<p>You may still find a software solution though. DInput does work on Win10 if you can get a suitable driver\software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should still be a few new joysticks with and XInput\DInput switch that will work with Win10 if you are keen enough to buy a new one.</p>
<p>I use a Logitech F310 controller in conjunction with keyboard on the rare occasions I fire up CSF2. The F310 controller has a switch</p>
<p>for both DInput and XInput, so you can run the old games and create custom button profiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you are <em>really</em> keen you could go the dual boot with XP route. </p>
<p>

<p>Thanks BD, you are going to a lot of trouble which I do appreciate.&nbsp; I have saved all your messages into my files so I can study in a bit more in view of all this info you have given me as i am now unsure if it is a game driver software or a joystick driver
 or something related to either that I need,&nbsp; but I will first follow up the two links you gave me and also pursue one or two F S forums and see what drops out !</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have been playing about with Flight Sims for about 25 years, even starting running one&nbsp; on a laptop which in those days was never heard of,&nbsp; but it's still a" boys toy"and at my age of 87 I should know better than to get so deeply involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But keeping active in the mind I think should never be dropped, again many thanks&nbsp;&nbsp; Ken</p>

<p><em>"age of 87 I should know better than to get so deeply involved."</em></p>
<p>- Do try and get\stay involved Ken. With 14 years up on me you're doing well. Everyone I know is a technophobe. Bop till you drop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I started gaming on Nintendo in '90. PC in '04. Early on I didn't think I would like driving games, but along came the Col McRea Dirt
</p>
<p>series rally games (around '06) and I was hooked on driving games. Rally style in particular.
</p>
<p>As with using a good joystick with flight sims, driving games are best played with a good wheel though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current 'sim' favourite is a skiing game...&nbsp; <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/460920/Steep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
--STEEP-- </a>. &nbsp; Unlike flight sims this is one of those easy to pick up, hard to master games</p>
<p>(as are the rally games). Sometimes frustrating, but generally firm but fair. These games do require a machine with a fair bit of grunt though.

<p>Hi BD, well you sound on about the same crazy nut that I am !&nbsp; I have eliminated one fact, i don't think the problem is compatibility because it would engine start, taxi and take off regardless of how I waggled the joystick, before I tried to alter anything
 and as it's the same now with it set to XP.&nbsp; I Have in fact only just started pressing a few keys, can't find the original manual and eventually got to F2 and the keyboard commands popped up&nbsp; , and they all work&nbsp; ! But I could not control flight on the keys
 needed to make any smooth turns etc. it does need a joystick of some sort, so at least that narrows down the search.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>That is an interesting comment about rallying, would a flight sim answer using a wheel, and have you ever used one for that purpose. ?&nbsp; Yes thanks for your encouraging remarks, I am a bit like a dog with a bone I keep gnawing away it it, don't like to admit
 defeat.&nbsp; ken</p>

<p>Hi Ken, Any joystick, controller, or wheel that uses DInput and has a profiling software that is compatible with Win10 can in theory
</p>
<p>be used with the game.</p>
<p>The profiling software is just another keyboard emulator (not unlike the 3rd party options, but specific to the brand you are using)
</p>
<p>that allows you to assign the keystrokes&nbsp; used by the game to&nbsp; whichever button or switch you like on your controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If the buttons on the joystick are registering the desired commands and the stick is not functioning try mapping the</p>
<p>joystick axis to keyboard commands. CFS2 uses number pad keys - 8 for pitch up and 2 for down (or vice-versa). Probably 4&amp;6 for roll .</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- I have thought of having a go using my Logitech G27 wheel with flight sims, but never got around to it because I don't run the
</p>
<p>flight sims much and my game controllers sticks do the job well enough for casual sessions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main issue with the wheel is you cannot push the wheel forward\back for pitch.</p>
<p>My wheel has two 'paddles' on the column (alternatives for gear shift, but can be programmed to whichever function the user wants).</p>
<p>For a flight sim I would probably try to use these for pitch, and the wheel for roll, but while the wheel is analogue the paddles are not,</p>
<p>so they may not be real good for pitch.</p>
<p>The accelerator and break foot controls are analogue and could be used for rudder.</p>
<p>This wheel also has six buttons in the centre, and more buttons on the gear shift console for other functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- A new joystick would be the best option, but if they don't specify a DInput\XInput switch opton you would want to enquire on
</p>
<p>flight sim sites, or the joysticks mfg to find if it has a DInput\XInput switch or is otherwise compatible (by some software magic)</p>
<p>with the CFS games. The Logitech F310 may be a lot cheaper than any joysticks that are available with a D &amp; X switch though.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"don't like to admit defeat"</em></p>
<p>- A prerequisite for gamers. </p>

<p>Hi Gents,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been following this thread with interest and note the predicament Ken is in with the non-functioning stick.&nbsp; &nbsp;I too have a MS Sidewinder (an old one) without Force Feedback and have used it without any hiccups in FSX under Win7 and Win10.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, it seems
 clear that CFS is the culprit here.&nbsp; &nbsp;And at 65 yrs of age, I offer suggestions with trepidation:&nbsp; as what would a young whipper snapper know that you venerable sages don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It hasn't been discussed yet, but can it be assumed that your joystick mappings within CFS are correct and the Sim is taking that information off the joystick and not keyboard and/or mouse?&nbsp; &nbsp;Another option:&nbsp; delete the current joystick mappings, OK, and
 close the window and CFS.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then launch CFS and back into your controller settings and set joystick mappings to default.&nbsp; &nbsp;Click OK, and close window and work the stick in a flight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or else, delete all your controller and keyboard settings and close CFS (of course, it will be a pain to re-map all your special settings, unless you can save the appropriate file before wiping out these settings).&nbsp; &nbsp;Unplug the joystick from the port and
 launch CFS.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then re-plug the joystick and check whether it is recognised in both the Control Panel and CFS.&nbsp; &nbsp;Any difference now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ken, you may have tried all the above, but thought to check, as sometimes the solution can be found in going through the fundamentals.&nbsp; &nbsp;All the best in your endeavour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>
        </p>

<p>Oops... Confession time. I lied...&nbsp; XInput does work with CFS2. I started thinking... 'We'll it's been a long time, and I'd better double check
</p>
<p>with my XBOX 360 controller',&nbsp; and it does work with CSF2. Not as well as the DInput Logi controller though.</p>
<p>The left stick and 'hat' work properly but the two analogue buttons on the shoulder don't want to be mapped to anything in the</p>
<p>games control settings. The right stick also refused to be assigned to anything. However, the Logi F310 will map all buttons to any command, and there are a few commands that work on the right stick axis as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Anyway... Hope Cris's method works for you. If you at least we know that a modern XInput joystick should work with the game... Mostly.</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks BD, this is taking tihngs too far in respect of what you would get at the end of the day for the effort and cost involved I think... but, I managed to pick up an E.mail reply from someone on a CombatSim Forum.&nbsp; This guy says he had the problem but
 transferred certain files from the XP game to the Windows 10, namely Default Panes and Devices CFG and CFG 2.</p>
<p>That's no guarantee it would work in someone else's game so that could be a risk not worth taking unless you were certain of success..</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I came up with another idea, in delving into the loft and looking at all the stuff I had used/discarded etc I found an external hard drive, brand new, never used, I seem to remember I needed more disc space but eventually changed the computer.</p>
<p>I still have a Windows 7 O S installation disc, so why not set that up and run the Flight sims from this drive.</p>
<p>2002,&nbsp; 2004,&nbsp; Combat Sim 11 (Pacific ) and a few add ons from Just fFight such as Battle of Britain flight , Dam Busters and improved airports and scenery discs all all there just waiting to be used again, all ran with windows 7 and XP&nbsp; O&nbsp; S but none with
 F S X&nbsp; but it reopens a lost world if they can be used again !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must first consult a more technical gut that helps me out from time to time when I manage to foul p the whole system, he will be able to tell me if this should work.</p>
<p>I'll keep you posted&nbsp;&nbsp; regards&nbsp;&nbsp; Ken</p>

            Hi Sharon
<br />
<br />Are you able to boot into WIndows?
<br />
<br />1.
<br />If so, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />If you cannot boot into Windows:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            Dave, This may take awhile because I have already had to restart my computer while waiting for your reply. It also take awhile because of my compututer and Win. expertise, or lack thereof.&nbsp; Thank you for your patience. My first question is how to zip a
 file&nbsp; :-(&nbsp;

            Hi SharonFisk2, no problem, don't worry about zipping the file, just upload it to OneDrive in a Web Browser, then right click that file and choose Share - Get Link, Copy Link and post that link here. . .

<br />Machine Check exception code usually means a hardware failure. Is your laptop under warranty?
