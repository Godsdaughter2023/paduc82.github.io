<h2>            Bluetooth Totally Disappeared</h2>
                    <div style="text-align: left"><em><strong>A </strong></em><strong><em>few days ago my Bluetooth Icon disappeared from the taskbar, the notifications area where you turn the Bluetooth on &amp; settings. When you go into settings under devices the heading for Bluetooth
 &amp; Other Devices is still there &amp; it still shows the add a device with the sub-titles of Bluetooth, Wireless Display or Dock &amp; Everything Else but the On &amp; Off switch is not there. So I backed everything up on my computer &amp; went to recovery which I was wanting
 to do anyway &amp; selected Reset this PC and chose the options keep nothing delete everything and then reinstalled Windows 10 Pro. I thought that would take care of the problem but it didn't not. I even went to the manufactures website and downloaded all of the
 drivers including the Bluetooth driver and it still did nothing. I do notice that there is a sub-title called Bluetooth USB in the Device Manger which was never there before but still no Bluetooth anywhere. What do I do now as I am confused why this happened
 and where to go now.&nbsp;</em></strong></div>

            Hey Andre, The System SKU is empty as there is nothing next to it at all. The version I am running is&nbsp;Version&nbsp;10.0.16299 Build 16299. I have had this computer since Sept of 2014 so when it was received it had Windows 8. From there I went to 8.1 , then
 to Windows 10 Home &amp; finally to Windows 10 Pro.

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You should backup your files before downgrading.
<br />Applications will need to be reinstalled.
<br />The custom install will archive your files, so you can recover them from the Windows.old folder - make sure you follow the instructions to the letter. 
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

<h2>            File execution blocked</h2>
                    <p>I had been using a Swiftforth compiler when after the latest update of Windows 10 that happened today.&nbsp; File execution blocked message appears.</p>
<p>It is getting extremely frustrating trying to get things done when Windows 10 decides to block execution of the primary reason I use a computer in the first place.&nbsp; I cannot understand why I have to continuously fight the operating system to do what I want
 to do.&nbsp; What do I need to do to stop this insanity?</p>

<p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most applications and hardware drivers designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10, but there are some older programs that might run poorly or not at all due to compatibility issues. As such, we advise that you run the
<strong>Program Compatibility Troubleshooter</strong>. This tool can automatically detect and resolve some of the most common issues. To do so, kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Enter the name of the program in the search box on the <strong>taskbar</strong>, press and hold (or right-click) the search result, and then select
<strong>Open file location</strong>.</li><li>Press and hold (or right-click) the program, select <strong>Properties</strong>, and then select the
<strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.
<ul>
<li>First, select <strong>Run compatibility troubleshooter</strong> to run the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter. (Note that DPI scaling issues won’t be resolved with the troubleshooter, so refer to the table below for other options.)</li><li>If you’re still experiencing compatibility problems, adjust one or more of the following settings and select
<strong>OK</strong> when you’re done.</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ol>

    <title>High CPU Usage in Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Version 1607 after installing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            High CPU Usage in Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Version 1607  after installing Update KB3150513</h2>
                    <p>I know this questions has previously appeared in various forms but I have tried all the resolutions to no avail. I have run sfc and dism multiple times, tried safe boot etc.) &nbsp;What is happening now is that when the system comes up from power save mode, I
 immediately get the &nbsp;"Network Host Local Service (No network) (4)" &nbsp;process running at 40-50% CPU. &nbsp;I have difficulty making TCP/IP connections from remote machines during this time. &nbsp;Eventually, &nbsp;after an hour or 2, &nbsp;the CPU may die down and things return
 to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all started after update&nbsp;KB3150513 was first installed on 5/23/17. &nbsp;After that first install, I could not get a normal restart to boot correctly. &nbsp; It would come up on a mode where all my installed apps (IDEs, Office Apps, &amp; SW dev tools) would work
 but I could not start any of the system tools (event viewer, device manager, command prompt, etc.). &nbsp; I could boot in safe mode and most stuff worked but networking was severely limited. &nbsp; I called MS but they could not diagnose the problem because they could
 not start the required apps when booting in normal mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then update KB3150513 has been installed an additional 3 times and I can at least boot normally into the condition described above. &nbsp; What I find astounding is that with each&nbsp;KB3150513 update, My Intel graphics driver is being reinstalled. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Its
 not obviously part of the update, or is it? I am not even sure that the version number is different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried calling MS a second time, and this time the technician asked me what system I was running. &nbsp; Its a stock Dell Vostro 200 with 4GB of memory. &nbsp;It has been running W10 64-bit flawlessly since 9/16/16. &nbsp;He told me it was no longer supported citing the
 Dell website which only says its not being tested for W10 compatibility and that the drivers are no longer being supported. &nbsp;Not being tested is not the same thing as will not work. But guess what, the critical drivers, floppy disk, DVD and hard disk are standard
 and supplied by MS, not Dell, and I have a 3rd party &nbsp;PCI Ethernet driver. All seems to be fine. &nbsp;Memory and disk diagnostics all pass. &nbsp;The system works except for the issue above and a number of Service Control Manager timeout errors (7000, 7011) in the
 event log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: &nbsp;I use this machine exclusively for SW development and do not need the Creators Update. &nbsp; All I want is a stable working version of Windows 10.</p>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
<br />
This problem may occur for several reasons. If the task manager shows high CPU usage despite light or no workload, and affects your computer's performance, we suggest that you try the workaround found on this

<p>My system is running with C:\WINDOWS\system32\DRIVERS\(atapi.sys, ataport.sys, pciide.sys and pciidex.sys) . The only hard drive is a Seagate ATA drive. &nbsp; I doubt if this is the problem. &nbsp; When the system is working, it runs as well as can be expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"Network Host Local Service (No network) (4)" &nbsp;process running at 40-50% CPU is running 4 DLLs:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This state occurs right after coming up from sleep mode and lasts up to 30 minutes or more. &nbsp;The system is otherwise idle except for occasional incidental&nbsp;W10 maintenance tasks. &nbsp;During that
 time I cannot make TCP/IP connections to services running on this machine. &nbsp;I suspect there is something wrong with the BFE or Windows Firewall as the event log is showing multiple occurrences of &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>A timeout (30000 milliseconds) was reached while waiting for a transaction response from the BFE service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there are other errors in the event log all having to do with services not starting properly or hanging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it will help I can provide sample event log starting with this mornings resume from sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if I have reached some limit on the number of filters in the BFE or exceptions in the Firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS I also noticed that I cannot start the Windows Firewall command when in this condition.</p>

<p>I think I may have found the culprit. &nbsp; Around 5/23/17 I happened to run a program from TrendMicro called "House Call for Home Networks." &nbsp;At or around this time is when I started having this problem.
</p>
<p>Suspecting "House Call for Home Networks" was the culprit, I uninstalled it, but that did not help.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, noting that the problem described above involved the Firewall (not able to make connections from remote machines), I decided investigate the Firewall more deeply. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that "House Call for Home Networks" had created 4852 inbound rules out a total of 5218 in the Inbound Rules Table. &nbsp;This is seems to be very wrong. &nbsp;I have reported this in detail to TrendMicro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, as of this morning I can't restart the system in question in normal mode as it seems to have gone south after a failed W10 update (possibly the Creators Update) &nbsp;I can start it in Safe Mode, but you can't access the Firewall Advanced UI in
 Safe Mode. &nbsp;I am trying to go back to a working system via a System Restore. Stay tuned. &nbsp; hope I can find a way to remove these entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This afternoon, I managed to launch the Firewall Advanced GUI in Safe mode. You have to run the .exe as administrator from the list of admin tasks not via the UI. I removed all 4852 rules related to House Calls. &nbsp;I wasn't fast. &nbsp; I also had to reinstall
 my graphics driver, but when the system came up there was no high CPU and the remote system connected instantly. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was really ugly. &nbsp; This is so specialized I think the whole tread should be deleted. &nbsp;It won;t help anybody. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the fact that the Windows Firewall allows duplicate entries to be created should be considered a bug. &nbsp;Thee were several minor instances as well.</p>

<p>@fixpertise: You saved my life. I have exactly same issue with windows 10. The problem gone after deleted all rules in windows firewall. For me, I open windows defender Firewall in admin tools, no need to use safe mode.</p>

<p><span>Hi pnkn,</span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In order to troubleshoot the issue better, please provide more information.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>How long have you been experiencing this problem?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Have you recently installed or uninstalled any software or hardware?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Are you experiencing this error while accessing any particular program or application?</span></span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to boot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue persist.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Safe mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly or that might prevent
<span>Windows</span> from starting correctly.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>1.Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the
<strong>Start</strong> button, click the arrow next to the <strong>Lock</strong> button, and then click
<strong>Restart</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do one of the following:
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; press F8 before the
<span>Windows</span> logo appears. If the <span>Windows</span> logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows</span></span><span> logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; start in safe mode, and then press F8.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the
<strong>Advanced Boot Options</strong> screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words
<strong>Safe Mode </strong>in the corners of the display. To exit safe mode, restart&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your computer and let
<span>Windows</span> start normally.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

    <title>Folder contents not copying on the first try in Win10 to a NAS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisdziewior  say:</h3>
<h2>            Folder contents not copying on the first try in Win10 to a NAS</h2>
                    <p>There may have been a post relating to this, but I haven't seen an answer that resolves the issue. Here is a work around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my network there is a Win10/64 laptop and a GigaNAS storage device. I have full RW permission to use the NAS. Having a folder open on the NAS drive, I want to copy a folder and it's contents to the NAS from the Win10 laptop. I drag a folder to the open
 NAS drive window, and it will create a folder in the NAS with the same name, but the contents are not copied. It is just an empty folder of the same name. However, if I drag that same folder a 2nd time to to the NAS drive after the empty folder was created,
 it will then copy the contents of the folder including it's sub-folders, but not the sub-folders contents. Again the empty folder must exist before it's contents are copied. So, in essences, before the contents of any folder is copied, the empty folder of
 the same name must exist on the destination NAS drive.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Some tests that I have tried is using copy and paste instead of dragging, and it still produces the same results which require a second paste before it copies the contents of a folder.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The has worked properly under on my old laptop running Win7/64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone found a fix for this?</p>
<p>

I tried using the cmd console as you suggested. I did an xcopy with the /S parameter and successfully copied a folder hierarchy to a mapped drive. So I started thinking, maybe it needed to be a mapped drive. I had only used a open folder on the NAS and never
 mapped a drive letter to it. However there was no luck with that. I dragged a folder to the newly mapped N: drive, and it still only created an empty folder on mapped NAS drive.&nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>If xcopy.exe or robocopy.exe are able to copy the source folder structure to the target folder, complete with files then, I can think of two reasons for the failure of File Explorer to do the same thing:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a bug in the Windows 10 File Explorer when dealing with NAS devices</li><li>The Windows 10 machines you use have a damaged version of File Explorer</li></ul>
<p>If this was my problem then I would repeat the tests, using a machine that from outside my usual environment or a machine that runs a factory version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To walk around the problem you could create a new right-click context menu item. When clicked it would invoke robocopy.exe with appropriate command line arguments.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Both the win10 machines that I have tried this with are new HP Envy N7 series laptops with fresh factory OS Win10/64 home edition on them. Only the requested windows updates have been done on them. I doubt that that file explorer is damaged on then, and
 tend to believe that there is a bug in win10, which I was hoping would be looked into by MS, by giving an accurate description of the problem and a reproducible fail case. I think this is a pretty big issue if this is a wide spread problem, and I suspect it
 is. I also believe that this may have started earlier that win10, as I have read some discussions of similar failures in the win8 environment, although since I am not running any win8 PCs, I can not prove this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will build another PC with win10 and see if this is also the case on generic/other brand machines, and not just limited to HP's OS tweaking. The work you suggest is fine for myself, but the others using the systems that are not so computer savvy. Hopefully
 we will see a real fix to this issue.</p>
<p>Thank you for your efforts.</p>

<p>I am still testing, but since Windows 10 has done an update, it is working somewhat. What I mean by that, is that it is copying most (or at last some of the time) the entire directory structure. It still on occasion only copies the primary folder without
 it's contents. Keep in mind that this was 100% reliable in Windows 7. In any regard, I am still testing to try to provide something reproducible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, it has updated to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows 10 (Home)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 1703</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 error 0xc0000225</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I know this may have been posted a few times but couldn't find anything that could help me with this problem.</p>
<p>I just did an update on my computer (Acer Aspire E1-530g) and when it restarted I got on a blue screen with the following message:
</p>
<p>"A required device isn't connected or can't be accessed </p>
<p>Error code: 0xc0000225"</p>
<p>
</p><p>After looking for a solution I was told to look for an .iso of the Windows 8 recovery&nbsp; since I can't find my disk anymore. But thing is I have no idea where to find one or how to use it on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also don't have access to anything except for the setup utility which pops up when I press esape. I tried to reconfigure the default settings but nothing happened in the end, plus I can't access the advanced options menu either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advandce for any help you might give me.</p>

<p>I've tried uninstalling and reinstailling the game bit I continue to get this error message.</p>
<p>Can anyone offer a suggestion to remedy???</p>

                    <p>My Surface Pro 4 has stopped recognizing my external monitor - Windows 10 won't detect the monitor when I connect the computer through the Microsoft Surface Dock.&nbsp; But when I plug the HDMI cable directly into the Surface Pro 4, it detects the monitor and
 will duplicate the displays.&nbsp; But up to this morning it worked fine through the Dock.&nbsp; What do I do?</p>

            <p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only changes to the computer were the recent set of updates from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try the suggestions in the post you refer to, which I read before I made the Community post.&nbsp; Nothing worked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most importantly, none of them seem to relate to the situation I am in - it worked for several weeks, then stopped. What could cause this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I went through the entire dock trouble shooting protocol and it finally reset and started working again after unplugging and replugging the dock power.</p>

    <title>I&#39;m so confused&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            I&#39;m so confused&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So apparently I am the only halo fan at my School now...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just had an interesting conversation at school today, my friend asked me to join his game battles team for Black ops. I declined stating I dislike Call of Duty, then asked him how do you play competitively on a game that takes no skill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is when my 6 friends and my English Teacher said that Halo is a skilless game that anyone can be good at.</p>
<p>Apparently:</p>
<p>1) Halo is a Childish game.</p>
<p>2)It is easier to kill people because the Reticule is big and you can aim from the hip.</p>
<p>3) Halo games never change and are always the same (lol irony)</p>
<p>From what I understand from my personal expiernce, The Halo Series takes more skill to be good at. You cant just play for the first time and do good because you spawn with a gun that over powers the rest. Call of Duty is nothing more than who fires the first
 bullet.</p>
<p>Anyone here have a better explanation as to why Halo takes no skill? Or are my friends just stupid (like I assume)</p>
<p>(I am not trying to start a HALO vs COD thread)</p>

<p>Sorry to say but your friends don't seem to know much about skills in video games.</p>
<p>1)Halo is not a Childish game. </p>
<p>2)Reticule being bigger makes it harder to shoot someone. If I remember right you can aim from the hip in CoD. Which I am fairly all the 1337 children call "No-Scoping"</p>
<p>3)Halo games do take more skill.</p>

<p>Sounds like you need to school some of your friends by totally destroying them at Reach and then ask them if a little skill would have made a difference. How does starting off with a better weapon than the competition and not being matched up by skill make
 you skillful? Of course you're going to do better than the lower ranks you pillocks. (sorry, totally watching Top Gear at the moment)</p>

<p>so, you dislike COD, but it's your second most recently played game? Anyways, I like Halo and COD equally, and I'd say they both take skill. Spartans can fire from the hip because they're strong enough that recoil doesn't really affect their aim. It's not
 childish. 1, It's not the same game any more than COD, and 2, what's wrong with making 2+ games similar, if they're both good?</p>

<p>It's sad, but Call of Duty is the new "cool" game that all the kids want. Much like Halo was during Halo 2 (It really died off for everyone I know before 3... getting older sucks).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call of Duty's not a skill-less game per se, just very noob friendly in many aspects. If you have restricted settings in it it is actually decently competitive experience. But the extreme majority just use the default settings and it really is so easy to
 dominate at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Halo's time has come and passed. It's very likely that it will never have the top spot again, but that's fine! The experiences I have had and continue to have with the game will last a lifetime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing they could do to really up the ante and make the game get away from its "little kid" roots and make the next game have a much, much darker storyline. Like you really get to see the destruction and death involved in war. One part from the Reach
 campaign that stands out is when you're in the Falcon riding along and shooting Banshees down, and you hear on your radio about a Civilian transport getting shot down, then watch it explode in flames.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seriously, I loved the whole Halo trilogy's storyline but it was more Space Opera and not enough violence. War is a gritty, terrible thing. They need to bring the emotion back!</p>

<p>whatever. halo does take some skill. just not as much as you might think. take infection games for example. all it takes is paying attention to what paths to take to completely surprise the enemy humans once you have been zombified. or even capturing the
 flag, knowing the best places to go to surprise the enemy totally helps if you dont have more skill than your opponents. i used to suck more at infection games but since i started figuring out how to surprise enemy humans in certain maps, my kills have been
 steadily improving. i aint great, but i'm getting much better. hey guys...theres a way to surprise those human chumps who are camped out in the central area on the cage map...and it works 90% of the time</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Here is advice from HP Community Forums.</p>
<p><a href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Web-Printing-Software/My-printer-is-offline-how-do-I-get-it-back-on-line/td-p/917549" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Web-Printing-Software/My-printer-is-offline-how-do-I-get-it-back-on-line/td-p/917549</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Click on&nbsp;Start&nbsp;&gt; go to Control Panel &gt; choose Printers &gt; Right Click on your printer and make sure that there is no check mark on the “Use Printer Offline” option.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This should put your printer back online. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a worst scenario, uninstall then reinstall your Printer using the Drivers and information at this HP website.</p>
<p>Put in your Printer Model number there for that information <strong>and troubleshooting steps</strong> for it.</p>

Thanks, gob0nkers for the reply! But I have already visited that thread. I don't want to do that what's in the thread. It'll take a long time. I just want a quick process. But thanks anyway. If you know any other solution then please reply back. :(

    <title>Locked out of Xbox live account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mjwells1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locked out of Xbox live account</h2>
                    Hi guys, so i need some serious help. I created an xbox live account back on my xbox 360 way back in December of 2008. Since then i've lost access to the orginal email I used to log into the account with. My debit card number has also changed as well as
 my physical address. I also changed my gamer tag three or four times. I used the account until about 2013 or 2014. Unfortunately&nbsp; I forgot the password and no one at Microsoft will allow me access to the account. Most of the games I bought digitally for my
 old 360 are now backwards compatible for xbone so I'd really like to have the account back. Any advice? I've tried calling several times.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Here is the only way that you can do this and this will ONLY work if you have access to any console that profile has been signed into previously if not you will have to continue to fill out the account recovery form till you get enough questions correct
 or remember the password for the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to account.live.com/acsr and try to recover the account when it tries to send a code to your security proof click that you dont have any of these it will then ask for an alternate email that you do have access to will then send a verification code
 to that email once you type that email in it will start asking you questions about your account. (from what it sounds like you may have already done this step)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The account recovery team will then look at your answers and if you provided enough of them correctly they will send a link to that alternate email allowing you to reset the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. If you do not answer enough correctly the account recovery team will send you an email saying this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. If you get the email saying you have not provided enough info you can contact xbox support (if you still have access to a console that profile was signed into previously) and give them a reference number off the bottom of that email and some more info
 about the account and the console it was on previously and they will escalate it up to their escalations team that will then look at those answers and if enough of them are correct then they will send you a link to reset your password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Now remember xbox support will ONLY be able to help you if you have access to a console still that this profile was on previously.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>They can be reached by going to support.xbox.com/contact-us</p>

    <title>New Skype issues syncing&#47;updating conversations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> art_guy  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Skype issues syncing&#47;updating conversations</h2>
                    <p>Guys, the new Skype is buggy as hell. I have a group (seems to be JUST that group, for some reason, and it's a pretty huge one, so that might or might not have something to do with the actual issue) in which I'm displayed with my EMAIL address every time
 I type (hotmail email) instead of my Skype name. And I know they should be the same thing, but in this case, they just aren't. And NO, I did NOT log in using my email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And in order to see what the others said, I need to do a refresh command every second. This is really, really annoying as you can imagine. If you need more info, please, let me know.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The old "classic" version is not much better either, at least in this regard. With that version, I need to log out and log back in, in order to be able to write in that group. First time I log in and enter that group I appear as if I'm not a member of that
 group and I can't type. After logging out and back in I CAN finally type.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And with this version, I am recognised with my Skype ID instead of email (which, to me, is actually the way it should be). Still, with that version TOO I can't see what people are saying until I'm doing a Log out and log in every few seconds (since there
 is no refresh chat option with the old version, and even if there were, it's still not ok). This is not how the app should behave. And it makes it really, REALLY frustrating to use. Not to mention it gives the user a really crappy user experience. This is
 not Instant Messaging. This is messaging on demand. And it sucks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This started almost a month ago when I logged in to check out my email on Microsoft's site. And apparently, once you log into your EMAIL, you're also automatically logged into SKYPE. Because why not? Who wouldn't want to have all the Skype chats popping
 around when all they want to do is read their freaking emails?! Preferably in silence!</p>
<p>Also, what's even more annoying is that there is no option to log out of Skype only. You can log out of everything, including mail, or stay logged in to everything, including Skype. Come on, people! Seriously?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I'm not here to comment on the email website. But I thought you should know, since I'm pretty sure this is when everything started to go south. So it might help with this issue, as well.</p>

<p>Hi Karen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nice to meet you. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alright, let's try to fix this, cause it's really annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll take each of the things you mentioned in your previous post and try to answer them to the best of my knowledge, where applicable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a Mac user, and even though I occasionally use Windows, too, it's pretty rare, so I'd like to focus my energy on trying to troubleshoot (and possibly fix) the Mac issues first. I'm pretty sure that, once those will be fixed, everything will be fine with
 the Windows version, too. No matter which one (Classic or...can I call it Modern? Right, the new one. :) ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right. So let's take them one by one:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">MacOS -&gt; Modern Skype version: 8.16.0.4</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">MacOS -&gt; Classic Skype version: 7.59.37</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I tried them both. With similar results. Basically the chat is not updating until I:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">1. for Modern Skype -&gt; do a /refresh chat or /refresh all command</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2. for Classic Skype -&gt; do a Log Out &amp; Log In.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not the admin, nor the creator of the group. I'm just a user in a group. Regular user.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">But I did ask the admin to remove me from the group and add me back in. And, it appeared as if I was removed. But I'm still in the group. He also tried to add me and..well, no change. Either I wasn't removed in the first place, or..I
 don't know. Another syncing issue? Maybe you get more from this than I do. To me it's confusing as fork. It makes no sense whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I also tried to quit the group myself and...no feedback, no change, no nothing. It would just take the command and...do thing with it. No error, but also, no quitting either. That's one of the most frustrating things. If I was removed
 from the group, then why am i still in the group? If I'm not in the group, why do I keep receiving notifications from the group? If I quit the group myself, why am I still in the group? If I successfully quit the group (which it doesn't look like it happened),
 why am I still in the group? And if it didn't quit the group, then why don't I have an error to tell me that the operation was unsuccessful and give me some clues as to why it was unsuccessful?</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Too many questions? :)) I'm sorry. I apologise. But this is incredibly confusing to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I'm not aware of which exact versions are the others using (as I said, it's a pretty big group). But, one thing I know for sure, most of that group is running Skype for Windows. And another thing that's for sure, one of the admins is running the
 Classic version of Skype for Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">So, as you said, this might also contribute to the issue.<br />
</p>
<p>As for the up to date check...Uhm, I'm not sure if I should be able to do that command, as a regular user in the group (probably yes), but when I do that command in the group (I'm currently on the "Modern" Skype, so that's what I used to try that command),
 I get the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">"Invalid command. Please try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, one other thing to mention is that this group is pretty old. And of course, I can't just ask people to create a new one, just for me. Especially since I'm just a user in the group. I have no superpower. :))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I'm thinking we might need to debug this live, somehow, if possible. Cause it might be pretty hard to do it otherwise. And possibly time consuming too.
</p>
<p>I'm aware of the fact that I might be one of the very few people to encounter this issue, but I don't know what else to do. Seriously. And I DO need that group to work like clockwork. And it doesn't. I feel like I already tried everything I knew. With no
 result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, if we manage to fix this for the Mac Skype client (although I'm not sure it's actually a client side bug, but who knows, I might be wrong) then I'll try the other versions, too. Cause the Android version has the same issue. Interestingly enough,
 the iOS one doesn't. Or at least not anymore...</p>
<p>
</p><p>That one (the iOS one) used to have a very unique issue: I was getting notifications from that group, but I had no actual group in my Skype app. That group was simply missing. It was not available with Search, nothing. But I was getting notifications from
 it. And clicking the notifications would always redirect me to the last conversation, whichever that might be. So it wouldn't somehow open that chat anyway. Just...bounce back to the last conversation. :))</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry I included so many details, not all of them related to Skype for Mac. I don't want to go off-topic. But at the same time, I don't know which of the details I gave you could actually help you fix the issue. As I said, my main goal here right now
 is to fix the Mac version since that's what I'm using the most often. But, if it helps, I might open a new topic for the mobile versions too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, as I said, that might not be necessary anymore, if we manage to fix it for all clients.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Waiting for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if I can help with any other information, please, don't hesitate to tell me. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Radu</p>

<p>Thank you for the response and additional details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue happens on both Skype versions 7.59.37 and 8.16.0.4, yes, there might be a synching issue. But to further check on this, kindly try these troubleshooting steps:</p>
<ul>

<p>
</p><p>Check if there are any changes on the group chat, if there's none, please let me know.</p>

<p>Hi Karen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will do. And I'll come back to you as soon as I have more info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One quick question (just so we don't have to redo the whole thing): do you want me to try a specific version (such as the Classic one or the new one) in particular? From my personal experience, it won't make much of a difference. The behaviour is slightly
 different, in the sense that, for one I need to log out, for the other one, I can do a refresh command, but the actual issue is the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aaand I suppose the development team would rather fix a build that's currently the newest one and still under development, and hopefully the only one in the future, than the old one. I mean, that's usually how it works. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my guess is that the best choice would be to try the new one. But just for the sake of efficiency (and so we don't have to redo the whole thing later on), it would be good to know if you want me to try one version in particular. If not, I'll just use
 the newest one and that's it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I'll try to log out of all the devices, uninstall, restart, reinstall, and log back in one at a time and let you know if that makes any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help so far. :)</p>

<p>Sorry for the confusion,</p>

</p><p>Kindly apply the steps on the new Skype version. If you will uninstall the classic Skype, you may not be able to reinstall it back. All older Skype versions were removed on the download page link due to an installer issue.</p>

</p><p>I'll wait for your updates.</p>

<p>Hi Karen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, reinstalling the Classic version won't be a problem since I've got the installer on my Desktop. :) But anyway, let's focus on the new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tested this...and sadly the issue still occurs (and no, I'm not logged in on another device). The messages still appear as if they were sent from my email address (the email is displayed instead of the Skype ID) and I still don't see the replies until
 I do a refresh command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyway, please, let me know your thoughts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Radu</p>
        </p>
