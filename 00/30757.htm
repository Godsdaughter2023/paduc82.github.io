            <p>Hi KKS,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are using an external hard drive of a large capacity for taking the backup using the “<strong><em>Windows 7 File Recovery</em></strong>” feature in Windows 8, then that could be the reason why you get this error. I would like to inform you that a
 recovery media for Windows 8 operating system cannot be created in a drive of large capacity. It can only be created in a DVD or a pen drive of 3-4 GB storage capacity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I would suggest you to check if the Volume Shadow Copy service (VSS) is running properly. To do so, try the following steps:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a. Press Windows logo key + X&nbsp;and click
<strong>Run</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. Type <strong>services.msc
</strong>in the search box, click <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
c. On the Services window,&nbsp;double-click on the <strong>Volume Shadow Copy </strong>
service.<br />
d. Check if the VSS service is <strong>Started</strong> set to <strong>Automatic</strong>.&nbsp;If not, please change to this status.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e. Try to perform Backup again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In addition to that, I would also like to inform you that the System Backup feature has been replaced with File History in Windows 8. Thus, you may also use this feature to take the back up of your files on the computer. You may
 refer to these articles for more information about&nbsp;<strong><em>File History</em></strong>.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Version 1607 Sysprep Succeeds with Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> art vandelay 14  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Version 1607 Sysprep Succeeds with Error setupdigetclassdevs failed with error 0</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have an open case with Microsoft regarding this issue. &nbsp;Currently I have had four techs remote control my multiple computers, to continue having errors with sysprep, although it does succeed for me every time. &nbsp;I have gone through all suggested
 documents from Microsoft, and have googled all suggestions that are available from Google. &nbsp;What I am really wondering, are people who are having sysprep succeed also receiving this error message on Windows 10 Version 1607? &nbsp;Error: SYSPRP setupdigetclassdevs
 failed with error 0 in the C:\Windows\system32\sysprep\setuperr.log&nbsp;</p>
<p>I receive the error when you can first access the cmdprompt using Shift + F10 during sysprep phase, that is the soonest I can actually verify it is there. &nbsp;I have never been able to get sysprep to succeed without generating that error in the setuperr.log...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried completely different physical laptops (Dell and HP), hard drives etc. &nbsp;I will list all the steps I have attempted, note that I have done this so many times I have tried with and without some of these steps, overall I would say Windows 10 has
 been redone at least about 35 times with the same sysprep success and setuperr.log error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Disable tiledatamodelsvc - I set the registry service start value to 4 for disabled and restart computer, this is the only actual way to keep the service disabled. &nbsp;Powershell does not actually keep the service stopped, this service is always disabled
 every single time I have attempted sysprep, so I don't want to hear any mention of this service that is NOT causing my problem at all.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Disable Windows Defender, and any other unnecessary services. &nbsp;Things such as windows update, firewall, security center etc. I have attempted to stop them right before running sysprep. &nbsp;Nothing has made any difference, I have tried at least five different
 combinations of disabling services with no changes.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Never connect to the internet.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Never join the computer to a domain.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Try safe mode, sysprep does not even work on Windows 10 in version 1607 period, although a tech recommended trying this.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;Repair system files in case the internet went out during the download, this was done multiple times and did not help anything, since it was not the problem. &nbsp;I am just confirming this was verified.</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;Redownload Windows 10 ISO file and repack it to the USB stick to verify it was not missing any files, check all system files again and verify windows does not need repairing. &nbsp;This of course did absolutely nothing once again, this is the first thing
 each tech has recommended, so please stop giving the same poor advice.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;Delete all local user accounts after running sysprep into audit mode, then use answer file to create local user to avoid the Windows 10 sysprep loop that inevitably happen without answer file. &nbsp;Sysprep still succeeds with the same error, setupdigetclassdevs
 failed with error 0.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;Delete Windows store apps recommended by Microsoft, but be careful not to remove too many apps as this can also cause issues. &nbsp;Keeping the computer disconnected from internet is the best way to verify nothing is automatically installed, and I have tried
 removing many apps, as well as not removing that many all with the exact same sysprep success and error message. &nbsp;Any suggestion available on the internet was tried for store apps, all with the exact same sysprep success and error message.</p>
<p>10. &nbsp;Also I have heard once the error setupdigetclassdevs failed with error 0 shows up once, it will always continues to show up in following sysprep attempts. &nbsp;Every time I say I receive the error, it is after completely reinstalling Windows every time.
 &nbsp;Like I said Windows 10 has been repaired, and even completely redownloaded multiple times now and the USB media recreated each time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am not sure if the error message I receive is something to even be concerned about, nobody at Microsoft is able to tell me a single thing about what it means. &nbsp;They have so far mentioned nothing but unhelpful suggestions. &nbsp;Windows 10 version 1607 sysprep
 does not work from the initial release on any computers, with completely clean installs performed every single time, and all Microsoft recommendations being performed. &nbsp;I will start installing this into a VM just to further prove it's not my multiple physical
 laptops all having the same exact identical issue. &nbsp;Has there been a single person able to get Windows 10 Version 1607 to sysprep a clean installation, with all necessary services etc. disabled, without receiving the error message SYSPRP setupdigetclassdevs
 failed with error 0? &nbsp;I would like to hear what tests have shown Windows 10 Version 1607 has even ran a successful sysprep operation without generating that error, because my testing has shown that is absolutely impossible.</p>

            <p>I have just replicated this same issue once again to Windows 10 Version 1607 installed on a VM. &nbsp;The last Microsoft tech tried arguing that it was related to physical hardware, that is completely inaccurate as it happens on VM's also. &nbsp;I did also try the
 mode:VM with the sysprep command. &nbsp;Every one of their support members blames the most unlikely issues for absolutely every issue that their coders caused when developing the OS. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never experienced a vendor continue to insist that they don't have any issues with Windows 10 Version 1607 sysprep. &nbsp;What will they say it is the result of next? &nbsp;I can get sysprep to succeed, but it generates the error SYSPRP setupdigetclassdevs
 failed with error 0 every single time, can someone even tell me what this even means? &nbsp;This happens on any kind of physical hardware, Dell, HP, and even on VM's now. &nbsp;Installation has been redownload and recreated completely. &nbsp;Microsoft you need to actually
 address your issues rather than keep telling your techs to blame every single customer's setup. &nbsp;I have never worked with so many inexperienced technicians who weren't able to give me a single piece of advice. &nbsp;Not a single suggestion from Microsoft has gotten
 me any further, so it is making me wonder why I am even talking to them at all anymore?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I need to just start posting blogs everywhere, documenting the exact issue and showing Microsoft's refusal to stand behind and fix their products that didn't work correctly to begin with.</p>

            Thanks for posting this. I thought i was the only one that was having this issue and have been trying everything under the sun to get this to prep clean. Your steps are exactly what i have been doing to make this work and failing. Was going to open a ticket
 with MS to see if I get any additional help, but is sounds like I may not. &nbsp;I will keep you posted if I hear anything different.&nbsp;

 the&nbsp;</span><strong>installation media</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;and restart your&nbsp;</span><strong>computer</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;so that&nbsp;</span><strong>windows</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">starts
 normally. Then, insert the&nbsp;</span><strong>installation media</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;and restart the upgrade. (Do not select Icustom [advanced] to perform an upgrade Icustom [advanced] installs a new copy of&nbsp;</span><strong>windows</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;and
 deletes your programs and settings.), and I took it to frys a day ago because I couldn't see anything on my display, and he told me he tried installing windows via usb, just to make sure it worked which it did he took it back off I believe he wasn't suppose
 to intall it just diagnose it , so I don't know what's wrong, or how to go around that message erro, thanks for the help.</span>

<h2>            Ayuda con compra de puntos</h2>
                    
<p>Hola, bueno pues desde ayer intente comprar 6000 puntos de Xbox Live, lo intente directo en la consola y tambien por medio de la computadora y no me lo permite, ya hable con el proveedor de la tarjeta y dice que no hay ningun problema con la tarjeta, que
 esta activada y no excede el limite. Con esta tarjeta compre mi membresia Gold de 1 año y tambien he comprado una menor cantidad de puntos como 2000.
</p>
<p>Tambien al intentar entrar a la pestaña de Cuentas en xbox.com me aparece el mensaje: Oh, oh... Eso no debería haber ocurrido.</p>
<p>Quisiera saber si podrian ayudarme y decirme cual podria ser el problema con la compra de puntos y con la pestaña de cuentas, para poder desactivar la tarjeta si sigue sin funcioinar.</p>
<p>Gracias.</p>

<h2>            System Image Recovery - Can&#39;t find System Image</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to restore a backup system image to my repaired PC.&nbsp; It is wiped clean.&nbsp; I have the "Repair Disc Windows 7 64 Bit" that I created in Windows 7.&nbsp; Using Windows 7 Backup I have a system image backup on an external WD Essentiasl 1TB USB Hard&nbsp;Drive.</p>
<p>I insert the Repair Disc and start the system.&nbsp; Get to System Recoevery Options.&nbsp; I have the external Hard Disk with the system backup image connected.&nbsp; Select System Image Recovery option.&nbsp; Says "Windows cannot find a system image on this computer.&nbsp; Attach
 the backup hard disk or insert the final DVD from a bckup set and click retry.&nbsp; Alternatively, close this dialog for more options.&nbsp; Retry gives me the same message.&nbsp; Tried starting with drive attached, not attached, same result.&nbsp; Click cancel.</p>
<p>Next option selected is "Select a system image."&nbsp; No system image listed.&nbsp; Hit refresh, still nothing.&nbsp; Top of screen says "Click Advanced to add a network location or install a driver for a backup device if it does not show up in the list below."&nbsp; I click
 on the Advanced tab.&nbsp; Option to "Search for a system image on the network" or "Install a driver."&nbsp; I select install a driver.&nbsp; Find the right driver for the WD Essential hard drive (disk.sys and partmgr.sys) and when I click on them I get "The specified location
 does not contain information about your hardware."&nbsp; Click OK.&nbsp; Can't find how to load these drivers I am being asked for.</p>
<p>Funny thing is that on the screen where I search for driver I can see the WD Essential Hard Drive connected to the system.&nbsp; I can also see the system image files but when I click on them I get the same error message, "The specified location does not contain
 information about your hardware."</p>
<p>Please HELP.&nbsp; This is very frustrating!!!</p>

<p>While in Repair Mode, you have an option to open a Command Prompt. From there try the following commands:</p>
<p>Mountvol<br />
(This command will show you all available drives, including your external disk)</p>
<p>dir Q:<br />
(Replace Q: with one drive letter at a time from the letters that the mountvol command showed you, e.g.<br />
dir D:<br />
dir E:<br />
etc.<br />
until you see a folder "WindowsImageBackup" on the screen. Let's assume it is F:\WindowsImageBackup.</p>
<p>dir F:\WindowsImageBackup /s<br />
(This command should show you the contents of the image folder, with files totalling more than 10 GBytes)</p>
<p>Now perhaps this image folder is missing, incomplete or inaccessible.</p>
<p>I have to add that I am disappointed with the native imaging facility under Windows 7. It is temperamental and its functionality is extremely limited. I recently bought myself a copy of Acronis TrueImage 10 and its is to the Windows imaging tool like a fully
 functional motor cycle is to a child's tricycle. Other brand imaging tools are just as functional - just make sure that they are certified for Windows 7.</p>

<h2>            Surface Book &#47; Laptop Keyboard Layout -- How to Reassign Function Keys&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I find the surface book keyboard layout to be very cumbersome to use given that the function keys are shared with other important keys such as page up / page down and home / end.&nbsp; This is a real problem for users who make use of windows keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In excel for example, ctrl + pg. up/down is the best way to navigate between sheets without a mouse and shift + F11 is a fast way to insert a new sheet. Because page down and F11 are the same key, I now have to hit the function key before adding a new sheet
 and then remember to turn it back it off so that I can use pg. up / down to navigate again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another frequently used shortcut is alternating between esc. and F2 as you arrow around the sheet to quickly display formula links. Esc + F2 and ctrl pg. up/down are two of the most frequently used keyboard shortcuts in excel and the surface book keyboard
 user must constantly switch the function key on and off to use them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to natively reverse the function order of individual function keys such that page up (f10) / down (f11) act as page up /down while the rest of the function keys act as function keys?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I consider this to be a pretty big design flaw. MS hardware should integrate seamlessly with MS software and this is clearly not the case here.&nbsp;</p>

            I use an app called SharpKeys. &nbsp; I learned about it from one of Scott Hanselman's blogs. &nbsp; It essentially allows you to remap any key combination on the keyboard. &nbsp; I made the right Alt key the PgDn key, for example, because my preference is to keep the
 function keys active.

            Even though there is no dock for the RT class tablets (Surface RT and Surface 2), you can somewhat create one yourself by getting the video adapter and a USB hub (more of a port replicator).
<div><br />
<div>Those two items would cost about $50.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Maybe not a fancy docking station but a solution to using the tablet as a desktop.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There are no plans for a docking station for the RT models.</div>

    <title>Solving the endless Windows Update problem for already installed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Solving the endless Windows Update problem for already installed updates &#40;KB979909, KB982168, KB974417&#41; and most likely any other update.</h2>
                    
<p>OK, I contacted MS via their 1-800 number regarding the problem I was having with Windows Update.</p>
<p>Basically, Windows Update kept popping the shield up on the taskbar nagging me to install updates that had already been successfully installed (KB979909, KB982168, KB974417 - in my case, but I'll bet that this will work on any updates.)</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am using Windows XP Pro and this procedure works flawlessy. I take no responsibility for you trying this on a Windows XP machine if you aren't remotely tech savvy with a computer or if you try it with any other MS operating system.</p>
<p>On to the fix...</p>
<p>If Windows keeps bugging you to install updates that have already been installed successfully, you need to rename these directories:</p>
<p>Windows/SoftwareDistribution<br />
Windows/System32/CatRoot<br />
Windows/System32/Catroot2</p>
<p>Just rename them with a .old extension tacked on to the end of their names.</p>
<p>Access will be denied for renaming them, so you need to perform these steps:</p>
<p>From the Start menu select Run</p>
<p>Type SERVICES.MSC and then hit the ENTER key</p>
<p>From the list of services in the newly opened window, Stop these services one at a time by selecting them from the list and clicking on the STOP icon at the top of the window:</p>
<p>Automatic Updates<br />
Background Intelligent Transfer Service<br />
Cryptographic Services</p>
<p>Now you can rename the directories listed above so that in the end you will have these new directories created (which are just the old ones renamed):</p>
<p>Windows/SoftwareDistribution.old<br />
Windows/System32/CatRoot.old<br />
Windows/System32/CatRoot2.old</p>
<p>Go to Windows Update via Internet Explorer and hide the updates that keep recurring by selecting "Don't show this update anymore", or something to that effect, for each of the updates. Windows Update will still warn you that you have hidden critical updates,
 but the desktop won't bug you about them anymore.</p>
<p>Reboot the computer and the renamed&nbsp;directories will be recreated.</p>
<p>Supposedly, MS is working on this issue, but this is a workaround that solves the issue for now.</p>

            I tried both Bogey1962 as well as PABear's suggested steps, but even though&nbsp;both proposals do eventually stop the recurring update requests, both do not provide a definitive solution.&nbsp;No matter which&nbsp;of the two options I try, I&nbsp;end up&nbsp;having Windows Update
 telling me to install 'umbrella' Security Update <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/951847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB951847</a>&nbsp;prior to install KB979909, KB982168 and&nbsp;KB974417, otherwise these will not be installed. But..&nbsp;KB951847 has also a notorious history in failing to install properly; any search engine can tell you that.

<blockquote>This same thing happened to my PC but only when I have Nero 10 installed on my PC is it possible that you have Nero 10 also.</blockquote>
<p>No, that's not an issue. There's no other software from this maker (<em>Ahead</em> ) on the pc either.</p>
<p>@ PA Bear: my problem is exacly similar to the original one, described by Bogey1962, so why should I start up a new thread? Frankly spoken, in 15 years of surfing the internet this is my very first time I was told<strong>it seems to be useless</strong> to
 UTFS and <strong>it's apparently no longer credible</strong>to hook on to an existing and highly relevant thread...</p>
In all honesty, I've let this issue rest for a while as the particular pc has now been replaced by a brand new Win7HP driven notebook, but when I have the intention to tune up this old relic from the digital age again, I might wanna try the suggestion that<em>v-6jayde</em>
 proposed in this thread. Or whipe the entire HDD and replace the existing WinXP installation to commense with a fresh start.<br />

<blockquote>This same thing happened to my PC but only when I have Nero 10 installed on my PC is it possible that you have Nero 10 also.</blockquote>
<p><br />
I had the same case when I installed Nero 10 (as Raquad suggested).</p>
<p>Nero10 comes with some pre-required list of some 3rd party components. Once I started clearing it out (installing it) Windows Update prompted me for those 3 .NET updates (in the middle of Nero install). Amazingly those Nero pre-reuired updates failed in
 the middle and couldn't continue ( I tried several times ). Ever since the picture was the same: Windows Update keeps prompting me for installation and Nero couldn't continue.</p>
<p>I just left it like this and after few days I tried again ( I am not sure if I restarted ) but at that time Nero was already successfully installed. However, Windows Update kept asking me over and over again for that installation and I passed it many times
 ( successfully ). Even more, becase the .NET isntallation is performed with "/q" switch key (for Quiet) I assumed the isntallation failed without letting me know. So I "stolled" the binaries from Windows/SoftwareDistribution folder and performed it one by
 one - it was still OK without error. It disappeared from the list once I isntalled it but few minutes later they popped again. Until now I cannot resolve it and it is really nagging me as I never had similar case for many years ( it was always fine )&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in few words:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - in my case it happened only after I installed Nero10. That is why I am scared to deploy the nero on&nbsp; my laptop.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; - Nero10 isntallation failed but eventually it was performed (after several days)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; - the first time Nero10 was installed .NET updates are keep reoccuring.</p>
<p>I am keeping "Hiding the updates" for the last as I hide only things I need to hide, I would preffer .NET updates to be "normally cleaned" from the update list...<br />
Anyone with some fresh ideas?</p>

                    <p>So ever since i came back home to florida i have recently started to disconnect from xbox live about every hour. It will only disconnect me from xbox live, but wont affect anyone else in the house. It will kick me offline for only about 2 seconds but it will take me out of my game and my party. Its very frustrating and annoying, does anyone have any suggestions? I am connected through a wifi booster because our normal router wont reach to where my room is.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>When viewing folders in Windows Explorer, is there a way to tell if it's empty or not without opening it, or right clicking / selecting properties. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>WINDOWS DVD MAKER HAS STOPPED WORKING - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taff69  say:</h3>
<h2>            WINDOWS DVD MAKER HAS STOPPED WORKING</h2>
                    
<p>I have previouslt created around 70 DVD's without problem and now the DVD Maker has stopped functioning.</p>
<p>I can add the items, doesnt matter how many or what size. I am using AVI files which have not been an issue previously. When then hitting next to go to the ready to burn page it thinks about it, the display goes white (transparent) and locks up and then
 the stopped working error message come up.</p>
<p>I have clean booted it and done just about everything i can find on this site to do and still the problem is there. I have wiped teh hard drive clean and reinstalled Windows Vista from scratch and that didnt work either. Very frustrating!!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>That is the exact error, WINDOWS DVD MAKER HAS STOPPED WORKING. It then goes about explaining that if a fix is found windows will advise, etc.</p>
<p>I have looked at the link you posted previosuly and nothing there seems to apply. I have read many of the posts here on a similar subject and tried all the fixes. It is still the same,</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have also been having this problem and I'm also looking for a solution. The most troublesome issue about this crash is that it doesn't give any clues as to why it crashes. So I am not able to provide any specifics other than than blunt error
 message Taff has described.</p>
<p>My question is: Is there a way to acquire more information about Windows DVD Maker (like the encrypted codes that run the program), that way those of us with the same issue can better provide more feedback to the Microsoft Supporters?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my issue still persists even after checking that my computer contains the latest Windows Vista service pack (SP2).</p>
<p>The details on my event log (Event Viewer) are as follow:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faulting application DVDMaker.exe,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; version 6.0.6002.18005,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time stamp 0x49e02385,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; application start time 0x01cad08df919e370.</p>
<p>From observing other blogs I have understood that the "faulting module iac25_32.ax" should be an unregistered server. However, while trying to un-register the server through the Command Prompt an error occurs.</p>
<p>The error reads as follows: The module "iac25_32.ax" was loaded but the call to DllUnregisterServer failed with error code 0x8000ffff</p>
<p>How do i resolve this error code 0x8000ffff?</p>

<p><strong>Hi Iv_marquez,</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
This might happen if some codec is installed or any non Microsoft DVD burner is installed or CD/DVD drive is not responding. The iac25_32.ax is a codec file which is not compatible with DVD maker.<br />
Let's unregister this file and check the result. Use the regsvr32 command to unregister iac25_32.ax module.<br />
1. Click start-&gt;type in cmd, right click cmd and click run as administrator.<br />
2. Right click on cmd.exe and select run as administrator.<br />
3. Then type in&nbsp; regsvr32 iac25_32.ax /u and hit enter.</p>
<p>We also recommend you to visit the following site, download and run the Microsoft fix it:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929461</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the issue persists, you can check the functionality of DVD maker by disabling all the non Microsoft services. To do this, follow these steps.<br />
1. Follow "Step 1: Perform a clean boot" to disable all the non Microsoft services, restart the computer and check if the issue still persists:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</a><br />
2. If the issue does not persist in clean boot, try "Step 2: Enable half of the services" to "Step 6: Resolve the problem" to find what's causing the issue:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</a><br />
Once you find the culprit, uninstall it.<br />
3. Follow "Step 7: Reset the computer to start as usual"</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> If you've installed any non Microsoft CD/DVD burner, uninstall it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Hi Taff69,</strong></p>
<p>The CD/DVD drive might not be responding correctly. We recommend you to visit the following site, download and run the Microsoft fix it:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929461</a></p>
<p>We also recommend you to run SFC (System File Checker) tool to fix the system file errors. To do this, follow these steps.<br />
1. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password,
 or click Allow.<br />
2. Type the following command, and then press ENTER: sfc /scannow<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</p>

<p>Thank you for the advise, but once i try to follow your steps on unregistering the file iac25_32.ax i encounter another problem. I will detail my steps taken on unregistering that file and then the problem that occurs...</p>
<ol>
<li>After typing regsvr32 iac25_32.ax /u and hitting enter within the Command Prompt, an error occurs.
</li><li>The error is read as follows: The module "iac25_32.ax" was loaded but the call to DllUnregisterServer failed with error code 0x8000ffff. For more information about this problem, search online using the error code as a search term.
</li><li>When I go ahead and check online for the error code, I find out that that error code (0x8000ffff) primarily relates to the issue of Windows Update problems and doesn't help resolve my problem
</li></ol>
How can i resolve this error code (0x8000ffff) occurring when i try to unregister the file iac25_32.ax from the Command Prompt?
        </p>

                    &nbsp;For about a week now&nbsp;I've been getting a lot of "freeze up" and am trying to eliminate the conflicting processes that&nbsp;cause my Vista Home Premium 32-bit w/ SP1 system&nbsp;to&nbsp;"lock up" on me.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've tried but&nbsp;can't do an effective Restore because none of my store points go back far enough to solve the issue(s).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;So I'm trying a "clean boot" as described in the article http:// support.microsoft.com/kb/331796.
<br />
<br />
My system has settled down significantly since turning off about half of the non-Microsoft services&nbsp;configured to be run at&nbsp;startup.<br />
<br />
But each time I run <strong>msconfig.exe</strong> I get this error message-- &nbsp;"A problem was encountered while processing custom tools manifest file (C:\Windows\system32\MSCFGTLC.XML".
<br />
<br />
It isn't stopping me from fiddling with the startup configuration but I don't think I should be getting this error. Any ideas about what this is and what to do about it?<br />

<p>Posting here since there is no Game specific forums for this yet.</p>
<p>Anyone know how to get the And really bad eggs achievement? It says to play as all Extra Toggle Characters. I loaded up a free play game and went through all teh characters but no achievement. I'm not sure what else to do and I can't find any guides on the
 game yet. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks Zen, </p>

<p>I'll check it out when I get home. My work's proxy is blocking that site. I think I checked there tho and they didn't have a walkthrough for that specific achievement yet.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>uyuyuy72,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes I think it's on par with other lego games. I'm having alot of fun with it. I would rate the legos games favorite&nbsp;to least favorite as:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lego Star wars 3</p>
<p>Lego Star wars TCS (Ommiting star wars 2)</p>
<p>Lego Pirates</p>
<p>Lego Batman</p>
<p>Lego Indiana 1</p>
<p>Lego Indiana 2</p>
<p>Lego Harry potter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing I didn't like was it includes the 4th movie and was released before the movie comes out. but that's it. definantely worth a play through</p>

<p>to get the really bad eggs achievement you have to have the extra toggle red hat active and start each level and toggle all the characters then you can play through or save and exit go to each level and repeat then in the hub area hold the Y button and switch
 to each charecter I even did the custom ones and the achievement poped.</p>

<p>Hi Sonya,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>MSDT</strong> stands for <strong>Microsoft</strong> <strong>Support</strong>
<strong>Diagnostic</strong> <strong>Tool</strong>, it is a built-in tool in Windows that can be used to diagnose and troubleshoot Windows issues. This can be activated when you contacted a
<strong>Microsoft</strong> <strong>Support</strong> <strong>Engineer</strong> and provided you with a
<strong>PassKey</strong>. With regard to your query, one of the possible reasons why msdt and msdtadmin folders appear in your temp folder is when the tool has been used.
<br />
</p>
<p>

<p>Okay, well as far as I know I have never provided anyone with a passkey, in fact I have gone out of my way disabling services that would allow anyone remote access to the computers. Somehow I have these folders both on the laptop and the desktop both last
 modified 3 days ago about 7 hours apart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So since I have never provided anyone with a passkey, I have attempted to disable remote services, can I disable this thing from running too?</p>

<p>I've tried that unfortunately something still always triggers things like "remote access connection manager" "remote access" and telephony.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled all of these services thousands of times, finally I decided to change the logon for these services and used a password different from my own (since most everything seems to be able to impersonate the administrator account) - so I'm pretty
 sure they will not be launched anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I cannot figure out to disable clipboardserver though (open in sihost so is remote desktop session host server sdk apis) and really trying to figure out how I might be able to prevent these powershell events.. On October 15th 48 powershell
 events all of which say "remote execute" many of which seems to reference tsusbhub (I thought I disabled this through the registry) and appear to have installed a printer, despite disabling pretty much every service I can think of to prevent anything from
 being setup including spooler.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These events happened after I disabled the windows image acquisition service, after finding the extremely large debug files for this service which appears to be sending every image I create somewhere (I guess this is setting sync which I chose to disable
 after windows setup but is still open in explorer, and upon opening the files I found it impersonates wiaserv).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyway, at least I have finally managed the to stop random session changing from 1 to 2 and no longer have events like "%sfrom%S (@#$%)" in event viewer. If nothing else, I have finally been able to fix one annoyance no one could explain and no update would
 address.</p>

<p>Disabling <strong>Windows</strong> <strong>Services</strong> is not recommended since this will cause system conflicts. There's a possibility that the moment you've disabled the Windows services on your device cause the issue. Also, disabling this services
 will also disable <strong>Dependencies </strong>included on that services, like <strong>
Remote Procedure Call, DCOM Server Process Launcher, </strong>and <strong>RPC Endpoint Mapper.

<p>Well unfortunately my files continue to get released without my consent. I only have Adobe installed CS6 and malwarebytes installed on the computer. I do not use nor have I ever used a remote service in my life, the computers have not been joined to a domain,
 they do not file share with anyone in the home, but seems they share with someone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Not one update has resolved the issue, Microsoft and Adobe both publish my intellectual property as their products WITHOUT my consent and I am left with no other option than trying to stop it myself unless of course someone actually started investigating
 what all is being collected in all that "extra data" microsoft is collecting and sending God only knows where.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've wasted so many hours doing clean installs, every time you issue an update, I have scanned with every antivirus and antispyware program out there, nothing finds a thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My photos, are being collected my work is being collected and I guess it's okay that some large company like Microsoft has the right to determine that I do not not have legal rights to my own intellectual property if they can throw a texture in a video game,
 or use it for a new background? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempting change things in GPE what a laugh - turn of offline files (even with the service disabled) every file on my pc states "availability: available offline"&nbsp; attempting to disable remote desktop and so on in GPE does not seem to make a difference,
 removing the printserver, uninstalling the default printers and what not does not seem to stop powershell from installing a 3D printer which DOES not even show in device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I guess it's better that people and possibly companies (since the security forums have no solutions for this) are better off not being able to earn from their own intellectual property as long as there's companies like this out there who can use,
 or sale anything they collect while in violation of numerous federal laws and completely trampling the rights of the end user.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. When exactly do you receive the error codes? What is the complete error message received along with the error codes?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Did both the error codes appear when installing Windows updates?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If it is with Windows Update, run the Windows Update troubleshooter. Refer the following link:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Open the Windows Update troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><u><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter</span></span></u></strong></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:
</span></strong><span>You may refer the following link and check:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Description of the System Update Readiness Tool for Windows Vista, for Windows Server 2008, for Windows 7, and for Windows
 Server 2008 R2</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><u><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821</span></span></u></strong></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you receive the error&nbsp;0x80070057" when you back up files in Windows 7 then refer the following link and check:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>0x80070057" error message when you back up files in Windows 7</span></strong></p>

            <p><span>Hi Ttimt,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community!
</span></p>
<p><span>Why did you perform a system restore?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First temporarily disable security software and firewalls and check.
</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1: Disable Windows firewall.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>a) Press ‘Windows + W’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b) Type ‘Windows firewall’ and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>c) Select ‘Turn Windows firewall on or off’ and select ‘Turn off the Windows firewall’ for both ‘public network
 location settings’ and ‘private network location settings’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Disable Windows Defender.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>a) Press ‘Windows + W’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b) Type ‘Defender’ and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>c) Click on ‘settings’ tab and uncheck ‘Turn on real-time protection’.</span></p>
<p><span>Warning: Antivirus software, Windows Firewall and Windows Defender can help protect your computer against viruses and other security
 threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software
 is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the computer hangs in safe mode with networking.</span></p>
<p><span>Safe Mode</span></p>
<p><span>Start the computer in Safe mode and check. Follow these steps to start the computer to safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Under ‘Boot Options’, select the ‘Safe Boot’ option.</span></p>
<p><span>e) Choose the type of safe mode by selecting one of the options below the Safe boot check box: ‘Minimal’.
</span></p>
<p><span>f) Click OK and then restart your PC.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, try reinstalling the network adapter in clean boot state.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Clean Boot</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1:</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check
 box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the ‘StartUp’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which
 are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p><span>g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></p>
<p><span>a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected
 in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in
 the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go
 to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items
</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may
 be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected
 in the Startup Item list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in
 the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected
 in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may
 be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the
 problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 7:</span></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also run System maintenance troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press Windows key + W on the keyboard</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type Troubleshooter then click on Settings under the Search field</span></p>
<p><span>c) In Settings click on Find and Fix Problems</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click on System and security</span></p>
<p><span>e) Click System maintenance follow the prompts from there.</span></p>
<p><span>Also see Windows hangs or freezes.</span></p>

            <div>I did a system restore because the Diagnostic policy service, diagnostic service host and diagnostic system host is disabled and it show Error 5 when i tried to enabled it.<br />
I'm running on administration, the services log on is set to Local Services and somewhere I put Local Services. Cant Remember.<br />
<br />
My Computer Windows Defender is not enabled</div>
When i boot into safe mode with minimal, no network is enabled so how could i check it?<br />
Then i reboot into safe mode again with option "network" and the problem still persist.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>When the Network and Sharing Center pops out, under the section "View Active Network" will keep blinking.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then i do a clean boot, disabling all startup items and non-microsoft services, i didn't go straight go to step 2 of clean boot, but i go and open my network and sharing center and the problem is still there, then i skipped all the other steps and maybe
 the problem is microsoft services?</div>
<div><br />
<div>And when i go back to normal boot, "HomeGroup" appear at my desktop, is that because i accidentally enabled any service? But anyways, I pressed "Leave HomeGroup" and the icon vanished.</div>

    <title>I want to have a standalone Windows 7 installation, independent from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yulflip  say:</h3>
<h2>            I want to have a standalone Windows 7 installation, independent from my manufacturer bundle. Is this possible&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a Lenovo x220 laptop and I wish to install Windows 7 by itself without the manufacturer bundle. Furthermore, I wish to be able to reinstall Windows 7 on my own without erasing the other operating system I am using (the "recovery DVDs" simply reset the
 hard drive to factory settings)<br />
<br />
Basically, I do not feel like I own Windows -- I merely use it according to Lenovo's (or is it Microsoft's?) whim. I want to install Windows 7 the way I want.<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />

            <blockquote>Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a Lenovo x220 laptop and I wish to install Windows 7 by itself without the manufacturer bundle. Furthermore, I wish to be able to reinstall Windows 7 on my own without erasing the other operating system I am using (the "recovery DVDs" simply reset the
 hard drive to factory settings)<br />
<br />
Basically, I do not feel like I own Windows -- I merely use it according to Lenovo's (or is it Microsoft's?) whim. I want to install Windows 7 the way I want.<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />
</blockquote>
<p><br />
In essence, you do not own Windows, you 'license' it from Microsoft. Which gives you the right to use it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You said you want a standalone copy of Windows 7 installed on your machine, while still maintaining your recovery partition.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, you won't be able to everything exactly, but you can have a standalone install and keep a system image of the manufacturer setup which you can restore if future needs require.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First:</strong></p>
<p>Create a system image of your current setup on your Lenovo laptop. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Second:</strong></p>
<p>Download the corresponding edition of Windows 7 you have a license for from the following link. You can identify the edition on COA sticker attached to your machine, with at bottom or battery compartment (laptop) or top/side if its a desktop computer.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately no, unless you know someone in your region who has a localized copy. Apart from this, your only option would be to do an Anytime Upgrade from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 7 Ultimate and download the Czech Language Pack.

    <title>How to give feedback to Microsoft&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to give feedback to Microsoft&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I had a suggestion I want to give to Microsoft that may improve the way their Mail app works. &nbsp;I ended up spending 30 minutes searching through the Microsoft website and couldn't find a way to easily leave feedback. &nbsp;Going through their "Contact Us" links
 forces me to make a call to their tech support. &nbsp;There's no easy way to simply write them an email. &nbsp;So now I have two suggestions I want to give to Microsoft: one on the use of the Mail app and another on how to allow customers to quickly and easily send
 them feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a simple email address they have for things like this?</p>
