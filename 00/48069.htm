<h2>            why am I restricted to save files on an external drive when I am the administrator</h2>
                    After installing win 7 I have files on one of my external drives that say are limited excess and when I tries to save a file to a folder it said I had to ask the administrator. Why are external drives effected with restrictions. I have not found a way
 to control these restrictions.<br />

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>It seems to be a permission issue.
</span><span><span>You may take the ownership of the folde and use the steps to grant permission to everyone. You can login as an administrator and make the required
 changes.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><b><span>Before taking ownership I would suggest you to create a new restore point so that the system may be reverted

 The System Restore tool uses restore points to return system files and settings to an earlier point in time. You can use it to restore the operating system to a point in time in which you did not experience the problem. To restore back you need to have a restore
 point available so I would suggest you to create a new restore point before taking ownership of the folder. Refer to the below link to create a restore point manually –<br />

<h3> nik.net3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender Real Time Protection Service slowing down Visual Studio etc.</h2>
                    <p>Hi since past two months or so I have been observing a strange phenomenon with the Real Time Protection Service that comes bundled in as a part of Windows Defender on Windows 10. When this service is set to ON Visual Studio builds take an excrciatingly long
 time to complete. Visual Studio itself takes forever to launch. Further if there are managed add-ins (written using Visual Studio Tools For Office, VSTO) installed in Outlook, Outlook takes 13-14 seconds to launch! When this service is disabled Outlook again
 launches within two seconds or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have raised this on Twitter with Windows Support and tried discussing this online with Microsoft Support for an hour without any resolution. Looking around the internet I can see there are users who are reporting same problems such as</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://ardalis.com/speed-up-visual-studio-build-times</p>
<p>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17845320/slow-page-refresh-times-during-development</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have been noticing this for only two months or so. I have tried spinning up new VMs in Azure etc. to test this and in every instance I have noticed this Real TIme Protection Service to be the culprit. My main issue is the Outlook Add In load time to be
 honest.</p>

</p><p>As I have mentioned above this issue is not isolated to my individual computer. I have spun up brand new virtual machines in Azure where I was able to successfully replicate the problem. I have also reset my laptop and the issue persists. Also as indicated
 by the links I shared in my original post other people also seem to be running into this problem.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen this issue with many different versions of visual studio, from 2012 to 2015. Newer verisons of studio are slower for just about everything, from changing projects and files to compiling. C# intellisense seems to be a particular problem for
 me until I turned it off. The issue is chronically bad enough that I had to revert to studio 2013 fro 2015 to get my work done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;According to task manager, the bottleneck is disk, not memory or CPU and the process that is hogging the disk is the windows defender exe. I have been running a core i7 mobile gen 1 processor with 8 gigs of ram and a terabyte 7200 RPM laptop drive, but
 the system I bought to alleviate the problem (a core I7 gen2 desktop with 16 gigs of ram and a 7200 RPM drive) had the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I tried moving my projects to a flash drive, but my code files don't seem to be part of the problem at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Since the speed issue goes away when I turn off defender (until the next reboot) I can only assume that the drive issue is from defender trying to access signatures, and not from defender being charged with all the load time for visual studio DLLs.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Have you tried adding VS executable or the entire folder to the exclusions list in Windows Defender settings? You can exclude a file, folder, or a file extension. Per Outlook I have no problems here, running Office 2010 in Windows x64.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I find it interesting that you are asking if I 'Reached out' to Microsoft, since this forum is the suggested and only way that Microsoft provides to do that exact thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I have been reporting the speed issue in the 4 or 5 usability studies I've been invited to participate in since windows 10 came out, but I haven't been to one since I discovered the issue was Windows defender. It always confused me and the other participants
 in the group studies that Microsoft was somehow unaware of the issue.</p>

            <p>Sorry what I meant was that if you tried reaching out to them via Windows Insider or one of their Connect programs where they accept bugs related to their products. I am sure they aren't unaware of the issue but perhaps it isn't prioritized high enough which
 is a bit weird given their focus on making Visual Studio and .NET the ubiquitous developer platforms and tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my main issue is with Visual Studio and an Outlook Add-In that I have developed. It is called TMO (TFS Meets Outlook) and it provides two way connectivity with TFS from within Outlook. What I have discovered is that Defender causes Outlook to load really
 slow if that add-in (or any managed add-in) is installed. TMO is right now in Beta and I would be really grateful if you could give it a spin and let me know how the Outlook loads for you once TMO is installed. I have noticed that adding Outlook.exe to the
 defender exception list or disabling the real time protection service makes the problem go away.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 startmenu and Cortana don&#180;t work with mandatory profile</h2>
                    <p>Mandatory profile does not work properly with window 10 fresh installation. Once I logged in with mandatory profile in window 10 pro the start menu does not work and cortana stopped working.</p>
<p>I can say taskbar stopped working with mandatory profile. If I log in with local user profile it worked fine with no issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me to sort this out.</p>

<h2>            Error 997. Overlapped I&#47;O operation - 0x80070643 - Fatal error during installation - .NET framework</h2>
                    <p>Event Viewer error message:<br />
Event ID 10997 from source MsiInstaller cannot be found (...) Product: Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.2 -- Error 997. Error 997. Overlapped I/O operation is in progress.<br />
<br />
The error initially occurred in Windows Update (important update).<br />
<br />
The error message occurs as a result of install attempts for .net framework 4.0, 4.5, or 4.52. Originally, the PC ran 4.51.<br />
<br />
The Install Log states:<br />
&lt;Returning IDOK. INSTALLMESSAGE_ERROR [Overlapped I/O operation is in progress. ]&gt; und<br />
&lt;Final Result: Installation failed with error code: (0x80070643), "Fatal error during installation. "&gt;<br />
<br />
How can I find out what I/O operation in progress the overlap occurs with?<br />
<br />
I already tried various solutions suggested in different forums, none was successful, e. g.<br />
- Repair Tool<br />
- cleanup Tool</p>
<p>- SFC /scannow</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even reverting back to an 18 month old harddisk image did not solve the problem. I have a different PC on which the .NET update ran successfully and that was set-up in parallel to the PC on which this issue occurs.<br />
<br />
Grateful for any hints or solutions - kind regds.<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate your efforts in performing SFC scan and also running repair and clean tools.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to refer to the post of Anshul Arona on Feb 13, 2014 and follow the steps as suggested from the below link.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/net-framework-35-fails-with-error-0x80070643/0115e938-f11f-4b0d-a15b-8985548b9dd7"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/net-framework-35-fails-with-error-0x80070643/0115e938-f11f-4b0d-a15b-8985548b9dd7</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I also suggest you to disable Antivirus software temporarily and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most
 cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software
 is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

            <p>Hello Ganesh, many thanks for your suggestion and apologies for my late reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had posted the same question to the German forum from where the suggestion came to apply an inline update. Unfortunately only an inline update has solved the issue. Which I find very disappointing because obviously it is very time consuming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I find particularly strange is that I restored an image from only a short period after the clean installation of Win7 and still the error occurred. Which means that a sleeping error was present on the machine for months for no obvious reason and only
 became obvious at the attempted installation of a new .net framework version. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx again for your support</p>
<p>Jochen</p>

<p>I had an issue after installed Just Cause 3 through Steam.&nbsp; The game wouldn't launch after trying to install Visual Studio Redistributable 2010.</p>
<p>

            <p>***You don't have to rename/delete this folder!!*** </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just right click Properties and&nbsp;add a folder permission to it&nbsp;for "SYSTEM"&nbsp;and&nbsp;grant it&nbsp;"Full Control".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hit this error myself&nbsp;trying to install .NET Framework 4.6.1 (Both&nbsp;the install via&nbsp;Windows Update and the MS&nbsp;downloaded installer file were failing with the above error in the logs.) None of the standard troubleshooting/Fixit/.Net Cleanup utilities did
 anything to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While Rajesh's suggestion of re-naming the folder&nbsp;does indeed allow the&nbsp;.NET&nbsp;install to succeed, what ends up happening is the "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">S-1-5-18"
</span>folder gets re-created when the installer runs. Considering I'm pretty sure this folder&nbsp;houses some of&nbsp;your user account(maybe)&nbsp;RSA private keys, I would think that&nbsp;even renaming the folder just removed those private keys from ever being accessed again.&nbsp;So
 you had better hope nothing important was signed/encrypted with them. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Not liking that prospect I kept googling and&nbsp;found another old&nbsp;article talking about issues with .NET 3.5 that suggested Local System needed file permissions on some folder and adding it allowed that install to complete successfully.&nbsp; I ripped out&nbsp;.NET&nbsp;4.6.1
 and&nbsp;put my original "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">S-1-5-18" folder back the way it was before renaming it&nbsp;and sure enough the .NET 4.6.1 install failed yet again. Then tried out&nbsp;simply adding the&nbsp;file permission&nbsp;to the folder and BOOM! .NET install suddenly&nbsp;succeeded
 without so much as a reboot and everything that was in my "S-1-5-18" folder stayed put! FTW.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In case you get permission denied errors when trying to set the permissions to the RSA directory, to take ownership of all files and folders in the RSA directory you can run the following commands:</p>
<p>
</p><p>cd c:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA</p>
<p>takeown /f * /a /r</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You should then be able to add System with full control to the&nbsp;directory and it's subdirectories without issue.</p>

            <p>What exactly do you mean by "destructive recovery?" From your post I take it to mean you want to format the system drive and perform a clean installation of Windows 7. In other words, start with a clean hard drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is correct, then YES; in fact, when upgrading from Windows XP to Windows 7 there is no actual "upgrade path" as the upgrade requires a custom (clean) installation of Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Upgrading to Windows 7: frequently asked questions<br />
</strong>(see: I'm running Windows XP on my PC. Can I buy the upgrade version of Windows 7?)<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/upgrading-to-windows-7-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/upgrading-to-windows-7-frequently-asked-questions</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to upgrading, if you haven't done so already, it is highly recommended that you run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor to ensure that your computer is capable of running Windows 7. Windows 7 was designed to use the latest technologies and hardware and many
 older machines are not capable of running the new operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor<br />
</strong>&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should also visit the windows 7 Compatibility Center to determine if all of your computer's devices (printers, scanners, cameras, etc.) and programs are compatible with Windows 7. For printers and other peripherals you'll need the manufacturer's name
 and exact model number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upgrading to Windows 7 will also require that you find and install Windows 7 drivers (32-bit or 64-bit based on what you upgrade to) for all you hardware and peripheral devices. This includes BIOS (if applicable), motherboard (chipset), audio, video, LAN,
 mouse and keyboard,&nbsp;printers, scanners, cameras, etc. In the case of printers, scanners and such devices, you may also need the associated software programs for your version of Windows 7 in addition to new drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating new drivers&nbsp;is the responsibility of the device maker; in other words the computer manufacturer or actual hardware or device&nbsp;manufacturer. If your computer is a major brand (i.e., Dell, HP, etc) visit the maker's support site and search for Windows
 7 drivers for your specific computer model. In the case of printers and such, visit their manufacturer's support site, again looking for new Windows 7 drivers for your specific device's model. Google is your friend.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to starting the actual upgrade process, you should backup all of your files and data, including photos, movies, music, contact lists and anything else that you do not want to loose; again, this upgrade requires the hard drive to be formatted thus erasing
 everything on the drive. Ideally, this backup should be to external media such as an external hard drive or flash drive (of sufficient size).</p>

<h3> jackattack95  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disk Check Issue&#63;</h2>
                    I factory reset my laptop. All of a sudden I'm getting this message "To turn off Disk Check, press any key in x number of seconds," x standing for 8 seconds, 7 seconds, etc. Why is this happening? I just got this laptop delivered to my house on Thursday
 and was using it perfectly fine before. How can I resolve this issue?&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query&nbsp;in Microsoft Community. We understand the inconvenience caused&nbsp;and will assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that the issue occurs when&nbsp;the computer is not shut down completely. It executes the Windows Disk checker (chkdsk) on startup. Simply pressing any key would stop Check disk from running but when you restart your computer, you’ll get
 this prompt again because Windows still thinks the drive needs scanning and will keep reminding you until it is checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to let the system continue and complete with the Disk Check. It might take some while to complete the process. After the process is complete and the system boots to the login screen, login to the system, restart the computer and check if the
 issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the&nbsp;information&nbsp;is helpful. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for your prompt reply. The thing is, I have always let the disk check run without stopping it. I believe the disk check stops before the whole 8 or so seconds and the computer boots up. Sometimes, like after I started up the computer just now,
 the disk check ran for a second or two. I remember there was this one time where I was trying to download Symantec Antivirus and had to restart my computer. However, my computer was stuck on a Restart "loop". The screen said "Restart" for a long time, so I
 did a hard reset/turn off. However, I had the Disk Check issue even before I tried to download the Symantec. Can you address this issue?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have tried to perform the above steps. As far as I know, the Disk Check message has not come up again. However, when I did the Startup Repair, I received a message stating that repairing the disks could take up to an hour. However, it finished within a
 few seconds. Should I be concerned? Have I solved the problem, or have I simply brushed it off?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it seems that startup is a lot faster now. Is this a note for concern, as it wasn't how my computer usually started up? I've also noticed that my laptop is hotter now with just a little bit of use. Is this normal? This may have been the case when I
 first purchased it, and I might not have taken note of it until now, but I'm not entirely sure.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Volume Icon in System Tray Settings is Greyed Out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> syk52  say:</h3>
<h2>            Volume Icon in System Tray Settings is Greyed Out</h2>
                    
<p>The volume icon appeared in my System Trey until a few days ago.&nbsp; Didn't notice until just now that it is gone, and unchecked/greyed out in the System Trey settings area.&nbsp; I have not made any system changes or added any new applications, so cannot see any
 reason for this to have occurred.&nbsp; Reading the related online postings prompted me to add my voice to the count of Vista users reporting this problem.&nbsp; Vista 6.0.6001.</p>

<h2>            Physical games and apps work, digital games do not work</h2>
                    
<p>So I've been having problems with my Xbox for a week now, ever since support had me try to do a new update for Fallout 4 issues. Since then the console wouldn't load or do updates. Today I finally got it to do an update, and then I factory reset it. So the
 console is updated and clean.</p>
<p>Only now, none of my digital content works. Games won't load, they crash back to the home screen. Apps work fine. Fallout 4 digital takes forever to load, but works. What's going on?</p>
<p>Support today had the nerve to tell me my console is aged and probably needs repair. The thing is less than two years old.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>i've already made sure that the drivers are updated and run the troubleshooter as well. My computer is running windows 10. I've seen an older thread on this same issue but it wasn't resolved either. So it would be great if you could provide some specific

<p>Hi Rovin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, completely uninstalling and reinstalling the driver works effectively than simply updating the driver. Try uninstalling the driver from the&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>, and restart your computer to automatically reload the driver. When installing
 the driver, it is also important to use the one that came from your device manufacturer website. Check this article on how to fix Bluetooth problems in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need further assistance, let me know by posting back. I will get back to you as soon as I can.</p>

<h2>            Every game freezes and crashes to main menu during multiplayer.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, so I wanted to play some Titanfall, Halo and COD:AW. So basically everytime i start a game, it is okay, no ping, everything fine, then suddenly, freeze and crash to main menu with description that i don't have connection to my network, i go onto dashboard,
 and it shows that there's no connection, and quickly goes normal. When I go to my detailed network settings, I have 44 mbps of downloading speed and 160 ping (WAT?). And also there's NAT type: Open, and info: You are behind a NAT cone or something like that.
 So I contacted xbox support staff 4 god *** times, and actually there were 2 guys, one who told me that my NAT as OPEN was wrong, and the second one saying that this is alright. So I done some Port forwarding in my network (I gotta virgin media superhub2)
 Port Triggering, enabled DMZ, setted up a new static ip to my xbox, nothing worked. Can you guys please help me with solving that issue?</p>

    <title>Photo Gallery reduces file size of tagged photos - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> knielsen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photo Gallery reduces file size of tagged photos</h2>
                    <p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Problem</span></span></p>
<p><span>I just installed Windows Photo Gallery 2012 (WPG) since I decided to use it for photo organizing. However, when I apply&nbsp;any type
 of tags to my&nbsp;photos using WPG there is a significant reduction in the file size of the tagged photos. Generally, there was file&nbsp;size reduction of about&nbsp;15 percent&nbsp;(while the resolution of the photo&nbsp;was unchanged).</span></p>
<p><span>I find it hard to believe that the file size could be reduced by 15 percent&nbsp;without some kind of picture quality compression – and
 loss of quality – being involved!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Question</span></p>
<p><span>Can anyone help explaining the file size reduction I'm seeing? Could it be due to unwanted photo compression? Also, when does Photo
 Gallery compress photos, and can&nbsp;it happen&nbsp;without my consent?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">More information:</span></p>
<p><span>For instance, I have a JPG picture taken with a DMC-ZS15. The original file size is&nbsp;4,67 MB (4.907.520 byte). After adding a geo-tag
 to the picture the file size is reduced to&nbsp;3,97 MB (4.169.988 byte). Adding a&nbsp;face-tag to the original&nbsp;similarly reduced the file size to&nbsp;3,97 MB (4.170.671 byte). Adding other types to tags also reduced the file size.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>The&nbsp;"date modified" is updated the instant the tag is added. Since&nbsp;there is no way to undo (CTRL+Z) adding a tag, the damaged has
 potentially been done. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I found that the file size reductions happen when tagging photos using two different&nbsp;Panasonic cameras&nbsp;(a DMC-TZ8 and a DMC-ZS15)
 both of which have been my main cameras. However, I&nbsp;also </span><span>have photos from other cameras (two different Canons and a Windows Phone) that actually saw a slight increase in
 file size, when I added tags to them - as expected.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm using Windows Photo Gallery 2012 (build 16.4.3528.331) on a Lenovo X230, Windows 8.1 with the latest updates. Note that in settings
 I have set the JPEG quality to 100 %.</span></p>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;knielsen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Windows Photo Gallery forum. Sorry for the delayed response. From the information that you've provided, this issue occurs only on photos that were produced by two different Panasonic cameras (a DMC-TZ8 and a DMC-ZS15).</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried to reproduce/simulate this issue but was not successful. We&nbsp;experienced a little increase in file size but no reduction. With this, we request that you provide&nbsp;us some of the original photos that were produced by the two specific cameras. You
 may upload them on the private message area.</p>

<h2>            Code 43 error for device on USBdevice - USB Mouse stopped working</h2>
                    Running Windows 7 on a Dell Inspirion<br />
<br />
USB wire optical mouse has been working without difficulties for last three weeks since we purchased it.<br />
<br />
This morning device not working message appeared and the mouse stopped working.<br />
<br />
The mouse works well on other systems (XP) as we checked to ensure it was not the mouse.<br />
<br />
Uninstalled all the USB drivers, and unplugged any USB devices,&nbsp;restarted and Windows 7 which reinstalled USB drivers.&nbsp; The driver installation reports successful installation on controllers and Root Hub however indicates a Device failed at the end.<br />
<br />
Youe assistance would be appreciated.&nbsp;<br />

            Thanks for your help, the solution ended up being to rebuild the INFCACHE.1 file in C:\windows\system32\driverstore folder.&nbsp; I renamed the INFCACHE.1 ffile to INFCACHE.1bak and then restarted the machine.&nbsp; After it was booted up I connected the USB device
 and after a few minutes the INFCACHE.1 file is rebuilt automatically.&nbsp; The ability to rename the file though required me to&nbsp;change the Owner and Permissions via the security tab by right clicking the INFCACHE.1 file and then going to Properties

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently after installing Windows 10, I went into my Dell Audio app to change the EQ of my speakers and headphones with Waves MaxxAudio that I had with Windows 8 - 8.1, and the Waves MaxxAudio option is still there but nothing shows up to change anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>Sorry for the confusion. </p>
<p>Earlier today we were experiencing issues with people loading up their accounts, and that could be leading to the error that you're seeing there. I would suggest that if you haven't already, try power cycling your console as outlined in

<p>I need help, I use to play my xbox one without wifi, but I've got some wifi now, so I connected it to my xbox one, everything seems to work fine, but when I try to play ANY of my games that can use wifi will not work, instead this note pops up saying. Update
 needed</p>
<p>You need this update, but we can't get it right now. Try again in a while. (0x8b050033)</p>
<p>That is exactly what it says, the same thing over and over again for about the past 2-3 months now. I've been playing my xbox one offline so I can play the games (offline, soloplayer) and I've been checking it now and then but it's still there. And I'm getting
 sick on "Try again in a while." Please someone help me</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 6 Pen joining clicks</h2>
                    <p>I've had my surface pro and pen for about 2 months now, everything was working well. Now, whenever I use the pen to draw with, it's like linking the words together, almost like cursive. The screen is responding to touch that isn't there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to fix this? I really need it as it is how I take my uni notes.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the concern, and are currently investigating a possible root case and solution. Please continue to check for Surface and Windows Updates to ensure your device has the most current firmware and software available. You can obtain this by checking

<p>
</p><p><strong>Recommendations:</strong></p>

<p>Hello <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/aba6c29d-74f3-4369-89fe-997d3feb230a" title="AlysiaMarshall"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">AlysiaMarshall</span></a>,</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to hear that the pen is still now working properly even after these steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to verify a few more things here for us to better understand and isolate the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>What type of Surface pen do you have? Pls refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4036281/surface-how-to-use-your-surface-pen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to check for Surface pen versions.</li><li>Is this happening to a specific app/program when using the Surface pen? Try to check and test your Surface Pen with another program or application.</li><li>"<em>The screen is responding to touch that isn't there.</em>&nbsp;" - Do you mean the Surface behaves as though it is receiving touch input, but you are not touching the screen?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Additional Troubleshooting steps:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Uninstall HID-Compliant Touch Screen </strong>driver and <strong>restart</strong></li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Device Manager</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>Go to <strong>Human Interface Devices</strong>. Expand <strong>Human Interface Devices</strong>, and right-click
<strong>HID-Compliant Touch Screen</strong>. </li><li>Right-click on <strong>HID-Compliant Touch Screen </strong>and select <strong>
Uninstall</strong>. </li><li>If there is more than one driver, uninstall those as well. </li><li><strong>Restart </strong>Surface and attempt to reproduce the issue. </li></ol>
<p>Drivers are software that tell the hardware what to do, and how to do it. Uninstalling and reinstalling the driver (restart reinstalls) may resolve any issues that the driver is having at performing its designed tasks. It's a good idea to check for updates
 after this step as well to ensure that you have the latest version available. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results. Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>What do you mean by linking? Are there little dashes on the letters? If so, you've got the wonderful "fish hook" problem some of us have been dealing with for months. I've yet to see any helpful reply for this issue, so hopefully you don't have it.</p>

<h2>            Just Cause 2 on Xbox One error 0x80150017</h2>
                    
<p>When trying to redeem my code for Just Cause 2 which I have received when buying Just Cause 3 I get the error 0x80150017. The same issue occurs when using the W10, redeem website and the console. How can I solve this?</p>

            <p>Hey there MrVoras!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the code redemption issue! You can encounter error code 80150017 if you have a region miss-match. If you haven't already, I recommend making sure that your account region matches your physical location. If you have made sure that everything matches and the issue continues to occur, you will need to reach out to phone support from our&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a>&nbsp;page for further assistance. Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</p>

<p>That is the main problem - I am from Lithuania which is not available to choose from the region list, therefore I set my region to the UK. The live support chat directed my here because they could not solve the problem</p>

            <p>Thanks for clarifying MrVoras.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Lithuania isn't a supported region which would explain the trouble you're having. As we mentioned, cross-region accounts aren't supported and cause the trouble you're having. We're always looking at expanding our support to other regions, if you'd like to provide some feedback head over to <a href="http://xbox.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox.Uservoice.com</a></p>

<p><strong><span>hello, I would like to know how to get the sims 3 to work on my laptop. I have downloaded it but it comes up with a crc error&nbsp;during&nbsp;installation. I read that this can be caused when your computer is in need of defragging so....</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>To try and fix this i have downloaded a clean up and defragging program. I cleaned my computer and tried to defrag. I then discovered that i couldn't defrag unless i had vista sp2. I downloaded sp2 eventually with the help of an advisor. There
 were some faults which were preventing me from downloading it myself. Now i have sp2 it still won't defrag without freezing up. So i still can't download the sims 3! Its very frustrating and i'm wondering if you could help me sort it all out please?&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

            <p>Hi, I have the same error when I tried installing it on my pc.</p>
<p>What I did:</p>
<p>1. Run Disk Cleanup Utility of windows on Local C Drive</p>
<p>2. Restart your computer.</p>
<p>3. Run <a href="http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ccleaner</a> and click "cleaner"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, got to "Registry" and click Scan then Click on Fix all Issues...</p>
<p>4. Before you install the Sims 3 game, clean the installation disc using a disc cleaner and a microfiber cloth. Make sure that the disc is dry before you load it to your DVD Drive.</p>
<p>5. Once the installation is done, restart computer. Then, refer back to 1-4 steps.</p>
