            Most often when a device doesnt work it is because of a driver.&nbsp; Try re-installing yours.<br />
<br />
This works for win vista, 7 &amp; 8<br />

    <title>Brightness Output of Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fuzzyreets  say:</h3>
<h2>            Brightness Output of Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>Does anyone else find that the brightness level of the Xbox One is insanely high?&nbsp; I have to literally turn the brightness on my TV down from 48 to 29 any time I use my Xbox One.&nbsp; This is the only device in my home theater that behaves like this.&nbsp; I'm wondering
 if other users have found the same issue.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>I find it OK. Depends what TV you use. Samsung HDTV's are more brighter than Sony HDTV's because a retailer said Samsung really pushes for brightness. Some games allow you to adjust the brightness/gamma levels. Or you can simply adjust it on your TV/display.

<p>Have a Sony KDL40EX720 (LED full HDTV) it has an anti-reflective (anti-glare) screen so it doesn't reflect like a mirror which is what I like about it, and it's a good 1080p display, but if anything is pixelated, the screen isn't shy when it comes to showing
 it. The model that I have suffers a little in terms of brightness when compared to Samsung Series 5+ models only because a retailer said Samsung really pushes for brightness. I brought Sony because I was told it has a low hardware failure rate. Can't really
 complain about the brightness but it does mean I usually need to turn the brightness on my TV to 80 and have gamma on 2 or 5 (max option).

<p>Use a calibration disc on the HDMI output you use for the XBOX or do what Deedles did, there's calibration in the settings on the One.

<p>
</p><p>I' having the same problem since early 1607 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the aforementioned actions did work!</p>
<p>Thus a did a clean reinstall (w/ keeping user data) and -- again, it fails!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So 0x80070570 means: ERROR_FILE_CORRUPT "The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since its not the downloaded update files, it must be an issue on the system.</p>
<p>Since I did not let the clean install delete user data, it must be a file or folder which persisted throughout the clean install. And its not hardware related, except the error message is wrong (which I don't assume).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question is, how do I locate the file or folder being somehow "corrupted", which could also be a tricky access right issue???</p>
<p>I'm almost at the point of throwing ProcessMonitor at this, alas, the log file must be enormous :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I find other people coming to the same conclusion?</p>
<p>Did someone find it?</p>

<h2>            Headset Crackle</h2>
                    <p>If you've had this you will know.&nbsp; It basically does not happen in the home screen at all only in game.&nbsp; The audio is crisp through a tv, but I use a headset a lot for PUBG, talking with friends, etc.&nbsp; Point is this crazy crackling sound ruins the games.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fixes I have tried include -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - I have 2 different controllers and 2 different headsets.&nbsp; The combinations make no difference&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 - Going into the audio setting and changing which type of headset output occurs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3 - Changing MAC address.</p>
<p>4 - This has occured for weeks seemingly randomly,&nbsp; so my xbox has turned off and on various times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#teamxbox fix this in the next xbox please? Side note I have a Xbox one X.&nbsp; Problem never occured when I had a S.&nbsp;</p>

I'm sorry to hear about the issue. Let's try out some troubleshooting steps to see if we can get your headset to play nicely with your Xbox One.</p>

</li><li><span>Make sure your headset adapter is firmly plugged into your controller and that your headset's 3.5mm cable is securely plugged into the headset adapter.</span>
</li><li><span>Try your headset with another device (Like a cell phone) to see if the issue continues to occur.</span>
</li><li><span>Try your headset and headset adapter with another controller. (Make sure the additional controller has been updated)</span>
</li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
If after you try out these steps I listed above and the issue still persists, I would suggest posting what's happening on your end over in this thread,&nbsp;as that is the place we are gathering more information from users who are experiencing this.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Lenovo Yoga 13 touch keyboard disappears after add other language pack</h2>
                    <p>The touch keyboard was function correctly on my new Lenovo Yoga 13&nbsp;in both laptop mode and tablet mode.</p>
<p>After adding second language the touch keyboard works at both modes.</p>
<p>After close the LED screen then open the LED, touch keyboard works only in laptop mode. In tablet mode when touch a text box or call the touch keyboard from the desktop task bar directly, the keyboard will pop up then disappears.</p>
<p>After restart the PC, in both modes the touch keyboard pops up then disappers.</p>
<p>HELP!!!!</p>

            <p>You need to update Synaptics TouchPad Driver for Microsoft Windows 8 (64-bit) - IdeaPad Yoga 13.</p>
<p>Goto Lenovo support, under drivers select Ideal pad Yoga 13, find all the drivers and select mose &amp; keyboard. Then download Ottp16ww.exe. follow instructions.</p>

    <title>have retail Windows 10 pro and new mobo, but &#39;boot critical - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            have retail Windows 10 pro and new mobo, but &#39;boot critical drivers&#39; missing and startup repair can&#39;t repair</h2>
                    <p>I had a bonafide Windows 8.1 Pro installation and did the free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Then, I bought a retail copy of Windows 10 Pro and a new motherboard. I wanted to install the new mobo with my old hard disks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I boot to Command Prompt, I can see my old disks and all their files. Of course, they are drive "C" and drive "F" under Command Prompt, instead of "C" and "D", but everything is there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run Windows 10 retail install (64-bit), it ends after a short time with "Windows Setup: Windows Setup could not install one or more boot-critical drivers. To install Windows, make sure that the drivers are valid, and restart the installation" &lt;OK&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run Startup Repair, I'm told "Startup Repair couldn't repair your PC: Press 'Advanced options' to try other options to repair your PC or "Shut down" to turn off your PC. Log file:" &lt;Shutdown&gt; &lt;AdvancedOptions&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's relevant, the new mobo is an Asus Sabertooth Z170 Mark I. I think the only new device from the old mobo is an M.2 slot, which I'm not using yet. I'm even using Onboard graphics to simplify things (ie, my graphics cards are pulled temporarily).</p>

            <p>I realized I didn't put an explicit question in my prior post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I boot my C drive to Windows 10 again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible for me to boot to Windows 10 and follow some process so all I have to do is type in my new retail Windows 10 license key? (ie, no long install, no PC refresh, etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Also, I did look into disabling the M.2 slot in the UEFI BIOS but I didn't see that option. I just figured that if that is the wonky new device that is too new for retail Windows 10 to ship with&nbsp;its driver, disabling it in the BIOS could be a workaround.
 That said, maybe two weeks from now I'll be asking how I can move my Windows installation from its current SSD to a new Samsung 950 M.2 drive).</p>

            <p>This post is to help folks who stumble across the same issue. In my case, the problem should have&nbsp;been on my debug path, and I guess I can credit Billion Debbarma with asking the question that got me to the answer. But, I also discovered an error in the
 information provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unbeknownst to me, I was booting off of a USB recovery stick. In the old mobo, I had set the boot order long ago to ignore USB sticks, figuring if I really wanted to do that I could set it up again configuring the BIOS. Well, the new mobo went back to the
 default.&nbsp;This stick was a&nbsp;Recovery drive created by the old mobo. I still don't know why this Recovery stick couldn't repair Windows 10 on the new mobo, why it created empty log files on repair and said it couldn't repair it. It would be better perhaps to
 have the Recovery stick say "I was created on a different license, so even though I could repair your Windows installation, I'm not going to"</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, I don't know why booting off of the retail Windows 10 Pro stick gave me an error about boot critical drivers missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, to answer the questions, I was not trying to perform a clean installation and I thought this was apparent from the question. The exact error messages I received were in my original post. I did remove the old mobo and it is in the closet because
 only someone with more talent than me can run this system with two motherboards. But, it was the question "Does the computer boot properly?" that helped because it set me on a path to demonstrate the system could boot to Ubuntu 14.04 and that's when I discovered
 what was really booting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can state definitively the sentence fragment "you need to perform clean installation to enter the retail Windows 10 license key since you have already upgraded to Windows 10 free version" is false. Once I was actually able to start my old Windows 10 installation,
 all I had to do was go to Activate and enter the new license key. That part was easy peasy.</p>

<p>Not correct, although I can see why you might think so looking at that Apple document.&nbsp; If you look a little farther down that page at the table of "Minimum System Requirements," you'll see Windows 7 wherever Windows is mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you download iCloudSetup.exe from the page both of us linked (HT204230), it should be v. 6.0.1.41, which will install iCloud 6.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have iCloud 6.0 running on a Windows 7 Pro sp1 system with no discernible problems.

<p>Hello Clwri,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.</p>
<p>I found information on Closed Captions in the Windows Vista, Help and Support.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Show closed captions or subtitles in Windows Media Center</strong></p>
<p>If your computer has no TV tuner, an optional analog or digital TV tuner is required to play and record TV in Windows Media Center.<br />
If you want spoken audio to be in text format when you are watching TV shows and DVDs, you can turn on closed captioning in Windows Media Center.</p>
<p>By default, closed captioning is turned on for Windows Media Center and Windows Media Center Extender when both are set to Mute. You can change this setting if you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Windows Media Center displays closed captioning that is broadcast by your TV service provider. Check with your service provider to see if they broadcast closed captioning for the TV show you want to watch.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;To turn closed captioning on or off</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>On the start screen, scroll to Tasks, click settings, click TV or DVD, and then click Closed Captioning. In some regions, you may need to select Subtitles instead of Closed Captioning.
</li><li>Under Caption Display, click either On, Off, or On when muted.
</li><li>After you have completed your changes, click Save to return to the settings screen.
</li></ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;To select a different captioning channel for analog TV channels</strong></p>
<p><span>If you have an analog TV signal and you want to turn on closed captioning, you need to specify closed captioning for analog channels for closed captioning to work correctly.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>On the start screen, scroll to Tasks, click settings, click TV, and then click Closed Captioning.</span>
</li><li><span>Under Basic Captioning, click CC1.</span>
</li><li><span>When you have completed your changes, click Save to return to the settings screen.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;To select a different captioning channel for digital TV channels</strong></p>
<p><span>Digital TV channels provide further closed captions options in addition to Basic Captioning. Windows Media Center will attempt to select closed captions in the language specified in the Preferred Language setting. Note
 that certain broadcasts may not specify the language that is associated with each captioning service.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>On the start screen, scroll to Tasks, click settings, click TV, and then click Closed Captioning.</span>
</li><li><span>Under Preferred Language, select a language.</span>
</li><li><span>When you have completed your changes, click Save to return to the settings screen.</span>
</li></ol>
<p>Please let us know if this answers your question or if you still need further assistance.<br />
<br />
Sincerely, &nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;

<p>f you've forgotten your Windows password, there are several ways to retrieve or reset it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your PC is on a domain, your system administrator must reset your password.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you're using a Microsoft account, you can reset your password online. For more info, go to the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=238656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>
<p>If you're using a local account, use your password hint as a reminder.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you've tried these suggestions and still can't sign in:</p>

<li>
<p>If you have <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span>, you'll need to reinstall Windows. </p>

                    I just upgraded to windows 10 and now I keep getting this "windows powershell has stopped working" error message. &nbsp;I have no idea what program it is affecting but IE seems to be frozen. &nbsp;I have no clue what's going on. &nbsp;It's seems like this is a common
 issue with many users but none of their causes are the same as mine so I don't know if their fixes will fix my issue. &nbsp;Can anyone offer some help? &nbsp;Thanks

<p>Method 3 seems to have done the trick for me.. I recommend starting it before you go to bed if you have either a large drive or multiple drives. It will scan every file you have on every connected drive but be warned it will wipe any infected file without
 prejudice. It took me about 10 hours for the scan and about 20 minutes to clean the files it found.<br />
Thank You,</p>
<p>This was driving me crazy for the past 5 days. </p>

<p>1. Reset IE (Edge) with no relief.</p>
<p>2. Ran "sfc /scannow" with no relief.</p>
<p>3. Microsoft Safety scanner is not available for Windows 10, that is not an option.</p>

    <title>All Microsoft software stops working at least once a day, but other - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erik bainbridge  say:</h3>
<h2>            All Microsoft software stops working at least once a day, but other software keeps running OK</h2>
                    <p>Once or twice a day, all Microsoft products on my PC completely freeze. &nbsp;Often, it starts with File Explorer freezing.&nbsp; After that, if I’m in Office software, they freeze and I can’t close them.&nbsp; If I’m not in Office software, I can’t open them.&nbsp; Task Manager
 can’t close anything.&nbsp; Sometimes my desktop and taskbar completely disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, non-Microsoft software is fine.&nbsp; If I have Chrome or Firefox already open, I can continue using them and I can close them normally.&nbsp; The same is true for The Bat Voyager email, which I run from a USB flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I built the computer myself two years ago (I’ve been building my own computers and servers for 23 years).&nbsp; It has had no problems with Win 7. &nbsp;It has the following configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Win 10 Pro on primary boot SSD</li><li>Win 7 Pro on secondary boot SSD</li><li>MSI Z87 GD65 motherboard</li><li>i7-4770 CPU</li><li>32GB Crucial Ballistix RAM</li><li>MSI GTX 970 GPU</li><li>Several external eSATA and USB drives</li><li>Kaspersky Internet Security</li><li>Office 365</li><li>Adobe CC</li><li>lots of other software</li></ul>
<p>I have no problems with Win 7, but I have this problem at least once a day on Win 10.&nbsp; I use the computer in my business and am on it all day, so this is a major problem for me. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Steps I’ve taken:</p>
<ul>
<li>All Windows updates are current</li><li>Motherboard BIOS, drivers, and utilities are current</li><li>Device Manager shows all drivers are current</li><li>sfc/scannow reports no problems</li></ul>
<p>One clue: when rebooting after a problem, Windows runs CHKDSK on many of the drives (there are 11 drives and partitions) and usually reports a non-existent drive each time after a failure.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Does anyone have suggestions?&nbsp; If this continues, I will have to go back to Win 7 permanently.</p>

            <p>This is really strange. &nbsp;After having the problem at least once daily for at least a month, I posted this question on Thursday and did not have the problem again until today (Sunday), and today the problem is slightly different than before. &nbsp;Today’s problem
 started with File Explorer hanging, as it often does, but this time affected both Microsoft and non-Microsoft applications. &nbsp;They at first became very slow to respond and then completely stopped responding. &nbsp;I had to reboot using my computer case’s restart
 button. &nbsp;Chkdsk did not run, which is unusual after these problems.<br />
<br />
I now have a new problem. &nbsp;After having the problem this morning, I tried the clean boot as described in the link you gave. &nbsp;The result is that I now cannot log into Win 10 and I cannot get into safe mode. &nbsp;When I try rebooting, the normal login screen displays
 except for the login prompt. &nbsp;It displays the date/time on the left and a shutdown button on the right. &nbsp;I’ve attached a screenshot (at bottom of post).<br />
<br />
I’m now using my Win 7 boot. &nbsp;I can’t get into Win 10 at all. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
To answer your previous questions:<br />
1)<span> </span>No, chkdsk has not given any error messages, including on the non-existent, drive, which it treats like any other drive.<br />
2)<span> </span>I haven’t made any changes to the computer, either hardware or software. &nbsp;However I think the problems started around the time I began using One Drive and in particular after I mapped One Drive
 as a network drive. &nbsp;I stopped using One Drive several weeks ago.<br />
<br />
What screenshot specifically would help you? &nbsp;When the problem happens, the screen looks completely normal except for being non-responsive. &nbsp;Today I had my camera ready to record the results of chkdsk, but it did not run as it usually does after one of these
 problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what my login screen looks like now, after configuring for a clean boot and then doing a restart. &nbsp;I don't get a login prompt at all and I can't get into safe mode.</p>

            <p>I created a USB recovery drive on a different PC (both are 64-bit Win 10 Pro), but was unable to recover using it. &nbsp;It didn't find any restore points, couldn't fix start problems, and sfc/scannow reported that it couldn't repair problems. &nbsp;I tried forcing
 it into safe mode by typing "bcdedit /set (default) bootmenupolicy legacy" in the command window, but it returned an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't get it to go into Safe Mode so I'm unable to get a login prompt. &nbsp;When I hold down SHIFT while pressing the restart icon (on the screenshot I attached above), it simply does a standard restart without going into safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a UEFI motherboard (MSI Z87 GD65), so F8 is not an option (though I have tried it in desperation).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I only see three options:</p>
<p>1) Do a Win 10 reset, but this would be painful because I have a lot of software installed</p>
<p>2) Restore from a backup, but this would still entail reinstalling a fair amount of software and the original problem might still be there</p>
<p>3) Give up on Win 10 and keep on using Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Thank you for the details. Since the possible resolutions didn't resolve the issue. You may need to reset your Windows. Resetting will let you choose whether to keep your files or remove them, and then reinstall Windows. It will remove apps from your PC
 manufacturer and the ones you installed from the Internet. However, default applications will remain.</p>

            <p>A fourth option just occurred to me, &nbsp;I'm wondering whether doing it would violate my Windows license and if it does, whether it create any problems for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I need to do to solve my immediate problem is boot into safe mode, but I can't because I have a UEFI motherboard and none of the non-F8 methods are working. &nbsp;What I'm wondering is this: would it create any problems if I temporarily move the boot SSD
 to an older case that has a motherboard with a traditional BIOS, boot into safe mode there, solve the problem that's keeping me from booting normally, and then move the boot SSD back into my usual case with the UEFI motherboard to run Win 10 normally (and
 go back to solving the original problem at the top of this thread)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Information about my Windows licenses:</p>
<p>My Windows 10 was a free upgrade from Win 8.1. &nbsp;I bought the Win 8 license directly from Microsoft when the Win 8 Release Candidate period ended, when Microsoft was selling Win 8 licenses for $40. &nbsp;I installed Win 8 by first installing the version of XP
 that came with the Win 8 install disk I received from Microsoft and then upgrading to Win 8. &nbsp;I built the computer myself. &nbsp;There are no manufacturer Windows licenses involved.</p>

            <p>It worked. &nbsp; I moved my boot SSD to a non-UEFI machine, used Shift F8 to boot into safe mode, and solved the config problem that was preventing my login screen from appearing. &nbsp;The boot SSD is now back in its usual machine and booting properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll do more debugging and will post more information about the original problem when I have some concrete information.</p>

            <p>I’ve narrowed the original problem down a little. &nbsp;I was incorrect in stating that all Microsoft applications stop running. &nbsp;It’s only applications I previously used with One Drive: Word 2016, Excel 2016, and File Explorer. &nbsp;(I stopped using One Drive weeks
 ago).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem happens after I’ve been using the computer for several hours. &nbsp;Without warning, Word, Excel, and File Explorer will stop responding. &nbsp;However Microsoft applications that I have not used with One Drive are OK (Edge, IE, Skype, and other Office
 2016 applications). &nbsp;Task Manager works but is unable to terminate Word, Excel, or File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Non-Microsoft applications are not affected. &nbsp;Chrome, Firefox, and other applications can still be opened and used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A minute or so after Word, Excel, and File Explorer stop responding, the desktop and task bar both go black. &nbsp;After this happens, applications other than these three can still be used if already open, but of course can’t be opened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I don’t solve this soon, I’m going to have to either reset Win 10, which I don’t really have time for because of how much software I have installed, or simply stop using Win 10 and use Win 7 instead. &nbsp;I’m already using Win 7 for work where I can’t afford
 an interruption.<br />

            <p>From the beginning, this problem has made no sense, &nbsp;Now it&nbsp;<em>seems</em> to be resolved, but I don't understand how or why, which really bothers me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps that led to the "resolution":</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I began having problems with non-Microsoft software in Win 10. &nbsp;Not as severe as the Microsoft problems I mentioned originally, but enough that I switched my default boot SSD to Win 7 so I could use the PC for work. &nbsp;I was going to return to debugging
 Win 10 when I had time the following weekend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. After four days of using Win 7 with no problem, it crashed with a BSOD. &nbsp;When I restarted Win 7, it ran chkdsk and found and repaired dozens of errors on the Win 7 boot SSD and thousands of errors on the Win 10 boot SSD. &nbsp;I'd been previously running chkdsk
 without finding errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I wanted to change the default boot drive to my Win 10 SSD so I could test Win 10 for a few days, but now I had &nbsp;a new problem: my BIOS (UEFI). &nbsp; I couldn't adjust settings. &nbsp;I tried repeatedly &nbsp;I would get into the initial settings screen, but not into
 any of the settings and was unable to change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. My motherboard is dual BIOS, so I switched to the other BIOS and I changed my default boot drive to the Win 10 SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been running Win 10 for about a week since then. &nbsp;I've had no problems except for a single Word crash. &nbsp;It didn't seem related to my earlier problems because I was able to restart Word and had no other problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is probably resolved, but I don't know why it occurred or why it is resolved. &nbsp;If anyone has any ideas, I've love to hear from you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll wait another week or so before marking this thread closed, just in case the problem recurs. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Help Windows 7 Upgrade error&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Help Windows 7 Upgrade error&#33;</h2>
                    I receive the following error when trying to upgrade Vista Home Premium to Windows 7 Ultimate:<br />
"To upgrade Windows, the Users, Program Files, and Windows directories need to be on the same partition. Upgrading when these directories are not on the same partition is not supported. Moving these directories so that they are on the same partition is also
 not supported. You can choose to install a new copy of Windows 7 Ultimate instead, but this is different from an upgrade, and does not keep your files, settings, and programs. You’ll need to reinstall any programs using the original installation discs or files.
 To save your files before installing Windows, back them up to an external location such as a CD, DVD, or external hard drive. To install a new copy of Windows 7 Ultimate, click the Back button in the upper left-hand corner, and select “Custom (advanced)”."&nbsp;
 All of the Users, Program Files, and Windows directories are on the same partition (C:), but HP has a second partition (D:) called Recovery.&nbsp; Also, when I ran the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor on my pc it told me that I would be able to use the upgrade option
 which would allow me to keep all my programs and data.&nbsp; So I'm confused why the Windows 7 installer is telling me that I can only use the Custom option which is unacceptable.&nbsp; Is there any way around this issue?

            The Upgrade Advisor deals with operating system, hardware and software compatibility. I think the complexity of upgrading key system folders that are not in their traditional locations is something that the operating system is not designed to do and wants
 to avoid any problems my occur from an in place upgrade. Try at least restoring them back to the respective locations temporarily at least for the upgrade.

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Wireless Issues</h2>
                    <p>New Surface Pro 4. &nbsp;My wireless connected for a day, but now fails to connect to wireless access points that I have previously connected to. &nbsp;When I try to connect I'm prompted for the network key (and yes, it's the right one), but the connection always
 fails. &nbsp;Other devices in my org are connected to the wireless access points okay. &nbsp;This is the only Surface Pro in the office, and the only machine with problems. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I want to restore my laptop to factory settings but I personally installed Windows 7 on it. Will Windows 7 still be installed or will it be lost &amp; will I have Windows Vista again?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Factory Settings" means the way it left the factory. If you got it with Vista on it, it will gp back to Vista.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whaty do you want to do this? <span style="font-style: italic">
n my view, it's usually a mistake. With a modicum of care, it should never be necessary to reinstall Windows (7,&nbsp;Vista, or any other version). I've run Windows 3.0, 3.1, WFWG 3.11, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, and now Windows
 7, each for the period of time before the next version came out, and each on two or more machines here. I never reinstalled any of them
</span><span>(with a single exception--a problem that I worked on for weeks unsuccessfully)</span><span style="font-style: italic">, and I have never had anything more than an occasional minor problem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">It's my belief that this mistaken notion stems from the technical support people at many of the larger OEMs. Their solution to almost any problem they don't quickly know
 the answer to is "reformat and reinstall." That's the perfect solution for them. It gets you off the phone quickly, it almost always works, and it doesn't require them to do any real troubleshooting (a skill that most of them obviously don't possess in any
 great degree).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">But it leaves you with all the work and all the problems. You have to restore all your data backups, you have to reinstall all your programs, you have to reinstall all
 the Windows and application updates, you have to locate and install all the needed drivers for your system, you have to recustomize Windows and all your apps to work the way you're comfortable with.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Besides all those things being time-consuming and troublesome, you may have trouble with some of them: can you find all your application CDs? Can you find all the needed
 installation codes? Do you have data backups to restore? Do you even remember all the customizations and tweaks you may have installed to make everything work the way you like? Occasionally there are problems that are so difficult to solve that Windows should
 be reinstalled cleanly. But they are few and far between; reinstallation should not be a substitute for troubleshooting; it should be a last resort, to be done only after all other attempts at troubleshooting by a qualified person have failed.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">And perhaps most important: if you reformat and reinstall without finding out what caused your problem, you will very likely repeat the behavior that caused it, and quickly
 find yourself back in exactly the same situation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">If you have problems, post the details of them here; it's likely that someone can help you and a reinstallation won't be required.</span></p>

<h2>            &#34;dial-up connection&#34; dialog box keeps popping up</h2>
                    When I'm using my computer (OS: Windows Vista Business) offline, the "dial-up connection" dialog box (asking me if I want to&nbsp;connect to the Internet) pops up extremely frequently. This is super annoying!&nbsp; Is there any way&nbsp;I can get it to stop happening&nbsp;altogether
 (without affecting my ability, of course,&nbsp;to access the Internet by right-clicking the "Connect to a network"&nbsp;icon in the system&nbsp;tray)?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you may be able to provide.<br />

            From the internet options in IE, open the connections menu and select "never dial a connection" instead of "dial whenever a connection is not present". This will stop the automatic dialing but will still give you the capability to dial manually when needed.

<p>
</p><p>Also, check for Windows update&nbsp;to look for&nbsp;latest drivers for devices installed in your computer.</p>
<p>Refer to the below Microsoft Help Article on <span><span><strong>Install and Update drivers in Windows 10</strong>, written by one of our MVPs,
<strong>Andre da Costa.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Additionally, I would also suggest you to refer to the manufacturer/computer assembler's website to look for updated drivers for the devices installed in your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Method 3</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Identify any changes made on the computer before you&nbsp;started experiencing the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you recently installed a hardware device, such as a sound card or video card, an incorrect or improperly installed device driver might be causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Windows has in built Driver Verifier&nbsp;as well </span><span>to identify problematic drivers. The Driver Verifier Manager, tests each specified driver at startup. If it detects a problem, it identifies it and then stops it from running. Here's how:</span></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Type <strong>verifier</strong> in <strong>Windows Start menu Search box
</strong>and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Navigate to <strong>Create Standard Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>
Click Next </strong>&gt; <strong>Automatically select unsigned drivers </strong>&gt; <strong>
Next</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3.</strong> At last you have two options <strong>Cancel</strong> or <strong>
Finish</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you click on <strong>Cancel</strong>, no changes are made to your system configuration.</li></ul>
<p>From the list which is presented, you can manually try to <strong>Roll back</strong>,
<strong>Update</strong>, <strong>Disable</strong> or <strong>Uninstall the Driver</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you click on <strong>Finish</strong>, then restart the system, you may be presented with an error message.</li></ul>
<p>This will include the name of the buggy driver along with an error code. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Now reboot the system in <strong>Safe Mode with Networking
</strong>to update, disable or uninstall the particular driver.<br />
(Safe mode with Networking starts Windows in safe mode and includes the network drivers, services needed to access the Internet or other computers on your network).</p>
</span><span><br />
</span><span>
<p><strong>5. </strong>Type <strong>verifier/reset </strong>in Windows Start Menu Search and hit Enter to
<strong>disable</strong> the <strong>Driver Verifier Manager</strong>.</p>
</span>
