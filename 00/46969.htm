<h2>            Japanese language issues on Backward Compability</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm enjoying BC on Xbox One, but I found big issues on playing it - language issue.</p>
<p>I found some of games are not supporting Japanese though I bought them on Japanese Xbox 360.</p>
<p>Please fix them ASAP because I believe BC has launched untill we can play these games as our own language.</p>

<p>・Fable 2 (Game on Demand) - It is UK English as default and can't choose Japanese.</p>

<p>I heard some of friends are having same troubles on other games, so I'll let my Japanese friends post same issues on this thread.</p>
<p>Please check this thread and fix them.</p>

    <title>Making Windows 7 Task Manager show all processes from Startup folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lee_47  say:</h3>
<h2>            Making Windows 7 Task Manager show all processes from Startup folder shortcut&#63;</h2>
                    I need to know how to have the Windows Task Manager come up each time I boot up showing all the processes, via a shortcut in the Startup folder.<br />
<br />
For years, I've had the task manager come up every time but I always have to go through the ordeal of clicking the button at the bottom of the Processes tab to show all processes.<br />
<br />
I've wasted so much time searching for the answer but it seems everyone just keeps talking about creating a shortcut and altering it to run as administrator then double-clicking it whenever needed, which I already knew.<br />
<br />
But doing that and putting the altered shortcut in the Startup folder will not work, period. The task manager does not come up at all whenever the shortcut has been given admin rights, which makes no sense at all.<br />
<br />
When viewing the Properties on the actual taskmgr.exe file, under the Compatibility tab, there is a section at the bottom, Priviledge Level, that has a box to check to "Run this program as an administrator" but it is grayed out and cannot be checked. How do
 I fix it so I can check that box? That might be the solution I'm guessing.<br />
<br />
Do note, I refuse to disable UAC to remedy this and I will not use Process Explorer as a replacement.<br />
<br />
Please teach me the trick to having the task manager come up the way I want it.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />

<h2>            Power settings &#40;sleep&#47;hibernate&#41; not working properly in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Power settings - ignored</p>
<p>
</p><p>My power settings continue to be ignored on this Lenovo Yoga 700 14inch machine.</p>
<p>This has gone on a very long time.</p>
<p>Why does this machine ignore the power settings.</p>
<p>The screen saver works for a while and goes on after 3 minutes as it should.</p>
<p>Then after a couple hours, it doesn't work and the machine goes into sleep mode after a minute or so.</p>
<p>Machine is set to turn off monitor after 5 minutes and go to sleep in 10 minutes. Why does this never work right?? I thought that there would be a Windows update for this. &nbsp;How can it be allowed to go on this long??? &nbsp;I have tried all the troubleshooting
 and run the supposed solutions. Nothing has fixed this. &nbsp;Does anyone have a solution for this?</p>
<p>Bought machine in late 2015 and now we are at July 2016 and still doesnt follow the Power settings that i set. &nbsp;It is crazy for this to still be an issue.</p>

            <p>Thanks. have had this issue i think since i bought the Lenovo PC in late 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already done the troubleshooter and it didnt help it.</p>
<p>I also did the change plan settings a million times. That doesnt help. So method 2 and 3 didnt do anything.</p>
<p>I think i have updated the display driver already and that did not help. &nbsp;I can try that again (Method 1).</p>
<p>It is a major problem to always have to enter my MSFT password every time it goes to sleep after &nbsp;a minute or 2 of inactivity.. after being on for a while. I want this to work. &nbsp;No one has helped me.</p>

            <p>Ok, i updated the Intel HD Graphics 520 driver. Then the screen got very bright after the update.</p>
<p>Then i reduced the brightness and then couldnt get it back to level i wanted. That happens though with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The NVIDIA GeForce 940M driver is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i will see if this helps at all. &nbsp;If not, i need new solutions.</p>

            <p>The screen saver seems to be coming on at proper time, but i havent used the machine long enough to test properly.</p>
<p>I will try to test this weekend. &nbsp;Once NFL season begins, i will be on my machine all the time doing research to predict winners so i will definitely know if it is still an issue. It had seemed to work for a while in the past, but then it would eventually
 start going to sleep mode in a minute of inactivity. &nbsp;So i will need to stay on it for more than an hour to find that out.</p>

            <p>Ok, this is not working properly. It is going to sleep mode in 4 minutes of inactivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Lenovo update the Intel Graphics Driver and that did not help. &nbsp;This machine still ignores the power settings. &nbsp;It never works and never has. &nbsp;It is supposed to go into sleep mode in 10 minutes, not 4 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to make your computer listen to the Power settings and follow them? &nbsp;This has never worked properly on my machine. I am tired of logging in every time i am away for a brief duration of time. I need a solution that actually works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After being on pc all day, it seems to go into sleep mode after about 2 minutes of inactivity. That is not what i have set in power settings. I have 5 minutes for turning off display on battery power and 4 minutes for the screen saver to go on. &nbsp;Also, i
 set 10 minutes for the sleep mode so it doesnt seem to care about what i put as the settings. Can anyone fix this? &nbsp;Remains an issue and has been for over 6 months. &nbsp;Anyone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see many threads on Google ab this issue. Seems that thousands of pc users have this issue. I wonder why there is no good solution for it. &nbsp;I guess i will need to change my registry keys. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Have the same problem with Lenovo YOGA 3 Pro (1370) notebook, Windows 10.0.15063. Can get into sleep mode in just several minutes after inactivity. Have set it to get into sleep mode in 2 hours and blank screen in 5 min, so if I see screen just turning off
 and immediately find my note is in sleep mode, - something is obviously wrong. Played a bit, and when sleep is set to NEVER it did not get to sleep mode at all which is correct and not some hardware glitch.</p>
<br />
<p>Just another customer who would very much like to get a solution / fix.</p>

            1. Go to the Settings in your phone, locate Skype and reset Skype.
<br />
<br />2. If above doesn't work 
<br />a. Uninstall the Skype app by pressing and holding the Skype app icon. Tap the 'X' in the corner and then accept the confirmation message to delete it.
<br />
<br />b. Perform a “soft reset” by pressing and holding both the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons simultaneously for at least 10 seconds until you see the Apple logo. You can let go of both buttons after the Apple logo appears.
<br />
<br />c. Reinstall the Skype app from the App Store.
<br />
<br />d. Make sure that Skype is kept up-to-date by enabling it in your device's Settings &gt; General &gt; Background App Refresh

            Hi  menasse 
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience caused.
<br />
<br />Usually this means the Skype server is down in your region. Skype might be  doing maintenance work or there are too many users signing on cannot cope with the popularity. In any case — the issue is being looked in and everything should be back to normal in a few minutes.
<br />
<br />Just sign out of Skype then keep trying periodically.
<br />
<br />
<br />I recommend you monitor your Skype Status - Skype Support

<p>There's not a way specifically just the desktop font. &nbsp;If you change it, it will also change in a great many other places: folders, menus, title bars, other apps that read in your user variables to determine what font to use and such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also since screens aren't as universal as they were in the 90's (with varying icon density and resolutions; versus the old days when 1024x768 was just about the standard), setting different options can cause really unpredictable results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do want to get into the deep settings that control it, it's all in the registry. I wouldn't really recommend it, and make sure you make a full backup before you begin. &nbsp;It's all under here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\WindowMetrics</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, use a program like WindowBlinds by StarDock company (or programs like it). It makes it easy.</p>

<h2>            Elite Controller - Multiple Issues after repair</h2>
                    <p>My Elite Controller, which hasn't been touched since the last repair (by Xbox), has now got even
<strong>more</strong> issues:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>LS</strong>: Stick Drift</li><li><strong>D-PAD UP</strong>: Not functional</li><li><strong>D-PAD RiGHT</strong>: Not functional</li><li><strong>LB:</strong> Loose</li></ul>
<p>The controller has never been dropped, not even a scratch on it. I had previously tried to contact Mircosoft about it since then, I haven't got anywhere. The day it came back, it worked, until 3 days after (Within the return date after repair), but yet Microsoft
 didn't want to accept it. So since then, the £120 "<em>premium</em>" controller has been sat in its case. It's absolutely ridiculous&nbsp;that they send it back and it breaks within the first week. The issues cannot have been caused by me, as it is Stick Drift,
 an issue with the module, and 2 of the&nbsp;D-PAD buttons not registering. I've tried to register for it on the Devices website&nbsp;(support.microsoft.com/en-gb/devices) but have been stuck in a 'Retrieving your eligibility' loading screen for the past 10 minutes,
 even after multiple refreshes and clearing cache.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c60b2ec8-4085-4614-9826-5b0e39989c2f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c60b2ec8-4085-4614-9826-5b0e39989c2f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can get this controller repaired by Microsoft once and for all? I'm not happy about buying another one if the same issue will just end up happening to it, and then Microsoft not fixing it correctly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey GamingBoy177!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you're having issues with your Xbox One Wireless Elite Controller lets see what we can do to get you past this snag. Some of the issues youre describing could indicate there are damaged components within the controller itself. Your best option
 for repair would be to set up a call back by going here <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-gb/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Contact Xbox Customer Support</a>. There our representative will be able to provide you with any options we may have available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out</p>

<p>Hey Gamingboy you should definitely contact UK support 08005871102<br />
<br />
They should be able to offer a repair service if the device is within warranty still.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be aware after repair the warranty period is 90 day or what ever is left on the original 12 month warranty whichever is longer.<br />
<br />
If it is no longer under warrant be aware Microsoft do not offer an out of warranty repair service on any controller and you may need to purchase a new device</p>

<p>Ouch! I definitely wouldn't be a happy camper if I got a "repaired" elite controller back and it broke almost immediately after. If possible bring the repair order # up in the discussion when you contact Xbox support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope that you get that replaced without issue. Best of luck to you.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Windows Vista does not include a 16-bit subsystem. You will not be able to run 16-bit applications on Windows Vista directly.
</span></p>
<p><span>You can check if the program works in Windows XP compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Make older programs run in this version of Windows</a>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you are using Windows Vista Business, Windows Vista Enterprise or Windows Vista Ultimate edition, you can try to install Virtual PC and then you can install Windows XP on your virtual PC to run 16 bit applications.</span></p>
<p><span>You can download Virtual PC for Vista from the link below:<br />

<h2>            My laptop is stuck on the &#39;we couldn&#39;t complete the update undoing changes don&#39;t turn off your computer&#39;</h2>
                    <p>I have read other posts about this issue but can't find one that has a solution for me! I have an hp envy that is about 6 months old. I was connected to really slow internet at my school, left to go home at 17% into the update, opened my laptop at home and
 if was stuck on the 'we couldn't complete the update undoing changes don't turn off your computer'. It's been like this for 3 hours now. When I click the F8 button it only adjusts the volume, ctrl+alt+delete does nothing, F8+shift does nothing, taking the
 battery out doesn't work, turning it on and off doesnt work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is obviously how do I fix this issue?!&nbsp;</p>
<p>does this issue require the laptop to directly connect to the Internet, bc my apt complex internet requires you to login everytime you use it and I can't access that screen. Additionally, read that I can access the command screen (is that what it's called?)
 . How would I access a screen to fix restart the update or what not when I'm stuck on this screen?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

            <p><em>"...installation media..." </em>??? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's your answer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wow. &nbsp;Um, hey. Last time I checked, it was 2015 CE. &nbsp;I'm not trying be rude in saying this, but I do feel that it is my duty as a conscientious neighbor to gently remind you that nearly HALF OF THE WINDOWS 8 MACHINES THAT WERE PURCHASED LAST YEAR WERE MANUFACTURED
 WITHOUT OPTICAL DRIVES!!! </p>
<p>
</p><p>(Seriously, Microsoft MADE THIS OPERATING SYSTEM specifically to run on these transitional "2-n-1"-touch capable devices that have blurred the lines of previously established form factors... And we're here talking about
<em>optical media</em>? Really? &nbsp;I'm just stunned.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do any others of you fine <em>Micro</em>folk have an answer that is perhaps contemporary to the era of wirelessly-delivered installation files and "laptops" that fit into a fat guy's back pocket?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because an answer like that would help me out, seriously. &nbsp;Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Noah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm a M$ customer just like you, and I might have a mistaken idea about how your machine and Sam's are behaving, but, here goes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW - You and Sam never gave any of us, what kind of Windows® was installed prior to the glitch? May I assume that this was a Windows 8 OS? Or, was it 8.1, or 7?&nbsp; Does your hard drive have a Restore partition (it is D:\ on my Windows 8 laptop;&nbsp; the C:\ partition
 is of course, taken by the Windows 8&nbsp; OS). Do not allow anything to have permission to erase or change your Recovery partition.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, did Sam mean the 17% of installation was completed after the full download, or, did Sam/Noah mean that you had received only such a portion of the download when you left school? Before anybody can give you a GOOD answer, we needs you to answer the questions
 clearly and un-ambiguously. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would guess is, when Sam left the school while the update was 17% and trying to download, then, before he got home, he left the school's network, rode through a zone where the wi-fi signal dropped out unexpectedly to the laptop, and the download missed
 a stitch somewhere, so, later,&nbsp; it was missing some of the download and couldn't finish its installation. And, that download never will be able to finish it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Helpfully intended suggestion - Iff indeed you have a PC that looks like it cannot be stopped (without damaging the Windows OS, I guess) , and iff you have never turned it off since it hung up and it won't LET the power switch turn it off, and iff I interpreted
 Sam's report correctly, removing the battery didn't un-hang it (?) so I am assuming that he &amp; you had the charger cord plugged into the laptop and the house current while you took the battery out - then OK, try pulling the battery out AND unplug the charger
 power.&nbsp; That will kill the hung-up OS&nbsp; I think. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Get another PC, and check Acer's website for any instructions Acer has posted, relating to the recovery partition for your model and OS version.&nbsp; Follow them if Acer has them. It would be very helpful if a friend of yours bought the same model of laptop,
 then he/she can tell you whether the hard drive has a Recovery partition. Maybe, Acer will have a tool (app) that you could download on another PC to a USB flash drive, that will facilitate the repair using the Recovery partition. Maybe you can check support.acer.com
 on how to do the repair, Acer probably has an instruction sheet on their support website. If it is not obvious and easy to find that, then, submit a query to their version of this Forum.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next thing to try -&nbsp; then, you use the F1 (or F-whatever - open the BIOS and change the boot drive to D:\, connect the battery/power and start it up, and (here, I am flying blind - have never needed to do that, myself) see if that will automatically re-create
 or repair your Windows X on the C-drive.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Next thing to try - get a Linux boot "disk"/USB flash drive from a knowledgeable friend (maybe your Mom or Dad or big brother/sister would know someone),&nbsp; change the BIOS again so as to boot from it, and maybe you can get the recovery to run from the command
 line with their help. Probably need to download an app to reveal the Windows Product Key for your Windows (unique to that PC, and Windows will not install &amp; run without it if you are on 8/8.1) among the files. It would be on the M$ label if you have XP or
 Vista. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, yes - first, see if your BIOS has any diagnostic tools and tests and run those first - no use to waste your time trying to fix the OS if your hard drive is prematurely failing, or if you have RAM chips or a CPU gone bad or, etc. You might need to take
 it to a good, ethical professional computer repair guy. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can get Windows repaired, you still will need to reinstall your 3rd-party programs, i.e., any programs&nbsp; that were not supplied by Acer when the PC was new. Before installing those, reinstall your Anti-Malware (at least activate Windows Advanced Firewall
 and Windows Defender, and download Microsoft Security Essentials and run Microsoft System Security Scanner, and prior to running, update their malware definitions.&nbsp; Then, you need to run Windows Update and get all the Microsoft® Security patches and any other
 Important patches/updates, at the least.&nbsp; I have at least 186 of those now and counting. It will chew up hours of your time, on a 15 Mbps connection like mine. I had to go through that, upon running the Repair from Recovery partition last May, not a lot of
 fun. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck,&nbsp;&nbsp; hope this helps&nbsp; --&nbsp; </p>

<h3> king044  say:</h3>
<h2>            PX4 Headset chat not working</h2>
                    
<p>I just recently got a PX4 headset and have the stereo headset adapter that goes into the xbox one controller. I also have the cords to set up the sound from the TV. However, I don't have the cable that came with the headset that goes from the headset into
 the adapter itself so chat will work. I bought a 2.5mm male to 3.5mm male cable hoping it would suffice. The cord fits into the headset and adapter like its supposed to but chat still doest not work. Is there another cord I have to buy to get chat to work
 or is there another problem? Also, I already did the controller update. Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

<h3> ub6ib9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro is changing folder names without my permission.</h2>
                    I used a portable drive with personal files on it along with my main boot drive that runs windows 10 pro. The main boot drive contains all the user folders on the main boot drive. My portable drive has nothing to do with user folders but instead folders
 I have made that contain multiple files from multiple computers I own. On the portable drive I have folders named similar to documents or photos or videos but they all start with the word "Buzz" So an example would be: Buzz Pictures or Buzz Documents. When
 I decided to change the icon on these folders on my portable drive and apply the new icon change, at this point&nbsp; windows 10 does something very strange. It renames the folder to just "Documents" instead of just applying the new icon. So a folder called "Buzz
 Documents" changes without permission and without asking to just "Documents" Why does windows do this? How can it be made to stop doing it? I have to go back into the portable drive and change the folders names back to what it

You could give this a quick try...<br />
<br />
- Click Start<br />
- Click Control Panel<br />
- Open Add/Remove Programs<br />
- On the left side of the "Add/Remove Programs" window, click "Add/Remove Windows Components"<br />
- Do you have "Games" in this list?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - If so, check the box to the left, click "OK"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - When you click "OK" to exit the window, the installation should begin (if the "Games" option is there, of course)<br />

<p>Various websites -- and I know Google is one of them -- use your IP address to determine what country you are in and then redirect you to a version of the site that is in that country's language.&nbsp; For Google, enter the following in the address box of IE
 or Firefox (and then make a bookmark):</p>
<p>www.google.com/ncr</p>
<p>For other sites, there may or may not be as easy a workaround.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ultimate workaround is to browse using a proxy server that's located in an English-language country, but this is clumsy and may slow down your browsing.&nbsp; Proxy servers are typically used for anonymous surfing.&nbsp; You can Google for "public proxy servers"
 or "anonymous surfing", but for starters, <a href="http://www.publicproxyservers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Thanks for the response.&nbsp; I had already figured out the google method using the ncr but searching from there still brought up sites in Spanish.&nbsp; I went to the link you sent for some proxy servers and have bookmarked it.&nbsp; I got home from Mexico last night
 so will have to wait til I return to see if the proxy server works.&nbsp; I used to be in Tijuana every month and our computer tech there worked around it someway on just the computer I worked on and everything came up in English, but I cannot remember how he did
 it.&nbsp; Maybe he used a specific address in the network connection or changed the registry in some way on the computer I used.&nbsp; he is no longer there so I cannot ask him.&nbsp; All I could find searching for hours through Microsoft was the article regarding the default
 host but it did not help.&nbsp; Again, thank you so much for the proxy sites.&nbsp; And if anyone knows of a way to override the country or host or whatever it is called so as not to have to use a p

<p>When you were in Tijuana, did you connect to the Internet using the same Internet Service Provider as you do in whatever location you're in these days?&nbsp; If you were in the Tijuana office of a US company, your tech may have set your computer up to connect
 through the company's home network in the US.</p>
<p>I know some people who used to live in Merida.&nbsp; I don't recall that they had problems such as you describe, so I'll ask what they did.</p>

            When in Tijuana our internet service provider was a Mexican company, Telnet or something like that but we had a server there and he may have done something relating to it.&nbsp; It seems like there was a website he went to and I used to know the http address
 but can't remember it anymore. He had to allow me access to the internet on my computer and somehow in that setup he did something .&nbsp; I wish I could remember what it was.&nbsp; I know on my computer everything came up in English but on the administrator's computer
 hers was always in Spanish on the internet. What is you didn't use the automatic DHCP and input a specific internet address, subnet mask, default gateway, primary domain, etc.?&nbsp; Would that work? I may sound more computer literate than I am.&nbsp; I connected through
 another company's T1 internet access and had some problems a couple of years back and their T1 provider had me enter specific addresses instead of using the automatic.&nbsp; I do not have any idea if that wou

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Just as long shoot.</p>
<p>Log to the computer's TCP/IPv4 properties.</p>
<p>Uncheck the Auto DNS and put instead.</p>
<p>4.2.2.2</p>
<p>4.3.3.3</p>
<p>These are American public DNS servers it might resolve everything in english.</p>

<p>Jack's idea about using different DNS servers is worth trying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, although you can turn off getting the addresses of DNS servers automatically, you can't do anything about the IP address that you're assigned by the ISP.&nbsp; The<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>ISP</strong>
</span>might give you specific addresses to use (as you described with the T1 provider) instead of having your IP address automatically assigned by the ISP's DHCP server, but<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>you</strong>
</span>can't pick just any old IP address.</p>
<p>My family who used to live in Merida said that they didn't do anything special and had no issue with Google returning Spanish-language web sites, so that's no help for you.&nbsp; Before you give up on using Google's /ncr switch, delete all of your Temporary Internet
 Files as well as cookies from both Internet Explorer and Firefox (realizing that deleting cookies may lose some site customization features).&nbsp;</p>
<p>For IE, go to Tools &gt; Internet Options and on the General tab, click the buttons to Delete Files and Delete Cookies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Firefox, go to Tools &gt; Options.&nbsp; There are a few things to do here:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Content tab, there is a button to choose your preferred language for displaying web pages</li><li>On the Privacy tab, clear cookies as explained <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Deleting+cookies?s=delete+cookies&amp;as=s#Delete_all_cookies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> </li><li>On the Advanced tab, click the Network tab, then click the Clear Now button under Offline Storage</li></ol>
After you have cleared cache and networks for both IE and FF, run Disk Cleanup (Start &gt; Run &gt; cleanmgr &gt; OK) and then reboot the computer.&nbsp; Now go to www.google.com/ncr and see if you still get Spanish search results.

            <p>We go to Mexico often. <br />
We have found 3 options. <br />
ASKING for internet with a US address (as this has become more common since 2010 when this was asked)
<br />
OR using a Magic Jack, <br />
OR installing onto the laptop, a monthly paid program ($10 per month) called "Unblock Us" with chosen IP address of anywhere in the US.<br />
<br />
All 3 ways are described, in tedious detail, that anyone I hope can follow, are listed below.<br />
<br />
Most hotels will have 2 internet options now, one for locals, one for tourists. They don't ask which one you want, because they assume, unless you are speaking FLUENT Spanish, you are an english speaking gringo. LOL (and get the English IP address and password)
 So, as of late, its always been not an issue- but perhaps, if you are out of tourist towns, you might want to try one of the other 2 fixes if you still encounter this problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
When we stay longer than a week, we stay in time shares or rentals. In them we have access to the router and/ or an internet hardwired (ethernet connection) option for secure web browsing. We then use a product called "Magic Jack" and use that between the pc
 or laptop, and the connections and hook up a land line phone- THIS is somehow KEY to it all working. the Magic Jack alone, with no phone, doesn't work to get english internet browsing.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Either between the pc and ethernet and PHONE CORD for just one in english, or before the router (but phone/land line still plugged into the MG @ router), for all computers and wifi in english. Somehow it appears to work backwards through your pc.... Im really
 not sure HOW it works, but I know NOT using it, we have the same problem and <br />
EVERYTHING is in Spanish, and setting the computer or IP MANUALLY on the laptop<br />
wont make any difference. Plus, or course, you get the benefit or FREE PHONE CALLS back home to a cell phone or land line if the receiver doesn't have skype. (lol)<br />
Our Magic Jack has an American phone/address that we picked out for this very reason. We recently added a second one (MJ) to our kit, with a Canadian address (Mostly for cheap phone calls within Canada- but thats another story).<br />
Using the magic Jack, we NEVER see Spanish pages while browsing, and I only open plain old "google.com"<br />
That does, however, require at least having access to an ethernet cord, or router, or the internet box itself. Wifi to a laptop, with Magic Jack pluged in, then a phone into the jack, somehow ALSO, does not work. I don't understand or know why.... but on Wifi
 with MJ, its 50/50 english/Spanish. Kinda a cr@p shoot as to the language.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I risk sounding long winded, with a lot of details and information on what I use and how I use it and where and why. For that,
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/12ee567e-ec23-49f6-8649-bc830b793697" title="donnamctx">
donnamctx</a> (and other dear readers), I do apologize. <br />
I wanted to the clear, with no room for misunderstanding on how this works for us, because, after all, Im trying to offer advice and information. Also, theres nothing worse then people saying "install the *insert name of item, program, or whatever* and use
 it. <br />
Insert it WHERE? What folder? Or physically, attached to WHAT? Do I use it according to instructions, or have you failed to explain that you put it someplace else, for a reason you also forgot to explain. It DOES happen.<br />
Whats even worse, is they have a fix. You have questions. And suddenly, they never return to the forum, to help you further. UGGG! Yes, I have had issues. Can you tell?<br />
I dont know about you, but I don't know all things, and if Im asking for help on something, I want you to talk to me like a child so I fully understand.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps solve your problem! (and helps others with the same issue, looking for help)<br />
This is what we use. Both of the 2 units appear to work equally well. As I said, we have and use 2- one "go" and one "express"<br />
We do also use the phone app on our cell phones. Perhaps that explains why our only wifi item (cell phone with app) also always appeared in English, while wifi and MG on PC still, somehow was 50/50. Its just a thought.<br />
http://www.magicjack.com/index.html<br />
It describes it as "VoIP internet phone service" but the key word is INTERNET! Yes, for PCs and Laptops to access the internet through it as well!</p>
<p>
</p><p>***Also, recently, when we have NO access EXCEPT Wifi, I have discovered an IP INTERNET location changer to use on the laptop, that has given us (so far) a 100% success rate of English internet web browsing. Plus the only person I knew without email and/or
 internet access- just get a cell phone! Good job GRANDMA! (So no longer a need to phone a land line to check in and talk)<br />
Thus we will not be adding more months usage on out MG- but will still keep them, just in case.<br />
I now use "Unblock Us" (with US settings)<br />

I recently migrated to Windows 7 and Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; In Windows Mail, I could copy a column of email addresses from an Excel spreadsheet, paste them into the bcc field, click the bcc button to open an address window, then return to the email and all of
 the addresses would be in the bcc box separated by semicolons and ready to send.&nbsp; Windows Mail Live doesn't seem to do this, and when I copy in a column of email addresses the message won't send -- it says that there are no valid email addresses in the box.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
How do I copy a column of email addresses from Excel into a Windows Live Mail address box so it will send?</p>

<p>I'm not sure if it's the preview update but when I tried loading a new disc into my Xbox One it says i have to clean the disc... even if i just put the disc back in that i was just playing... I have to turn off my X1 and put in the disc to turn it on to
 get the X1 to read the disc... </p>

<p>Hi there the 0x21 error is a well known bug in the preview. When you try ejecting the disc does the console draw the disc back in? If this is the case leave the disc in there once drawn back in and wait 30 seconds, the disc drive will wake up and you should
 be able to swap out the discs. This would be best posted here <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_update_preview/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Stop writing, stop sharing ideas that work maybe once, and read the comment above me, by NJDevil. Everything else is a temporary fix that doesn't work until they release a new update for beta users.</p>
