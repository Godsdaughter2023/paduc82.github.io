                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Upgrading to Windows 10 has resulted in my NVIDIA GeForce GT 630M to completely disappear from my Device Manager, and naturally, when I try to install the appropriate driver (<a href="http://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/91984/en-uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.co.uk/download/driverResults.aspx/91984/en-uk</a><span>[1]</span>)
 it fails...</p>

</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">It is as though the GPU has completely vanished from my laptop, leaving only my integrated graphics Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000 to appear in my Display Adapters. Has anybody else experienced the same problem and found a solution?</p>

            <p>Hi Krishna, thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the first method (Hardware and Devices troubleshooter) did not work. I cannot do the second method (installing all drivers) as my laptop manufacturer, Acer, are only providing drivers up to Windows 8.1 for my laptop :-(</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for the late reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have drivers only till Windows 8.1 i would suggest you install them in compatibility for Windows 8.1 on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Download the drivers for Windows 8.1</li><li>On Windows 10, Right click on them and select properties&nbsp;</li><li>Select compatibility tab and check the option "Run this program in compatibility for"</li><li>Select Windows 8 from the drop down.</li><li>Select apply and OK.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Games for Windows Live - Marketplace Crashing&#33;</h2>
                    <p>First off, I've been put through the ringer with this issue. I started by going to Xbox Support, who sent me to Microsoft Support, who sent me BACK to Xbox Support, who sent me to Rockstar games Support, who still haven't answered, and many.. MANY more hours
 of tedious file moving and more. I'm to the point where I just want to toss my PC out the window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A little bit of a backstory</p>
<p>Me and a few friends want to play Grand Theft Auto 4. Why? Cause why not.. I installed it, to get everything working, but was greeted with a billion different issues consisting of Social Club not letting me sign in, GTA 4 crashing and the issue that I'm
 here for, Games for Windows Life - Marketplace is crashing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a Gif of whats happening&nbsp;https://gyazo.com/6704944fc83bffbca85f10f11e00a00a</p>
<p>- I open the Program</p>
<p>- It loads for like a second</p>
<p>- It freezes</p>
<p>- Eventually it asks me to Close the Program or Wait for it to Respond.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried reinstalling Games for Windows about 10 different times, I've (out of spite) have reinstalled the game, Installed different files. I'm just lost on what to even try next..</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions for you guys..</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Any suggestions on how to fix this?</p>
<p>2- Does anyone know how to completely remove Games for Windows Live - Marketplace (Files, Settings, ETC.?)</p>
<p>3- Does anyone know how to stop GFWL from Automatically signing in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got some log files, but I'm not sure if they will be of any help.</p>

            Wow, some really helpful comments up there .............
<div><br />
<div>My 2 cents :</div>
<div><br />
<div>Whatever file you are trying to open is probably corrupt.</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>Try opening it with the original software and save it under a different name, or re-download it.</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade flashing background image.</h2>
                    Upgraded my HP desktop from&nbsp;Windows 7 to Windows 10. Upgrade seemed to go off without a hitch. When I signed in I got only a flashing background image, no icons. I am not able to boot in Safe Mode. I am only able to access Task Manager. I tried one fix
 that I found online: Open task manager and stop (1) Problem Reports and Solution Control Panel Support .... (2) Windows Error Report Service. Problem Reports and Solution Control Panel Support was already stopped. Windows Error Report Service was running in
 manual mode, when I tried to stop it I received an error message something to the effect that my command could not be accepted. Called Microsoft support and talked to a tech for 2 hours, he could not help and scheduled a call back from "Level 2 Support". They
 did not call back as scheduled. My computer has been down for 5 days now. BTW I was running Norton 360 when I upgraded and have read that Norton has been the problem in some cases. Help please.

            Thank you for the reply<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/332b99bd-fe09-4403-a6e0-57aee6d67019" title="Divya M"> Divya M</a> . I was not able to boot to safe mode. When I rebooted the computer and held the shift key I only got a blank
 black screen. I was, however, able to access task manager by right clicking on the task bar on the blinking screen with my background image on it.<br />
<br />
Here is what did work: Open task manager ... under file (top left) click "Run new task" ...&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/forum/windows-29/flashing-screen-after-windows-10-upgrade-4538547/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1) !important">type
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1) !important">msconfig</span></span></a> (it is hard to type as screen blinks).
<strong>Important: If you can not type in the box, click browse </strong>(bottom right of the command window)<strong> and scroll down until you find msconfig and click on it</strong>... In the new box that opens (it may be behind the task manager box) go to
 Service Tab .... Scroll until you find 2 tasks that need to be stopped ... (1) Problem Reports and Solution Control Panel Support .... (2) Windows Error Report Service.... Disable these by unchecking .... Click Apply ... Click OK ... If you are prompted to
 restart, then restart computer.<br />
<br />
I was unable to type in the command box and this is where Microsoft support gave up, twice. Here is the piece that Microsoft support was missing:

<h2>            I&#39;m sort of Fed Up, but cannot do anything about it.</h2>
                    <p>Oh how MS has screwed me, let me count the way....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm sorry MS, but this is honestly how I'm starting to feel, and I don't have the option of switching to something else.&nbsp; You seem to think that nobody knows how to do anything on their&nbsp;own computer.&nbsp; Of course, there are some that don't, I'll freely admit
 that.&nbsp; But what about those of us who are used to doing for ourselves, and understand how to research and learn when we need to.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll enumerate things here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1) First,&nbsp;MS forces people to upgrade to&nbsp;their "better" much "improved" OS.&nbsp; If anyone would like to disagree with my use of the word "force", how much longer is your XP (the last OS that accepted that some users were actually intelligent,) going to be operating?&nbsp;
 Mine has already been shut down.&nbsp; It seems that all 4 of my legally obtained versions of XP are now invalid.&nbsp;&nbsp;2 I purchased for 2 different computers, 1 I got from work at Dell (and was supposedly a corporate license,) and one I got from school as part of
 a text book package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One day, I log onto my computer and it is suddenly watermarked that it is not genuine.&nbsp; What??&nbsp; Call MS, and it seems that the CD-Key (which I never gave out,) is suddenly in use all over the world.&nbsp; Ok, maybe I got a virus and it was stolen.&nbsp; I have 3 other
 valid versions, my second computer has long since been downgraded for vintage use.&nbsp; I'm not willing to pay $100 to get a new key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Format, re-install with my second purchased XP, which I had installed once, then removed when the system was downgraded.&nbsp; Validated it over the phone (the internet couldn't do it for some reason.)&nbsp; Everything seemed to work just fine.&nbsp; Only 3 days later....
 "Not Genuine" appears.&nbsp; It seems that this "version" (the exact same type as my first one, same package, same store, same time of purchase, same price,) is only valid for limited activations.&nbsp; I only ever activated it the one time, and the other one had gone
 through 4 computer upgrades (and 4 activations.)&nbsp; Sorry, nothing we can do (says MS,) we'll issue you another key if you sign up for a year of service for $100 (ok, $99, but close enough)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Well, I'm keeping my cool.&nbsp; I dig out my school version which I never even opened.&nbsp; Tear open the package, re-format and re-install again.&nbsp; Only this time, it refuses to validate at all.&nbsp; Do you have the receipt?&nbsp; Well, I got it in 2003??&nbsp; I don't remember
 when.&nbsp; You'll need to contact the people you got it from.&nbsp; 2 weeks of dealing with MS and the University, I finally gave up and moved to my last legal copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>BTW - you should really see the pattern by now.&nbsp; Suffice it to say.&nbsp; It seems that Dell gave their corporate key to 3 million people in 100 different countries, because 2 weeks after installing it (and it validated just fine,) 2 days after getting support
 from MS for a driver issue (and they requested the CD-Key to give me that help, and failed to solve the issue) the CD-Key was locked out (just like my first one,) for the same reason.&nbsp; I hadn't installed anything on it that I didn't get directly from MS.&nbsp;
 Even my device drivers came from them.&nbsp; I was being exceptionally careful to avoid any chance of getting a virus this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, I'm faced with paying $99 dollars to get another key (that I strongly suspect will only be good for a few weeks at most.)&nbsp; Or, upgrading.&nbsp; Well, I think you know which I chose since my list now exists.&nbsp; I am now the extremely sad owner of Window 7 (64-bit,
 because of MS refusal to use segmentation - the software is there, in the 32 bit code, but permanently locked out.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2) I have a list of command line tools I use regularly.&nbsp; Yes, with MS's refusal to include 16-bit support, I now had to re-write them for a 32-bit OS at least, but I was up to that challenge (though I'm still debugging.)&nbsp; My usual policy is to just copy
 them into the path, so I can use them anywhere.&nbsp; A while after I did this, they stopped working for some reason.&nbsp; It boggled me for a short time, but I didn't worry to much about it, just copied them into the path again.&nbsp; I had assumed I had removed them for
 "some" reason and didn't remember.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only, it happened again.&nbsp; I still haven't found out "what" is doing it, but it appears that Windows 7 doesn't trust me.&nbsp; It automatically removes programs that it doesn't approve of (even when they aren't viruses, or even
 cause a "ping" on their own virus scanner.)&nbsp; My only solution, I had to add yet another item to the already absurdly long path (1018 characters long before my addition)&nbsp;in Windows 7 and put all my utilities there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3) The ridiculously handicapped volume controls.&nbsp; I'm old school, I use MIDI files.&nbsp; I use MIDI files a lot. They are extremely small, and with the correct tools sound very good.&nbsp; Only, it is now impossible to control the volume of MIDI files.&nbsp; We can't
 be trusted to control the individual device volumes any more.&nbsp; So what does this mean?&nbsp; Good MIDI files encode volume&nbsp;values as well&nbsp;(most people who deal with composing music know that good music has variable volumes.)&nbsp; Look at some sheet music when you get
 a chance (MIDI file is just encoded sheet music really,) with someone that&nbsp;can explain the symbols.&nbsp; You'll see that it includes instructions on how loud to play certain parts, when to&nbsp;lower the volumes, when to raise them,&nbsp;etc... &nbsp;Well, all that work that
 composers have done to make their music the best it can be (by making this part quite, this part louder, etc..) is totally wasted.&nbsp; MS, I guess, thinks that all that effort that composers such as Mozart (who was deaf, so he really had to work to get it done,)
 was totally wasted and useless.&nbsp; So, I guess the consider every good composer to be idiots, and everyone&nbsp;who enjoys music by&nbsp;the "greats" are also idiots.&nbsp; More on MIDI later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Next on the handicapped volume controls.&nbsp; The individual outputs are gone.&nbsp; You have 1 output&nbsp;that can be set to 3 devices (Sound Blaster Speakers, ATI HDMI Audio, and Sound Blaster SPDIF.)&nbsp; Never mind that my sound card actually has&nbsp;5 outputs (more if you
 consider the channeled outputs separately.)&nbsp; Headphones, Line-Out, Speaker-Out, SPDIF, &amp; Optical.&nbsp; It actually has 2 Headphone outs (and in XP I controlled to volumes separately,) 1 SPDIF Out,&nbsp;1 Optical outs, 2 Line-Outs, and up to 4 Speaker Outs (the last
 intended for front, side, back, &amp; center/sub.)&nbsp; Windows 7 gives you ...... Speakers or SPDIF.&nbsp; Period, nothing else, no other options.&nbsp; If I were using 7.1 speakers, it would let me adjust the "balance" if I really dig for the settings (or use the Creative
 Labs mixer.)&nbsp; Of course, the CL mixer had the more advanced controls, but Windows 7 doesn't give them access to the device to adjust them (at least that's what CL told me, they aren't allowed to build Windows 7 drivers that access the HW directly like they
 did with Windows XP.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I guess nobody ever uses the Line-Out, Optical Out,&nbsp;or Headphones.&nbsp; I'm right, aren't I, nobody EVER uses those, right??&nbsp; At least, that's what MS seems to believe.&nbsp; You cannot adjust those volumes, so, if I don't remember to adjust things some day, I'm
 going to seriously injure my ears when&nbsp;I use my headphones.&nbsp; Do you think I'll be able to blame MS for that?&nbsp; Yeah, probably not.&nbsp; I'm just lucky a sound played after plugging them in the first time before I actually put the buds in my ear.&nbsp; I'm surprised
 they still work (the ear buds that is.)&nbsp; The sound coming from those tiny little buds were extremely painful and they were at least 4 feet away from me at the time.&nbsp; the sound played was a relatively quiet one as well (a little "beep" sound.)&nbsp; I shudder to
 think how it would have felt if I had put them on, then started up a MIDI file (which always plays at max volume.)&nbsp; If I ever want to permanently deafen someone, I'll put headphones on them, turn up my system volumes, and play a MIDI file (I would NEVER do
 that, I'm just saying, is this what MS envisions?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Next on the Volume control list...&nbsp; Ever look at the record options?&nbsp; It gives me 3 of my inputs.&nbsp; Line-In, SPDIF, and Microphone.&nbsp; I'm wondering where my Optical input is?&nbsp; It seems, that MS has decided that nobody uses this.&nbsp; Ok,&nbsp; I'll admit it, I never
 use it.&nbsp; I would like the option some day though.&nbsp; It also doesn't list my CD input (either digital or analog, and I now my card has those, I connect the Blue Ray drive to them.)&nbsp; Ever look for other record options?&nbsp; They don't exist.&nbsp; You cannot record anything
 else.&nbsp; Want to record a mix with an audio file (for example?)&nbsp; Well, MS has decided that you aren't allowed to do that.&nbsp; I guess they feel that Karaoke is an abomination and should be eliminated.&nbsp; Having listened to some of it, I can understand the attitude.&nbsp;
 While were at it, lets destroy everything Tchaikovsky (not really, I like some of his work.)&nbsp; Oh, and&nbsp;lets destroy all of Shakespeare's works as well (not to mention the 1st amendment.)&nbsp; Gone is "What You Hear" as a recording option.&nbsp; Gone is the ability to
 record any of the output channels for that matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The final bit about the volume controls.&nbsp; I actually like being able to adjust the volume of individual applications.&nbsp; I mean, some developers have no concept of auditory balance.&nbsp; They produce audio that you cannot adjust (in the game or application,) at
 ridiculous volume levels (high or low.)&nbsp; It would really be nice if MS had allowed me to adjust the volume of an application without actually loading it, but I can hope (probably in vain,) that that is the next step.&nbsp; What I don't like is the total elimination
 of adjusting individual audio type as well.&nbsp; You cannot balance your different audio sources.&nbsp; You have 2 volume controls "period".&nbsp;&nbsp;Device and Application.&nbsp; Apparently, MS somehow became aware that everyone in the world (ever last person in existence,) was
 misusing the ability to balance individual audio types as well as sources.&nbsp; I mean, its so confusing having MIDI, WAVE, CD, SPDIF, etc... listed.&nbsp; Why can't I just set it to show 1 volume and not worry about everything else... Wait a minute, wasn't I able
 to do that in XP?&nbsp; I'm so stupid, I can't possibly do something like that.&nbsp; Ok, that's mean, maybe some people really don't know to do something like that.&nbsp; I could accept reversing the case.&nbsp; Allowing someone who is smart enough to read the instructions (or
 do a web search even,) can turn those controls "ON" because the default to "OFF".&nbsp; But apparently MS, doesn't trust people to have those controls.&nbsp; Was there a rash of people damaging their equipment or themselves because of poor balance control?&nbsp; Were there
 enough to justify classification of all users as auditory idiots?&nbsp; If so, why were there no reports of such massive numbers of injuries and destroyed equipment in the news?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>4)&nbsp; Driver installs.&nbsp; Pretty much all installs really, but drivers are the most egregious.&nbsp; Everything else, you can get around if you are persistent and willing to do the research necessary.&nbsp; But drivers (kernel mode,) are literally impossible to install
 (if they aren't approved by MS,) without completely disabling your security or actually hacking the OS (which violates the EULA.)&nbsp; What is the approval method?&nbsp; Why paying huge sums of money, of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I wrote a single driver for personal use.&nbsp; OK, I'll admit it, I'm not that good of a programmer, I took someone else's code (that they made freely available and open source,) and altered it for my use.&nbsp; I compiled it myself.&nbsp; I went to install it, and wasn't
 allowed.&nbsp; My own code, on my own system, and obviously I'm too stupid to have gotten it right.&nbsp; Ok, I can admit that it might have had a few bugs, I didn't mind self signing the code and going into test mode (off the net, it weakens security,) and testing
 the driver.&nbsp; Well, it worked fine.&nbsp; I tried everything I could think of to break it, and it handled it flawlessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Ok, back out of test mode (it stopped loading of course.)&nbsp; Lets see how to get it to install in full security mode.&nbsp; Here is where I have a problem.&nbsp; To get it signed, I have to pay a minimum of $300/year.&nbsp; That is assuming I get lucky and the multi-stage
 cross-signing works fine across the board.&nbsp; Do the search, some people have bought certificates from companies that cross-signed fine a week before the purchase, but failed now.&nbsp; Another option is to send the code to MS and pay them to quality test it and
 release it (assuming they are even willing to do so with something this small, that is open-source to boot.)&nbsp; Don't know how much that costs, but probably a lot more than $300 (though it might be good for more than a year.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is code that I know rather well.&nbsp; I know it's safe, I compiled it on this exact system.&nbsp; Isn't there anything in place to at least let me install it on the system I built it on?&nbsp; Of course not, I'm too stupid to install such dangerous thing on my system.&nbsp;
 OK, there are people out there that will install anything.&nbsp; I can see making it difficult, but making it impossible?&nbsp; Make it something that can only be done locally and manually (cannot be automated in software.)&nbsp; I can accept that.&nbsp; But let me maintain full
 security while still installing something I know is safe.&nbsp; If I turn out to be wrong, it's my own fault.&nbsp; If I'm smart enough to do the research and jump through the proper hoops to get it installed, I'm smart enough to accept that.&nbsp; And I'm probably smart
 enough (or at least lazy enough,) not to do the same to install something I don't already trust.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I did toy with the idea of trying to convince someone who already has a valid certificate to sign it for me.&nbsp; But realized quickly that it isn't something I can really ask someone to do.&nbsp; They paid good money for that certificate, they need it to produce
 and sell their own products.&nbsp; I cannot ask them to spend the time to verify my code is safe without any chance of making a profit on it.&nbsp; Nor can I ask them to sign it blind (as it would have their signature on it, and if I distributed it, it would be their
 reputation on the line.)&nbsp; Also, I cannot be 100% sure that I won't need to make any future modifications to the code and then I would need them to do it all over again.&nbsp; Since it is MS's rules that caused the issue, I wouldn't hesitate to ask them to do it,
 but they refused without me going through the full validation process (and paying them of course.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Because of Parkinson's induced heart issues (my heart has stopped on&nbsp;5 separate instances when I was under only slight amounts of stress,) I can no longer work, and the government (in THEIR infinite wisdom,) has ruled that I only need $741 / month to live
 on (after paying $425/month in rent - still trying to get housing assistance, and getting $60 in food assistance.)&nbsp; From the remaining $316 I have to get the remainder of a month's food, averaging $120 or&nbsp;$180/month with the $60 (and I'm not eating steaks.&nbsp;
 Its&nbsp;mostly beans, vegetables, sandwiches, soups, etc...)&nbsp; I smoke, and am under doctor's orders NOT to quit (shocked me as well, but it could actually kill me to try.)&nbsp; So, because of federal taxes, I spend $120 (after switching to eCigs,) on that.&nbsp; Oh, and
 they are pushing to start taxing eCigs the same as tobacco cigarettes, so that could go up drastically.&nbsp; So far, that leaves me $79/month to pay medical expenses (not much thanks to Medicare/Medicaid,)&nbsp; put gas in my car, buy incidentals (laundry soap, dish
 soap, body soap, toilet paper, etc..) make routine repairs (a head lamp burned out in my car, for example, still have to replace it.)&nbsp; On average,&nbsp;I usually end up having to wait a few day (at the end of every month,) to get things done.&nbsp; I'll probably never
 upgrade my computer again (for example,) what I have is it for the rest of my life (I'll have to switch to UNIX I guess when MS disables Windows 7 like they did XP.)&nbsp; So, I'd like to ask MS... How do they expect me to pay $300/year or even more as a single
 payment to certify a driver I built myself and cannot sell?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>5)&nbsp; I promised to come back to MIDI.&nbsp; Much of this doesn't really fall into a "You are to stupid to be trusted with this" category, so it doesn't apply to my current argument.&nbsp; It is however a solid (IMHO,) complaint on the decisions MS made in building
 its latest operating systems.&nbsp; As stated, I work a lot with MIDI files.&nbsp; I don't do anything professionally, so I don't make any sort of profit on them.&nbsp; Back when I was working hard (and making good money I'm rather proud to say,) I spent quite a bit on software
 and equipment for this.&nbsp; None of this works any more.&nbsp; I'm making do by attaching things to my vintage system instead, but I'd rather use my good system.&nbsp; Yes, the software is Windows 95 (it is 32 bit, but still won't run in Windows 7 - it cannot access the
 HW like it wants too.)&nbsp; Oh, the HW doesn't work any more either - and I had long since switched to a USB MIDI interface instead of using the one on the sound card (sound card doesn't seem to have it any more.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As a final note to the MIDI issue.&nbsp; MS has decided that nobody needs to access any MIDI device other than their own WaveTable Synth.&nbsp; Want to attach an external MIDI device?&nbsp; Well, good luck with that.&nbsp; It might attach just fine (well, mine seemed too,)
 but unless you use specialized software just for that device you'll never get a response from it.&nbsp; MS has now locked the Default MIDI device (device 0) as their own WaveTable.&nbsp; A quick not about that.&nbsp; I'm sorry MS, but your GS WaveTable is a bit of a joke.&nbsp;
 The old Adlib FM synth sounds better.&nbsp; Windows XP had a MIDI Mapper as device "0" that was just a programmable re-director with a Control Panel stub to set it.&nbsp; What it did was take the MIDI stream (sent to default or device 0,) and pipe it to whichever device
 you selected in it's settings.&nbsp; The setting disappeared in Vista, but I'm told the MIDI Mapper is still there (never used Vista myself,)&nbsp;and it's settings can still be adjusted but only manually (in the registry,) or with 3rd party software.&nbsp; Windows 7 is
 supposed to work the same, but most of the SW doesn't fully work for me (maybe it's my 64-Bit.)&nbsp; I managed to find one that works, though I shouldn't have had to do that.&nbsp; From what I understand, if you are using Windows 8, the MIDI Mapper has been completely
 removed.&nbsp; So your only choice is to manually change device 0 every time.&nbsp; Unlike with Windows XP (or Vista I'm told,) any&nbsp;application that lets you select the MIDI output device no longer gives me the option to select default (or device 0,) to get the MIDI
 Mapper (letting me change it from a common location if I wanted.)&nbsp; It only lists my current "default" as 0, and then the others are 1 through whatever.&nbsp; Which is exacerbated by MS deciding that I don't need to use the SoundFont capabilities of my Sound Blaster.&nbsp;
 I had to get a completely software driven (instead of the HW on my card,) SoundFont "emulator" to get my SoundFonts back.&nbsp; Lets not get into having to have yet "another" driver installed to get EAX support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In conclusion, what it all boils down too, it seems that MS has decided that every single one of it's end users are idiots.&nbsp; They cannot be trusted&nbsp;with something as simple as maintaining their own audio balances.&nbsp; Every OS I've seen since Windows XP has
 been, IMHO, an exorcise in "dumbing down" the interface.&nbsp; What about those who are intelligent and want the ability to customize?&nbsp; I imagine the entire design team laughed for hours after that question, it seems they cannot conceive of anyone as smart as they
 are.&nbsp; There are many other complaints, but most of those are self-fixable with time an patience.&nbsp; These are the ones (I've encountered so far,) that cannot be fixed unless MS admits that some users are actually intelligent and may need this functionality and
 puts out patches to add this functionality back in.&nbsp; I shouldn't have to seek (and maybe pay,) for basic functionality of this nature.&nbsp; Some of which cannot be had at any price.&nbsp; I did a search for some of the things I'd like "back" and some of the ones I've
 found cost more than Windows 7 itself did.&nbsp; And I'm not even sure they would work.&nbsp; Or if they did, that MS won't decide to disable them in a future patch.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 reinstall with Secure Boot enabled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blasio onogur  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 reinstall with Secure Boot enabled</h2>
                    <p>I wonder how a reinstalled Windows 10 gets activated; whether it needs the Secure Boot keys stored in the UEFI, it needs to be bundled to a Microsoft account, it asks Microsoft's servers if it has a configuration
 to which a Windows activation belongs or the installer already has a key built-in.</p>
<p>I am curious only because I intend to reinstall Windows 10 onto a laptop of mine using the recently released Media Creator tool. The notebook currently uses Master Boot Record (in legacy mode) to boot that I intend
 to change for the Secure Boot function of the UEFI, and with so little knowledge about the activation process of the reinstalled Windows 10 I do not wish to risk having to buy Windows again.</p>

    <title>Asus n61 crashes due to ELAN driver update included with build 511 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timmoxv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Asus n61 crashes due to ELAN driver update included with build 511</h2>
                    <p>My installation of Win10 on my old ASUS laptop N61JQ that my kids use went pretty well but every time it tries to update the ELAN touchpad driver it crashes the PC seriously so that everything freezes requiring a reboot. Reboots work for a short time but&nbsp;eventually
 I can't even get to the OS, even using safe mode. The boot tools don't fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the MS tool to prevent installation of a new update for that ELAN driver which worked well until the build 10586 came along since it seems the newer ELAN driver is automatically included in build 10586 since I have tried several times to install
 that build and then quickly roll back the ELAN driver but something always crashes even if the roll-back seems to work OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have solved the issue by installing the original win 10 build (10240) from DVD and blocking both the ELAN driver update and the build 10586 update using the MS show/hide tool. The only non-win 10 driver I had to install was the 64-bit win 7 driver for
 the webcam since&nbsp;the vision&nbsp;was upside down and all has been working well for 3 weeks now but I guess that I will have a very limited update path unless I choose to show the build 10586 update again but there lies my problem with the ELAN driver. The working
 ELAN touchpad driver installed with build 10240 and working fine is "ELAN Touchpad 11.15.0.18_X64".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is an old laptop and my win 10 install on my main laptop went perfectly well but it would be great to get the N61jq back up to date with the main win 10 builds. Any ideas?</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>The only other thing I can try is another clean install to v1511 via DVD without internet access and then see if that build has the bad driver pre-loaded or if it is downloading it before first use. I then might be able to use the show/hide update to block
 it. What do you think?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>That might&nbsp;be worth a&nbsp;try.</p>
<p>

    <title>Impossible to use Lexmark x9575 printer with Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frb-montreal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Impossible to use Lexmark x9575 printer with Windows 7</h2>
                    I have a Windows 7 computer and a Lexmark x9575 printer (a few years old). I downloaded the Windows 7 driver and installed it (successfully, it seems), but for a reason I don't understand this printer does not show as an option when I want to print a document.
<br />
At the same time, the same driver was installed on my daughter's computer (Windows 7 as well, with the same driver) and she can print without any problems.
<br />
Please help!&nbsp;

            Hello, thank you for your answer!<br />
Here are my answers to your questions:<br />
1. no change other than upgrading to Windows 7 (or did you have specific changes in mind that could create the problem?)<br />
2. the printer is detected by the system (see attached image), I see it in Device manager indeed.
<br />
It says there is no pilot for it, but I have installed, uninstalled and reinstalled, with shutdowns in between tries. I used the trouble shooter, but no positive result.<br />
3. I had not tried to set up the printer using wi-fi -- I just tried, but the result is the same as with a wired connection.<br />
I tried both methods you suggested: there are no issues with the hardware (the printer works with another W7 computer, and my system is a very standard system, nothing funky, pirated or otherwise out of the ordinary).<br />

            Yes, the browser was the problem. Used Mozilla Firefox instead of, but it still took more than 3 hours to download. Many thanks for you help, you are a star!

Game image is very large (7.21 GB), took about 3 hours to download.</p>
<p>Starting game is fine, can play the first level, but when trying to move to the next level this error comes up</p>

<p>Game Error</p>
<p>This disc is unreadable.</p>
<p>etc</p>

<p>All you can do is "OK" which takes you back to Xbox home screen.</p>
<p>Restarting the system has no effect. Tried deleting the game and re-downloading. NOTE - my son said he thought that the 2nd time we downloaded it, he saw that it was at about 75% and then suddenly it was done (seemed odd).</p>

<p>Same behaviour with 2nd download.</p>

<p>Now what? HELP!</p>

<h2>            Setting up user, he can&#39;t login</h2>
                    
<p>This is a new computer for an existing user. &nbsp;Downloaded and installed Skype and OneDrive from Office365 settings. &nbsp;Try to login using his 365 credentials (which work fine on the portal) in either application and I get:</p>
<p><strong>That Microsoft account doesn't exist. Enter a different account&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>This is something I've done many times. &nbsp;It looks like it wants an office live account, like it doesn't look for Office 365 info for the creds. &nbsp;I did install the desktop setup.</p>

<p>Windows 7 Pro, all patches/updates applied. &nbsp;Outlook resolves the credentials and works fine.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>I don't know what this means, and every time It pops up and I click OK,. the program i am currently using always stops working (it could be spotify, google chrome, internet explorer, steam...anything). It's really annoying because it makes me not be able
 to use anything on my computer for more than 2 minutes without it crashing. I'm also confused when it says "Click on OK to terminate the program" because I don't have a program called WMS Idle which apparently is the program that has an application error.
 Could you guys please help me fix this! Its really annoying</p>

<p>I'll look for you...<br />
<br />
If you want to keep your gamerscore ending in a 0 or a 5, better try your best to 100% it. There's a lot that are worth 14g and 12g.<br />
<br />
There's 1 achievement that makes a return but as a different name while another achievement may be the equivalent to FFXIII's Treasure Hunter.</p>

<p>Me I will go for every quest on Normal to save playthroughs and that doesn't work I will then go on Easy. &nbsp;Normal for me first Easy second. &nbsp;I love a challenge. &nbsp;I 1000G Final Fantasy 13 and this will not be spared!!!&nbsp; &gt;: - )</p>

<p>I just hope they don't put locked difficulty settings like they did with Star Ocean and Infinite Undiscovery. Playing through the game 2-3 times is just a pain expecially if it is an achievement worth only 1 GS.

<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)">There is a guide on PS3trophies.org, the game is apparently a lot easier to finish and less time consuming compared to XIII. All but one achievement can be obtained on either difficulty mode and none of them are missable, unlike
 the treasure hunter one in XIII which was.<br />
<br />
The achievements that don't end in a 0 or 5 don't bother me whatsoever.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Unable to connect to WD MyCloud NAS with recent Windows 10 updates</h2>
                    <p>HI - Need help reconnecting to WD MyCloud NAS after recent Windows 10 updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a recent update, I have not been able to connect from my Windows 10 laptop to my WD MyCloud NAS.&nbsp; I had no issue prior to update and haven't changed any other network settings prior to having problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched all the other topics and tried all the recommended solutions and nothing has worked:</p>
<p>- revert to previous windows update</p>
<p>- resetting all network adapters</p>
<p>- release/renew ipconfig etc</p>
<p>- remove firewall</p>
<p>- allowinsecure dword registry</p>
<p>- change Max SMB protocol</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm able to access files (via app) as well as WD MyCloud settings (via IP address)&nbsp;from Android tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try ip address from Chrome I get error:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(100, 100, 100, 1)">ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It's no longer visible in file explorer network</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Running Windows 10 Home - version 1709 - Build 16299.192</p>
<p>WD MyCloud Version 2.30.172 (current 11/17/17)</p>
