<h2>            HP Stream Wont Turn on</h2>
                    HELP!! My HP Stream wont turn on! Hi, My name is Jesse and my HP Stream wont turn on. Yesterday evening I was on Facebook and I fell asleep with the computer left turned on, On&nbsp;the table next to me. In the morning when I woke up (Today) the computer was
 completely dead, Not surprising since I had left the computer&nbsp; on the whole day with it set to not turn off at all if I don't touch it. So I plug in my computer to its factory charger and there was no charging light on the left hand side corner. I tried to
 turn it on but with no luck, and guss what?&nbsp; It wouldn't turn on at all, It wouldn't even show a indication if it was charging or not.&nbsp; So after one hour of it charging I checked on it and still so response. So I searched the internet for answers and to my
 demise I had no luck at all finding question or answer similar to mine. So can I please have help! Thanks - Jesse

<p>
</p><p><span><span>I regret the inconvenience you have faced regarding Windows 10 activation, I would surely assist you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to check with the external devices connected to the computer, this is to check whether the external devices have a conflict to the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since you are not able to charge the laptop using the factory charger, the issue could be with the Hardware. So I suggest you to get in touch with the manufacturer so that the issue would be fixed.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this helps. If the issue persists with the Windows 10, please do let us know and we would be happy to help you further.
</span></span></p>
<p>

<p>Hola hermano, asumo que desconocés el inglés, así que voy a responder en español.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Mantené presionado el botón encendido/apagado de la consola durante 10 segundos, posteriormente desconectala de la energía por un par de minutos. Entonces volvé a conectar y encendé.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ésto debería solucionar tu problema. Contanos si te ayudó.</p>

</p><p><strong>[Translation-Hello brother, I assume you do not know English, so I will respond in Spanish.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The companions above mentioned that you tried doing power cycling.

<p><strong>Press and hold the on/off button on the console for 10 seconds, then disconnect it from power for a couple of minutes. Then be back to connect and Encendé.</strong></p>

    <title>Problems when trying to fix MBR - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems when trying to fix MBR</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a Dell Inspiron 7000 series running Windows 8.1. After installing a Windows update, my computer booted into a black screen. I downloaded a Windows 8.1 ISO and made a bootable USB, from there I tried to repair the start and also used the various variations
 of the bootrec.exe command inside the command line when executing the bootable USB.<br />
<br />
I used the diskpart command to list the drives that my computer had. It turns out that the 480GB partition (that is, the main disk) is called Drive 5 there. I&nbsp;read somewhere that what I had to do was to select the Drive 5 when in diskpart, running the command
 "active", so that then I could run bootrec.exe from the Drive 5, but i got the following error message:&nbsp;"The selected disk is not a fixed MBR disk. Only on fixed MBR disks it's possible to mark a disk as active."<br />
<br />
The conclusion seems to be that my Windows partition is Disk 5, that Disk 5 has the MBR corrupted and that when I execute bootrec.exe it's not doing it on disk 5 by default, and I cannot manually change to Disk 5 using diskpart because it's not a fixed MBR
 disk.<br />
<br />
I have also tried the automatic startup repair, but I get an error message saying: "Startup repair could not repair your PC. The log file has been saved to C:/Windows/System32/Logfiles/Srt/SrtTrail.txt". &nbsp;I had a look at the log and I see that it contains a
 list of performed tasks, every single one of them listed as "correctly completed (error 0x0)" and then it says that the "main cause found" is "the system volume disk is damaged".
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have previously performed a chkdsk c: f/ r/ twice, which corrected plenty of errors in both cases, but with no luck solving the blank screen after boot. However, I'm now performing another chkdsk just in case.</div>
<div><br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Pau<br />
<br />
EDIT: I forgot to mention my laptop has a 32GB mSATA SSD. I don't know if this might have to do with this issue.</div>

            <p>The drive could be so badly damaged that it can't be repaired. It could also be other issues like ram or the CPU. Boot in to the bios and run a disk check from there. Also see of the drive manufacture has a disk scan</p>

            <p>Thank you DanzIZme for your reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been able to boot from a WinPE USB drive, and when I go to the cmd prompt, type notepad and go to file &gt; open I still see all my files there, so I guess the drive is not completely dead. Also, the laptop is new (less than 2 months), so unless there
 is a manufacturing defect, it should not be related to a physical problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to note that this happened after a Windows update, and not randomly, so my theory is that this update completely broke the MBR. I did not shut down the laptop or close the lid while it was updating: it seemed to complete successfuly, but the
 next time I turned it on, there was the black screen after boot.</p>

            Okay, I would try and recover your data so it doesn't get lost. We need to figure out if the drive has a MBR at all it could be a GPT. Get to a command prompt type diskpart press enter type listdisk hit enter. In the last column is got if it is blank it
 isn't a GPT

            It is GPT, because I tried to use diskpart to mark the drive which contains Windows as "active", and I got a message saying that only MBR drives can be marked as active, so it must be GPT. I never heard of GPT before so I don't know what does it imply
 in a practical situation.

            <p>Gave you the wrong command, I am used to not having spaces in most commands :)
<strong>diskpart </strong>then <strong>list disk</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Double check that it is being seen as a GPT using the command prompt diskpart hit enter then the right command is list disk with a space</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>IF it is a GPT then MBR can't be fixed because there is no usable one. Only a Protective MBR which prevents other programs from creating a MBR and breaking every thing</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the Windows update was done before it broke but I don't know if that was the root cause.. Was it after a restart to finish installing updates that it failed or was it after it restarted successfully.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen it many times before that an update it done and the PC breaks but it wasn't the updates fault it was a symptom of a different issue. Updates can be large and broad so they can bring an issue front-and-center more often then writing a 1 MB file.
 Not to say it wasn't the updates fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know what the list disk says. I am looking in to it a little I don't deal with GPT too often so I need to do a little research to get you some help</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry forgot something. Disconnect the 32GB drive and every external drive and try to boot. You can boot in to the BIOS and check how the disks are being seen. The drive with the OS should be disk 0. The BIOS may need to be reset or updated. There is a chance
 that the windows update included a BIOS update and that is the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can, get me a copy of the logs that are at c:\windows\windowsupdate.log and any other iterations. You can upload them to a onedrive public folder.

            <p>Thanks DanzIZme. I have done what you suggested, and I get 3 disks in "list disk". One of them is about 480GB (which is the main one), then there's another one which is 8GB and another one which is also roughly 8GB. One of those two should be the USB drive
 that I'm using for running WinPE, the other one I don't know what it is. Also, I see that the 32GB drive is not listed there, so my guess is that it doesn't act as a standalone drive but as a dynamic cache (please correct me if this is wrong).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, in the right column where it says "GPT", the 3 disks have an asterisk *.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About disconnecting the 32GB drive: the laptop rear lid is fixed with special screws, so lifting it I guess would void the warranty.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Okay. What is the boot order in the BIOS. How does the BIOS see the disks. Make sure the BIOS. the larger disk should be set to 0 if it is possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can disable UEFI in the BIOS that may fix the issue</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 recognizes my scanners but my graphics software will not</h2>
                    <p>When I upgraded to Windows 10 (from 7) I downloaded the new drivers for both my Epson Photo 4180 Scanner and Microtek ScanMaker 9800XL. Windows recognizes them but PhotoShop 7 locks up when I import the scanner software and MS PhotoDraw doesn't recognize
 the scanners at all. They both worked fine in Windows 7. Help!</p>

            The article in your post is lifehacker. Not addictivetips. So I do not know what you mean. Maybe I just don't see it on my side. 
<br />
<br />Anyway, did you try to use the commands in my link at all? What happens when you input them? They should hide any network with the name you type in. 
<br />
<br />netsh wlan add filter permission=block ssid="WiFi network you want to remove" networktype=infrastructure
<br />
<br />Make sure you replace the quotes with the name of the networks. 
<br />
<br />For your other request as to hiding a network based on its mac address, I do not know if windows is capable of doing this. You can hide your own SSID by editing it in your routers settings. Other than that, I can't find a way and have not heard of a way.

For your other request as to hiding a network based on its mac address, I do not know if windows is capable of doing this. You can hide your own SSID by editing it in your routers settings. Other than that, I can't find a way and have not heard of a way.

<p>You don't&nbsp; understand&nbsp; stand me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to hide a hidden wifi that i don't&nbsp; know it's&nbsp; name .</p>
<p>Or turn off the option that&nbsp; shows hidden networks in the wifi menu . So it only&nbsp; shows&nbsp; visible&nbsp; networks ( networks that are broadcasting their ssid )</p>

            Sometimes you can connect to a network and then the owner of that network can hide it. This will disconnect you and make it hidden, but all good. 
<br />

<br />The unwanted devices will appear dimmed. You can right-click on them from there and uninstall them. 
<br />
<br />Still doesn't work? Then you may just need to ignore the network. It doesn't cause any harm. Your router will pick up all nearby wifi unless you contact your ISP for a fix.

            Hello Guy.  I'm Greg, a Microsoft MVP here to help you.

 In Windows 10 everything depends on the  quality of the install, which is the reason most tech enthusiasts will never run a Factory or Upgrade install because they cause endless problems.  I'll give alternatives in a minute but meanwhile to gauge the quality of your install exactly please work through the Windows 10 Performance and Install Integrity Checklist at http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00 to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs are done.  

If any steps cannot be performed then try whichever method works to enter Safe Mode with Networking at http://www.pcworld.com/article/2984712/windows/how-to-enter-windows-10s-safe-mode.html which may work better to perform all of the steps, or from the Advanced Startup Options listed at  https://www.tenforums.com/tutoria

<p>Hi and thanks Greg. That's really good stuff. I am going to go through the checklist later, and maybe do a fresh install, if nothing, to speed the machine up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since posting this, I have run into the exact same issue on a different laptop. Getting ready to try it on a third, and what do you want to bet that the "change setting" will be greyed out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This leads me to believe that this is not an install problem, but a problem native in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are on a laptop, just click device manager, select your keyboard, and see if the "change settings" tab is greyed out, or see if you have a power management tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have yet to find a laptop in which this is not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, can you elaborate a bit on the bloatware. I look in "add remove programs" and down by the clock (notification area) and I don't see any bloatware. Is it hiding somewhere? I don't see any on either of my two new Dell machines. Maybe Dell doesn't do
 bloatware anymore?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thank you for your help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>The questions about other things</strong></p>
<p>Does windows defender scan the browser extensions (any browser)? And how to know that what type of data (if any) is being transmitted by an application that is installed in my computer and to where is the data going?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As in windows, for the different devices attached, there are different drivers from ms, but for the DataCard device that I have can I use or manage it through windows itself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as there are different programs installed in a system, then upon opening the programs they have their own window size and are placed at any position on the screen. How to do such a setting that they open with the same size as they are set and open at

 reminds that this specific work is pending especially when I am doing any related work?

    <title>My keyboard stopped working in Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My keyboard stopped working in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>My laptop is ASUS F555UA and I'm running Windows 10. I'm not sure if my Windows had just updated, but one day, I suddenly couldn't type my password in. Every time I used the Shift key it would type "[space]nbz", although my trackpad was still working (albeit
 responding slowly). From the login page, I decided to Reset My PC (and kept my personal files). I forgot that the onscreen keyboard could have been used at this point so I didn't. Once the OS was reset, I found that instead of just glitching my keyboard could
 not type anything. My trackpad went back to original functionality. I tried a number of solutions from online (not in order):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Turned on FilterKeys, restarted, then turned off Filterkeys.</p>
<p>2) Ran Troubleshooter for keyboard, PC found nothing wrong with the device.</p>
<p>3) Device Manager &gt; updated keyboard driver by searching driver software online automatically &gt; PC says that the latest version is installed.</p>
<p>4) Device Manager &gt; updated keyboard driver by browsing PC for driver software &gt; PC says it has been installed.</p>
<p>5) Device Manager &gt; uninstalled keyboard driver &gt; restart to reinstall keyboard driver.</p>
<p>6) Uninstall and reinstall ATKPackage.</p>
<p>7) Updated BIOS.</p>
<p>8) Edited keyboard registry.</p>
<p>9) Edited registry to make sure NumLock isn't turned on.</p>
<p>10) Reset PC again after all of these solutions failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no keyboard driver on the ASUS website for my particular model that I can download manually. I have not tried downloading any such driver from other websites in case of malware. There wasn't any liquid spilled on the keyboard nor was there any overt
 trauma done to my laptop. Please help me.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your keyboard is not working properly, it is possible that the problem is hardware-related, or the a service or an application is causing the keyboard to malfunction. For us to isolate the issue in using your keyboard, kindly respond to the questions
 below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you able to type using an external keyboard?</li><li>Without using an external keyboard, do the keyboard keys type the corresponding characters when entered? Kindly check through Notepad. This is for us to see if the issue only happens when attempting to log in.</li><li>Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed on your computer? Kindly go to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>About </strong>&gt; <strong>
Version</strong> to check.</li></ol>

            <p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to my problem.</p>
<p>Thank you Akheel Ahmed for your answer.</p>
<p>According to the result of&nbsp; sfc /scannow&nbsp; everything is OK in the Windows system.</p>
<p>The problem is that for a few shortcut icons on the desktop (Skype,...) the contextual menu is displayed correctly, but for all others:</p>
<ul>
<li>nothing is displayed,</li><li>the system seem to be frozen, the mouse cursor becomes a spinning wheel for waiting, mouse buttons are inefficient for a few seconds,</li><li>then the display gets black for less than 1 second,</li><li>and finally everything comes back to the normal state (without contextual menu !).</li></ul>
<p>If I display the desktop folder with Windows Explorer, the problem is the same: impossible to get the contextual menu from the involved shortcuts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this give you an idea to solve my problem ?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Antimalware Service Executable keeps running when Surface Pro 2 is idle</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had posted in this thread with a question regarding&nbsp;Antimalware Service Executable on my Surface Pro 2.
</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/antimalware-service-executable-keeps-running-when/da8f42fb-c5b2-4d56-aa02-63d1e83729b0?tm=1406320566907</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But I was told to post it here, therefor here is a copy paste of this question:</p>
<p>========= start copy paste ============</p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that whenever my surface pro 2 goes into idle that the Antimalware Service Executable starts to run. In itself I didn't think this was a problem as I figured it just does a scan now and then. But I've come to realize it just keeps
 running every time the surface pro 2 is idle. I've turned off going to sleep and turning screen off and it's still running now after over 6 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I touch the screen or move the mouse it will stop, so it's not slowing me down, but it just sounds unhealthy that it keeps running all the time ? The surface pro 2 gets really hot in the back and the CPU usage is a constant around 25%
 for the&nbsp;Antimalware Service Executable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've booted up Windows Defender and done a manual quick scan also, it didn't find anything. And that took around 20 minutes or something. So if it's scanning in the background it shouldn't take 5 hours right ? It's on an SSD with only around 130
 GB of data ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk speed of the process is also only around 0.6 or 0.7 MB / second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jorn</p>
<p>========== end copy paste =========</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally to be clear: for me it's fine that it runs the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Antimalware Service Executable when the Surface Pro 2 is idle, but it is doing this always, even after running it for 6 hours and the Surface
 Pro 2 gets really hot ... doesn't sound normal ?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thanks,</span></p>

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems the problem resolved itself, yesterday after an hour it was done. I then let it come back to idle a while later to see if the service would start again but it didn't. Maybe the long run I did the day before managed to get it to almost finished or
 something, whatever it was doing. I'll keep an eye on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows could not find a driver for your network adapter</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Geobook 3, Windows 10 laptop, barely a month old and this morning it won't connect to the Wi-Fi or show any available networks.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if it updated as I shut it down last night as I just left it shutting down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running the Troubleshoot came up with,</p>
<p>'Windows could not find a driver for your network adapter'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When looking at the network adapters there are about 6, and all say they are up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help? I'm starting a distance learning degree on Wednesday and it's essential I have internet access!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p><br />

            Hi Emily,<br /><br /><br /> Let’s click start - type Control Panel and open it up. Look for Network and Sharing center (or view network status and tasks) - on the left, click on “change adapter settings” - do you see your WiFi adapter here? If it’s disabled, right click and enable it. <br /><br />If it’s not, lets click start, and type “services.msc” - once open, go to WLAN service, and see if it’s started. Start it if it’s stopped. See if your wireless comes back. <br /><br />Let’s start here, and we’ll see if we can get you back up and running!<br />- C

            None of them. Alright, you need to try FIX 2 on that link.

<h2>            MSI laptop with Windows 7 is unable to use wireless adapter to connect to any wireless networks.</h2>
                    <p>I have several laptops and one of them is an msi with windows 7. All the other laptops also running windows seven connect wirelessly to my DSL connection.&nbsp; The msi did also until 2 to 3 months ago then it would not but worked fine using an ethernet cable
 and all other aspects seem to be working. Diagnostics says the wireless option in my laptop is turned off&nbsp; but I get no response when I try to turn it on. I went back to a date before this problem started and reconfiged and still no wireless connection. Any
 thoughts on what to try next&gt;?&nbsp; Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;original title:&nbsp;No wireless connection</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Fax and Scan always line busy now, worked before - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> connielieder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Fax and Scan always line busy now, worked before</h2>
                    I was using fax and scan to send faxes on 5/13/11 and it was working fine.&nbsp; On that same day, I downloaded Firefox 4 and Windows Update installed KB2529073 and KB2534366.&nbsp; Later in the day, I tried faxing and ran into a line busy repeatedly.&nbsp; Called destination
 and she had experienced a paper jam, so I assumed that was the problem.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it was not as she has since received several faxes from others, but mine are all going to a line busy error during the dialing.&nbsp; There is no audible busy signal and the
 calling card responses are correct and audible.&nbsp; Faxing from a HP Compaq F730US notebook with a HDAUDIO Soft Data Fax Modem using Windows 7 Home Premium upgraded from Vista.&nbsp; I am entering the entire calling card sequence and destination area code and number
 with appropriate pauses and using no dialing rules.&nbsp; (I don't fax very often, but this person is not on email, so it is my only alternative to snail mail.) Updated drivers and tried all the suggested troubleshooting techniques listed and it still returns a
 busy condition on every attempt.&nbsp; Phone line is working with an analog handset.&nbsp; Modem query returns good results. Any ideas?&nbsp; Could the updates loaded that day be a factor?

<ol>
<li><span><span>What troubleshooting steps have you tried?</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have another fax number, try to use it as a test to check if the problem persists.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can try the following methods:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Put the computer in ‘Clean boot’ and check the status.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span>
 When the troubleshooting is over do not forget to reset the computer to normal startup. Follow step 7 in the above article.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></span></span></p>
<p><span>Uninstall the updates and check if you can send fax.</span></p>
