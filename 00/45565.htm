<h2>            Want to make a video in windows movie maker</h2>
                    <p>For the above subject, I tried to open the .vpj file in windows media player but it doesn't support to open the file. So I need a supported codec of the player. My system is working with windows 8.1.
</p>
<p>I need windows movie maker free upgrade to edit two or more audio at a time to mix them as overlays to be able to run on my windows. Or suggest me to download a free software, which&nbsp;can do my task, for&nbsp;editing&nbsp; videos.</p>

    <title>Green power light flashing on my Xbox 360 Slim.. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Green power light flashing on my Xbox 360 Slim.. </h2>
                    
<p>Sometimes when i turn on my xbox, i notice that the power button flashes as if the disk tray is opening but there is already a disk in there and i didnt open my disk tray. It'll keep flashing until i actually open and close my tray and resume operation as
 normal. Also, at times, in the middle of a game, my console will send me to the dashboard and the light will start flashing but the tray wont open. it would act as if there is no disk in the tray and would wait for me to open it.&nbsp;<br />
any fixes/solutions ? /:&nbsp;</p>

<p>This just started for me too.</p>
<p>Happened after live update on Battlefield3</p>
<p>In my xbox if you insert a disk it's confused whether there is a disk in or not.
</p>
<p>I think this looks like a firmware rather than a hardware glitch.</p>
<p>Turn the xbox on with the tray closed and it says opening.</p>
<p>Open and it says = close tray</p>
<p>close tray it says = closing and then = opening - but it doesnt open.</p>
<p>Click OK on the remote and it does this cycle again.</p>
<p>I've cleaned the eject button but it was clean?</p>
<p>Might the mechanism have slipped a gear? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Pretty disappointed. &nbsp;My old white one still runs although I can hear it two streets over. ;)</p>

<p>okay so its been awhile, but i noticed that when the conditions in my room are really hot or really cold, it does this, but when the weather is perfect, like not too hot or cold, then it works perfectly fine. so i guess those problems were my fault. it's

            <p>First, you need to be sure you are saving an actual movie, not just the project file. The project file is just the save state of your editing session. That file points to the source media on your computer and won't be of any use if you send it to someone
 else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To save the movie, use <strong>File &gt; Save movie</strong>. The resulting file is an .mp4 file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it doesn't usually make sense to send the file directly. For one, it's usually too big to send in an email. So the better solution is to upload it to a video sharing site like YouTube, Vimeo, etc. From there you can get a link to share with friends
 and family.</p>

    <title>Problem using file sharing on Windows 10 while using a Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kiantamar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem using file sharing on Windows 10 while using a Microsoft Account to log in.</h2>
                    When I use a Local Account to log in, there is no problem. But when I want to log into OneNote I have to use my Microsoft Account which automatically&nbsp;changes my windows user account from Local to Microsoft Account.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I wouldn't have any issue using a Microsoft Account to log into my PC if it weren't for the fact that I can't use my Microsft Account when I want to share files over wifi with my other devices. (Using SMB)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I put my Microsoft Account username and password in the login page,&nbsp;it just doesn't work. It does work just fine when I revert back to a Local Account. But then I can't use OneNote anymore.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any way that I don't have to choose between file sharing or OneNote (or any other MS Office product that needs a Microsoft Account for logging in)?</div>
                </div>

            <p>Maybe I didn't explain my issue properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Right know I'm using a Local Account. I don't have any problem with file sharing. But when I do choose to switch to my Microsoft account, I can't use my Microsoft account credentials to access shared files on my PC. As seen in the screenshots below, when
 trying to gain access from another windows PC, it tells me the username or password is incorrect. And trying to gain access from an android device, it tell's me that server can't be found!</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa381b77-7a9f-4d22-b30c-81bbab2b037f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa381b77-7a9f-4d22-b30c-81bbab2b037f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Or from an Android device.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cc978352-89d1-4c7f-b040-13704f82ec66" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cc978352-89d1-4c7f-b040-13704f82ec66" /></a></p>
<p>As soon as I revert back to a local account and use my local account's username and password, everything works just fine without making any other changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While using Microsoft account, other third party apps (<span>such as Unified Remote</span>) that use their&nbsp;own port and security password (and don't require a local or Microsoft account credentials) work perfectly. So the
 problem isn't caused by using wrong IP address or router issue. And Also <strong>
the problem goes away when I use a local account.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I'm also sure that I'm typing the correct username and password for my Microsoft account.</p>

<h2>            stuck pixel on Surface 2 screen after 3weeks..</h2>
                    <p>hi there, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to report an issue with a stuck red pixel on a 3wk old Surface 2. I've never had this issue on a device before, and I'm pretty annoyed its appeared on a device of this calibre! Noticed it just under 24 hrs ago when using any IE window (metro or desktop)
 that has a black background. It is in the lower left hand region of the screen-and is apparent when loading the address bar from the bottom in metro IE. any solutions out there?!!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this comes immediately after a broken charger that has just been replaced free of charge via an online MS surface support rep.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>two quality control issues in under 4 weeks for a device costing this much....
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any help appreciated!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nick.</p>

    <title>Unidentified Network - Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frank_r_o  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unidentified Network - Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>New to these community pages, so hope I'm posting this in the right place...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, so I'm having the dreaded "Unidentified network" issue on my stationary computer. I'll make a list of what I've tried so far (which feels like everything):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) When setting the TCP/IPv4 to auto, I get the error above. There is no default gateway in the IPConfig/all, and shows the 169.254. address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) If I set it to manual, and use 192.168.1.xxx &nbsp;as IP (currently using .10) it works, but the Mbps is severely slowed. I have a 25 Mbps line, and Speedtest.net is giving me around 4-10 Mbps. For this I use the gateway 192.168.1.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I have two laptops and two smartphones that work flawlessly on the same router's network. This is also where I picked up the gateway and DNS addresses to input manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) I've tried netsh (log reset and winsock) and flush commands a billion times, and no dice. If trying to use Auto IP (DHCP?) and using /renew, I get the following error from the command prompt: "An error occurred while renewing interface Wireless Network
 connection: unable to contact your DHCP server. Request has timed out."</p>
<p>5) I have tried to uncheck the IPv6 box, without it doing anything to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) I have tried disabling the wireless adapter, and connecting a cable. Same issue, same errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) Disabling the Windows Firewall does nothing. For AV I only have MS Security Essentials and Malwarebytes Anti-Malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8) I tried reinstalling Windows 7 Ultimate on a brand new mainboard, with a brand new SSD and a brand new Netgear A6100 adapter,&nbsp;<strong>and the error only then occurred after Windows had installed all its updates</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm going to assume that there's something about the latest Win7 updates and how my computer responds that are causing this error, since mostly everything else that could have been the issue is now replaced with brand new parts. But I'll be damned if I know
 what is causing this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any idea how to fix this, I would greatly appreciate it if they could share! I honestly don't know anymore :&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In case you have use of them, here are the results from ipconfig/all with <strong>

            <p>Seeing as how the only "old" parts left now are Windows 7 and my router, could it be that either getting a new router or upgrading to Windows 8 would fix this issue? I was given the router as a gift a few years ago, but I noticed that reviews of it online
 aren't too positive about it. Could it simply be a bad product? But if so, why do the other laptops work with it? :-l<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Ok, so I did some more testing, and now the situation has changed to this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My oldest laptop running Windows 7 has perfect ping time (about 5-10 ms on Speedtest.net) and perfect download speeds (25 Mbps).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My newest laptop running Windows 8.1 has very high ping time (around 40 ms), but perfect download speeds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And finally, my stationary PC has Windows 7 Ultimate with normal ping time, but very slow download speeds (around 5 Mbps).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested with a cable directly to my ISP's main hub, and got the following results:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oldest laptop: No change; perfect ping and download</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stationary: Worked with DHCP for a brief moment with perfect ping and download speeds, then went to Unidentified Network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Newest laptop does not have a cable input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What on earth is happening here? I'm hesitant to say it's my ISP, since my oldest laptop seems to be working just fine. But the other two are getting worse by the minute. And the only thing my main computer and newer laptop have in common is that they're
 new...</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the steps and got the following results:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: "Newest drivers were already installed on your computer"</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: "No problems found" with the auto-diagnostics (this was using manual IP, auto IP has the auto-diagnostic resetting my adapter, then telling me it could not do anything more to help)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong>: Tried uninstalling MWB, restarting my computer and using auto IP. Still stuck with Unidentified Network. Manual IP works the same, but with severely limited Mbps and abnormally high ping, as before the uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Did not find anything that I had not tried or considered already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please keep the suggestions coming. Meanwhile, I have sent a tech support request to my ISP just to be certain. I have never met an issue like this, so any help is better than where I am now :-/</p>

            <p>Another update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My ISP was kind enough to reset my connection, and I've been trying a new router connected to a new port on the ISP's hub. This has given the following results:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- All laptops are now experiencing stable pings and download/upload speeds <strong>
using both wireless and cable</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- My main computer has similarly good ping and speeds <strong>using cable</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Trying to use my Wifi Adapter still gives the same poor ping and mbps, <strong>
and</strong> I am now trying this on a <strong>fresh install</strong> of Windows 7 Ultimate having installed only the adapter's drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I have tried the same adapter on my now-working laptops, and they have no issues using at full capacity, but my main computer refuses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- As mentioned earlier, this is a brand new adapter, on a brand new SSD and a brand new motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, my question them becomes:</p>
<p>What could strangle a Wifi connection on a fresh install of Windows? And why is it limited to only my stationary, main computer? Thanks again!</p>

 is set to obtain its IP address automatically (usual default setting) and (b) the adapter cannot obtain an IP address from a DHCP server.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Except in unusual circumstances (e.g., the router's DHCP server is disabled or broken), when this happens for a wifi adapter the cause is almost always an encryption or other security problem.&nbsp; The first step in troubleshooting this is to completely disable
 all encryption and other security features (e.g., IP or MAC filters) on the router and see if the adapter can now obtain an IP address from the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mention that you have tried the A6100 on the laptops.&nbsp; Do the laptops have the same operating system as your desktop/tower?&nbsp; If not, the drivers that you installed on the laptops may not be the same as the Windows 7 driver that you installed on your
 desktop and the comparison may not be completely accurate.&nbsp; Also, did you use the A6100 in the same wifi mode when installed on the laptops as you use on the desktop/tower?&nbsp; Even if the A6100 is not actually defective, at least one review characterizes its
 performance as "underwhelming in 2.4GHz mode and for 802.11n."&nbsp; See <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2426319,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Sorry for leaving out some information! I will attempt to anwer your questions as I find them:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, no, I do no longer currently get the Unidentified Network error, even with the Wifi. The only remaining symptoms are fluctuating mbps levels, and
<strong>only</strong> for my main stationary computer and <strong>only</strong> when using the Wifi, not cable (which seems to be fine now). Out of 25 Mbps fiber, I get about 5-10, and it varies wildly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As such, I no longer get the 169.254.xxx error on <strong>any </strong>of my computers. Even with the Wifi on Auto IP. DHCP is Enabled in the IPConfig/All and it is getting the standard 192.168.1.2(Preferred) IP. The /release and /renew commands respond
 almost instantly now as well, although this does nothing to fix the strangled speeds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the laptops, the oldest one is running Windows 7 Home Premium, and the newest one is using Windows 8.1 Pro. I confess I'm not sure what you mean by "wifi mode", but I changed nothing from the standard installation on any of the machines (all three),
 nor any settings in the TCP/IP settings for any of the three machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did notice that reviews were split regarding the adapter, but it gives flawless results on 2 out of 3 machines for me. I cannot for the life of me guess what could be limiting an adapter like this for a fresh Windows install on a week-old SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me if I missed any of your questions, and thanks again for responding!</p>

            <p>If you're not getting "unidentified network" and not getting a 169.254.x.y IP address, most of my comments can be ignored.&nbsp; And if one of your laptops uses Windows 7 Home Premium, it uses the same driver as your desktop/tower, so that isn't the issue, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I meant by "wifi mode" was whether you configured the adapter to use 802.11ac vs 802.11n vs 802.11g, etc., differently on the different computers.&nbsp; However, on reflection, it's really unlikely that you would have done that.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the only thing that I can think of that might explain what you're seeing is that mini-wifi adapters like the A6100 do not have very efficient antennas.&nbsp; If the USB port that you use on your desktop/tower is on the back of the system and the adapter
 is sandwiched between the computer case and a wall, it's possible that you're not getting as good a signal as you do when the adapter is plugged into one of your laptops sitting on a table out in the open.&nbsp; Unless the desktop/tower is also not particularly
 near your router, however, this is not likely to affect you as badly as your tests indicate.&nbsp; You might try using a different USB port or temporarily moving the computer away from any surrounding objects (such as wells, file cabinets, desks, fluorescent lamps,
 etc.).</p>

<p>
</p><p>I actually thought about the antenna issue for my desktop computer, and tested the laptop with the adapter sitting right next to where the desktop is. Laptop got a perfect connection, while the desktop is still horrible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tested every single USB port on my desktop, formatted the drive, reinstalled Windows and tried again. No success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any more ideas, please share them, no matter how far-fetched they might be. I'm out of ideas quite frankly. I have never met a problem like this before, and having a cable stretched all the way through my apartment is a sub-par solution :&lt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have one more piece of information, though it might be irrelevant. Before upgrading my computer with the new parts, including the adapter, my old parts and adapter were connected to this same router and wifi and worked without issue until the problems
 started. I did most of the upgrades as a response to the issue (and the parts were getting old), and while the problem is lessened now, it's strange how it survived what is in effect a brand new computer and adapter...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that the main hub that the router and cables are connected to could somehow recognize this as the same computer, and have some sort of stored error that would only apply to it? By main hub, I mean a sentral access hub from my supplier that
 delivers both broadband and TV channels. And if so, would it be realistic that it would react only to wifi and not cable? I'm grasping at straws at this point :-l</p>

            <p>If anything, your ISP's server ("main hub") would recognize your router (by its MAC address), but your router is a "barrier" between the "outside world" -- including your ISP -- and your computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could reset your router to its factory default state but then you would have to reconfigure the router's connection to your ISP as well as all of your wifi security settings.&nbsp; And I doubt that resetting the router would have any effect, anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Netgear's online documentation is very sparse for this product.&nbsp; The only downloadable package appears to include both a "Netgear Genie" and a stand-alone driver.&nbsp; Assuming that you installed the "Genie," you might uninstall it and then install the stand-alone
 drive to see if Windows 7 can do any better on its own.&nbsp; See second page of <a href="http://www.downloads.netgear.com/files/GDC/A6100/A6100_IG_14Aug2013.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>Have you tried starting your main computer in "<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode with networking</a>"?&nbsp; Given that the problem only happens on that computer and only
 when using wifi, if the problem isn't hardware related (e.g., antenna placement), the only other thing I can think of is that some task that is running on your main computer but not on the Windows 7 laptop is interfering with the adapter's driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's it.&nbsp; I'm out of ideas.</p>

            It's normal to have multiple Edge's processes shown in Task Manager. This means that Edge and any other browser puts web apps and plug-ins in a separate process. This is to prevent the browser won't lock up in-case a particular web app or plug-in stops responding. Opening a new tab will have it's own process unless the tab is from the same domain. This is also to increase their responsiveness.

<h2>            Unmountable_Boot_Volume</h2>
                    Yesterday I tried starting up my Lenovo IdeaPad u430 and I was faced with the UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME error. After looking at other threads I tried using the Media Creation Tool to create boot volumes on a dvd and also a USB drive but neither of these
 worked. Also tried booting from my old Win 7 disk and still had no luck. The laptop shipped with 8.1 preinstalled. In the BIOS it detects my drive as well so I don't think it's a hard drive failure.

    <title>Windows 10 File Rename Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amanda3234  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 File Rename Error</h2>
                    <p>I recently was upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 at work and given a new PC.&nbsp; Ever since, I can't rename or create new files/folders without the error message "The drive that this file or folder is stored on does not allow long file names, or names containing
 blanks or any of the following characters.."&nbsp; However, my file name including the entire pathway is less than 50 characters with none of the illegal characters.&nbsp; If I create the document or folder on my desktop it allows me to copy the folder into the same
 location with exactly the same name with no error.&nbsp; Then if I go to rename any files I get the same error.&nbsp; I can't figure out what the problem is.&nbsp; This is on a shared network drive.&nbsp; Any input would be appreciated, it is really causing a problem!</p>

            This is not an issue with your PC.
<br />I am assuming you are using Folder Redirection at your office.
<br />This is an issue with the server that your folders redirect to.
<br />The group that manages the server have not optimized the server for Windows 10.
<br />There is a policy that needs to be turned off.  I know this because we had to do this it our office.
<br />The GPO is Windows Fast Logon Optimization feature.

            You are welcome Amanda. It sounds like IT might set in policies to prevent saving data to local folders as part of its data retention strategy.

<div>There are lots of options built into Windows to help you get out of this predicament:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Reboot the machine with your Windows Repair CD, then use System Restore to set Windows back by a few days (works only if you changed the password recently).</li><li>Log on under your spare admin account, then reset the password to your usual account (works only if you set up a spare admin account).</li><li>Log on as Administrator in Safe Mode, then reset the password to your usual account (the password is usually blank).</li><li>Insert your USB flash disk with the password keyfile (works only if you took the time to create such a keyfile).</li><li>Use the password hint (works only if you created a hint and if it is good enough to let you guess the password)</li><li>Check your paper records (works only if you jotted down the password somewhere)</li></ul>

<h2>            Windows 10 BSOD with a code&#58; Bad System Config Info</h2>
                    I recently updated my laptop to Anniversary Update last week. I have finished installing Office 365 to my Dell Inspiron and tried to restart to verify my account. To my surprise, I was stucked into this BSOD having a code: bad system config info without
 getting access to the desktop. I waited to automatically fix the start up but it didn't got into it. I used a DVD to boot up and access the advanced options and tried those five listed options but it didn't done anything. My last resort is to have a re-installation
 using USB drive to boot up. I'm afraid that my digital license will no longer be available. Can you help me guys on the issue? FYI: My Dell Laptop runs on Windows 7 Home Basic before and was upgraded last November 2015. Thank you!

            <p>You can always perform a new install without it invalidating your license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation
 Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you are prompted to enter a product key, click 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later'</p>

<h2>            Are there new drivers for Microsoft USB2.0 UVC Webcam&#63; Black video</h2>
                    Hi. I am trying to fix my webcam. I am having issues in Skype and with the Web Cam software that came with my Toshiba Satellite A505-S6025. I used too have very good webcam quality and now after formatting, I am not getting great quality. In Skype under
 webcam settings when I click "Low Light Compensation" I get very good quality for a second and then it goes completely dark.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was wondering if anyone has had this similar problem and if there are new drivers. These are the drivers that I currently have installed:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Driver Provider: Microsoft</div>
<div>Driver Date: 6/21/2006</div>
<div>Driver Version: 6.1.7601.17514</div>
<div>Driver Signer: Microsoft Windows</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is a built-in webcam and I know it is still in good condition as I can get great quality, but then for some reason it goes dark after applying the "low light compensation" &nbsp;Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.</div>

    <title>BSOD while playing games and watching twitch - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            BSOD while playing games and watching twitch</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Hello, this is my first post, and I created this account today because I have been having a frustratingly enormous
 amount of BSODing happening to my computer lately. This has been going on for a period of about a couple weeks now, with an increasing frequency as time goes on. The problem is that I cannot figure out exactly what causes them because I get different error
 messages almost every time when my computer BSODs.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Here's a list of them with how common they reoccur for each time I get a BSOD:</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">1. KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED - (very common)</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">2. PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (Npfs.SYS), also (dxgkrnl.sys) - (very common)</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">3. IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL - (not as common)</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">4. DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (Wdf01000.sys) - (not as common)</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">5. SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (win32kfull.sys) - (not very common)</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">6. BAD_POOL_CALLER - (only happened once)</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">7. APC_INDEX_MISMATCH - (only happened once)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I have pinpointed the triggers of these BSODs to activities such as:</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">1. Playing games, particularly multiplayer, like: CS:GO, H1Z1, The Culling. When this happens, either my computer will
 BSOD directly from my game, or my game will crash me to my desktop, and then my PC eventually BSODs if I persist to play the games.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">2. Watching Twitch.tv. When this happens, Google Chrome will display the "aw snap" page and all of my pages in Chrome
 will crash, but not Chrome itself, and then I will almost always immediately get a BSOD after a few seconds of that screen appearing.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">-I can play games like Darkest Dungeon which is offline and not very graphics intensive, and I will never get a BSOD.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">-Also, I can manage to watch Twitch or play those "triggering games" for 5 min to up to 5 hours before I get a BSOD.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I have tried to browse around and try everything that comes up from other forum websites, posts, and even articles on
 the topic. What I have seen when I google each error message is that people are using /sfc scannow and /dism /repairhealth to remove corruption.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Things I have tried which failed fixing the problem in order:</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">1. Full system virus scan with Norton 360 (nothing found) and Malwarebytes (found a trojan, removed). Still BSODs.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">2. I uninstalled, reinstalled, and updated my Nvidia GTX 770 drivers because a lot of my searches correlated with people
 mentioning that these errors can come from a problem in your graphics drivers. I thought this made sense too because my BSODs get triggered by multiplayer games and twitch.tv, however this failed.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">3. I tried removing write caching on my disk drive because it was mentioned in another form post as a possible solution,
 but nothing changed.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">4. Upgrading from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 to see if it would give me uncorrupted, updated files. (I eventually downgraded
 back to Windows 8.1 after this failed)</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">5. Using /sfc scannow. The first time I used this, I got the message that says corruption is found but not everything
 was able to be fixed. So then I proceeded to use DISM /restorehealth which "successfully removed corruption", however a few days later I still got BSODs. I thought this was odd because this was the solution on nearly every post I read, so I went back to scan
 using /sfc scannow once more, and&nbsp;</span><strong>this time</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;it
 said no corruption is found (</span><strong>what?!?!</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">),
 but I still get BSODs.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">6. I went into my Device Manager and literally right-clicked and searched for updates on every single driver, but I
 still get crashes and BSODs.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I now am clueless due to the error always changing, and I ran out of ideas for what I can possibly do after Googling
 for hours and trying everything I saw.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">My PC Specs:</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Graphics Card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Processor: AMD FX(tm)-6350 Six-Core Processor - 4.23 GHz</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Installed Memory (RAM): 16.0 GB</span><br />

<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">OS: Windows 8.1 64-bit</span><br />

<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Sorry for the long post, and thank you for your time!</span>

<h2>            How do i reinstall my oem laptop windows 8 Pro.</h2>
                    I Just bought a new Sony svs13A25plb, with Windows 8 Pro.
<div>The thing is i'll use a trial boot setup (Ubuntu 12.04, Windows 8, Mac OS X 10.8), i know it's sounds tricky but im used to do it always.</div>
<div>The last setup was with Windows 7 which i purcheased, but it seems that license key system changed now, or at least, my laptop didn't come with license sticker.</div>
<div>I read about some kind of "key written in BIOS" so the OS installation don't need the user to enter the license code (source:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Windows-8-OEM-OA-3.0-Piracy-Genuine-Microsoft,16636.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Windows-8-OEM-OA-3.0-Piracy-Genuine-Microsoft,16636.html</a>).<br />
Does it means that i just need to download Windows 8 Installer and i wont have to input any license code during the installation?.</div>

<div>Thanks for Answering.<br />
I Did not made any change yet.&nbsp;<br />
My question is how do i get Windows 8 Installer to Install it in the laptop i purchased with OEM Windows 8 Pro, and what happen with the license, because i read that:
<div>"Activation for Windows 8 on OEM systems does not require a product key as the key is now imbedded in the BIOS so activating is no longer an issue."</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks.</div>

<p><span><span>Hello staffsgt,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Was
 this working fine anytime before or you are setting up this application for the first time?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Is
 your microphone working fine for other applications?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Here
 are a few methods you can try to fix this issue:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Check if the Microphone is set correctly:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Here is an article that will give you information on ‘Setting up Microphone on your computer:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Connect-a-microphone-music-player-or-other-audio-device-to-your-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Connect-a-microphone-music-player-or-other-audio-device-to-your-computer</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Check if the Microphone is enabled under recording devices:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 Start, type Sound in the Start Search box.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 Sound in the search results at the top of the Start menu.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 the Recording Tab.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>On
 the "Recording" tab there is listed the recording devices. One should read "Microphone" Click on that.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Right
 click on the device and click on enable.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Run recording troubleshooter:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Check out this article that will give you information on ‘How to Open the Recording Audio troubleshooter’:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Recording-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Recording-Audio-troubleshooter</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the Microphone is setup correctly and is working fine, then the issue is related to some setting with the ‘Teamspeak’ application. You should
 post your question at the Teamspeak community for a better response for this issue. Here is a link I found that you can follow to post your question:</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Harry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Corrupted system files is one of the possible reasons why you are have a no login screen and no taskbar when you boot your Windows 10 computer. For us to assist you better, may we know if you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue? We suggest
 that you try to boot your computer from the Windows 10 installation media and perform an Automatic repair from the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). The Automatic repair can detect and resolve the issues that prevent the computer from starting normally.
 You may refer to this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to download the Windows 10 ISO and create the installation media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can follow the steps below to perform Automatic repair on Windows 10 computer:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Insert the media such as (USB or DVD) and restart your computer.</li><li>If you see a message asking you to “Press any key to boot from DVD,” do so.</li><li>When you see the <strong>Install </strong><strong>Windows </strong>page, tap or click on
<strong>Repair </strong><strong>your </strong><strong>computer </strong>to start the Windows Recovery Mode.</li><li>In the <strong>Windows Recovery Environment</strong>, on the Choose an option screen, tap or click on
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Advanced </strong><strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Startup </strong><strong>Repair</strong>.</li></ol>

<p>I prepared a usb according to the link indicated and confirmed that it could be opened on another computer. But on plugging it in and restarting the original inaccessible computer! I still had the same situation. I even tried it without wifi to try and get

<p>The only changes to the computer recently have been automatic updates to windows.</p>

<p>Would you believe that when I turned the computer on the next morning, without the new usb&nbsp;I saw a message that it was rectifying a problem with the hard disc. shortly after the home screen came up with no airplane mode icon and a normal login screen. So
 now all seems well. just one of life's little mysteries/</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for your help.</p>

            It is good to know that your issue was already resolved. It seems that your computer has run its built-in start-up repair program.

<h2>            An older CDr is showing as filled, but the data is not being displayed when opened.</h2>
                    My father recorded a pro tools session back in the year 2000 and the studio bounced the session to a cdr data cd. I have windows 7 and when I put in the 12 year old disc it says the space is nearly all filled on it, but when I try to open, it shows a blank
 disc in windows explorer. The disc is in very good condition with no scratches and it has been on the cd shelf untouched. I don't want to damage or delete the data on it, as I wish to find the audio in the project session folder and remix my dad's song because
 the studio mastered it horribly in my opinion. Microsoft's fix it did not find any problems with my Drive.

            <p>Hello, thankyou!&nbsp;However the problem still continues.</p>
<p>I opened it&nbsp;on a windows&nbsp;7 computer, it shows something stored on them under capacity, but no files are found in the browser, on&nbsp;another computer running windows xp, it showed the cd as having 0 bytes and nothing on it.</p>
<p>I thought maybe it&nbsp;could be a problem with that&nbsp;one cd from the session back in 2000, but there were 3 others made, and they all do the same thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's probably not a Drive problem because newly written cds work with both my&nbsp;computers,</p>
<p><br />
If I had to guess what the problem was it would probably be that the software for writing the cds back in the year 2000 was not a built in standardized&nbsp;feature, and thus it was written differently than what is recognized by today's software.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is any way of recovering this data it would be very helpful.</p>

window where the program is actually running under UNIX. Note that the data<br />
files included in this folder have UNIX line-endings.</div>
<div>(7) How do I run MULVA on Windows?<br />
Included in the folder is a source file that has to be compiled under the <br />
respective operating system. You may have to adapt the file-endings<br />
prior to use.</div>

            <p>If the developer sent you the Windows source code, it will have to be compiled into an executable file for it to run on Windows. Source code is simply that - code and it cannot be executed as an application!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to get someone who can code to compile the source code for you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have access to someone who can compile the source for you, if you want, I could try to compile it for you. Copy all the source files into a folder, then put the folder onto OneDrive or DropBox and I will see if I can compile it for you</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to how to run the app on a Mac, not having intimate knowledge of the software, it would be impossible to say - you will need to ask the developer how to link his software into JUICE!</p>
