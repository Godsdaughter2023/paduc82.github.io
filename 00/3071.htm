            Hi Dianne,<br />
<br />
Excuse my interjection, but I know the answer to your issue and my colleague, Robear will not mind (I thought he would see the answer straight away also)<br />
<br />
Do you have the Google Toolbar Installed?<br />
<br />
Yes - you have an old version of the toolbar installed that is incompatible with IE8.
<br />
(If running Win7 then you must have upgraded from XP to Win7?)<br />
<br />
Please follow these instructions. (Assuming Win7, but similar for XP and Vista)<br />
<br />
Start&gt;Control Panel Items&gt;Programs and Features<br />
<br />
sort the list of Installed programs by Publisher and find and select Software from Google Inc.<br />
<br />
You may have both the <strong>Google Toolbar</strong> and the <strong>Google Toolbar Updater</strong> installed.<br />
<br />
Select and <strong>un-install</strong> them one by one.<br />
<br />
Very Important! <strong>Restart your Computer<br />
</strong><br />
When you computer restarts go to <strong>toolbar.google.com</strong> and download and install the latest
<strong>version (6).</strong> (that is if you want to install it. IE8 has the built-in Search Box which has most of the functions of the toolbar).<br />
<br />
Once you have the Compatible v6 of the Google Toolbar installed you should be able to open IE normally with all your enabled Addons accessible.<br />
<br />
Select the View&gt;Toolbars menu and you should see a (enabled) list of available toolbars. If you have no Toolbars in this list then go to Tools&gt;Internet Options - Advanced tab and check "Enable third-party browser extensions".<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No - you do not have the Google Toolbar Installed - I am mistake please follow Robears advice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

<h2>            Emojis in MS Word</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp; I recently installed Office 365 and I noticed that when I insert an emoji smiley face in Word, the font automatically changes to Segoe UI Emoji and I have to manually switch back to my original font.&nbsp; Does anyone know a fix for this?&nbsp; It;s very annoying
 because I often use smiley faces.</p>
<p>

            <p>Can't be done I'm afraid.&nbsp; All you can do is fill in the cell background using the Fill Color button in the Font group in the Home tab of the ribbon.</p>
<p>You can change the font colour of <em>part</em> of the text in a cell by selecting it in the Formula bar and using the Font Color button, next to the Fill Color button.</p>

<p>Vista and Windows 7 (at least the high end versions) come with a built-in tool for previous versions. In Explorer, just go to the folder where your file was stored, right click on the file and choose "Properties". There should be a tab labelled "Previous
 Versions".</p>

<h2>            Lumia 950&#58; can&#39;t stop downloading email attachment</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>for about one week, I am the proud owner of a new Lumia 950 and - overall - I am very happy with the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But one thing bothers me quite a lot: regardless which email account, I switched off the option to download the whole email immediately so that I can chose if I would like to download, e.g., a 30mb pdf-file while not having wifi. But turning off the option
 does not matter. While in the email embedded pictures are not downloaded, attached files like pdf- or word-files are still downloaded. This annoys me very because I have already used 80% of my monthly data plan within one week because of this unmeant file
 downloads!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, of someone has a good hint for me that would be very nice! :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>Andre</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>for about one week, I am the proud owner of a new Lumia 950 and - overall - I am very happy with the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But one thing bothers me quite a lot: regardless which email account, I switched off the option to download the whole email immediately so that I can chose if I would like to download, e.g., a 30mb pdf-file while not having wifi. But turning off the option
 does not matter. While in the email embedded pictures are not downloaded, attached files like yI pdf- or word-files are still downloaded. This annoys me very because I have already used 80% of my monthly don't see the option to download at all.data plan within
 one week because of this unmeant file downloads!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, of someone has a good hint for me that would be very nice! :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<h2>            Disabled focused inbox in Outlook but it returns after a PC restart</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the title suggests, a client of ours is having an issue where having disabled Focused inbox, the setting reverts after a restart of the PC and focused inbox is enabled again. They have to disable each time again in Outlook and while it is not the most
 critical of issues, it is getting quite frustrating for them at this point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give a bit of background, this only seems to occur under one email account, there is one mailbox that several users use (They have a separate Outlook profile created for this on their PC's and this is the only email account in this profile), they also
 have separate Outlook profiles for their own personal email accounts but there are also 2 spare PC's where this email account is the only Outlook profile setup, so no other profiles/accounts added in to Outlook, these are sort of kiosk PC's I guess. So the
 issue doesn't seem to be down to other accounts being added based on that. I have performed all the updates I can find for Windows and for Office, the PC is running Windows 10 and the Office version is 2016 as part of Office 365 Business Premium. I have also
 changed the setting via the OWA display settings in a hope that this would push through to the devices and fix the issue but unfortunately not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said it just seems to be this one email account so I am guessing the issue is with this account, though aside from this anomaly there are no other issues with the email account that I or the users are aware of, it functions normally and everything works
 as you'd expect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please advise if there is any way of permanently disabling the focused mailbox or if there is anything else that I should try, please note all PC's have all the latest patches etc. installed and some have had Office cleanly removed and reinstalled
 as part of testing. I do not think it is down to any individual PC, I can only assume it is the account itself that is causing the issue but I would appreciate any insight or advice you can provide on this, any information you need I will be happy to provide,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Chris</p>

<p>Hi man,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have faced some of the problems You said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.when we open the photos or web is opened it says "memory full please close some items" and wen the phone is restarted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; it works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have faced this problem once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.the phone sometimes hangs itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have faced this two time one @ very beginning of the day I have purchased that day I really worried abt usage of phone.</p>
<p>Then last week once it happened while my friend using mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.when application is clicked it take some time to open, ie: its slow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This you have to sacrifice to use Symbian S60 phones this can't be washed out from nokia</p>
<p>That's why my friend choosing Samsung galaxy S instead of Nokia N8.</p>
<p>N8 is better than Samsung Galaxy in all the features list but not the Speed vice You know the S's speed is 1Ghz ARM core.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This 3rd Bug can't be fixed for any of the nokia phones can be minimized to nokia's best speed(that too LOW I think :smileywink:).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.photos take time to load in photos folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This too same problem of speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.the sensor is not working exactly sometimes. The display goes blank if the phone is rotated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really this is annoying and goes crazy sometime.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.the browser hangs wen full screen viewing is done while browsing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This too I'm facing frequently.</p>
<p>While browsing many time the OPTIONS and BACK/EXIT&nbsp; tab is Gone away from the screen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then I have to&nbsp; use CALL END(RED) to Close and re-start the APP(WEB)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7.the sound of music is not good as expected.the ring of the phone is not loud enough and headset sound is not good
<i>😞</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>yes really its Sound quality worries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very LOW quality Sound .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pls do an UPGRADE NOKIA&nbsp; if you can</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Loudness is not enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this much LOW loudness they r writing in the Guide Full volume usage can damage u r ear .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this much sound I can't hear music even with motor running sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9.why is nokia providing trial version software like adobe(no full screen support),quick office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This we can download from their Home site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just Showing-off&nbsp; " We have This This this and this"" just build-up.</p>
<p>Waste flow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10.when the phone is slided the display will goes blank and it take time to light the keypad. (the sliding problem is<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; still not solved in latest version).<br />
11.the keygaurd code works slow, wen unlocked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same problem You have to do update nokia.</p>
<p>Pls do as quick as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally what is Nokia C6-00.1&nbsp;&nbsp; ? Not nokia C6-01 not Nokia C6-00.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really I'm asking What's nokia C6-00.1 ???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            hey,<br />
<br />
the N95-2 8GB with Spiderman movie, was a promotion handset. What you've done is upgraded the software on your handset to that available on the latest standard N95's which DON'T come with Spiderman,mainly because the promotion is over! I've contacted Nokia
 directly with this issue as i've had a customer with the same issue. In short, as Nokia have told me, There is no way to revive the lost movie as the software has been upgraded and it cant be downgraded to a promotional one.<br />
<br />
Note: Please do not attempt to upgrade software without reading the cautions and warnings issued by Nokia first.<br />
<br />
Hopefully Helpful,<br />

            The situation is that if you make a backup of your N95 8Gb using N-series PC Suite (note: it has to be the N-series version and not standard PC Suite), the licence key should have been backed up and could be restored after software update or repair.<br />
<br />
The Spiderman film is not part of the phone's software package, it is a promotional preinstalled extra - just like any DRM protected content that you buy and download, maintaining the data is the user's responsibility.

<h2>            re enter your password error message</h2>
                    <p>I am constantly being spammed by your error message which says you must re-enter your password for your account….</p>
<p>It happens on both of my phones, &nbsp;it happens every time I enter office, &nbsp;when I go to check my mail, &nbsp;when I read an email</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;it is both annoying frustrating and totally unproductive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have been a loyal Microsoft user for 20 years I think it is completely disgraceful that this error message which is clearly a fault in your software and your programs is not fixed and from what I can see has never been fixed. &nbsp;talk about promoting and
 selling your product on the false pretenses...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I am so frustrated that if you cannot supply me with an explanation and effects within the next &nbsp;48 hours I am gonna close my account my company's account my staff's account until everybody I can talk to why Google is a better alternative</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;finally I would have to say that the help section and the admin section of office 365 is obviously built by some technician who lacks either common sense or ease of usage if you want to get an idea of how other people service their customers and create
 useful help go and have a look at Google or Apple the new office 365 app is just clunky &nbsp;and your admin pages require a genius to work their way through the various layers that you put in place clearly to frustrate anybody seeking an answer</p>

            <p>Hi Geoff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>At Microsoft, we are committed to continuous improvement. Thanks for taking the time to share your experience so we can take steps to improve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We totally understand the inconvenience caused by keep popping out the error message to let you re-enter your password for your account. Based on your description, the issue you have encountered is that Outlook continually prompt for your password when you
 try to connect to Office 365. If my understanding is correct, I would like to confirm if you've already referred to this article:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/2984912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/2984912</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, Outlook keeps prompting for password could be caused by several reasons:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Outlook is configured to prompt you for credentials<br />
2. Incorrect password cached in credential storage<br />
3. Required Authentication Settings for outgoing server and incoming server<br />
4. Outlook Anywhere is not configured to use NTLM Authentication<br />
5. Corrupt Outlook profile<br />
6. Slow or unstable network connection</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please see what we can try as below:</p>
<p>1. Delete the old credentials -&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Open Control Panel&gt;User Account (View by: Category)&gt;Choose “Manage Windows Credentials” (under Credential Manager)&gt;find your Outlook account and remove.</span> Then,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/829918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">creating
 a new Outlook profile</a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;to see if there is any improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Checked the setting “Encrypt data between Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange” by clicking File &gt; Account settings &gt; Account settings
 &gt; more settings &gt; security tab &gt; "Encrypt data between Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If all above with no luck, we may need the following information for next troubleshooting:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. The tenant information, also known as the email address you are using to log in. I have sent you a private message to get that and you can click the link below to access the pm:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list</a></p>
<p>2. Some screenshots about the error you meet.</p>
<p>3. The detailed version of Outlook on your PC and phone.</p>
<p>4. How many users encounter the same issue in your organization?</p>
<p>5. Have your organization deployed an on-premises Exchange server or under a hybrid environment?</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;help section and the admin section of office 365, we really appreciate if if you can submit your feedback via&nbsp;</span><a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273493-office-365-admin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://office365.uservoice.com/forums/273493-office-365-admin</a>.

    <title>Project Summary report and Baseline - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark0894  say:</h3>
<h2>            Project Summary report and Baseline</h2>
                    I define a project baseline as a summary of the work plan. In the Project Summary Report the baseline is subtracted from the Schedule to get the variance. The PMBOK (Project Management Book of Knowledge) Earned value reporting formulas subtract schedule
 from the planned data. The earned value formula is Schedule Variance (SV) = Earned value( EV or cumulative baseline) - (Scheduled work)&nbsp;(PV); Example, my schedule costs are $37,919 and my baseline cost is $36,199. According to the Earned value formula the
 Variance is -$1,720 (overbudget)&nbsp; The Project Summary Report&nbsp;response is a positive $1,720.&nbsp; Am I missing something?

            <p>Mark,</p>
<p>No, you're not missing anything, you've simply discovered one of the little anomalies in Project. It certainly would seem to make more sense to show the variance in the Project Summary Report either as a negative value or in parenthesis, as it is in all
 Project views, but for whatever reason on the Project Summary Report it is shown as an absolute value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It didn't check other versions of Project to see if it has always been that way.</p>

<h3> shericn  say:</h3>
<h2>            view pim.vol</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Is there a way to view the content of pim.vol file in Windows Mobile phone? What I want to do is to view its content through a Windows Mobile phone app. For example, the sample code HelloSms was able to send SMS, but it cannot tell us which messages are already
 sent or received. I would like to add features to it so that I can view the messages sent and received in addition. In order to do this, my idea was to simply view the content of pim.vol and display it. But I don't know how to open and view the content of
 it when writing Windows Mobile code. How would I be able to do this? If this is not the only way, is there another way to view the current SMS information?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Bug Report for Word 2013&#58; Document Recovery panel disappears after enabling editing mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a bug report for Word 2013, I hope this is the correct place to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The scenario is this:</p>
<p>1. After a crash with several open documents, I open Word for this first time since the crash by opening a new document that starts in 'Protected View'</p>
<p>2. At this point the Document Recovery panel is opened and showing several documents</p>
<p>3. Clicking on 'Enable' to open the document in editing mode, removes the&nbsp;Document Recovery panel and it does not restore again. There is no option to reach the recovered document since the crash unless finding the folder in which they were stored and manually
 opening the .asd files.</p>

            <p>Yes, I think that eventually I found them, but it took some digging and the panel should not have disappeared.</p>

            I believe&nbsp;that the disappearing is by design. The idea is that you should be presented with recovered documents when you first (re-)open Word after a crash. If you choose not to open them at that point, Word hides and does not redisplay the recovery panel.<br />

            I think the point is that the Recovery Panel is showing several documents, but it is necessary to open them all before editing any of them. The OP opened one and enabled editing, and the panel disappeared, making the rest inaccessible.

            Yes, that was my point as well: Word presents the recovered files only once, and you lose them if you don't open all of them at that point. But I wouldn't call it a bug.

<p>Stefan, I think you miss the full context of the scenario:</p>
<ol>
<li>Word crashed with say - 5 opened documents.</li><li>Now, when Word is closed (right after the crash), I open a document which I downloaded from an email attachment, therefore, Word opens that document in&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">'Protected View', AND showing the recovery panel
 for the 5 documents. As it should.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">At this point, I haven't made any decision about the 5 recovered document, I just want to edit the document I just opened, so I click '</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Enable'.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Word re-opens, without the recovery panel.</span></li></ol>
<p>I haven't made any decision about the recovered docs, I haven't closed Word - just clicked 'Enable' and the recovered documents are lost.</p>
<p>IMHO - that shouldn't happen, and that's a bug.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Personal Account and Student account connection</h2>
                    <p>I've had Office 365 on my personal account for some reason that I can't really identify. At first I installed Office 365 through my university and went into my regular account and it just worked for me for some reason. So I figured I got the connection to
 work. Apparently it registered that I purchased the product and that's why I was able to use it. For the past 3 years I've used my personal account for all of my school related stuff. This means all my files that I have made during my time in school are under
 my personal account and everything has been synced to my personal account.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to continue using my personal account for all my student needs so I don't have to manage two One Drives and two Outlook calendars at the same time. I've been trying to get Office 365 Student through microsoft since its cheap and has multiple
 years upon purchase, but sinc K-State University already offers it, I cannot purchase it to place under my personal account and will always direct me to K-States download site and have me sign into my student account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why I ask the question, how can I allow my personal account to have the Office 365 privileges of my student account while I am a student?</p>
<p>(Note: "while I am a student")</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't expect Office 365 for free, I just don't want to have to migrate everything to a new account and then have to transfer it all back. It would be way too tedious and time consuming.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Microsoft Certified Technician Scams - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cindyvickers0908  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Certified Technician Scams</h2>
                    <p>I noticed the comment posted regarding the man who was cold called by a scammer, I think regarding the Ammy Scam.&nbsp; He had asked who these people are and why aren't they in jail yet. That email was dated 2013. Here we are almost at 2020 and they have been
 not only scamming the US, but also Great Britain, Australia, Canada, Netherlands, Germany and Japan.&nbsp; In the US recently an 82 year old woman was scammed out of $40,000.00 , her life savings. She committed suicide and left behind a devastated family. Most
 scams come from India, but a few come from Africa and even from within the US. Boca Raton, FL. is a hot spot for call centers.&nbsp; The amount of intelligence gathered by citizens and handed over to the authorities within their respective countries and to the
 Indian authorities would fill a warehouse of 40,000 Sq. Ft.&nbsp; There was an arrest of about 120 some odd scammers who received 20 years each. But it didn't put a dent in the amount of call centers they have and the amount of willing people to willing steal from
 people, senior citizens are a favorite target. They have no care about the mess they leave with the people they have stolen from. Some people can't make mortgage or rent payments, car payments or feed their families. The Cyber Police and other Authorities
 in India are all paid off. They have received truck loads of intelligence with exact evidence, pictures, names, recordings etc. Even their ISPs do not respond. The US gives India $55Billion each year for food, Medicine, Military etc. I can see a clear way
 to shut them down. Maybe not with the current President, but soon.&nbsp; They only other way is to educate each American Citizen about all the different scams, and each victim country should do the same.&nbsp; Well, that is my take on it. When scammers call me, I make
 sure to waste their time and ruin their day. While I am wasting their time, at the very least they are NOT scamming another victim.&nbsp; Never let some log onto your device and never give them private information.</p>

            These scams has been around for many years and users have to be careful not fall for them and it they fall, they have to take action by contacting their bank and local authorities to help them out.

<p>I understand that these scams have been around for many years, but never at the level where it has the attention of Senators because of a resulting suicide.&nbsp; People need to be educated via a major platform, such as Microsoft. The entire nation, every citizen
 needs to know. And not all scams do not involve Microsoft. The authorities at some of the highest levels have been handed intel for over 10 years, and yet very little is done.&nbsp; Educate Educate Educate. If people understood then it could stop this crisis in
 a heartbeat.</p>

<p>And just exactly what would the venue for that education be Cindy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most&nbsp;people haven't been in a school for decades and the problem isn't really education, it's basic common sense.&nbsp; I know people who've never been beyond high school and some not even that and they wouldn't be fooled by such scams for a second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also known of people with degrees who've&nbsp;been&nbsp;fooled, including some who've been taken by other scams that have nothing to do with computers or any technology, such as the "Grandparents Scam", which tricks mostly elderly people into believing their
 grandchildren are in jail or otherwise need money.&nbsp; In many cases this results in much larger losses than most technical support scams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So where do you draw the line and whom is responsible for performing the education or in fact paying for it?&nbsp; The companies who's names are being abused by the scammers?&nbsp; Why? Aren't they really just victims of the scammers too, with their good names being
 misused and sullied, while&nbsp;actually they have absolutely nothing to do with the scams?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In truth, no one has tried harder to both collect information about the scammers victimizing their customers and providing that to authorities than Microsoft, as well as providing education through the avenues that might help like the AARP and other organizations.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2018/11/29/new-breakthroughs-in-combatting-tech-support-scams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">New breakthroughs in combatting tech support scams - Microsoft on the Issues</a></p>

<p>
</p><p>So I say again, who do you think will educate these people? &nbsp;And why, if many are educated, do they still fall for the scams?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Might it be that in many cases&nbsp;the core problem isn't really education at all, but rather feeble minded individuals whom for whatever reason don't have the mental capacity to properly vet the information they're receiving in a sensible way?&nbsp; And if so, who's
 going to help in that case, or should we take their computers, phones and other technology&nbsp;away in order to protect them from themselves?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, for anyone who's actually fully read and analyzed all of the threads here relating to any scams, all of these individual issues exist.&nbsp; There's not a single version of any scam, but rather many variations, which for a strong minded individual
 are easy to recognize, but for some others seem as different as the myriad details the scammers provide in order to confuse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In truth, all scams are really just modern versions of the same con[fidence} schemes that con men have been selling to the weak minded for centuries, with the first con likely occurring shortly after language was first used.&nbsp; Some TV PSA advertisements have
 attempted to explain this, but then the potential victims actually need to see these and pay enough attention in order to learn.&nbsp; How often do you really think that happens?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And how many people do you think will actually see your message here and why?&nbsp; Maybe&nbsp;a few&nbsp;people and how many of those do you think&nbsp;might actually not know all of this already?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've stated myself here in several threads before, until every person on earth receives an education that includes good basic instruction in common sense items relating to confidence schemes, computers and technology in general, these scams will still
 continue to work in some cases.&nbsp; And as long as older people continue to lose their faculties due to dementia, or even some younger people have issues that affect their mental capacity, they will require some form of protection that's difficult to put in place,
 since someone first needs to recognize that the individual's&nbsp;problem exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I'm not saying none of this should be attempted, only that to think there's a simple or even a single answer is naïve.&nbsp; The reality is that major efforts are occurring at all levels of government, industry and various other organizations, but all
 of these combined still haven't stopped the scams completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you really want to have an impact, go to your local organizations and help those in your own region like the elderly or other groups most likely to be affected, since none of those will ever see a posting here until it's far to late to matter.&nbsp; And
 it doesn't matter who posts it, no matter how official or trustworthy they may actually be.</p>

<p>Hot under the collar are you matey? I never expected anyone to actually see my post on MS as clearly you have zero traffic. Also tech scams are not in the majority as the volume of other scams far out number them. I only thought an extra post wouldn't hurt
 if someone ventured that way. We are already doing more then Microsoft or any government or policing agency and still to no avail. Our avenue is both YouTube Scambaiters, we are located in many countries. The other is person to person. We don't care to educate
 people about Microsoft technogy, nor do we care if they even have your product. They could have Apple for all we know. That is not the education I was referring to. We sit logged in their call centers like ghosts, watching, filming, and recording scams in
 progress. We even interfere in their scams, breach the payments gateways and refund as many "victims" as possible. We do not ever refer to a victim as "simple minded" as you did. They are victims.&nbsp; We follow the 💰.&nbsp; We work around the clock as we are in all
 or most time zones.&nbsp; You are kind of a jerk and certainly for a Microsoft Professional you borderlined on rude. I will be sure to forward your kind and caring response on YouTube and forward it to some persons of position in your billion dollar publicly traded
 company.</p>

<p>Not at all&nbsp; Cindy, I'm just realistic, since I've been involved in supporting people on various types of computer systems&nbsp;professionally, commercially, and personally for 4 decades now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, if you can't understand I'm not a Microsoft employee or even directly associated with them in any way, you don't know much about this community, as I'm just a volunteer here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've learned in 40 years of supporting people is that just like the poor, there will always be some with less mental capacity.&nbsp; This is also the vulnerability that all of the scams and cons exploit, so it's a fundamental issue that you need to understand
 when attempting to provide them&nbsp;protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The difference between me and you is that you're an activist, while I'm a realist.&nbsp; I've long ago realized that some people simply shouldn't be allowed access to a computer that's Internet attached without personal guidance.&nbsp; That includes children, but
 also those with other mental capacity limitations, as well as in some cases the elderly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not that it wouldn't be "nice" if those like yourself could actually clean up the world, but until people like Putin, Maduro and others who abuse their own people are gone, the criminals will always have a safe place to hide, sanctioned or not.&nbsp; So
 your efforts will often go in vain, regardless of whether most people in the more benevolent parts of the world feel they're the correct thing to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm not against you, just not going to waste my time on pointless effort.&nbsp; I'll concentrate instead on those few I'm directly responsible for, while offering those who come here who should have known better the sanity check they need.&nbsp; Being "nice" doesn't
 get the point across&nbsp;that those malicious actors out there don't give a hoot what happens to anyone, so wake up and keep that in mind for the next time your gut's telling you there's something wrong with their story and you're tempted not to listen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those are the people who actually reach this community and it's always verification of their own foolishness they're wanting&nbsp;to receive, if they aren't actually stating this fact&nbsp;themselves and trying (vainly) to warn others&nbsp;here in advance, just as you've
 done&nbsp;.&nbsp; Think about that for a few seconds before being tempted to respond and you'll realize I'm correct.</p>

<p>Listen matey, that was my first time locating that site and had no idea you were only a volunteer moderator.&nbsp; I still consider you to be impertanent. We are not on the same slide here. I am not talking about Putin, or Jong-Un. You are way off target. I think
 maybe we may share one issue in common here, but you have taken this to a whole new level on major problem on the world stage. Our issue is simple and to the point, we have made awesome strides and as a result 120 Indian Scammers, or there about, received
 20 yr sentences. It was a major combined effort or which my role was probably minimal considering the amount of professionals working together on one issue. We are not trying to solve world peace or solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it's just one issue.
 We won't stop, we won't quit. I can't say you are right or wrong and certainly am not co-signing your multitude of issue. Please lay off the responses, it's really bordering on harassment. My ship in sailing in an entirely different direction mate. Bon Voyage</p>

            Just one thing. I am retiring after a very long career&nbsp; starting in late 70's after graduating from college. I have working in the industry before and after DOS was first out there on a 5 1/4 inch floppy and Microsoft released it's Personal computer in
 81. I am ending my very long career working in the K-12 industry primarily on software implementation, training and support in a 5 state territory. So it seems we share something else in common - very long careers and lots of combined experience. We just can't
 seem to find a common denominator on what my one issue is. Again Bon Voyage and good luck in your future endeavors.

<p>Yes Cindy, I feel we're a lot closer on this than you think, I've just dealt with it form the security perspective for far longer, so evaluate the true problems in a different way than you do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started my career around the same time, beginning with building a personal&nbsp;IMSAI 8080 and quickly moving to writing assembly language BIOS and performing other support for customers of that computer store and others in the region.&nbsp; Soon though I started
 supporting early systems&nbsp;as administrator&nbsp;in an engineering school, then a computer manufacturing and support organization for&nbsp;a full range of school, government and commercial customers.&nbsp; I eventually transitioned to security services including vulnerability,
 security and phishing assessment and testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I've seen these same issues across the full spectrum of customers and yes, I've become very opinionated in where the true problems lie, but with good data to back it up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key problem is that the Internet, though it opened the world to anyone with a computer, also brought that world directly inside the computers and homes of every single person who owns one.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this initially required every person to become&nbsp;a
 security expert and though that's improved some, the core issue is that many aren't and never will be proficient enough to protect themselves, regardless how much we try to educate, since&nbsp;most simply don't have the aptitude in the technical arena.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The more dangerous technology though has been VoIP telephony, since combined with the Internet and the very call centers that US companies often helped fund, it brings the more malicious from around the world directly to every cell phone and ancient landline
 phone in every home in the world.&nbsp; It's this ability that's most often leveraged to abuse the often feeble or at least less quick minds of the elderly or potentially inebriated individuals, using their less prepared faculties against them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem isn't catching all of the potential malicious actors, it's how to return the boundaries that used to exist at national borders or others due to items&nbsp;such as&nbsp;cost/call, while still allowing those with more ability and willingness to accept risk
 to continue taking advantage of what the Internet enables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll never catch all of the potential criminals, since just like the victims there'll continue to be "one born every minute".&nbsp; The only hope is to find ways to protect those that need it that can be built into the systems that allow the access themselves.&nbsp;
 For example, the crowd-sourced abilities that smartphone makers have recently built into their phone apps that allow each user to mark a call as a probable spam caller, notifying others of this fact when that same&nbsp;number calls them only seconds later, providing
 a simple ability to block these callers either on demand or in all cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Technology alone won't resolve all of this, but using the technology in order to provide the systems to aid in the required protection makes far more sense than trying to catch each individual scammer, since those systems are far too slow to ever be truly
 effective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hopeful that we're beginning to see real solutions developed though, it will just take time for the newer devices to get into the hands of enough people to make them effective at covering those in need, such as&nbsp;children and the elderly who will always
 need some level of&nbsp;protection from themselves.&nbsp; Along with the warning that many others may need in case their faculties are currently compromised or they're just not paying good attention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop or at least greatly reduce the ability to reach the potential&nbsp;target and the attacks will stop as they fail to pay off as easily.</p>
<p>

            You are coreect about "we will never catch" all of these criminals or stop organized crime.&nbsp; I fully agree and also smartphone manufacturers software that flags potential SPAM calls is great. My phone stops them all. But one other thing I&nbsp; might add is
 that individuals do mot need to be technically or computer savvy at all to prevent the tech scams They or any of the multitude of scams out there, they only need to know a few things.&nbsp; The IRS, FBI, SSA,&nbsp; the President will never call you period, hang up the
 phone and notify a trusted family member. You will never receive a gift of money or amything else in which they want money first, again hang up the phone. And so forth.&nbsp; Our most vulnerable which are our Seniors, not talking about about downs syndrome&nbsp; children
 or mildly autistic individuals, who do answer phones&nbsp; as a responsible caregiver or other adult will remove the phone from their hands. People need to tell their parents and grandparents. They should

<h2>            Virus &#34;Warning Your PC may be at Risk&#34; changed file extensions</h2>
                    <p>my computer had the virus with the popup msg "Warning Your PC may be at Risk". &nbsp;I was able to remove it using malwarebytes and norton.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that many files (almost 3,000) with extension txt, doc, and jpeg have been renamed by appending .zbdvacj, including those in program files, e.g. ab.doc.zbdvacj</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot use these files anymore. &nbsp;They have gibberish if I open them in word or notepad, or if I remove the extension from the file name. &nbsp;I don't have a backup to restore from.<br />
</p>
<p>Is there a way to recover these files?</p>

<h2>            how to send mms picture messages to my pc from 6233</h2>
                    I have a Nokia 6233 and have saved my mms photos on the memory card but can't get them onto my computer. PC suite doesn't even recognise they are there. I can transfer sms, photos and music to my pc with no trouble. I have set up my phone to receive mms
 etc but don't know what to do . I use bluetooth

            Are you using the latest version of PCSuites for your phone? In PCSuites phone browser, you should see the phone memory &amp; the memory card(with jpg extension photos), all you have to do is cut &amp; paste(jpg files) to a directory in your PC/Laptop. Else, get
 hold of a memory card reader, set the PC to display also hidden files, just do the cut &amp; paste. MMS (one of packet services given by phone provider) is for phone to phone not PC to phone or vice versa. Or, send the photos one by one by bluetooth to the PC/Laptop.<br />

            thanks but I've worked it out.<br />
I opened the mms jpeg images and saved them to my Images folder. Then I used the bluetooth to drag the photos to my pc.

    <title>How do we configure the Zune software to use a microSD card on our new - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doctor-who  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do we configure the Zune software to use a microSD card on our new Surface 3&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased a new Surface 3. I totally <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
love it</span>! This I the first tablet I've ever owned. I got the 128 GB model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, even with 128 GB that isn't large enough for my wife's music library. I don't know how she's done it, but she's got a music collection that's over 20 GB in size. To help alleviate this I bought a 64 GB microSD card, which works fine in our Surface.
 And now we want to transfer all of her music from her Zune collection on her desktop, to the Surface 3. And I want all of it to go onto the microSD card. (Her PC is dying anyway, which is one reason why we purchased the Surface 3, so she could use that should
 her desktop die.) Installing the latest version of the Zune software will be easy enough. But how do I get the Zune software to use the microSD card for storage of everything she's got, and not use the Surface 3's HD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For that matter, what's the easiest way of getting her music and videos from her PC to our Surface 3?</p>

            <p>Hello Doctor-Who:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the questions you have about managing your collection on a SD card for you&nbsp;new Surface Pro 3.&nbsp; I have not personally had the chance to work with a Surface Pro 3 using a SD card so some of the following is speculation
 based on how the&nbsp;Zune software works&nbsp;and my experience moving content&nbsp;from PC's to&nbsp;Surface devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I would like to&nbsp;discuss is the moving of content from the computer to the Surface tablet.&nbsp; There are actually a couple of options you can consider and depending&nbsp;on how the collection is made up, you may need to do a bit of both to complete
 the move.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, if you collection is made up entirely of content that you own, no DRM protection, you can get a SD card reader that allows you to put the SD card into your computer and move the contents on your computer HD to the SD card.&nbsp; From there you can move
 the SD card to the Surface tablet where the content should be able to be read by the Zune software, Xbox Music application and other media management programs.&nbsp;</li><li>Next, you can re-download your content directly to the Surface.&nbsp; You should be able to set this up to download directly to the SD card in the Surface.&nbsp; This is going to be the only way this will work if your wife has a Xbox Music Pass or if the videos in
 question were purchased via the Zune marketplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;Videos purchased&nbsp;via Zune&nbsp;can be downloaded via the&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;Video application on your Surface.&nbsp; If you do not want to actually download these,&nbsp;she can stream them via this app.&nbsp; If she does have a Music Pass
 and has an&nbsp;extensive collection downloaded with the Zune software, she&nbsp;can restore&nbsp;the subscription content&nbsp;via the Zune software by going to settings &gt; account &gt; subscription history &gt;&nbsp;restore all.&nbsp; Now if content has been removed from the store or relisted,
 the content will not be able to restore and there will be an error.&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p>Now we will discuss setting up the Zune software to look to the SD card and&nbsp;even setting this up so new downloads will store to the SD card.&nbsp; &nbsp;As mentioned, this is not something I have been able to do first hand so I will be including a forum post or two
 related to this topic that discuss some issues that others have run into when setting this up.&nbsp; The first thing you would do is add the SD card to your device and ensure that it is recognized in File Explorer.&nbsp; Once it is, open the Zune software and go to
 settings &gt; software &gt; collection.&nbsp; If you see a "manage separately" button, click this first.&nbsp; At this point you should see a Monitored folders and a Zune folders section.&nbsp; Be sure you have the SD card listed in both sections.&nbsp; The monitored folders section
 will ensure the software looks here so you will see the content in your collection.&nbsp; The Zune folders section is where you will decide where newly downloaded content is sent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned,&nbsp;if you run into issues getting the Zune software to recognize the SD card, review this forum for a&nbsp;potential work around that may help you accomplish what you want.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/musicandvideo/forum/xboxmusic-zune_software/zune-software-will-not-recognize-sd-card-as-part/456dc6e7-4b93-4921-aef4-3b85faeb7f7b">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/musicandvideo/forum/xboxmusic-zune_software/zune-software-will-not-recognize-sd-card-as-part/456dc6e7-4b93-4921-aef4-3b85faeb7f7b</a>
</li></ul>
<p>The final thing I want to mention is considering the use&nbsp;of Xbox Music and Video moving forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that some need to use the Zune software (Windows&nbsp;Phone 7 and Zune player users) and others just simply like Zune&nbsp;better but this is something to
 explore.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can find more about managing your content with with&nbsp;the&nbsp;Xbox Music and Video applications here, &nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows/how-to-add-music" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-other-devices/windows/how-to-add-music</a>
