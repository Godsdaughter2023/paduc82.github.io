<h2>            Microsoft Account as sign in on computer</h2>
                    <p>I've been playing around with windows 10 for some months and have seen different changes with the new updates.&nbsp; One item that I would like to address is the sign in (user name and password).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My family uses the same computer from time to time and I don't like having to use a Microsoft account addressed to myself for everybody in the household to use when they wish to use this computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second item is that I don't like the Microsoft account changing my computer name.&nbsp; I name each computer in this household for a specific reason and the Microsoft account sign in disrupts the freedom to keep the computer name you assigned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, my brother an elder, doesn't like that he has to set-up a Microsoft account to download games to play at his leisure, he asked me why there were no games with the OS?&nbsp; He doesn't care to get online and putting his name and/or e-mail out on the web.&nbsp;
 He was very against using X-Box.&nbsp; I have to agree with him, with all the hacking, spying, malicious acts of others on the web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other, than a few hiccups and some kernel power 41 crashes, I do like the program and it's ease of use.</p>
<p>

            <p>System &gt;&nbsp; Advanced settings &gt; Computer Name (tab)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree about that name, wish they would at least key it off the user name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sounds like you might&nbsp;think about&nbsp;making&nbsp;yourself a new household Microsoft email address and use it for the main computer login.

            <p>Why not setup local accounts for the different family members?&nbsp; Could even set different user permissions if you want to restrict some users access (eg: restrict what children can do).</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS used to (I think as part of live essentials) offer free family security pack which offered account monitoring facilities (so the parent's admin account could monitor / block access to sites etc on the childs user account).&nbsp; Not sure if this is still available
 or if it is if it's compatible with W10.</p>

            <p>Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good idea if I wanted to make myself an administer of the household.&nbsp; But let us be real, this is a family home, not a totalitarian dictatorship.&nbsp; Many people have family computers that have multiple users.&nbsp; Some of us are struggling to make ends meat and
 can't afford to buy new and/or multiple computers as well.&nbsp; Besides, my older brother dislikes user names and passwords, he's lucky if he remembers to flush the toilet or to put the seat down.&nbsp; There are many customers out there that value their privacy and
 several whom just want to play microsoft solitaire to help themselves to relax.&nbsp; I mean we all have older relatives that enjoy the simple things.&nbsp; Why do we have to make it more difficult and controlling for them to be able to enjoy computers as they had in
 the past.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>For these type of customers there should be a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em>microsoft download</em></span> that they can get the same old favorites to install on the computer without having to log in and download them.&nbsp; I myself, tried to select the correct game for him and it wasn't the same.&nbsp; He wouldn't play it and became very
 indifferent!!!&nbsp; We need to keep our elders in mind when we advance our technology.&nbsp; Not all of them have the memory or snap to learn new things, as we do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the grandachildren, I'm sure that they can shown me a few tricks on current devices and they love X-Box Games.&nbsp; They already have microsoft accounts and know it by heart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I start the computer, I do not want to use a user name or password, I would think that it should be my right as a citizen, to have the freedom of that choice on the computer I paid for and is in my home.&nbsp; I don't like the idea of somebody forcing me
 to have a user name and password, just to start the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Developers need to remember that family households have people of all ages and different opinions of privacy as well as what is convenient and non-convenient for them as the end user.&nbsp; I'm about security, but they don't want any part of it.&nbsp; Also he wants
 the control of getting on the computer when he feels like it, without me logging on to the computer for him to use it (he doesn't want an user name and/or password).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some days it's hard for him to see the keyboard keys to know which key is the correct letter, but he sure loves the older microsoft solitaire, spider solitaire, hearts, chess, etc...&nbsp; All he has to do is use the mouse and be able to see the icon.</p>

            I hate having to log in to my own computer.&nbsp; It's mine.&nbsp; It does not belong to Microsoft.&nbsp; If I'm not worried about securing my data, why should&nbsp;the corporation that wrote my operating system&nbsp;be allowed to order me to secure my own data? The pictures,
 files, programs, and records on it are mine.&nbsp; They don't belong to Microsoft.&nbsp; With the new&nbsp;W10 I find that I have to use a password/pin&nbsp;if want&nbsp;to use Cortana.&nbsp; I'm not complaining about having passwords on my email account or similar security features.&nbsp;
 But I don't have to hand enter a password each time I use those programs.&nbsp; My phone doesn't make me&nbsp;log in every time I&nbsp;use it, and it has a personal assistant.&nbsp; Why does using Cortana force me to use a password/pin to open my computer?&nbsp; Why can't the operating
 system log me in just like it does on my phone?&nbsp; If I want to use a security feature&nbsp;to lock&nbsp;my computer, the option is certainly there, bu

    <title>I want IE10 to open in the desktop mode and I want it as the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> walthy  say:</h3>
<h2>            I want IE10 to open in the desktop mode and I want it as the default&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Why has this seemed to have changed recently?&nbsp; I want IE10 as my default browser and I always want it to open in the desktop mode.&nbsp; It did this just fine until about a week ago and then something changed.&nbsp; Was there an update or something?&nbsp; According to
 the support site if IE10 is the default browser it will always open in the "Metro" mode and only when it is not the default browser it will open in the desktop mode.&nbsp; Clearly this was not the case until just recently.&nbsp; When I click on a link in my email I
 want to see IE10 open in the desktop mode.&nbsp; So now Microsoft if forcing me to change my default browser to something else to get this functionality?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something is wrong here.&nbsp; Anybody got any ideas why this has happened.&nbsp; I'm running Stardock's Start8 from startup so I can have my desktop all of the time.&nbsp; When I get a touch screen, then maybe I will want to change.&nbsp; Windows Blue can't come fast enough
 for me to hopefully at least give me a choice.&nbsp; I like Windows 8 stability, but not its restrictions on choice.</p>

<h2>            Syncing MS Outlook 2016 calendar and contacts with iPhone and iPad</h2>
                    <p>Since I installed <strong>Windows 10 </strong>and <strong>MS Office Home and Business&nbsp;2016
</strong>I cannot sync&nbsp;the&nbsp;Outlook contacts and calendar&nbsp;on my desktop PC&nbsp;with my iPhone and iPad via iTunes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The iCloud apps (calendar and contacts) on the Start up screen are synced via iCloud.&nbsp; BUT, I want to sync the 2016 Outlook calendar and contacts that is installed on my desktop PC with my iPhone and iPad.&nbsp; As I update my iPhone and iPad calendars/contacts
 I also want my MS Outlook Calendar/contacts on my PC to sync.&nbsp; When I had Windows 7 and MS Office 2013, I was able to sync across my all devices.&nbsp; Now when I try to sync devices (PC, iPhone and iPad)
<em>via iTunes it tells me that the contacts and calendar are synced via iCloud and they are synced with the iCloud apps on the start up screen</em>, but my&nbsp;MS Office Outlook&nbsp;2016 calendar and contacts that is installed on my PC is not synced with my&nbsp;iPhone
 and iPad.&nbsp;&nbsp;I use the Webmail provided by my internet service provider and, like I said, I am getting my emails across all my devices just fine.&nbsp; Only the contacts and calendars don't sync.&nbsp; The calendar in Outlook 2016 on my PC does not show any of the appointments/events
 that are on my iPhone and iPad.&nbsp; It does say "On this computer only", if this helps.&nbsp; Do I need to change some setting on my iPhone and iPad?&nbsp; I hope my question isn't too confusing.&nbsp; I'm not very good with technical computer stuff.&nbsp; Any ideas?

<p><span>Hi Mary,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your updates. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We could fully understand how frustrating it is when you are encountering this issue. Recently, we received a lot of similar issue from other Mac Users which is a common issue happens among Mac users. I didn’t
 mention it at first because you were using Font Manager That could be a reason why Word always pops up the error message about no access privileges. However, as you have tried to remove the front manager and clear font cache from your side. And the issue still
 exists. This means your issue is the same as other Mac users. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now we are doing the relevant tests on this issue and investigate it from our side. It will take some time to achieve it.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to get the updates on this issue timely, I would kindly suggest you also subscribe the following 2 threads. Also, if there is any update, we will post back here as soon as possible.</span></p>

            <p>As far as crashes:</p>
<p>It happens in conjunction with eraser function/button been used to remove handwritten remark (for example) I don't use it in any other office program (sorry have no use for one note and rest is even less pen useful ). Eraser is very common error it happens
 almost always after first button click followed by erasing action. Very repeatable.
</p>
<p>There is no error code it just crushes and shows recovery message.</p>
<p>"No pen" issue have no pattern (at least I haven't noticed one).&nbsp;I use pen only in word and adobe pdf. Adobe Reader have pen support on the level it so horrible we hope you won't use it, so I don't use it for pdf as much as it possible, so I can't&nbsp;report
 on anything but word. However once pen is frozen none of the programs going to see it. On the other hand mouse is still working.</p>
<p>the thing is I bought surface 3 pro only for it pen abilities (for that price there are much better ultrabooks)</p>
<p>due to nature of windows 8.1 I continue to use my old laptop for anything workload intensive (I choose 6 years old laptop over new system.... that definite success ) but I used pen few times only. It horrible and it starts to write before it touches surface,
 making writing in Word clumsy and it crashes. so combo of these two factors lead to incorrect writing followed by erasing action, followed by recovery of the file and in some cases all work is lost.

            <p>This is solution for someone else problem.</p>
<p>In my case eraser works, it jus crushes MS Word 2013 as I use it. </p>
<p>Every single time.</p>
<p>Pen disappearance meaning you loose all pen input apart one note calling button.
</p>
<p>Anyway I already reinstalled whole system from usb stick , after failed refresh. And I reinstalled office 2013 few times (4-5).</p>
<p>Pen can disappear in Adobe PDF, but use of eraser is ok. So it MS Word bug coupled with system handling pen.</p>

            Hello. Do you think the battery condition is very good? Have you noticed that it drains very quickly and does not hold a charge well? You might consider getting a new one if it is very old. If you think the battery is good and well charged, remove the
 battery for as long as you can (overnight is good). Take out all SD or SIM cards. Replace the battery and give the device a soft reset.&nbsp;

<h3> gjwpromo1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Image Size and pixelation in Access 2007 Report</h2>
                    Image Size:&nbsp; I have a report that lists the demographics of a manager, and has his picture.&nbsp; The image of the manager is found by the managers ID number.&nbsp; All the picture files are named with a number corresponding to the managers ID.&nbsp; So if I look at
 manager 101, the report looks for picture 101.jpg. &nbsp; I drew the image object on the report to be 1"X1".&nbsp; When I view the report on my 90 DPI monitor, using the standard size jpg from the digital camera, it is pixelated.&nbsp; When I print it, it is great.&nbsp; If I
 resize the actual JPG so that it is&nbsp; 90 dpi and cropped to 1"X1" in photoshop, it displays great.&nbsp; So there is a problem with Access if it has to resize a jpg (or BMP).&nbsp; Has anyone been able to get Access to display photos without having to resize them in

<p><br />
This is what I've found and I don't know if it has changed in subsequent versions to 2003 (which is what we're using here at work).&nbsp; We found that the only way to consistently show pics in a report is to set the size to a max of 1024x768.&nbsp; We had an issue where
 we had a very good camera being used by Asset Managers taking pics of real estate and coming back and using the highest resolution pics that the camera could make.&nbsp; But then only a few pics would show up in the report.&nbsp; Resizing back to 1024x768 made them
 all display properly.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that is my suggestion.&nbsp; I don't think it is the dpi which is the issue.&nbsp; I think it is the Resolution.</p>

            Thank you for the quick response.&nbsp; I never had this problem in Access 2003, and unfortunately I did upgrade because they threatened that 2003 wouldn't work with Win 7, so something did change.&nbsp; It is both the resolution and the size.&nbsp; If I match the JPG
 file to exactly the screen resolution, and set the size to exactly the size I drew the object to, then it works great.&nbsp; Maybe it is the total number of pixels (resolution X square inches), but one way or the other, while Access is adjusting the jpg to fit
 into my drawn object, it screws it up on the report preview, but prints out correctly.&nbsp; I have even converted to B&amp;W and the distortion is still there.&nbsp; It currently is 8-bit RGB.<br />

                    <p>The row auto-height feature isn't working for wrapped text in Excel 2016, it used to&nbsp;work by double-clicking the row now it makes the row the default Excel height of 12.75 pts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone experienced this problem and found a fix it?&nbsp; Even if you think you saw something about this but aren't sure if it's the same problem I'm happy to check it out and report back... please just&nbsp;point me in the right direction!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm open to suggestions from anyone... I have a lot of templates to create in Excel and I really don't want to be manually adjusting the height of every row!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also while I'm here, is Page Layout view the only view that shows an exact match of the page to that in print preview?&nbsp; I want to view the edit screen exactly like the printed view without using page layout view and I'm guessing this can't be done?&nbsp; Wrapped
 text appears different on the print preview screen despite using the same scaling for print layout as the screen layout... go figure!! So add this to the auto row height feature not working and it's a real hassle trying to get the two views to match!&nbsp; :o(</p>

<p>Hi Katrina</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue - double-clicking on a row or column boundary often doesn't auto-fit the row/column size</p>
<p>-&nbsp; The ribbon option works: Format - AutoFit </p>
<p>-&nbsp; Double-click <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">sometimes</span> works, never on the first attempt, sometimes on the second attempt for the same row/column.&nbsp; Bizarrely inconsistent.</p>
<p>-&nbsp; Triple-click seems to work but only on one row/column (I often select all rows/columns and auto-resize all at once, triple click only does the row/column actually clicked)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a long-time and expert user of Excel shortcuts (since 1992) - something has changed in its behaviour in a recent release.&nbsp; I have release 16.0.9330.2073 32-bit.</p>
<p>

<p>Excel can access XML to some extent. I've never had the occasion to need to; so I can't say.</p>

            You probably have Office 2016. There is no office 2015. Mac Office 2016 does not work the same way that Windows Office does. You can open HTML files using file-import. or in some cases you may be able to open them directly using File-Open. A direct data
 source from the web is not supported on the Mac as it is in Windows.<br />

    <title>Activating Yammer for SharePoint Online - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Activating Yammer for SharePoint Online</h2>
                    
<p>hello,</p>
<p>i am looking into activating yammer to use on my company's sharepoint 2013 site. the support.office.com faq for yammer activation states "please note that if your organization also uses sharepoint online sites, you cannot activate yammer enterprise using
 the same domain. check to make sure that you’ve verified both www.contoso.com for use with sharepoint sites and contoso.com for use with yammer enterprise."</p>
<p>i am a little unsure about what domain my sharepoint site uses. when i go to the sharepoint homepage the web address is (note, for privacy reasons i have replaced the actual company name with "contoso"): "<a href="https://contosomarketing.sharepoint.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contosomarketing.sharepoint.com"</a></p>
<p>in my o365 admin under domains, i have 3 domain options:</p>
<p>365.contosocompany.com</p>
<p>contosocompany.com</p>
<p>contosomarketing.onmicrosoft.com</p>

<p>which of these three is used for the sharepoint? the third? or the second?&nbsp;</p>

<p>when i go into activating yammer it gives me two options to select from for the domains,&nbsp;</p>
<p>contosocompany.com</p>
<p>365.contosocompany.com</p>

<p>there is no "www." before any of the addresses. when i select contosocompany.com, it does not active and gives me the error message pictured below. i'm afraid to select the other option, just to try it, in case it works and ends up being the wrong domain.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=5130d1ea-e414-4153-ba52-d738319794f7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d5130d1ea-e414-4153-ba52-d738319794f7" /></a></p>
<p>what domain should i be using? do i need &nbsp;a new domain? &nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you for any help, advice, or feedback you have on this issue. it is greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yammer isn't integrated at all with Sharepoint so I'm guessing the only issue would maybe be with log ins. They're not integrated either, but in the event you use a 3rd party service like okta, I suppose it makes sense to use the same domain as SP. We use
 company.sharepoint.com but all yammer content is at xxx.yammer.com. </p>

 It does show that is is a send and receive account. It has nothing to do with the junk settings. It is not being forwarded to any other account. I dont know if I am more frustrated with the lack of help or losing business!!!!</p>

 I really believe the problem is on your end as I tested my mail box on other computers I have at home with the same results but they work with other Outlook.com accounts. Among the other things I am even a subscriber for Windows Live Hotmail Plus! (it expires
 Nov 2013) so I am actually paying to use my email ... and I can't ...<br />
<br />
This is quite disappointing ...<br />

<p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>The pink and blue fields are both scattered throughout the entire page - it's not like the blue are on top and the pink are on the bottom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
First, yes I meant a subform, sorry, I'm responding from my Touchpad, which has a funky spell check.<br />
<br />
Ok, if you need the blue CONTROLS (not fields, you don't have fields on a form, but controls that may or may not be bound to fields in a table) scattered among &nbsp;the pink ones (or vice versa), then I suggest you read my blog article on Displaying Data from Related
 Tables. The techniques described there should help you do what you want.

            <p>Reading back over this thread, I am going to suggest that you stick with a single form - probably what you had at the start of this thread.</p>
<p>Change the record source of the form so that both tables are joined into a query - that allows fields from both tables on the form to be mixed together over the form.</p>
<p>You can make some of the textboxes locked so that users can't change the data in them - that would be your blue controls. The pink controls stay unlocked so the user can edit them.</p>
<p>If you have a strong wish to separate the blue controls to one part of the screen and the pink on another part of the screen - that is easy to do.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;main time to consider using 2 forms side-by-side - blue controls on one form and pink on the other - is when you can't join the 2 tables into a query that allows edits.</p>

                    <b><u>Request</u></b>
<div>
<div><b><u><br />
</u></b></div>
<div>Can someone please help resolve the following issues:</div>
<div>1. Cannot open any Office applications and receive "side-by-side configuration" error message</div>
<div>2. Cannot uninstall one of the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Packages with an "installation source...not available" error message.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b><u><br />

<b><u>Background</u></b>
<div><b><u><br />
</u></b></div>
<div>Within 4 days of installing and running Office Home and Student 2010 on a new Windows 7 laptop, I was no longer able to open Office applications. Each time I have tried opening any of the programs, I
 have received the following error:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div><i>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\EXCEL.EXE</i></div>
<div><i>The application has failed to start because its side-by-side configuration is incorrect. Please see application event log or use the command-line sxstrace.exe tool for more detail.</i></div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The error log description is:</div>
<div>

 on line 0. Invalid Xml syntax.</i></div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I followed the instructions I've found on the forums to reinstall&nbsp;Microsoft Visual C++ SP1 Redistributable Packages but it has not changed anything.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In trying to uninstall one of the packages I installed, I received the following error message:</div>

<h2>            Why Am I Paying More For Microsoft 365 Home&#63;</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">Hi - Everyone - My annual subscription to Microsoft 365 Home is due up for renewal this month, which is fine, and I do not have a problem in this regard. I have been happy with Microsoft 365 Home, apart from a few glitches in the
 early stages. My renewal amount is R1199.00 in South African currency. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify">What I can not understand is how does a South African Electronic store called "First Shop" sell what appears to be the same article for R799.00 incl VAT. (See Advert Below).

<p>The invoice template in Excel will not advance the invoice number by (1) when creating a new invoice.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "view tab" I select the Micros icon.&nbsp; In the drop down micros table I select "AssignNumbers".&nbsp; In XP I would get the following invoice warning "A
 unique number is already assigned to this form.&nbsp; Changing it may cause you bookeeping problems.&nbsp; Do you reallywant to assign a new number?"&nbsp; I would chose yes and the invoice number would advance by 1 number.&nbsp; Ex:&nbsp; invoice# 11 would change to 12.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know
 what to do to fix this?</p>
<p>Thanks Bill</p>
<p>Note: this function worked in XP</p>

            There are &gt;40 invoice templates, you will need to be a little more specific.

<br />You must use Windows Defender as a standalone AV in order to use Controlled folder access.

<p>Thanks Summit that's what it will be then.</p>
<p>I got a full subscription of McAfee and installed that</p>
<p>So I suppose I have to decide it I need to remove it or if McAfee has the same protection, would you know?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebuilt my machine as I got an email saying to pay $893 as they have my password and they did as they showed what it was on the mail, and if I didn't pay within 48 hours they will mail out screenshots of my mails and details passwords etc</p>
<p>He said he did it 6 months ago and if I change my password he will still be able to access it due to cached information, that why I rebuilt my PC, there was no mention of encrypting my files if I don't pay, any idea</p>
<p>He said his nickname in darknet is harry33</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

            Breaches happen usually where your username/ password gets leaked. Looks like the scammer is trying to get the benefit of this and trick you to this.
<br />My suggestion-Just do a clean installation of Windows. No need to buy a new PC. If you have a subscription of McAfee, continue with it until you have. Then go for Windows Defender.
<br />
<br />For clean install:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />My email is listed 6 times here, check yours. If it gets listed, no need to worry.

            <p>Hi Dianne,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It is a SCAM!!! Microsoft does not do that nor do they have partners who do that nor do they hire sub-contractors or people or even get volunteers to do that. There are probably thousands of such companies out there doing this every day - we get two
 or three messages like this (or more) every day asking about it. You are the lucky ones who recognized the scam enough not to be sucked into it and end up with identify theft, infections, hacking of your computer, convincing you to buy software or services
 you either don't need or that don't really exist at all, and all sorts of nefarious tricks. You'd be surprised by how many contact us AFTER they realized they'd been suckered asking what to do. Do not waste time talking to these people, do not give them any
 personal information whatsoever, do not be tricked by what they may get you to see on the computer - in fact, don't do anything they suggest on your computer or even visit websites they recommend, and for heaven's sake don't give them access to your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Microsoft knows this goes on but with these companies springing up like dandelions, or closing and changing names when discovered, and mostly operating in foreign countries, it would take an army of lawyers to pursue every one of them. They do the
 best they can, but there simply are too many and more get added every day. People have to be careful of these things. They not only occur by phone, but also by e-mail, instant messaging, regular mail and every way imaginable. Just remember that Microsoft does
 not do this and hang up or delete emails or messages or mail from anyone claiming they are doing this because they know information about your computer or want information from you to confirm your account so it won't be closed and ask you for your username
 and password and all sorts of other personal information. Microsoft DOES NOT DO THIS!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>See the following for additional information about this and what to do and how Microsoft operates:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope you didn't get caught by these scammers and saved yourself a big headache. Continue to use the same caution and you should do fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you got caught by these scammers (did any of the things they suggested and especially if you gave them access), I would also proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It was not a good idea to give them access to your computer or any personal information, but if they had access to your computer or you visited a website they suggested or downloaded anything intentionally or unintentionally from a website or email,
 they could have infected you or made changes (or installed a way to gain access at their convenience in a background download occurring while they were showing you things and installing who knows what). Plus if they installed fee-based products (as is often
 the case since they negotiate deals with such vendors to split the profits on such “sales” – in effect, a kickback), they may have removed other products and when the service is cancelled what they installed may also be cancelled. In some cases, this may be
 good. In others, it may leave you without security protection depending on what they did. So you need to make sure that you eventually have proper firewall and real-time AV protection installed (and remove any they installed unless you did a clean install
 or System Restore as will be suggested shortly – then just confirm things are back to normal and the security is enabled or re-installed).
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>See this article: </span><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx?PageIndex=10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx?PageIndex=10</span></a><span>.
 The article also includes links for things to do if you think you've been a victim of this type of scam and information about what Microsoft does and doesn't do so you won't be tricked again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Still, it doesn't hurt to be cautious. <b>I believe the safest thing to do at this point is to backup your data and do a clean install or a restore to factory conditions (however you are setup to start from scratch after doing a full format of the
 hard drive).</b> If you aren’t prepared for such a radical solution (even if it is the safest), please at least proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do a System Restore to before the call and giving them access. That will hopefully remove anything they may have installed and undo any changes they might have made. Also change your password and security questions with your email provider, network,
 ISP and perhaps others listed below (which a System Restore won’t do – they’ll still be the same until you revise them). There’s no telling what they could have done while they had access to your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then to make sure you weren't infected, please do the following;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a> and SuperAntiSpyware:</span><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a><span>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: </span><a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Are you running Microsoft Security Essentials? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>If so</span></b><span>: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start here - </span><a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</span></a><span>and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary
 by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (</span><a href="http://www.answerdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.answerdesk.com/</span></a><span>)<b> in the US at this time.</b> After an initial free consultation, a fee will be
 charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>If not</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can start here: </span><a href="https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/</span></a><span> (which will also lead to the paid support options if you are in the US)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In other regions not served by the link above, go here: </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://Support.microsoft.com/security</span></a><span>and go to the “assisted support” or contact us menu.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the above is too expensive and you'd like some free options (though they can take days or a week or so before getting a response and then more days going back and forth in a forum environment - and though the quality of help you get is generally
 good, the level of expertise of the person assigned to your case is pretty much the luck of the draw - but that's the "price" of free options), here are some free malware-removal forums:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>P.S. In the meantime, I'd contact the bank or credit card company and dispute the charge to try and get my money back (if you actually paid anything - otherwise skip ahead to the P.P.S). Canceling the card is not enough to remove prior transactions
 that were charged to it without disputing them – and there may be more than just this one company if they installed products that cost money that will separately charge you (or already have). That may be simpler than asking the company or companies for a refund
 - but if the banks can't help you at this point, then of course try to get the refund from the company or companies (and keep asking to talk to the person's manager until you get as high as you can) and tell them if they refuse you'll notify the authorities
 and the company that hosts their website and take legal action (even if we know you won't because it's too much of a hassle, they won't be certain).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>How far you want to go in terms of changing all your other passwords, pins, logon information, account information (including all your financial data if on the computer) and such is a decision you need to make for yourself. They are not all related
 to resolving the computer issues and your best bet outside of anything computer-related is to contact those companies or the local authorities and see what they advise (or seek out an attorney for advice).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>P.P.S. If you wish to report it and live in the United States, here are some links you can try:</span></p>

<p><span><br />
</span><a href="http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx</span></a><span> This one is the "big gun" and while the best (like getting the BAU to take your case at the FBI), they really only focus on the major cases.
 I imagine enough complaints from enough people (or the right person or perhaps someone actually victimized or the company being misrepresented) about a particular company would make it a major case, but frankly don't know how they work or prioritize what they
 do. Still, since if they do get involved they can probably do the most to resolve the matter, I'd include them if I were harmed.</span></p>
