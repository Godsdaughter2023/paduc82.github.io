<h3> sgtsweetiebelle  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;Ctrl&#93;&#43;&#91;Backspace&#93; deletes a word and a space, not just a word.</h2>
                    <p>Normally, the [Ctrl]+[Backspace] key combo deletes the preceding word. Instead, in Word 2013, it deletes both the word and the space immediately preceding it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Oops, I made a mistaek|</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>turns into this</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Oops, I made a|</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>when it should instead turn into this:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Oops, I made a |</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>This is really annoying, because it's inconsistent with every other program I use. I have to keep retraining myself to re-insert the space each time I use Word. Almost every other program behaves differently--be it Chrome, Skype, Edge, or even other Office
 programs like OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I disable this behavior? Can it even be disabled?</p>

    <title>How do I disable linked styles in Word for Mac 2016&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richwcarr  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I disable linked styles in Word for Mac 2016&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to convert from FrameMaker to Word. FrameMaker has, for example, a style named
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">H1 Heading</span>. I want to replace this with the standard "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Heading 1</span>". I first update&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Heading 1</span> to have the same definition
 as <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">H1 Heading</span>. I select some text that is formatted with
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">H1 Heading</span> and then select <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Heading 1</span> and "Update to Match Selection" &nbsp;That all works fine, the text looks good, and I can format&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">H1 Heading</span>&nbsp;as&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Heading 1</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I look at the definition of <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Heading 1</span> and it is "linked to
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">H1 Heading</span>". So, I can't ever eliminate
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">H1 Heading</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see there used to be a "Disable Linked Styles" in older versions of Word. Is it still possible to do that?</p>

<p>OK, I think I figured it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Redefine Heading 1 using text formatted as H1 Heading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Use Advanced Find/Replace to change all items formatted as H1 Heading to Heading 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Delete the H1 Heading style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word figures out that it needs to update all the styles that are linked to the deleted style.</p>

<br />
<br />When you say you cannot Repair your Office installation from Control Panel
<br />
<br />When you select Office in Programs and Features, at the top, click Change - Repair
<br />
<br />Do you not get that option?

<p>Yes, I do get that option. When I click on Repair, nothing happens. I’ve walked away for various time periods to let the computer do its thing but nothing happens regardless of time allowed (5 min, half hour, 2 hours, etc). Ive rebooted a ton of times but
 nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Password on protected documents has stopped working- can&#39;t open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimd54  say:</h3>
<h2>            Password on protected documents has stopped working- can&#39;t open them</h2>
                    <p>I save a daily report, password protected, &nbsp;same password, and the password-protected report is attached to a daily email to clients. On my laptop, the documents are saved, firstly on dropbox, and secondly as a document on my hard drive. I copy yesterday's
 report, with the same password, and save it with the updated information. Today, when accessing yesterdays document (on dropbox) for updating to today the password would not work. I went to my backup and initially I was able to open a few archived versions
 of the report, but now I can't open them either. The password has become inoperative on both dropbox and my laptop. In case it was something really dumb, like the num lock key or wrong case, I have tried everything I can think off. What seems to rule this
 out is that I have also tried accessing the dropbox versions from another laptop but same thing: "The password is incorrect: Word cannot open the document..."</p>
<p>What is a bit of a relief, is that someone who shares the dropbox is able to open them (she used a MacBook), but nevertheless I'm hugely perturbed about the possibility of losing access to a series of docs which will be required for audit. If it wasn't for
 the Apple I'd be at risk of losing a valuable contract.</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest what the issue might be. Is there a maximum number of documents you can save with the same password, for example?</p>

            Hi Jim,<br />
<br />
No, there is no maximum number of documents that you can save with the same password.<br />
<br />
To narrow down the issue, you can try the following suggestions:<br />
1. Instead of typing the password, you can open <strong>Notepad </strong>and type the password there in plain text, then copy and paste it into the password box.<br />
2. Instead of copying the document, please try to create a new document with the same password and see if you can access it.<br />
3. Try opening your previous documents on another computer and see if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Based on your description, a user was able to open the exact same document inside Dropbox from a Macbook, which means that the issue may be with your
<strong>Word </strong>client.<br />
<br />
To make sure, please try to update your Office to the latest version. If your Office is already on the latest version, you may try an
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Online Repair</a></strong>.<br />

            <p>Thanks for trying to assist.</p>
<p>I have the files saved on my main laptop in a Documents folder, as well as on DropBox. The password does not work on either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My new daily report has a new password (client now requires a change every three months). The new password I used for the last three days has now also stopped working on the documents in my Documents folder as well as on the copies saved in DropBox, except
 the most recent, saved yesterday.</p>
<p>I have tried your quick fixes.</p>
<p>No 1: Didn't work- I don't have Notepad; I used OneNote. Nothing.</p>
<p>No 2: A new document with the same password works, BUT note my remarks that a new password on new documents saved yesterday have now also stopped working, it seems the passworf fails after a day or so.</p>
<p>No 3: As noted in my original post, the password no longer works when accessing the docs from another Windows 10 laptop (DropBox only- the folders containing the documents are not on laptop 2). As noted my associate can open the DropBox documents using a
 MacBook- this points to a problem with Windows or Office.</p>
<p>In short, nothing has worked yet, and 5 months of archives remain closed to me. Is it any wonder I'm glancing enviously at my associates Apple, and saving hard for a MacBook? (other MS issues have cost me weeks of downtime this year alone)</p>
<p>I'm going to try the Online Repair option next. In the meantime here is the screenshot:</p>

            <p>OK. Now I have done both a Quick Repair, and an Online Repair. Nothing has changed. Passwords only work on the most recent of my documents.</p>
<p>I am incredibly fortunate that these documents are backed up and remain available to me and my client's auditors through my associate's MacBook and DropBox. The clear message here is that some bug in Office 365 can render an entire archive of Password protected
 documents inaccessible and therefore of no use at all, and that Office is simply not a safe repository for confidential material. The encryption function is unreliable, and therefore useless to me. I could easily have lost a valuable contract because of this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My quick fix is to work and save my daily reports in unprotected documents and add the password to each one before emailing it to my client. In other words, I will now have to save a password protected version to DropBox, which my associate can access when
 audit comes around. I will have to work in unprotected documents, saving protected versions (which will probably also become inaccessible) on my laptop, while also saving unprotected versions, probably on an external drive, so that I can have access to my
 archive when necessary. This increases my workload and totally defeats the object of encryption, and I'll have to conceal the unprotected archive from my clients at audit time.
</p>
<p>I am ethically and morally very unhappy with this, but I have no alternative. I can't trust Office, and because of this I am betraying the trust of my client.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the details of the screenshot you provided, I managed to determine that you use an Office 365 Home / Personal subscription.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you had posted to the "Office 365 for business" category, i am going to move this thread to the Office 365 Home category for proper handling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I find it very difficult to find content in conversations when there is a lot of groups, conversataions and people in my list of contacts.&nbsp; It gets VERY chaotic, and all i really need to do is create a tagging process to keep it all organized.&nbsp; For example,
 could i have a tag list that i create and then when i have a message in the list that i want to "save" or find later, i can just click it and then apply some tags quickly.&nbsp; Then later go to a place where i can view all items by tag, by person and ordered by
 date.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This would make things SOOO much more organized.&nbsp; We tried creating conversations but then you end up with 30 conversations and then within those conversations i have items that get lost in the thread.. so finding something someone said that i need to recall...
 is impossible.&nbsp; A global search would sorta be helpful but then id have to know exactly what text to look for... and then do the scrolling game to jump thru conversations that include that text.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It would be REALLY great to click a tag, and then filter by a person and THEN do a search... boom.&nbsp; Now i can have ONE conversation thread for a top level topic that then i can tag things the way i need to organize them and then im so much more efficient.</p>

<p>Then in a PERFECT world i could create a Flow process for some tags.&nbsp; Like, if its something i have to do... i could tag it wiht a "ToDO" tag and then that would trigger a Flow event that puts that message into my Calendar, or whatever app im using to manage
 my list of todos.&nbsp; Or if its a file or link, i could tag it and have it Flow'ed over to a DropBox folder for use in another app or project.<br />
<br />
Tagging is so dynamic and useful it would REALLY be helpful.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft one note - typing into a template</h2>
                    <p>Can you open a template or document from email in one note and type directly into it?</p>
<p>I have tried but it seems when I open a document it just attaches it to a notebook, and won't allow me to edit or type into it.</p>
<p>I am wanting to open a word doc or pdf in one note and type into it, then email it to others to record information.</p>
<p>If this is possible can someone please tell me how.</p>

            <p>I'm not entirely sure I understand what you want to do. You wouldn't open a Word doc or pdf in OneNote, you would open them in Word or Acrobat. You can attach either Word docs or pdfs to a page in OneNote, just like you can attach them to an email. If they
 are attached, you would see an icon, and you can double click those icons and open the file in their own applications, though they are stored in the OneNote file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also print a word doc or pdf to OneNote, but that winds up printing what amounts to a picture or facsimile of the pages into a page in a notebook. You can't easily edit that, though you can search it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of that is really geared towards the tablet/desktop version of OneNote. The mobile version is used more to make minor entries and retrieve things you have stored in big brother. Hopefully the link in the other post helps with some more insight into
 how OneNote works.</p>

            <p>Hi Wendy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the description, you are facing issues working with Outlook attachments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would need more information to help you better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Are you saving the email attachments to a specific folder in the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.How are you trying to save the attachment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.What does the attachment contain (Pictures, Office files, PDF etc)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.Does it happen with all the emails with multiple attachments or with specific emails?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try the following steps and verify the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try saving the files to a different location and check the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try Working in Outlook safe and check if it helps. To know how to start Outlook in Safe mode, follow the steps below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to Start &gt; Copy and paste the following command line in the<span style="font-weight: bold"><font>‘Search programs and files’</font></span> box and Press Enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>Outlook /safe</font></span></p>

            Thanks for your reply. <br />
Here is the&nbsp;additional info you needed...<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. I am saving the attachments to a specific folder, but it doesn't matter where I save them...no files ever show up in the folder.
<br />
2.&nbsp;When I save attachments I go to the "save attachments" button&nbsp;when the email is open (under the file tab)<br />
3. It doesn't seem to matter what the attachment is. It could&nbsp;range from a&nbsp;.pdf, .tif, .dwg. .dgn...any kind of files. The important thing is if there is more than one - that is when&nbsp;I can't see what is&nbsp;in the folder I'm saving the attachments to.
<br />
4. It happens with any email that contains <u>more than one </u>attachment. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
I tried&nbsp;working in outlook /safe mode. That seemed to&nbsp;have no effect. I tried&nbsp;to repair the&nbsp;Outlook data file. It found errors, but it locks up when it is trying to repair it. I made sure outlook was closed when I did this. There appears to be no change in&nbsp;this&nbsp;problem,
 even after I restarted the computer. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Any other ideas? This has been a&nbsp;long standing problem from the beginning of when Outlook was set up on this computer. This is not a new thing that started.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />

</p><p>It sounds like you may have tried a few workaround from other posts.&nbsp; Can you describe which ones you have already tried?&nbsp;

<h2>            Locked out of email account by security details. Unable to solve - escalation plan</h2>
                    <p>I was forced to create a email account after buying a computer with windows 10 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only used this a few times, but it worked fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After about 5 months I have been asked to update security information before I can log into the email - the phone number given (mine) is incorrect, and when I try to update this I am asked to fill in a series of questions about use of the account (subjects
 of emails sent etc.) Due to my not using this email a lot at all I always get an email to a different account with the below message saying that my account couldn't be recovered. (I have done this about 6 times).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just had a phone call from the microsoft team and they said to post a question and the escalation plan team can respond to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help as I was getting some important emails to this account and I can't access them now.
</p>

 so thought it best to install a standalone outlook.Thank's for the help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
It's a pleasure. Use the following to uninstall the trial versions before you install Outlook Standalone.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open an Office application, such as Word. </li><li>Click the <strong>File </strong>tab. </li><li>Click <strong>Help</strong>. </li><li>Under <strong>Trial Product</strong>, find Microsoft Office Professional 2010 and then click<strong>Licensing Options</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Remove Trial</strong>. </li></ol>

    <title>How to Bring Up the Find Box in a Skype Message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kit8290  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Bring Up the Find Box in a Skype Message</h2>
                    Everyday I usually bring up a CTRL + F to bring up the search box...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The old search box - you could type in a keyword - and then, press back and forward to go to the previous keyword and keep pressing it throughout the message.<br />
<br />
That was easy.<br />
<br />
Today - I updated Skype.&nbsp; When I press CTRL + F .. it brings&nbsp; up a SKYPE search box instead of the message search box.<br />
<br />
When I press the "messages" to search within a message - it searches EVERY CHAT that has ever happened instead of the RELEVANT chat that I need the info...<br />
<br />
I'm talking to Sam - I remember saying something yesterday about Payroll.. I search for Payroll.. and there are a thousand results, there are hundreds of new contacts called Payroll.... and no way to press within the chat box - the forward and back button that
 was there yesterday.<br />
<br />
HOW DO YOU BRING UP THE SEARCH / FIND WITHIN ONE CHAT BOX?<br />
<br />
Am I overthinking this because this was easy yesterday .... now because the shortcut doesn't work anymore - what is the new shortcut?&nbsp; OR did Skype do away with the FIND WITHIN CHAT feature that was easy yesterday... and now displaying ALL sorts of bogus information
 from random chat people that I haven't talked to in years...&nbsp;<br />

            I don't believe it was included with any [recent] version of Mac Office. In addition to Office 2011 I have both 2008 &amp; 2004 installed here but Old English Text MT doesn't appear anywhere. I don't recall ever having removed it for any reason, nor is it
 in any of the Disabled font folders.<br />
<br />
I don't know whether it's available free, but you can try Googling for it.<br />

            Use the below Array formula
<br />
<br />=SUM(IF(C3:C10="NA",2,C3:C10))
<br />
<br />Note - Array Formula is not entered by pressing ENTER after entering your formula but by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. If you are copying and pasting this formula, take F2 after pasting and CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. This will put { } brackets around the formula which you can see in Formula Bar. If you edit again, you will have to do CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER again. Don't put { } manually.

<h2>            Is there a &#34;patch&#34; for Outlook 2007 that will make it acceptable security wise to my ISP&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We've used Outlook 2007 for a long time and like it; now our ISP will not accept it because of security flaws.&nbsp; Does Microsoft have any interest in fixing these flaws?&nbsp; We've looked at Outlook 2016, but I've never seen software that generates such hatred
 from the users...is it ever going to be something useable by ordinary computer users like us?&nbsp; I was forced to select a "subtopic" below, but none of those relate to my question; my problem is lack of security in 2007</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Keeping Office up-to-date will ensure that you have the latest security updates and fixes. We suggest that you get the latest updates available for Microsoft office 2007. You may check this
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5#ID0EAACAAA=Office_2007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> for the steps on how to.<br />
<br />
We also want to remind you that Office 2007 is approaching end of extended support. Once it reaches the end of its support lifecycle, there will no new security updates, non-security updates, free or paid assisted support options, or online technical content
 updates. Please check this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3198497/office-2007-approaching-end-of-extended-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Presumably you are connecting to your ISP's server using IMAP? If you change to POP access then any security issues are your problem. Everything happens at your PC and the ISP shouldn't even be aware of what e-mail client you are using. This does mean that
 cross platform access may be a problem unless you leave material on the server for a period after downloading the messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 2007 is still subject to all the security updates, provided it has been updated to SP3 and is updated regularly with Windows, however it will be out of support from October 2017, so you need to consider where you will go then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said that I have been using Outlook 2016 (the standalone Office version, not the 365 version) for some while and have not had any problems with it at all. It does all I require of an e-mail client. It can even be installed alongside your earlier version
 and they can share the same data (though not at the same time), which may help with the transition.</p>

<p>Your mail provider shouldn't even care what client you're using and I'd find it odd to know they're testing the mail agent identity to lock Outlook 2007 out. What insecurities do they claim Outlook 2007 has? What happens if you try to configure your account
 anyway? What servers, ports, and encryption does your mail provider require?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You don't have to leave your data behind; Outlook 2016 can use the same data store as you currently do in Outlook 2007.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just curious; Which "security flaws" is your ISP referring to? As mentioned before, Outlook 2007 is currently still receiving security updates. You can download them via Windows Update when you have it set to also download updates for other Microsoft applications.

            I'm not sure what the "flaws" are...they will now only accept email clients that have "oauth" something, and they highly recommend a Yahoo thing with which they are now associated....Yahoo of the outfit that was plundered for millions of users personal
 data....which makes me suspicious of their motives as well as ticks me off.&nbsp; If you know what "Oauth" is, pls let me know.

            The third choice will work. Both gmail and Outlook.com support app passwords, so now, it seems, Yahoo will also. AT&amp;T uses Yahoo as well. I use AT&amp;T and I haven't received a similar notice.

<p>This is something that is applicable to any ISP using Yahoo as their backbone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All you need to do is generate the APP Password as per their instructions and use that password in Outlook for the account which simply means changing the current password being used to log into the account. Entire process takes less then 2 minutes following
 the instructions provided.</p>

<h2>            Disable warnings on hyperlinks Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I use hyperlinks in my tasks a lot. I have a machine with two user profiles. I have a SBS domain and I am decommissioning it. As part of the process I have created a non-domain profile in W10 and have it mostly configured. I then removed the machine from
 the domain. In the old profile which I can no longer access I had this problem with the warning on hyperlinks and fixed it. I believe with a commonly known reg hack. I tried it in this profile but it's ineffective. I created the key</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Security and added a DWord value&nbsp;DisableHyperlinkWarning and set the data to 1. I rebooted and I still get the warning but now the color of the warning box looks different. I also tried&nbsp;</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Outlook\Security</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Office\16.0\Common</p>

            Try the following to see if it is document-specific: Make a copy of the problem document. Delete any section breaks and copy the content, minus the final paragraph mark (¶), into a new blank document. Can you still reproduce the issue? If not, the original
 document and possibly also its template may be corrupt.<br />

In order to see section breaks, paragraph marks and other nonprinting marks, click the ¶ button on the Home tab.<br />

On 9 or 19 October, there were a whole lot of Windows\Office Updates that have caused alll sorts of problems, and yours may be yet another one.&nbsp; Try using Windows System Restore to restore your system to the state that it was in before the update was installed.
 A restore point will have been created before the updates were installed.&nbsp; You can undo the restore if it does not correct the problem. However, if it does, you should turn off the automatic installation of updates to prevent those updates from re-installing
 themselves the next time that you shut down the computer.

            October 19th is not here yet.&nbsp; So, it was October 9th.&nbsp; I set my own restore point and called it "BigNineteenUpdates."&nbsp; They did not install automatically.&nbsp; I received notifications of updates; but I inspect them before I install them.&nbsp; I also have an
 XP-Pro system on which the updates that day were fewer.&nbsp; Would you recommend the same for that system?&nbsp; It requires a restart due to a program I removed.&nbsp; However, I do not recall encountering the problem there.&nbsp; Thanks for your response.<br />

            I just used System Restore and I am hiding all those updates, presuming you meant all of them, not just those peculiar to 64-bit.&nbsp; Later I will have to test my Office 2003 on my XP-Pro system to make sure Copy and Paste work there.&nbsp; Now, I can use those
 features on this system, having tested them in Word.&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

            After bringing up my XP-Pro, I decided not to do System Restore there even though there were about seven updates that same day for that system.&nbsp; I was able to do Copy and Paste.&nbsp; This ordeal makes me wish I was more attentive when I bought this computer.&nbsp;
 The XP is less problematic than the Windows 7.&nbsp; I don't know if the problems with this one are due to the 64-bit differences.&nbsp; System Restore helped correct another problem too.&nbsp; Were there any complaints about the unavailability of Help topics under various
 programs (F1)?&nbsp; For instance, my Nero Multimedia Suite 10 has these topics under various features, none of which displayed Help references until after System Restore.
