<h2>            US Skype Number for Canada</h2>
                    <p>Hello Community</p>
<p>
</p><p>So IÂ´m moving to Canada and i was thinking on getting a Skype number to use it instead of paying 50 something dollars for a phone bill.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, can people from Canada call me as a normal canadian number or thats going to cost them extra money?</p>
<p>

<p>To be very clear:</p>
<p>It appears that those of us who live in Canada are not able to get a "Canadian" skype number. I have no idea why and this totally sucks, but that's another issue we should pursue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you get a US skype number and people from Canada call you, they will be charged long distance charges. Since many many people are now only using cell phones instead of land lines, many people do not buy packages that allow them to call the USA. Therefore
 those people would not be able to call you.</p>
<p>There are many inexpensive packages from land lines that allow calls to the US for not too much money, but unless you have that built into your landline package, it would be costly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On that note, we should all put in requests to be able to have a Canadian skype number.</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Kathleen</p>

<h2>            Downloading and Installing Windows 7 OA</h2>
                    <p>My laptop (ASUS K53E) came with a copy of Windows 7 Home Premium <strong>pre-installed</strong>. I have since installed another OS, deleting whatever partitions were there when I first purchased the device. I would like to reinstall Windows 7, as I have

<p>You cannot because the Digital River .isos have been removed and no Windows 7 installation media is available for the Windows 7 OEM license. Try to install Windows 10 10130 which should you back on track for your free upgrade, you should install this build
 immediately before Microsoft remove it:</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note the newer builds Windows 10 Insider Build&nbsp;10147 and later introduce Microsoft Product Activation and only accept an activated:</p>

    <title>My settings are gone, local and microsoft Account issue. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pedro pds  say:</h3>
<h2>            My settings are gone, local and microsoft Account issue.</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased a new laptop with window 8 upgraded to 10, where I setup a local user account. This account (and laptop) has been&nbsp;used by me and my wife (with no needed split in user settings, preferences etc.) so far with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This week some event happened (I don't understand what) that required me to login with my Microsoft account. Since this account is not shared with my wife and that original shared local account that we&nbsp;created in the beginning is no longer available in my
 login screen (I don't know why), I was forced&nbsp;to add my wife's MS account as a user. Therefore now I have two options to login to our machine: via my MS account and via my wife's MS account, each using its own separate password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would have been ok, if it wasn't for one major problem: My MS login captures all the original settings, files and folders of that original local account. My&nbsp;wife's MS login does not capture anything at all and is treated as a brand new account to the
 laptop. The result is that she cannot see the computer that she is used to and likes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already gave administrator rights but no change. I have tried to create a different local user 'without a MS account' but the result is the same: no access to my original files and settings. How can I either:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Get our shared local login account back with all the original settings? It vanished from my login screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Keep two separate&nbsp;MS logins as we have now, but both having the same access to the files, folders and settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, PDS</p>
<p />

    <title>Permanently uninstall drivers&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sayengohil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Permanently uninstall drivers&#63;</h2>
                    So I have windows 8 on an 11.6 inch Asus Vivobook Touchscreen. My problem is that the touchscreen broke, and I can now not do anything as the touchscreen is randomly registering touches, rendering my laptop unusable. I managed to fight my way into uninstalling
 the correct driver, so now it works. However, when I turn my laptop on again, the driver re - installs itself, so I have to uninstall it again. Does anyone know how to permanently uninstall this driver, so it does not re install it? Thank you in advance!&nbsp;

<h3> ren&#233;m  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will Windows &#39;system image&#39; work with SSD drives</h2>
                    <p>I am about to buy a new computer and in this regard have been hot on <strong>2 x 256 Gb SSD drives in RAID 0</strong> for OS and programs instead of a traditional mechanical hard drive.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
I have previously benefited from the Windows system image which has saved me out of big problems with my current machine as it became unstable.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
My question is whether the Windows system image&nbsp;and Recovery will also seamlessly work if I pass to the SSD drive and the same questions if I have 2 SSD drives in RAID 0?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>I would suggest you get away from the Windows backup program and get yourself a good commercial backup program. This forum is frought with problem reports for the Windows one. I know I was very unimpressed when I tried it. Two I'm familiar with and like
 are Norton Ghost (which I've been using for 7 years without the 1st problem), and Memeo which has a 30 day free trial and you can buy it for $29.99 - you can download it from http://memeo.com . You can get Ghost for next to nothing (like I did) if you watch
 the sales. </p>
<p>CNET has a lot of backup program reviews at </p>
<p>http://download.cnet.com/windows/backup-software/?tag=contentBody;sideBar .</p>
<p>Some of these are free (last time I checked there were 315), some have free trials (over 1000), and some are purchase only (over 200).</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

            <p>Hi Hula,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I already have Ghost 14, but after the transition to Windows 7, I found it easier to use Windows own image backup system.</p>
<p>I have several times had needed it and it has worked perfectly every time - for me.</p>
<p>Since I am on the way to a new computer with 2 x 256 GB SSD in RAID 0, I was interested in hearing about the image backup will work flawlessly with this configuration. The same applies of course also the case for DriveImage XML or Norton Ghost.</p>
<p>Will it work?<br />

            <p>&nbsp;Rene', all I can tell you is like I said above, this forum is littered with reports of problems using the built in Windows backup program.&nbsp; When I tried it, I was very disappointed.&nbsp; I haven't seen but a couple of posts in this forum from folks with SSD
 drives, but both of them were having problems.&nbsp; In my opinion there's a very good reason MS keeps coming up with new backup/restore programs in every new version of Windows - they haven't gotten it right yet.&nbsp; Personally I perfer not to fight this seemingly
 non-ending battle, and let other pioneers try to debug it.&nbsp; They've got their work cut out for them.&nbsp; Hey, maybe you'll be the pioneer to get it debugged!&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;By the way, if you try to install Ghost 14 with Win 7, it'll tell you there're "known problems" with it.&nbsp; I ignored that and it worked for me, but I got Ghost 15 shortly after it came out and haven't had any problems with it with a good number of PCs since.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

            <p>Hi Hula,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've downloaded the Memeo Backup Premium, but the program disappoints me somewhat.<br />
Unfortunately I can not figure out where I can make personal settings.</p>
<p>Eg displayed time and date format in English and are not usable in Europe.<br />
Furthermore, the time is displayed 2 hours wrong and I can not change it.</p>
<p>When I start my machine opens Outlook automatically when I use it all day.</p>
<p>In connection with the backup of such Outlook I get message that it can not be done while the file is in use.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I can not find how I make an image of my C: drive, so I can restore on a new hard drive if anything happens.</p>
<p>Have I misunderstood the program?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

            <p>Rene',</p>
<p>&nbsp; Memeo is a rather simple program.&nbsp; The good news is that it's simple, I'm afraid that's the bad news too!&nbsp; If you've created one backup, you'll get a message that your backups are up to date, and until it thinks it's time for another one, you won't see
 a place to click for another one.&nbsp; If you have no backups, or you delete the one(s) you have (via the Action tab), you'll see the button that says "Start Backup" near the lower right corner of the Memeo window.&nbsp; When you click on that, it starts the full backup,
 then presents a popup saying "you're done" followed by "Any new or changed files will automatically be backed up in the future".&nbsp; No scheduling required!"&nbsp; So the answer to your question about where to create backups is that it's all automatic, and you don't
 have to do anything in the future unless you want to retrieve something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now regarding the conflict with Outlook, I can only say that I don't use Outlook, I just use Windows Live Mail, so I'm afraid you'll have to ask the Memeo folks about that.&nbsp; I don't blame you for wanting to use Outlook, since it comes with Office, and it's
 not cheap to get it.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you click Help, there's a place for your name and email address and an entry "Send feedback" which might be the way to communicate with them.&nbsp; Apparently this product is one of Seagate's because it uses the Seagate Dashboard and it
 comes on Seagate's external hard drives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Re the time being in English and being off by 2 hours, again I'll have to refer you to the Memeo folks.&nbsp; My total European experience was two weeks I spent in England back in 1991!&nbsp; Sorry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Remember there's always Ghost!&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

                    &nbsp;NO its is NOT the CABLE/ADAPTER/VIDEO DRIVER/GRAPHICS DRIVER/OS/ NVIDIA GRAPHICS DRIVE/ OR ANYTHIING BUT THE WINDOWS TEN UPDATES. My monitor has worked fine for a year. then comes random trash windows updates which everyone thinks are TRASH. BOOM my monitor
 has no signal. DOwngrade to last update of windows BOOM monitor has signal. AUTO UPDATE EVERY GOD DAMN TIME I LEAVE MY PC ALONE AND MAGICAL BOOOOOM NO SIGNAL TO MONITOR. had to downgrade about 10 ten days in a row until my pc finally went brain dead and I
 got caught in the endless "searching for previous version of windows" downgrade loop for about 2 days. finally fixed that after complete re install of my os and deleting all drivers and resetting every single thing you can think of completely wiping my pc.
 now I cant downgrade to a proper version of windows and I am stuck only able to use my 10 YEAR OLD TV and not my 5 year old monitor through vga signal. I have tried all of your trash lazy ****suggestions on all of your forum

<h2>            My Scanner doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've a printer "HP psc 1315" and using Windows7 Home Premium. </p>
<p>I've a problem with the scanner function, it doesn't work. I got "Error - A problem prevented the document from being scanned. Please try again, or for troubleshooting information, see Help and Support or the information that came with the scanner", then
 by click "OK" a small attention message appeared "Scanner - Operation could not be completed (error 0x00000015). The device is not ready". and by click "OK" nothing scan!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the following to solve the this problem with no luck:</p>
<p>1- printer troubleshooting.</p>
<p>2- remove the printer and reinstall it.</p>
<p>3- check the status of Windows Image acquisition service (stop it, restart it, automate it.</p>
<p>4- scanning from&nbsp;the Paint&nbsp;application, an attention message appeared "Paint - Unable to retrieve picture from device. Verify the device is properly connected and try again)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: </p>
<p>- My printer connected directly to the computer via USB port.</p>
<p>- I'm an administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciate your support. Thank you</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate the steps that you have tried to resolve the issue. Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens if you just click OK and continue the scanning operation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>As according to the below provided article this error message can be safely ignored in case of a picture scanning operation -</strong></p>

<h2>            Deleted file still keeps appearing</h2>
                    <p>When I click on the dropdown arrow in the top bar in file manager, it doesn't matter which folder I am in, the same file keeps appearing. That file has been deleted. When I click on the file it gives an error message saying the 'file can't be found, check
 the spelling'</p>
<p>I just can't get rid of the file. I've attached a couple of screenshots. It's a .zip file that is already deleted.</p>
<p>The first screenshot is the error when I try to open it.</p>
<p>The second is showing how it appears in the dropdown. It doesn't matter what the document or folder is, it is always the file that drops down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried creating a new folder with it and deleting again and it still is there.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Audio &#38; Realtek drivers - work then not work, sound setup fixes but problem comes back</h2>
                    <p>Seems with the latest Windows 10 updates I am having problems with my audio - particularly for playing music from itunes and when playing games (e.g. Fortnite).</p>
<p>I have noted that sound settings &gt; troubleshoot does fix the problem but the solution does not remain in place.</p>
<p>I have noted sometimes that when I log onto all other accounts on the PC then explicitly log off then on my account audio works again - but not always.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Settings all seem correct and I have disabled other audio devices that may be causing confusion (potential user error).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using "Realtek High Definition Audio".&nbsp;</p>
<p>All outputs and inputs under Settings &gt; App Volume Device Settings are set to Default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a new bug in the windows 10 update?</p>
<p>Any ideas to put in place a persistent solution?</p>

            Hi Tom, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />I'd recommend firstly re-enabling the audio devices you've disabled, then try running the sound troubleshooter again. It's possible that disabling audio devices has caused something to go wrong with your device settings.
<br />
<br />You can also have a look at this Microsoft Support article that will help you go through some troubleshooting steps for audio:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/4026994/windows-10-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />Once you've had a go at those steps, let me know what happens! Thanks!

            Look at your Device Manager, and select the option to review hidden devices. Anything that is greyed out roll back the driver. Especially look at anything that has to do with Intel or Realtek hardware ( the update does not like their hardware, especially
 if you have a touchscreen), that worked for me in October. If the drivers are gone, like with this last update, the only thing I was able to do was recovery option to roll back the build. Please let Microsoft and Intel know because they think others are not
 having this problem.

<br />You can try to update reinstall and rollback the drivers 
<br />Please follow these steps 
<br />1.Run the troubleshooter 
<br />Open Settings. 
<br />Click on Update &amp; Security. 
<br />Click on Troubleshoot. 
<br />Select the Playing Audio option. 
<br />Click the Run the troubleshooter button. 
<br />If That didn't work 
<br />2.Rollback the drivers 
<br />Go to Device Manager &gt; select audio inputs and outputs &gt; right click in the Speakers &gt; Properties&gt; Drivers &gt; Roll back Driver
<br />3.Try update or uninstall and reinstall the drivers 
<br />How update drivers 
<br />Go to Device Manager &gt; select audio inputs and outputs &gt; right click in the Speakers &gt; Update driver 
<br />If that didn't work 
<br />Uninstall and install the drivers 
<br />Go to Device Manager &gt; select audio inputs and outputs &gt; right click in the Speakers &gt; Uninstall Restart your PC, and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver. 
<br />If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions. 
<br />I hope it helps

<p><em>'I am using "Realtek High Definition Audio". '</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- There should be no problems with Realtek Audio on a machine running an Intel I5-7600K. Both of my machines</p>
<p>are older than this and my Realtek HD Audio is still working properly (v1809).</p>
<p>- Are you using the driver supplied by the mfg of your motherboard ? </p>
<p>Have you also gone over the settings in your Realtek Audio Manager software ?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I have disabled other audio devices that may be causing confusion"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>In <em>Settings</em> or <em>Device Manager</em> ? The latter would be a surer bet. I was having a problem on my machine because my monitor</p>
<p>has internal speakers and Windows seems to prefer them as the Default option when the monitor is connected via DisplayPort\HDMI</p>
<p>(it may happen if you connect via HDMI\DisplayPort regardless of if there are speakers on the monitor ? ).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even after designating Speakers\Realtek as my Default output Windows would choose my Nvidia HD Audio as default now and then.</p>
<p>I don't know what the trigger was (a Windows update would be one), but I stopped it by disabling Nvidia Audio in Device Manager.
</p>
<p>Uninstalling the Nvidia HD Audio didn't work because Windows would pop one back in after reboot.</p>
<p>What makes this confusing is the speakers work when tested via Sound or Realtek Audio Manager because the software provides</p>
<p>a direct audio source.</p>
<p>All other audio sources are being piped through the HDMI\DisplayPort output, and in my case the speakers on the monitor were</p>
<p>so weak I didn't hear them at the level my volume is normally at.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"All outputs and inputs under Settings &gt; App Volume Device Settings are set to Default."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- I'm not clear if you have done this, but...<br />
To make sure your Realtek audio is the default audio scroll down the <em>Settings&gt;System&gt;Sound&nbsp;</em> Windows a bit further to
</p>
<p><em>Sound Control Panel.</em></p>
<p>In Sound Playback tab&nbsp; verify your <em>Speakers</em> (Realtek audio) is set to default.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have problems with game audio in a few games, click on the <em>Advanced tab</em> and verify the
<em>Default Format</em> is set to </p>
<p><em>24 bit, 48000 HZ.</em></p>
<p>Some older games audio does not work over 48000 Hz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>.</p>

<p>Hi Michelle, unfortunately I had a message saying I was running low on disk space and I could remove older versions of installations to free it up - so I did. Hence rollback isn't possible.</p>

</p><p>I have removed the realtek audio drivers altogether and am using the default Windows High Definition Audio Device.</p>
<p>We still have some issues where audio isn't working when you start up the PC. Shutting down and restart seems to resolve.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Interesting short article, I haven't had any issues with the Realtek drivers until the recent windows update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did go looking for a later update at the realtek site but it is a little "arcane" .</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link in the article that points to torrent drivers doesn't appear to work - but the arcticle is 5 years old so probably not a surprise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you search for realtek drivers you do get alot of suspect sites that want to install their own driver installation software to assess your machine and then fix. Personally I'm not comfortable with that and want to keep my installation as clean as possible.</p>
<p>

For better assistance, we recommend contacting the manufacturer of your device to get the necessary driver that's compatible with Windows 10.<br />

<h2>            Default Monitor Identity Problem in windows - Mouse without Borders</h2>
                    I have been using Mouse without borders from Microsoft&nbsp; garage for a year. it has worked on three 3 computers and 3 respective monitors. Now I added a 4th monitor to the host. So one computer has 2 monitors. One with HDMI and the other with DVI. Windows
 has by dedault given Identity 1 to the HDMI monitor which is not my main monitor. The main monitor is identity 2. I cant change it. I cant find a way to change the identity of my main monitor to 1 from 2. That being explained now to scrolls from main monitor
 to other two computers i have to go through the second monitor which is a pain. Any help? Thanks.

<p>Hi Mr3putt1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As what you've already mentioned, the Identity 1 is given to the HDMI connection by default. But this doesn't mean that the Identity 1 should always be the main monitor or display. You can still set or have the Identity 2 as the main display. Follow these
 steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on your desktop and click <strong>Screen Resolution</strong>.</li><li>Under Change the appearance of your display, select the <em>Identity 2 </em>monitor.</li><li>Under Multiple displays, check the box for <strong>Make this my main display</strong>. Your Identity 2 monitor should now be the main display.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message "Driver Verifier Detected Violation" that you are getting means that the Driver Verifier is enabled.</p>
<p>The Driver Verifier should not be enabled under normal circumstances so try "turning off" the Driver Verifier and see if it helps:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start &gt; type <em>verifier.exe</em> and press "Enter" &gt; Delete existing settings &gt; Finish &gt; click "Yes" to the message to delete the settings and end the program.</p>
<p>

<p>You are getting the error 0x80070426 because you have unknowingly disabled the software licensing service or in a case where it was not started after the update. Restarting the service can easily resolve the error. Kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Hold down F8 Key before the appearance of Windows logo on the screen (in case your computer has one OS) or use arrow keys to highlight â<strong>Safe Mode with command prompt</strong>â in case your computer has more than one OS.</p>
<p>2. Type â<strong>services.msc</strong>â into the command prompt then press Enter.</p>
<p>3. Locate â<strong>Software Licensing</strong>â on the list of services that come up.</p>
<p>4. Right-click on âSoftware Licensingâ and select â<strong>Properties</strong>â.</p>
<p>5. Change the â<strong>Startup type</strong>â to â<strong>Automatic</strong>â before clicking OK.</p>
<p>6. Restart your computer.</p>

            Hey JE I had the same problem. I fixed it. You just have to go to your control panel (you can type control panel in Cortana). Then, go to Hardware and sound. (Once I went there everything was ok.) Try that and see if it works for you. Let me know.

<h2>            Windows 10 Product Key Damaged During Package Opening</h2>

 get the product key from these barcodes?</p>

            A number of users have been reporting issues recently removing the protective seal on Windows 10 OEM System Builder product key stickers. Unlike retail Windows 10 licenses, which come on a business size card in the box; the OEM Windows 10 System Builder product key is located on the certificate of authenticity sticker on the outside or inside of the package. To prevent theft, a protective seal covers the product key. Similar to a pay as you go phone card, users can utilize a sharp instrument such as a knife, scissor or even a coin to remove protective seal. See below:
<br />

<br />
<br />Credit: Microsoft
<br />
<br />Sometimes, if too much pressure is applied or liquid comes in contact with the sticker, this can damage the product key characters. When this happens, your best course of action is to return it to the reseller for a replacement or refund; since it might be a defective product. Contacting Microsoft might be an option, although the software firm has no responsibility for damaged product keys; since production is handled by a third party source. If vendor is able to provide a replacement, ask them to remove the protective seal for you, so you are not liable for damage if it happens again.
<br />
<br />If you are unable to get any assistance from the vendor, contact Microsoft support and they might be able to replace it for you.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/contactus/?ws=support#tab0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/contactus/?ws=supp...</a>
<br />
<br />What if Microsoft can't help either?
<br />
<br />Your options are limited, you might have to cut your losses, or try salvaging the key yourself. The first option you can try using is a magnifying glass to enlarge the characters. If you don't have a magnifying glass, you can use digital camera or your smart phone to take a picture then blow it up on your computer. Below is a list of characters used and not used in Microsoft product keys:
<br />
<br />Characters and numbers used:
<br />2346789BCDFGHJKMPQRTVWXY
<br />
<br />Characters and numbers not used:
<br />015AEILNOSUZ
<br />
<br />Sometimes a 6 could be easily mistaken for a G or a B for an 8, so look carefully. If the product key sticker is smudged, you could try using a damp Q-Tip to gently scrub the smudge covering the letters.

            Hi claudia,
<br />
<br />Capslock + 0 is a keyboard shortcut for Read Aloud (Narrator) is your caps lock key on?
<br />
<br />You can disable Narrator, if yo do not use that functionality:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />In the left Pane, navigate to:
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options
<br />
<br />Right click \Image File Execution Options and choose New - Key
<br />
<br />Name that key Narrator.exe
<br />
<br />Then click Narrator.exe
<br />
<br />In the right pane, right click an empty space and choose New - String
<br />
<br />Name that Debugger
<br />
<br />Then double click the new String value and set its value to  %1
<br />
<br />Save and close the Registry editor and restart for the change to be applied

<h2>            Printing full size with Windows Photo Viewer</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to print images with Windows Photo Viewer, full-page on 11 x 17 paper. I select the Tabloid size paper and the full page photo option, but my prints still only cover about half of the page. I have tried checking and unchecking the "fit picture
 to frame" box, and have tried to adjust the settings by going into Options - Printer properties. How should I go about this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>If your printer is physically capable of printing on this size paper, the issue may be a function of your printer driver.&nbsp; After selecting "Tabloid" in WPV, was Tabloid showing as the selected paper size in "Printer properties"?&nbsp; Note that there may be more
 than one location in the printer driver dialog where the paper size is indicated.&nbsp; Also, depending on your printer driver, there may also be a "Scale to fit" option that you should probably de-select.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again assuming that you have a printer than can print on tabloid size paper, open a word processor (e.g., Word, although WordPad probably will also work) and create an 11x17 document.&nbsp; Type at least a few lines at the top and bottom of the page and then
 print it.&nbsp; Does it print correctly or is it scaled down?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all else fails, I suggest that you ask a question in the support forum of your printer's manufacturer.</p>
<p>

            Hi Vlad.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If WIndows 10 came preinstalled on the PC then the Product Key is embedded in a chip on the motherboard.  It should reactivate during a Clean Install following the illustrated steps in this link which include everything that works best in Windows 10:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If it's lost activation run the Activation Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation.  Report back what is listed on that page at the top under Status and Edition.  
<br />
<br />Was Windows reinstalled by a shop that might have used another Activation method or insert another Product Key that messes up the auto-activation from the embedded key?  
<br />
<br />You can read the Product Key by installing ProducKey:  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a> then look for OEM - BIOS key and insert it in Activation Settings link to Change Product Key.  
<br />
<br />If this fails contact MS Support to activate:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/405170...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Vlad,
<br />
<br />Restart (not shut down) your PC 3 or 4 times, this can often fix this issue . . . 
<br />
<br />If that does not fix this issue: 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small utility which will find your Windows 10 Product Key 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/OemKey/</a> 
<br />
<br />Go to Settings - Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />Try entering that product key there to activate Windows 
<br />
<br />Otherwise, contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Choose a local Phone Number:
