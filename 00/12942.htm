            Wait. It takes a while depending on your connections speed and other factors. Installation took 45 minutes for me which was quicker than usual and looked stuck at times. Be patient.

<h2>            Zune says my HTC Mozart is fully up to date but windowsphone.com says it isn&#39;t. What can I do&#63;</h2>
                    I have an HTC Mozart, am in the UK and am on Orange.<br />
I am running Software: Windows Phone 7.5<br />
OS version: 7.10.7740.16<br />
<br />
Zune is completely up to date and I have no problem synching media on my device with Zune.<br />
When I look for available updates Zune tells me that I am completely up to date, however when I go to windowsphone.com to buy apps I'm told that my phone needs to be updated before I can purchase any online (I have no issues purchasing through my phone marketplace).<br />
<br />
I have contacted HTC and they tell me that updates are available for my device.<br />
I have contacted Orange who tell me they can't assist me as updates are rolled out through Zune; all they do is text me to let me know an update is available.<br />
All attempts to seek help from microsoft have led me here - so in desperation, I post.<br />
<br />
Is anyone able to help me update my phone?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

    <title>Cant open attachments on outlook for android app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> evald80i  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cant open attachments on outlook for android app</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have outlook email app on samsung s7 phone. If i recieve an email with an attachment its fine, i can view it BUT if i search historical emails i can see the paperclip showing there is an attachment but when i open the email there is no attachment to be
 seen and no options to open it?? Once only it showed me the attachment and than disappeared again after i did another search.</p>
<p>The same happens also on a brand new Samsung S8 on both company and hotmail account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any chance that microsoft can fix this? This issue is old and it is very strange that MS does not want to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could fix this very easy which means installing another app but i have another problem with office 365 account. If i use another app, i keep receiving emails in my inbox folder every time i send one, which means the one that i send i see it also in my
 inbox because my email is on the CC automatically. The IT guy told us to use outlook app and this issue disappeared but the problem with the attachment is more important than the one of recieving sopy of emails</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following the answers to your questions</p>
<p>
</p><p>-The issue did not started at a certain time or event. Just noticed it 2-3 days ago when making some searches in my sent email(@hotmail account) folder. Having an office 365 and a hotmail account both configured on the app, i tried to make some searches
 on the office365 and the same issue also there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-No, there is no error. It seems that the email does not have attachment at all</p>
<p>
</p><p>-i'm not saving the attachment. Just trying to look at it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-No, the sender does not matter. Just tried on other emails with different sender and the issue still persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-i have tried with samsung s7 and samsung s8 and on both devices the issue is there. The account configured on s8 is another hotmail one. If i open on a browser i see the attachment</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After making some tests, seems the issue is affecting only the sent folder. The inbox one does not have this issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have exactly the same problem on my Oneplus5&nbsp; and this does not happen with all the mails , it is random . I can see the attachment icon while i am at thr main screen of outlook app where all the emails are indexed chronologically but when I click any
 email with attachments , while reading the mail I do not see any attachment and no option to download it. This is strange , Iv uninstalled , reinstalled , rebooted , Cleared Cache.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another strange thing noticed is , to verify that the email im reading in the outlook app does actually have attachment I logged into my office365 account using browser on my Oneplus5 , and searched for the same mail. I could see the attachments on the browser
 and then when I revisited my outlook app to my surprise I was able to see the attachments in that particular mail , but again that is only for a short moment. If i try to read that particular mail after sometime again on my outlook app ,it again has attachments
 missing.</p>

<p>I have the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>exact same issue
</strong></em></span>on my Samsung Galaxy Note 8.&nbsp; I have tried many different things, uninstall, reinstall, wipe phone, check for phone and app updates, NOTHING works.&nbsp; It seems like if I just go into the folder and search my sent items manually by scrolling
 it works most of the time, but if I do a search is when it does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works fine on my tablet which is a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, but not matter what I do on my phone I cannot view the attachments when I do a search in my sent items folder.<br />
</p>
<p>Only thing that has ever worked is just not using this app and using the default one on my phone which is not what I prefer to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please say that there is some sort of fix out there.</p>

            Hi, Thanks for the reply, but unfortunately, this does not solve the issue.&nbsp; I have tried this several times and am still unable to see any attachments.&nbsp; Again, this is not across the board for me.&nbsp; The only time I can't locate my attachments is when I
 do a search.&nbsp; If I just scroll through my inbox or folders and open an email with attachments, there is no problem.&nbsp; But if I am trying to search for an email from say "Emily" and I do a search in my inbox, I can see the email and it tells me there is attachments
 with the little paperclip icon, but the attachments do not show anywhere, nor is there an option to show or open them.

                    <span>
<p><strong>I made the mistake of trying to consolidate all of my OneNote 2010 Notebooks by moving all of the files to a new share (like I have successfully done in the past with 2007)</strong></p>
<p><strong>I realized too late that I should have used the new features in 2010 to point to the new location, because when I navigated to the new share to open the Notebooks, OneNote told me that there is no Notebook at that location, even though I can see
 the files in Explorer</strong></p>
<p><strong>Even after creating a brand new shared Notebook and adding content to it, will the content be removed after the next sync. Any ideas how to fix this ?</strong></p>

<p>Hi Bernd,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I am aware of that. My problem is that ON now only seems to see the notebook (as a folder) but not the notes<strong>within
</strong>that notebook (contents of the folder).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I add a note to the notebook, it will only stay there until the next sync, after which it would disapear from the notebook in ON. But the note still shows up in the<strong>folder</strong> when I use Explorer to look at the content.&nbsp;This does not happen
 for any locally stored notebooks, only ones that I share.</p>
<p>Hope this helps clarify my problem. I have 2-3 years of notes which still seems to be there, I just cannot now access &nbsp;them through ON and the structure of notebooks, sections and section groups that I created to sort them with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any additional help will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Lucas</p>

<p>There is still more to clarify, because I don't understand what you're talking about, when you write "But the note still shows up in the folder, when I use Explorer to look at the content".</p>
<p>What one calls notes normally is content created by typing/inserting on a page as part of a section. What you can see in Explorer is neither the mentioned note nor the containing page, only the section that contains that page = a *.one file. So please tell
 us what "shows up in the folder" by using Explorer.</p>
<p>It would be helpful to see a picture of your file/folder structure you created on your share.</p>
<p>Create a screenshot and store that on one of the free sites like http://www.imagehost.org/ and give us a link.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>http://i.imagehost.org/0107/FileStructure.jpg</p>

<p>OK, thank you for the surprising (and excellent) documentation. Surprising is that there is obviously something wrong in ON 2010.</p>
<p>Because I personally have only ON 2007 I cannot reproduce it, the GUI for sharing is completely new.</p>
<p>But there is hope: I would make the shift of your notebook the old fashioned and in my opinion simple way which I used so often.</p>
<p>Recipe:</p>
<ol>
<li>close your notebook explicitely </li><li>close ON </li><li>move the notebook folder-"tree" starting with the notebook1 folder to your share location under Onenote notebooks as intented by using Windows explorer</li><li>start Onenote </li><li>re-open notebook1 from the share </li></ol>
<p>Now it should work. The most important step is the 1st step.</p>
<p>Bernd</p>

    <title>Pending approval View with more than 5000 elements - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pending approval View with more than 5000 elements</h2>
                    
<p>I have a documenta library in Sharepoint Online with about 15.000 documents. It works well but the user wants to make a view of "Pending approval Items". I have created a new public view with the filter "Approved status is Pending". When I open the view
 in the browser It cant be displayed and says that the view have more than 5000 documents.</p>
<p>I know that there are about 20 documents pending approval (in status "pending"). Why does I get this error?</p>
<p>Searching internet I have read that the first column of the view filter has to be indexed, but I can not index tha column "Approval status".</p>

1.try navigating to the<strong> list/library settings</strong> &gt; <strong>advanced settings</strong> &gt;

<p>The honest answer would be you can't have more than 5k items in a library. If you do, most functionality will stop working because SP innately doesn't allow open queries of that many items.</p>

<p>hi jerry,</p>
<p>1. i have reindexed the list and nothing happens, the only message i have received is the one that says that this operation can cause bad performance. i attached the screen with this message:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=31afe7d6-d180-4f26-8aab-a931a35a07e7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d31afe7d6-d180-4f26-8aab-a931a35a07e7" /></a></p>
<p>is there any way to see the reindexing status?</p>
<p>2. my view filter setting is as follow:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=ef4169ea-7f8a-4d11-bcd9-3e7be41f9dae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3def4169ea-7f8a-4d11-bcd9-3e7be41f9dae" /></a></p>
<p>3. and this is the error message when i open the view:</p>

<p>hi ugo,</p>
<p>i would like to explain the situation and share a workaround with you for your references.</p>
<p>in a list which exceeds the list view threshold, the situation you see is an expected behavior since,</p>
<p>a. creating filter view based on a column would work on an indexed column,</p>
<p>b. the approval status column, as you may have known, does not support to be indexed.</p>
<p>therefore, the view would still give us the message of "this view cannot be displayed because it exceeds the list view threshold".</p>
<p>to find the items which is "pending", please export this list to excel. you then can view the list using the filter from the excel, and search the items in the library.</p>
<p>- go to the library &gt; at library ribbon, export to excel.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=f083cb84-4ae1-448a-b1b3-c042f1ffbabf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3df083cb84-4ae1-448a-b1b3-c042f1ffbabf" /></a></p>

<p>Please create a temporary view as the below then to Export to Excel.</p>
<p>Go to the List &gt; at LIST ribbon, Create View &gt; choose Standard View &gt; type in View Name &gt; scroll down to Filter section, make sure you select Show all items in this view &gt; OK.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 cannot redeem this offer based on how your Microsoft account is set up</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So last year I bought a new laptop in Vietnam, and there was an offer that when I purchase that laptop, I would get a free Office 365 Personal 1-year subscription. Now I am studying abroad in Australia, the subscription has ended, so I went to buy a new
 Personal 1-year subscription. Then I tried to reactivate the subscription by putting in the new Key code, but I got the 'ERROR, you cannot redeem this offer based on how your Microsoft account is set up". At first I think this is because of now I am in a different
 region and my account is based in Vietnam so I changed my account region to Australia, there weren't any billing options in my account as I don't have a Credit card at that time yet. After that I tried to put in the Key code again but the same "Error" happened
 again. Now I am confused, I am going to need Word for my homework and assignments. I tried to contact but the numbers I got are all in the US and Canada. The Chat is unavailable.</p>
<p>Could anyone please help me? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. But my subscription has already expired, so there is no "Cancel Subscription" anymore, only renew your subscription. I have already purchased a new Office 365 Personal in Australia but my account is set in Vietnam, and yesterday
 I knew that I cannot change my Office account region. Is there anything I can do about this?
</p>
<p>Is it possible that I create an Australian Office account and the use that Key code? But since I have put it in my current Office account to redeem but it refuse to accept it, so can I now use that Key code for a new Australian account?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

                    <p>Whenever I filter rows and go to delete the filtered rows, the hidden rows between also are deleted</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wondering if this is a bug or a setting that needs to be changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reason, why I think it is a bug, is that when I copy and paste data (when the data is filtered), it too also copies over the hidden rows data)</p>

<h2>            What is the best practice for handling departing employees&#63;</h2>
                    <p>As we migrate more users to OneDrive for Business I'm wondering what others are doing to handle files from departing employees?&nbsp; With our old File Servers we would typically give managers access to users folders for a given time period to&nbsp;clear them out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There don't appear to be great options to handle this with OneDrive for Business--or I may just now know how to handle this.</p>
<p>

            Hi MarcRohde,<br />
<br />
To handle files from departing employees, the best practices is adding your account as the owner of this employee’s OneDrive for Business. Here are the steps:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Navigate to the<strong> SharePoint admin center</strong> &gt;<strong> User Profiles</strong> &gt;
<strong>People</strong> &gt; <strong>Manage User Profiles</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Enter the user name &gt;<strong> Find</strong>.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Right click the user’s Account name &gt;<strong> Manage Site Collection Owners</strong>.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Select your account in Primary Site Collection Administrator and Site Collection Administrators &gt; delete the former user's account &gt; click<strong> Ok</strong>.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dafb9073-c68a-4c60-84b0-0c8d382b6bc1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dafb9073-c68a-4c60-84b0-0c8d382b6bc1" /></a><br />
<br />
Once you become the owner of this user’s OneDrive for Business, you can login to his/her OneDrive for Business and sync files to your computer with the OneDrive for Business sync client to retain the back-up data.<br />
<br />
Then you can delete the user’s account. If a user (say a departing employee) no longer needs a license, you can delete that user’s account. After you do this, any licenses that were assigned to that person become available to assign to another user.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>CAUTION</strong>: When a user’s license is removed, all data that is associated with that user account is held for
<strong>30 days</strong>. After the 30 day grace period, the data is deleted and can’t be recovered, except for documents that are saved on SharePoint Online and the data in the user's mailbox. The user mailbox will remain in Exchange Online until it is deleted,
 permanently removed or purged by the Office 365 admin. You can reassign a license to the user and make the mailbox active again.<br />
<br />

<h2>            OL07 not syncing contact &#38; cal notes in Vista</h2>
                    <span>Hi. I have been reading online discussion forums for a week. I see this problem from other people, but haven't found any answers. I hope someone can help.<br />
                    <span>Hi. I have been reading online discussion forums for a week. I see this problem from other people, but haven't found any answers. I hope someone can help.<br />
<br />
I have Vista 64-bit and Outlook 2007. I have the Sprint HTC Mogul (6800) Pocket PC phone. I went back to Windows Mobile Device Center 6.0 after 6.1 was crashing my phone and not syncing. My computer is about a week old... just got it! First time on Vista.<br />
<br />
When I hook up my phone, it goes through the sync, and says all done. I find that it has moved my calendar appointments and added or deleted contacts, which at least is something. It also syncs the Notes just fine.<br />
<br />
However, it doesn't send any of the notes I had inside contacts or inside calendar appointments. I use contact notes a lot, and found recently that all of those are BLANK. I have no idea how to get it to send these over. When I had ActiveSync under XP, it always
 sent these over, and I don't remember having to tell it to do so!<br />
<br />
Can somebody please tell me what I need to do?<br />
<br />
I'm also having the Outlook doesn't quit when I quit no matter HOW I quit, so if anybody knows that one, that would be great too!<br />
<br />
Many thanks. <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.microsoft.com%2fMSDN%2femoticons%2femotion-1.gif" /><br />

            What do you mean by WMDC 6.1 was crashing your phone? I suggest you run Office Diagnostics in Outlook You will find this option under the Help menu. After the repair is done, remove WMDC, reboot your computer and re-install again. Before connecting your
 device, delete the partnership on the pda. To do that, open Activesync and click Menu - Options. Select your PC and click Delete. Reboot your device and connect again to establish a new partnership. Let me know if this helps.

<br />
Last week, I ran SCANPST. It fixed whatever it found with my PST. <br />
<br />
I uninstalled the late 2007 version of WMDC because it was evil. I called that 6.1, but I think I got that wrong. I found WMDC 64 bit ORIGINAL version from early 2007, and installed that. Yes, I'm restarting every time.
<br />
<br />
I run that earlier version of WMDC, and that was working, but now, I find it's not syncing at all. I plugged my phone in 3x this morning, and it's not syncing anything. I just added a calendar appointment in Outlook, and nothing happened.<br />
<br />
When it DOES decide to sync, which is now and then, it doesn't move over notes inside contacts or calendar appointments.<br />
<br />
What do I mean WMDC crashes my phone? Just Google that. Lots of people and I are having an issue where when we try to sync under the later version of WMDC, the mobile phone gives us crash messages. I flashed back to an older ROM thinking that was the problem,
 but it was from trying to sync. Once I Google'd it, I found other people describing the same thing.<br />
<br />
So I've already done what you suggest, and I still have WMDC deciding to sync some things or nothing, randomly. Right now, it's not syncing anything. Yesterday it sync'ed some things but still not my Contact Notes.<br />
<br />
Please tell me what you suggest I do now. Thanks.<br />

            <span>Great question. Here is what I just did. Let's say I have two contacts, and we'll call them CG and IO for their initials.<br />
<br />
CG had no notes. I went into my mobile and wrote "testing notes." I synced the phone. It showed me it was syncing 1 contact. I went into Outlook, there was "testing notes" for CG.<br />
<br />
In Outlook, I deleted "testing notes." The phone sync'ed 1 contact. I checked the phone. Notes were empty.<br />
<br />
That was looking good, so I tried something else.<br />
<br />
My contact for IO has a LOT of notes that have NOT transferred under Vista on my new laptop at all. So I tried something similar.<br />
<br />
I went into Outlook. I retyped some of the notes I had already. I added some words.<br />
<br />
I synced the phone. It said no changes, and didn't sync. My phone still shows no notes for IO, while Outlook shows many lines of notes for that person.<br />
<br />
I can't explain it! But it gets weirder.<br />
<br />
I decided to completely delete my IO contact. I synced the phone. It showed me it was removing a contact.<br />
<br />
I created a brand new IO contact, same name. Mostly the same info. New picture of him. Same notes, just typed freshly, not copied and pasted. Saved that.<br />
<br />
Synced the phone. It showed it was moving a contact. Went into contacts, there he is. New picture. NO NOTES.<br />
<br />
I don't get it.<br />

<p>Nor do I!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to duplicate your issue but cannot.&nbsp; I used an AT&amp;T 8525 upgraded to WM6.1 and sync with a Vista laptop (32 bit) with Outlook 2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I added a contact called AA Test.&nbsp; I added a phone number and a comment in the Notes area.&nbsp; Sync'd and it brought it over ... with the note.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure what to offer but I will still look around for something.</p>

<p>I have downloaded the OVI store application, and use it sometimes, until I had the same probleme has almost everybody, "no gateway answer" if I remember correctly.</p>
<p><br />
But I could still go on OVI store with 3G.<br />
So I uninstall the OVI store with the application manager, clear the cache in the Nokia Browser and Opera Browser, and reinstalled it.<br />
<br />
It could connect to the wifi again, just 1 time.<br />
So the&nbsp;problem&nbsp;come back again, I clear the cache, uninstall OVI Store but decide to not install it again.<br />
<br />
But still not able to connect to WIFI and enjoy internet on my phone with WIFI.<br />
<br />
Does anyone has the same problem has me?<br />
<br />
Please help me to solve it, I have decided to change my phone for a WIFI phone, and finally, I have like almost the same has before, smartphone without WIFI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your answers.</p>

<p>you have done the right thing in clearing your cache and cookies with the web browser.&nbsp; you could also use y-browser and/or x-plore to be sure that your c:/cache/vss folder is completely cleared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then, i dont think that it was mentioned above, but i would also be sure to check your internet connections settings to be sure that you have set up your wifi connection correctly to the network you are trying to connect to.</p>

<p>i was talking about the wifi connection on your device.&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i would delete the connection then recreate it as a new one by searching for your wifi and entering the key again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is a product that is really good called smart connect, it will automatically allow your e71 to search for the fastest connection and use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then there is another product that is also free that you could use called easy wifi by devicescape which is wifi specific.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if push comes to shove and you dont care about starting over, you may as well do so and just reinstall the OS firmware or *#7370#</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this will wipe the enitre devic eand start if afresh.</p>

            Thx for informing me about devicescape.<br />
It seams nice, but I am from a small city in Vietnam, and not a big interest for me :P<br />
<br />
I have already deleted and recreate the wifi, actually, i do that everytime I have some trouble because I have already read that in a topic in the same forum.<br />
For the application, I am not sure i really need that for the moment.<br />
And I don't think reinstall the OS firmware is the solution, because I did that when I bought it in the shop already, and didn't install so many application (just famous one as Skype, Snake, Opera)<br />
And add some contact already, I think the problem will still remains.<br />
<br />
I had the same issue later in the afternoon, everytime I try to clear the cache, delete the wifi network, restarting the phone, change some setting. Then work back.<br />
This is not very practical

<h2>            Phone gets hang&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I recently updated my <strong>Lumia 730</strong> to <strong>W</strong><strong>indows 10</strong>, I'm very disappointed with Windows 10 Mobile due to the following issues. Person like me who lives in budget, buys his favorite mobile brand even friends

</p><p>(i). sometimes when I try to <strong>On/Off</strong> my <strong>cellular data</strong> from the notification button, my phone gets hang and couldn't open any of the applications, couldn't even switch of my phone using power button. I'm forced to remove my
 battery for restarting my phone. After, restarting it when I try to On/Off cellular data from the
<strong>settings&gt;Network &amp; wireless&gt;Cellular &amp; Sim</strong>, the <strong>page is e</strong><strong>mpty</strong>, couldn't find any of the options. Then, I've to restart my phone several times to On/Off my cellular data. Please provide me a solution to solve
 this problem.</p>
<p>

<h2>            When I plug in my zune to charge it shows the normal dead battery symbol then cuts in half and pixels out and will not charge or turn on.</h2>
                    
<p>My 80g zune will no longer charge or even turn on. When I plug in my zune and hold down the on button it will show the normal "dead" battery icon, then will slit in half and bar out.&nbsp; It will not do anything and will only show the battery charging symbol
 only sometimes.&nbsp;A few months ago before this problem, I would charge it until it showed a full batter and when I would take it out and listen to it, it would already be at half life in a matter of minutes where as before it had never done that.&nbsp; What I was
 wonder was what I should do? Is it fixable and if so where do I get it fixed?</p>

    <title>OneNote right pane overflow of text&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul rittman  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote right pane overflow of text&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When using OneNote (I am on 2016, but also have a license for 2010 so I could install that if need be), I have all the pages in one workbook listed on the right side of the page.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would like to do, is have all the leftover text, that is not visible, to flow over and form a second line underneath the first line. Currently, I have 16 spaces, and anything beyond that is simply not seen. Now I can drag the divider between this
 right hand pane, and the text field of the page, to the left, which does allow room for more characters. The problem there is that this reduces teh area for the text itself of the page.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get the page title, to bleed/overflow down onto a second row, so I can see the entire page title, instead of only seeing the first x number of letters?

<h2>            nokia 5800 xpress music not displaying caller id</h2>
                    
<p>Recently got a new 5800 xpress music and have entered all contacts into mobile. When contacts are calling me it is not displaying their number just saying call calling. Having noticed some people have been having same problems,I have checked that I do not
 have&nbsp;any duplicate numbers stored, and have also tried saving only to sim&nbsp;or only to phone but neither are allowing the number to be displayed. I run my own business so this is getting annoying as if I miss a call I don't have a clue who it is and can not
 return any calls!! Can anybody help!?!</p>

            Last time I checked this was a problem with your service. You will have to contact your provider.<br />
<br />
If you had duplicated numbers, the phone should just display the actual number and not the name.<br />
<br />
But if your phone says "call/calling" - it's an operator issue.

<h2>            Office 365 Pro plus upgraded to 16.0.10827.20084 causing issues on outlook add-ins</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using <strong>Addin-Express</strong>&nbsp;to create addins for Outlook Windows. Few of our users today got Office365 ProPlus upgraded to version
<strong>16.0.10827.20084</strong>. This version is causing our Addin panels to anchor out of outlook and is displaying in a different window. But the latest version I see from this
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/officeupdates/update-history-office365-proplus-by-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link </a>is <strong>16.0.10730.20102</strong>, which is working fine with our addin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is this version(16.0.10827.20084) a beta version released to subset of users? And also do you guys plan on fixing this issue of panels anchoring out of outlook? if not so, how do I get this version installed as it is not generally available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>There’s a possibility that someone is trying to access your account. Since the screenshot shows that the attempt to log in came from different country. We would suggest you to do the following:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1) &nbsp;Change your password and make sure it's a strong one. The combination should have
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">alphabetical characters, numbers, and special characters.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2) &nbsp;Do not use the same password on more than one site. Especially sensitive accounts such as email, banking, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3) Do not save passwords in your browser. If you have a laptop (can get lost or stolen) or you live in some sort of situation where folks have access to your PC (dorm for instance.) In this case, we would suggest you to consider
 highly secure password. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I have four active mail accounts (2 times Outlook.com, 1 Google Apps and a regular IMAP), none of them sync automatically. I need to manually visit my inbox and sync them for new mails to arrive on my phone. I've already changed my synchronisation settings
 from 'as they arrive' to 'every 15 minutes', but this doesn't solve the issue.&nbsp;</p>

<div>I can receive emails and indeed emails sent from my Blackberry and Powerbook show up in the sent folder, but I can't send emails from the new mac. It's now about 2 weeks of trying. I get either

<br />
1.&nbsp; If you can send but not receive you have a bad POP or IMAP configuration (Incoming server)<br />
2.&nbsp; If you can receive but not send then you have a bad SMTP configuration (Outgoing server)<br />
<br />
Check under advanced settings. Check your provider's website for exact info on authentication, SSL and ports.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some ISPs require SSL for receiving<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most ISPs require advanced settings now for SMTP&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Outlook will auto setup most of the popular email providers like Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, Earthlink, FastMail, iCloud....<br />

<h2>            I&#39;m getting emails that look like they are from me, but I don&#39;t think they are</h2>
                    These emails end up in the spam folder. When I actually send myself an email, it goes to the inbox. When I "view the source" of those emails, it shows that's it's sent TO me, but not BY me. When I view the source on an email I really send myself, it show
 it to be to and from my email adtdress. What's up with this?I have already changed my password and scanned the computer for viruses etc. I don't really think my account has been hacked. Any idea what IS going on?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the late reply. By the way, let's find out what are the possible options that we can do to resolve your issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for providing additional information. I checked your screenshot and I found out
<span>
<font color="#000000">that you are having is an example of email spoofing. Email spoofing is an email activity in which the sender address and other parts of the email header are altered to appear as though the email originated from a different source. These
 techniques are commonly used in spam and phishing emails to hide the origin of the email message.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">To look for the original sender and the domain he/she is using, open the message header, press CTRL F, and type the following words:</font></span></p>

    <title>Configuring two different Microsoft email accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blueie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Configuring two different Microsoft email accounts</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>My two Microsoft email accounts - one is Hotmail and the other Outlook - have recently been migrated. Usually, I access both of these accounts using MS Outlook 2007 on my desktop via the Outlook Connector. Since the migration, the Connector is redundant,
 but I still have it installed and can see it in my list of Programs in my Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a home PC and unrelated to a networked work environment that uses Exchange Server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following MS instructions, I configured my Hotmail account through the Mail icon in my Windows 10 Control Panel and this is what I now see:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48e6c3d1-5020-4598-9d1d-5122a7c20fdc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48e6c3d1-5020-4598-9d1d-5122a7c20fdc" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open Outlook on my desktop, my newly configured Hotmail account has disappeared completely.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, again through the Mail icon in the Control Panel, I attempt to configure my second email account (outlook.com) and select the New tab in E-mail accounts, then I choose the Microsoft Exchange, POP3, IMAP, or HTTP option, I type in my details - my Outlook
 email address and password:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7eca2e3b-4eae-482e-81fa-24901d6a45c3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7eca2e3b-4eae-482e-81fa-24901d6a45c3" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I click Next and, as it is configuring my Outlook account, I get this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8409db9f-7b4f-4941-9bf6-a2b34e61e8af" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8409db9f-7b4f-4941-9bf6-a2b34e61e8af" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do here, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't just want to configure both email accounts, I want to be able to see them both, up-to-date, in my MS Outlook desktop application, just as it was using Outlook_Connector until MS started this circus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Outlook 2007 doesn't support adding 2 Exchange accounts within a single mail profile. Support for this was first added in Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't upgrade to Outlook 2010 or later at this moment, you can add the other account as an IMAP account instead. For instructions see:
<a href="https://www.msoutlook.info/question/add-an-outlookcom-account-to-outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Permanent Link to Adding an Outlook.com account to Outlook">
<p>
</p><p>Note that an IMAP account only supports synching mail folders. It does not support synching of Calendar and Contacts folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another workaround would be to create 2 Mail Profiles but you'd then have to restart Outlook each time to switch between the Mail Profiles. See:

</p><p>
</p><p>Hello Roady</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I have followed the instructions in the link you have kindly provided here to configure my outlook account:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.msoutlook.info/question/add-an-outlookcom-account-to-outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.msoutlook.info/question/add-an-outlookcom-account-to-outlook</a></p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Outgoing Server
<ul>
<li>enable: My outgoing server (SMTP) requires authentication</li></ul>
</li><li>Advanced

<li>Incoming server (IMAP): 993 </li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li>Enable: This server requires and encrypted connection (SSL) </li><li>Outgoing server (SMTP): 587 </li><li>Use the following type of encrypted connection: TLS</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>But I am not sure what this App Password means - do I have to follow that?&nbsp;I am trying to use&nbsp;my usual outlook.com password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open up the MS Outlook application on my desktop (I still cannot see my Hotmail account which, I think, has been configured correctly to Microsoft Exchange), I get the following errors:</p>

            <p>Regarding the Outlook Hotmail Connector account;</p>
<p>As your account has been migrated to the new Outlook Mail platform, you can no longer use your Outlook Hotmail Connector account so you'll have to remove that account (the one configured as MAPI). Additionally, you can also uninstall the Outlook Hotmail
 Connector from your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the IMAP/App Password issue;</p>
<p>Do you have Two-Step Verification enabled for your Microsoft Account?<br />
In that case, you can get an App Password here; <a href="https://account.live.com/Proofs/AppPassword" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.live.com/Proofs/AppPassword</a></p>
<p>Make sure you logon with the correct&nbsp;Microsoft Account first.</p>

            <p>Hello Roady</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, I have not set up a 2-stage verification for either the Hotmail or Outlook addresses. How would I check that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have explored it by going into my Outlook account online and I see this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fbe0c8e7-3764-4c1e-966b-0aa8b0efd440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">In fact<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fbe0c8e7-3764-4c1e-966b-0aa8b0efd440" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, I rarely use mobile devices - then it asked me to download a MS app for my phone but I need a Google account for that to access Play Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In terms of my desktop Outlook, in&nbsp;Control Panel | Mail I see this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06b6f37f-5362-42b7-99c8-b82e3bd6950c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/06b6f37f-5362-42b7-99c8-b82e3bd6950c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open the application, on my desktop Outlook application, it is&nbsp;confusing my Hotmail and Outlook accounts. According to the application, there are no emails in my Outlook inbox or folders - there are, in fact, more than a 1000 emails in my Outlook
 inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What a palaver this is.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi, yes, I've got on my 301 Trekbuddy up and running nicely! You can download maps on a PC and store them on the phone, it can connect to a GPS device, but otherwise a bit primitive!</p>
<p>Search for Trekbuddy for Java phones</p>

<h2>            Problems using COUNTIFS with multiple criteria and wildcard</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using COUNTIFS to create a dashboard to summarise monthly order and quote data.&nbsp; Generating the information from data updating automatically from a SQL database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using COUNTIFS because I have multiple criteria.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Columns I'm using are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Order Date (date ranges)</p>
<p>Order Type (order or reorder)</p>
<p>Quote Type (written, verbal, standard, special, demo etc) - this field can be a variety of any combination and the data displayed has comma separators i.e. example entries are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>,Written,</p>
<p>,Written,verbal,Notquoted</p>
<p>,Notquoted,Written,Standard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, I need to know how many written quotes for orders in a month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used COUNTIF to determine this data until I get to the Quote Type.&nbsp; This needs a wild card as I need to count all those with the word Written in the text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried using * and ? which don't return (I've checked and there are written quotes for the month I'm using).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The function works without this last section (quote type).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how I'm building it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=COUNTIFS('Order Data CRM'!Q:Q,"&gt;="&amp;Sheet1!C38,'Order Data CRM'!Q:Q,"&lt;="&amp;Sheet1!C39,'Order Data CRM'!AD:AD,"="&amp;Sheet1!P16,'Order Data CRM'!AG:AG,"?+Sheet1!P4?")</p>
<p>
</p><p>C38 Contains 01/02/2015</p>
<p>C39 Contains 28/02/2015</p>
<p>P16 Contains Order</p>
<p>P4 Contains ,Written,</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the above are on a separate calculation sheet which will be hidden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope anyone can help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Angela.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
