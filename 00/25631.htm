<h2>            Is it possible to show sub-tasks as labelled bars on a summary task bar in a Gantt chart in Project 2010&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to conserve space in my moderately large project, so rather than show the cascading sub-tasks, I was wondering if it was possible to show these linked subtasks horizontally. There is time between each, so with colours, they would show up easily,
 and with naming, they would be clearly identified. I have a copy of a project presentation (I think)&nbsp;that was done that way, but unfortunately do not know the author nor have an electronic version. In fact, the copy is a little beat up and maybe it is not
 even Project? </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did this for a customer several years ago.</p>
<p>Define the "type" of each task in a flag field in order to tell Project which color you want the rolled up task to have.</p>
<p>For instance, let's say that for the "green" rolled up tasks you will have Flag1=true, for the orange ones Flag2=true, etc.</p>
<p>Show the Bar Styles window</p>
<p>Start adding styles at the bottom:</p>
<p>Name=Green rolled up; Shape: for middle bar, select green bar;Show For.. Flag1;Rolled Up; From = Start; To=Finish</p>
<p>Also click Tekst, and for Below enter Name</p>
<p>Name=OrangeRolled Up; Shape=.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for the summary tasks, in Task information, General, make sure "Hide Bar" and "Rollup" checkboxes are checked</p>
<p>For the non-summary tasks, check "Rollup"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If by now you're still alive, you can admire the result.</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>

    <title>Outlook 2013 and Outlook.com not syncing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 and Outlook.com not syncing</h2>
                    <p>I have posted this before but received no help, so hopefully I will get more response this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, my Outlook 2013 and Outlook.com aren't syncing correctly with each other, which in turn makes my phone app not sync correctly. Between the three, they all receive email just fine. My issue is if I delete any emails in Outlook 2013, the emails
 don't delete from the other platforms. However, if I delete from Outlook.com, all the platforms receive that information. Does anyone know of a good way to fix this and what might be going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi Bryan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How is the email account setup in Outlook?
<span>Is it POP3, IMAP, Exchange Active Sync or Microsoft Exchange Server account?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verify the same from <strong>File </strong>
&gt; <strong>Account Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Account Settings </strong>&gt; check under
<strong>Email </strong>tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the email account is configured as Exchange Active sync, you may remove and re-add the email account in Outlook and check if it works as expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above steps fails, I would suggest you to create a new Outlook profile configure the email account in Outlook and verify the status.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer to the following article for instructions on how to create new profile:

    <title>Windows Phone Desktop App and Xbox Music App - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bomberkbh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Phone Desktop App and Xbox Music App &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; Annoyed&#33;</h2>
                    <p>THIS NEEDS SORTING URGENTLY.THE XBOX MUSIC APP AND WINDOWS DESKTOP APP DON'T WORK TOGETHER, THEY ARE *************** WHICH IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where do I start....oh yes. My previous phones was Samsung Galaxy Note 2. With this I could sync my phone with iTunes which included playlists etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then purchased a Nokia Lumia 1520. I installed the Windows Phone Desktop App on my Windows 8 PC plugged in my Windows 8 phone, followed the instructions and iTunes and my phone did a sync. This transferred all my music and playlists and the windows phone
 music app worked a treat. This was completed a number of sync's and everything was working great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Move forward a few months and the Windows Phone 8.1 update. Nice updates to the Windows Phone OS really nice. However, the music app had been replaced by the Xbox Music App. Ok looked ok and worked quite nicely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Came to the first sync with my iTunes as I had added music and playlists etc. Did all the connections with my phone and opened Windows Phone App and went to sync. It started to sync then stopped and didn't move across the bar and sat there for ages. Disconnect
 re-connect, same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried this so many times same result and getting very frustrated. Deleted all the music on my SD card and removed the Windows Phone folder from Apps data to force the phone to be re-recognised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone was recognised and I set up my phone with the Windows Phone App so it would sync with my iTunes library. As i have over 6000 tracks the re-sync took a few hours to complete. When complete I looked in the Xbox Music app to find that the music was
 there, some tracks were missing, all album art was missing, but all the playlists were empty. Removed all the playlists manually and then re sync my phone, expecting the playlists to re-appear. They did, but were duplicated. Remove the playlists again manually.
 Re-sync the phone, no playlists!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done this process of removing the music from my SD card, re-sync my phone, (hours on end) and I still get he same result, no playlsits and most of my music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried other apps, but they appear to rely on the music being in the main Xbox app first and they populate their own app, or I may have that wrong. Anyway, these apps do not show my music correctly and do not transfer the playlists either. in fact
 the choice of music players in the App store is minimal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled the Windows Desktop Phone App and installed it again and then had to do a full sync gain, same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also completed this on my Mac with the Mac version of the Windows Phone App, same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion, the Xbox Music App is complete garbage! The Windows Desktop App doesn't want to work with the Windows 8.1 phone OS and or Xbox Music App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did the old music app and windows desktop app work fine before the upgrade? is MS trying to push everyone down the WMP route and sync that way? (intact that doesn't work either, as I have tried that too taking up many hours once again). Is MS trying
 to push us all to using the Xbox apps to purchase our music etc and if it can not link in with the Xbox system, it will not be recognised??? Is there a big issue with the way that the links to the music and album art (before I had all my album art and now
 with Xbox music app, none!) and Xbox music (Yes!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really have had enough of trying various things which end up with me having to sync my whole collection of music taking up hours upon hours of my time. It should just work, i should plug my phone into my PC open up the desktop app, is should sync my music,
 my playlists and my album art and just work, well it don't and its complete c**p!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well what do i do?? Do I just use my Windows Phone as a phone and carry my iPod with me too?? the reason i have a smart phone is so i can carry everything with me including my music collection, so its not so smart in that area is it? do I stay frustrated
 and keep using my phone as a phone and try to live with this abomination of a music app and sync problems and never sync again??&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or do I wait for an iPhone 6 or Samsung Galaxy Note 4 or purchase a Samsung S5 knowing that all 3 of these devices will do what I ant them to do with my music collection and sync correctly. Having done that, sell my Nokia 1520 at a loss, never go near a
 Windows Phone again and stop as many people as I can from buying one of these devices. The reason I say that is it would appear from what I have read on various forums etc, that MS are aware of these sync and Xbox music app issues, but appear not to be doing
 a thing about it, which annoys the **** out of me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I junk my 1520 for something that works with my music, does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can sync my music as it should be with the minimal of fuss??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help from MS would be great, but I doubt that will be forthcoming. But seriously i have wasted soooooo many hours on this it nearly came to hammer time with the whole Windows Phone experience. Having said that my first few months with the phone and the
 old music app and the windows desktop phone app worked a treat, but now its indescribable!</p>

            Thanks for your response.<br />
In this case, is there any way I can make the 2nd edition works on N73.. I mean, given that N73 is newer, shouldnt it be backward compatible.. Everything on the web is 2nd Edition and I think this is such big down side of Nokia N73

            With S60 3rd Edition (or primarily with Symbian operating system version 9), the so called binary compatibility to earlier versions was broken.<br />
<br />
The main reasons why that happened was:<br />
- New Platform Security model<br />
- New real-time kernel<br />
- New ARM processor instruction set support

<h2>            How to fix websites that delay for several seconds and then load the page really fast</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use aol 9.7 software which has an adapter that connects the software to internet explorer for its browser. So yes, this is a microsoft internet explorer related question even though I use aol. &nbsp;I'm wondering what is causing web pages to have a short delay
 of several seconds, before loading the webpage really fast when it finaly does start to load. I did a internet speed test to make sure I'm getting all the speed I paid for and I am. I use wifi for my laptop so that perhaps makes the speed a little bit less
 than if it was directly hooked up to an ethernet cable. &nbsp;I'm inclined to believe it's a problem with the computer rather than router or modem. I did some reading online and thought an interesting possibility was an antivirus firewall may be the cause of the
 problem. So I then turned windows defender off, and turned the firewall off. However, the problem of website delays remained. So I'm not sure what's causing it when it used to go much more reliably fast on the same computer. I also noticed that if I do a website
 I've never been to before it loads slower, and if I visit a website that I visit often, it appears to be "cached" for quicker loading later. So that may be impacting perceived speed or lack thereof at times. My browser is inconsistent to say the least. If
 I have a cached website I visit frequently it may load pretty quickly, but if II load a website I've never been to then it will delay and load much slower. I have thought about upgrading the internet package for more mb/s, but I remember when it was going
 faster and not delaying at all, with this same internet package I currently have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So does anyone have any advice in laymen's terms, like in simple steps of where to go in windows or what to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you could give me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p><br />
Tim.</p>

            <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A third party browser extension on Internet Explorer may be causing this issue, so it would be ideal if you could open Internet Explorer in no add-ons mode, to start it with no browser extensions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To perform this action, press the Windows Key + R on your keyboard, type iexplore.exe -extoff and press enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still occurs while in no add-ons mode, then we definitely know an add-on isn't causing the issue. You may try resetting Internet Explorer in case it's currently corrupt.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click the tools tab and select select Internet Options </p>
<p>2. Head over to the advanced tab, then click reset </p>
<p>3. Place a checkmark next to 'delete personal settings' and click reset.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. It appears it's not an add-on issue (Itried what you said) &nbsp;because certain sites have some delay and slow loading. I've noticed that when websites are cached (ie you visit them frequently) they load a little bit faster. But when you
 load a website you've never been to it delays and loads slowly. To let you know, we're paying for only 2 mb;s of cable internet so even though it's much better than dial up it's still not the best speed out there. But even with that 2 mb plan on the same computer,
 using the same wifi and router, I had a much more relilable and faster internet with no initial delay. So I don't know what caused the computer to all of a sudden start having these delays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read a lot of things on the internet and tried a lot of things but the browser behaves the same way with an initial delay and then it loads reasonably quickly at that time. Occasionally there's an even tougher website to load that has a delay, and then
 also loads slowly thereafter too. So that's not a good circumstance to have when you're paying for high speed cable internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tim.</p>

            <p>When you go repeatedly to one site, the site automatically places&nbsp;a cookie onto your computer, which makes it easier to connect&nbsp;the next time you click the URL for&nbsp;that site.&nbsp; By contrast, a new site will momentarily delay while it first installs a cookie
 on your machine.&nbsp; (Thereafter, it may load quicker.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have your computer set to "delete browsing history on exit"&nbsp;all cookies will be removed each time you close the browser (Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;General tab).&nbsp; So, when you connect again a new cookie will first install (delay).&nbsp; Might want to UNCHECK
 this if it is checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Experiment with&nbsp;your cookie management options...... (Tools&gt;Internet Options&gt;Privacy Tab&gt;Advanced button)
</p>
<p>CHECK the box "override automatic cookie handling"</p>
<p>then,&nbsp;tweak the settings &nbsp;....... suggest "accept 1st Party Cookies"&nbsp; "Prompt or Block" third party cookies"</p>
<p>
</p><p>CHECK " Always show session cookies"</p>
<p>APPLY</p>
<p>OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Additionally, &nbsp;your DNS server may be caching old web addresses, so when you try to connect, it is still trying to load a (since changed) URL.&nbsp; You can clear the DNS and allow it to recreate all new URLs thereafter...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Key + X</p>
<p>Command prompt (Admin)</p>
<p>enter<strong> ipconfig /flushdns&nbsp; </strong>(there is one space before the (/)</p>
<p>hit the Enter key on your keyboard.</p>
<p>You will quickly get a reply&nbsp;"successfully flushed the DNS resolver cache"</p>
<p>After doing this, your PC will load slowly for awhile because each site you visit will now be caching its current address in the server.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. I tried your idea of flushing the DNS cache,, and the internet is going even slower. When I open websites, there is a delay where there is no page loading, then it finally starts loading. That delay is getting annoying.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also read online something about latency, and they were talking about how cable internet has very low latency which is good, and that allows for a quick loading webpage with no delay. Whereas satellite internet with high latency, has a delay before the
 page starts loading. However, it's kind of embarrassing that I have cable not satellite, and so therefore it should be loading quickly and not delaying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only goal is to get websites immediately load up when I go to them. That's why we pay for high speed cable internet. I don't want to have to replace the router or modem or anything, because I had very quick internet with that same router and modem in
 the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas since the DNS cache didn't seem to work? I frequently try to restart the computer etc. hoping that the internet will behave well that day. But other than that I'm not sure what to do. By the way, i regularly use CCLeaner which deletes the
 temporary internet files. Usually the cookies are not deleted though.</p>
<p>

<p>i you have run out of ideas for fixing it then your las chance is reset !</p>
<p>go to call screen , type *#7370# then security code 12345</p>
<p>wait for about 5 mins while your screen is blank ( your phone hasn't frozen it just takes some time)</p>
<p>if you interrupt this process its sure your phone will not work . So do not remove battery or press any key while screen is blank .</p>
<p>after it powers on it will be like new and your problem is no more there :smileywink:</p>

<p>I noticed by chance&nbsp;that when my menu button stopped working the clock date was&nbsp;completely wrong. I had already tried several times rebooting without success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setting the time/date back to the current one and restarting the phone fixed the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news is that you can access to the clock from the home screen by touching the clock widget.</p>

<p>(message from Nokia)</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Dear Mr. Edwards,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<br />
Thank you for contacting Nokia Care.<br />
<br />
We understand that you are having an issue with your Nokia C7-00 after removing the battery. We suggest that you perform the following troubleshooting steps to rectify the issue:<br />
<br />
Powercyle:<br />
<br />
1. Kindly turn off your phone.<br />
2. Remove the battery, SIM card and memory card for 5 minutes.<br />
3. Place back the battery, SIM card and memory card and turn on you phone.<br />
<br />
If performing a powercycle has not resolved the issue, we suggest that you do a soft reset on your Nokia C7-00. To do this, kindly follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
1. Go to the phone's main screen and press *#7780#.<br />
2. You will be prompted to restore the factory settings and it will ask for a lock code. If you have not changed the code, the default is 12345.<br />
3. Your phone will automatically restart after pressing the code.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, if the issue still persist after performing a soft reset. We recommend that you perform a software update on your Nokia C7-00 instead. &nbsp;The latest version for the Nokia C7-00 is version 014.002.<br />
<br />
Remember to do a backup before performing a software update as this deletes data.You may back up you files using Ovi Suite so that you will only need to connect your device to your PC. To back up your files using Ovi Suite, kindly follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
1. Download and install Ovi Suite from the link below:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/support/download-software/ovi-suite/compatibility-and-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.co.uk/support/download-software/ovi-suite/compatibility-and-download</a><br />
<br />
2. Connect the phone you want to back up to your computer with a USB &nbsp;cable. You can also use a Bluetooth connection. Your phone may ask you &nbsp;how you want to connect. Select PC Suite and then select OK.<br />
3. In Nokia Ovi Suite, select Tools &gt; Backup. Nokia Ovi Suite reads your phone and prepares a list of information that can be backed up.<br />
4. Select the information that you want to back up. If you want to change where the backup file is saved, select Browse and choose another location. If you have a lot of &nbsp;music, photos or videos on your phone, including them in the backup will cause the backup
 process to be slower.<br />
5. Select Start to begin the backup. Do not disconnect or switch off your phone during the backup. If you need to stop the backup, select Stop. Nokia Ovi Suite will reach a &nbsp;safe stop point and will then stop the backup.<br />
6. Click Finish to close the back up wizard.<br />
<br />
After making a backup proceed to the following steps to complete the software update:<br />
<br />
1.) Charge your battery â€“ this is very important; charge your battery to the full power before starting the update process; if you run out of battery in the middle of updating you can seriously harm your phone (it &nbsp;probably wonâ€™t even start up)<br />
2.) Download Nokia Software Updater â€“ install the updater; this piece of software will guide you through the whole update process; you might need<br />
to unblock it in your firewall<br />
3.) Launch the Nokia Sofware Updater â€“ from now on itâ€™s really simple, just follow the guide and youâ€™ll be fine; the whole updating process takes several minutes to complete, donâ€™t try to cancel it in the middle in any case, your risk damaging your phone, USB
 cable needed again.<br />
4.) Restore your data â€“ if you used a memory card for backup then you simply go to the Tools â€“ Memory select Options â€“ Restore from card; if you used Nokia PC Suite you have to connect your phone to the pc via USB cable, select Backup and Restore. Now you have
 your &nbsp;phone loaded with the newest software. If you experienced some problems with your phone performance before the update process should fix it. So go on and check it out. To make sure your phone is really updated type *#0000# when in idle screen and check
 the software version.<br />

Oh and thanks for the ideas and contributions

<p>Hi JulieLastName,</p>
<p>This is no such undo option in SharePoint Online. If you are using IE explorer, you can use
<strong>Open with Explorer</strong> feature to move the folder back.<br />
To do this,<br />
In the SharePoint Online document library, click the Library tab on the ribbon, and then click the Open with Explorer icon in the Connect &amp; Export group.<br />

<p>In Word's list of label types, the entries are not in "numeric" order but in "alphabetic" order. That means all the numbers, both 4-digit and 5-digit, that start with the same number are placed together, and only after the last of those do you get to the
 ones that start with the next number. The 8160 label is in the list:</p>

Thank you Jay.&nbsp; I was actually able to find what I needed but now I am having trouble bringing over an existing label list using Mail Merge.&nbsp; Do you have any guidance to give me?&nbsp; I was able to start a new document, click into Mail Merge, Recipients then "use
 an existing list" but when I click OK the list does not show up on the page. &nbsp;

<p>After selecting the data source, which I assume that you have done, you need to insert the merge fields into the first label on the sheet by using the Insert Merge Fields button in the Write &amp; insert fields section of the Mailings tab of the ribbon</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5aaf5949-ec54-48ce-ac83-d776dd75fbc8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5aaf5949-ec54-48ce-ac83-d776dd75fbc8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and then use the Update Labels button to replicate the setup from the first label to the other labels on the page</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c93aa34-8f91-41f1-bcd1-d3b39def2d6a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c93aa34-8f91-41f1-bcd1-d3b39def2d6a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then to actually execute the merge, you need to select the required destination from the Finish &amp; Merge dropdown in the Finish section of the ribbon.</p>

<p>From the statement '<span>click into Mail Merge, Recipients then "use an existing list" but when I click OK the list does not show up on the page</span>', I got the impression that you aren't able to find the existing data
 source. What sort of file do you expect it to be? Data sources are most often an Excel worksheet, an Access database, or a table in a Word document, but it could be any of the types in the dropdown on the Select Data Source dialog:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ccccbcc6-b0e6-493f-9fb9-ff117aafad3f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ccccbcc6-b0e6-493f-9fb9-ff117aafad3f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That dialog defaults to looking in the My Data sources folder under your Documents folder, but you can navigate to any other folder where the source file may be stored.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 - Problems with S&#47;MIME</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to encrypt and email and attach on my Office 365 account. I've downloaded S/MIME but whenever I try to use it, it just keeps telling me that I can't and that I need to install the program. I've restarted my browser (Firefox), cleared my history
 and cookies, and restarted my computer but none of that seems to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions of how to fix this/what could be happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Not sure why you're seeing that, but that's not what I see in ppt2007 and ppt2013.&nbsp; They both look the same.&nbsp; I suspect your font is either not being correctly applied in ppt2013 or is in some way corrupted, but I have no idea how to fix this.</p>
<p>Cheers<br />

            The 2013 screenshot is not Constantia (looks like Arial). Can you post a screenshot that also shows the font name in the home tab.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When I tested this in PowerPoint 2007 and 2013, both fonts looked the same, like your screen shot of ppt2007 - your screen shot of 2013 is displaying as Arial.&nbsp; It is not a feature of the font, there is some other problem.&nbsp; I noticed that you have your font
 size set to 23.9.&nbsp; I matched that and still it looked right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd be tempted to do a repair of Office 2013 via Control Panel &gt; Programs and features.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers<br />
Rich<br />

            Thanks, yes it is Ariel. &nbsp;I duplicated the slide in PP and changed one to Ariel. &nbsp;The two say Constantia and Ariel respectively but are identical. &nbsp;I have only had Office 2013 for a couple of weeks. Should I try
<div>a repair or perhaps a re-download ... ?</div>

            I'd have a look at Control Panel | Fonts to see if Windows thinks Constantia is installed at all.
<div><br />
<div>If not, I'd either do a repair install of Office or perhaps find someone with a copy of the font and install it on your system. &nbsp;While sharing fonts this way isn't normally legal (and possibly not strictly legal in this case) if you have Office, you have
 a license for the font. &nbsp;The Font StormTroopers have bigger doors to bash in elsewhere, I expect.&nbsp;</div>

<div>The link Rich007a posted explains how to install a font; in your case, you'll want to unzip the file containing the fonts first. &nbsp;Perhaps create new folder for your purchased fonts someplace convenient on your hard drive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And be sure to back the font files up so if anything happens to your hard drive, you don't lose all the money you spent on purchasing them.</div>

            <p><strong>When will Windows 10 officially become available? </strong></p>
<p>Microsoft will launch Windows 10 world wide in summer of 2015. This is what Microsoft Program Manager for Windows, Terry Myerson had to say:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>We continue to make great development progress and shared today that Windows 10 will be available this summer in 190 countries and 111 languages.
</em></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You will have a year to upgrade when it launches.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How much will Windows 10 cost?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft has not revealed all the details about pricing for Windows 10 yet, but they did announce that Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><em>This is more than a one-time upgrade: once a Windows device is upgraded to Windows 10, we will continue to keep it current for the supported lifetime of the device

    <title>Using BeforeUpdate event with subforms&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rob bob s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using BeforeUpdate event with subforms&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to verify a form is filled out completely before saving, and if not, I ask the user whether they wish to continue. &nbsp;I am using the BeforeUpdate event, but I don't think it's the right method. The problem occurs when the user goes to entering
 data into a subform. The BeforeUpdate event fires (though I don't want it to in this case).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, basically, I have</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Private Sub Form_BeforeUpdate(Cancel as Integer)</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">If Not formComplete() Then</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;response = MsgBox("This form has missing fields. &nbsp;Do you wish to continue?", vbYesNoCancel)</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If response &lt;&gt; vbYes then</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cancel = True</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Exit Sub</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;End if</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">End If</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">End Sub</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">...where "formComplete" is my function which determines whether all the required fields are entered. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">As I say though, I would like so skip this procedure if the user is simply entering data in a subform (they can't actually have a complete form until they do so). &nbsp;Suggestions?</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Thanks in advance,</p>

            <p>I suspect the problem has to do with the way Access handles subform data. The BeforeUpdate events of the mainform and the subform are (pretty much) independent: each fires when
<em>that form</em> is ready to be updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the mainform record updates (and its BeforeUpdate event executes) the instant you set focus to the subform; it must do so, in order to allow referential integrity to be enforced (you need the parent record saved before you can create
 the child record).&nbsp;Similarly, the subform updates as soon as you set focus back to the mainform or move to a new record on hte subform.&nbsp;There is no event which fires when all of the records that the user intends to enter on the subform (or all of the multiple
 subforms) are complete. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on what your formComplete function does, it may or may not be appropriate; and it may be nontrivial to determine that the main and subform records are complete to your satisfaction.

            You cannot prevent a parent form's current record being saved when you move focus to a subform to enter data into a referencing table.&nbsp; Even if you could, referential integrity would be violated.&nbsp; I assume that your formComplete function returns a Boolean
 False if no matching rows exist in the related table on which the subform is based, as well as there being any omissions from mandatory controls in the parent form.&nbsp; The only way you could cover both requirements would be to omit the check on matching rows
 existing in the related table from the function.&nbsp; You could then call it in the parent form's BeforeUpdate event procedure, as at present, to validate the mandatory controls in the parent form before moving focus to the subform.<br />
<br />
To enforce the insertion of at least one row in the subform you can use the technique illustrated in the file Families.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file, if the user attempts to navigate to a new record in the parent form, or to close the form, code in the parent form's Current and Unload event procedures detects the absence of a matching row in the referencing table (FamilyMembers)
 and returns the user to the record just entered.&nbsp; The user must then either enter at least one row in the subform or delete the record in the parent form.&nbsp; Otherwise the process is repeated ad infinitum until they do one or the other.<br />

            <p>Thanks. &nbsp;The form their dealing with is complicated with lots of various controls and subforms. &nbsp;It would be more of a pain for them to have to fill out the form in a particular order than it would be to have to click "OK" a bunch of times along the way.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But on the other hand since they have to click "OK" so many times it's easy to imagine that they'll do it blindly when I want the completion check to REALLY run -- when they close or move to another record in the parent form.</p>

<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>That would be too late in the day to <em>'bail out'</em>.&nbsp; In any event <em>'bailing out'</em> would mean allowing the parent form's current record to be saved by not setting the return value of the Cancel argument to True, which is what you are trying to
 prevent in the first place.&nbsp; Once you've done that it won't execute again, so there would be no validation whatsoever.<br />
<br />
It would be possible with a little more work to extend the code in my demo form's module to do all the validation, and therefore allow you to avoid the use of the BeforeUpdate event procedure completely.&nbsp; You'd need to extend the criteria for the DLookup function
 call so that in addition to testing for a row in families with no match in FamilyMembers by means of the subquery, it also tests for Nulls in any of the mandatory columns in Families.&nbsp; This would allow you to move to the subform without validating the parent
 form's controls, but while it would work in practice in the way you envisage, I would not be happy with such a solution as it would mean that the mandatory columns in Families would each have to allow Null in the table definition, prejudicing the integrity
 of the table.<br />
<br />
My demo does not do any validation on Families of course as it is not designed to illustrate this, and Families is just a single column table.

                    <span>Hello, my name is John, I am an I.T. professional and a member of the Microsoft insider program. as a member I downloaded a pre-release evaluation copy of Windows 10 a few months ago, installed fine, updated
 with fast updates to build 1024 and activated itself which was all good,&nbsp;PRODUCT ID IS/WAS "003300-80000-00000-AA744". I use Windows via Parallels desktop on an apple mac to maintain a number of legacy systems written in microsoft access 2010 so I had rather
 a lot of testing to do. Due to all the testing I decided to erase windows 10 and parallels from my macbook and install a fresh copy of both, parallels reinstalled fine and I installed windows 10 from the original ISO image and set it to auto update, gets as
 far as - Evaluation copy Build 9926 - &nbsp;but then the updates fail and I CAN NOT ACTIATE windows 10, ERROR CODE IS (0x8024a10c) when looking at my microsoft account it shows three copies of windows, one is windows 8, one is Windows-10. assistance please with
 activating and updating my Windows 10 reinstall, I will continue as an insider with the fast ring due to supporting legacy access 2010 databases.</span>

    <title>Backing-up data when the screen doesn&#39;t work. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mccbleue  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backing-up data when the screen doesn&#39;t work.</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Intermediate
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br />
<br /><b>Details</b><br />
<p>People often post asking for advice preserving personal data from their phone after the screen has broken or some other screen fault causes the display to fail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people might try to guide you to backup to memory card using the "Menu, down 2, right 1, select..." method of guiding you blindly through the menus, but menu structures in the typical modern phone may vary according to regional and network variant oftware,
 current software version installed or to user's personal preferences, so this isn't a reliable way to talk you through the process, and in any case backup to memory card can only restore to a phone of the same type, so if yours can't be fixed and you get a
 replacement which is an equivelant rather than the same model, you could still lose the backup.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The simplest way to do this is to connect your phone to your Windows PC or laptop using the USB cable. When the connection is made, the phone asks you to confirm a connection method, you simply select PC Suite and then backup your data from the computer.
 Of course, with no working phone display you can't see these choices, but PC Suite Mode is the first choice in the list, so all you need to do to complete the connection is press the middle of the navigation key and all is well - you can proceed to use Content
 Copier to back up your phone data for restoration after you get it repaired or replaced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have one of the new touch-screen models like the 5530 or 5800 Xpress Musics, then you have an additional problem because if your screen isn't showing anything, chances are it isn't accepting any input either; and even if it was accepting input, you
 wouldn't be able to see where to tap to select the right mode. In these cases, it might be a wise precaution to change from the default settings to switch off the "Ask on Connection" feature:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Menu&gt;Settings&gt;Connectivity&gt;USB&gt;Ask on connection&gt;No</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then (if necessary) set the connection mode to PC Suite in the same menu:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Menu&gt;Settings&gt;Connectivity&gt;USB&gt;USB connection&gt;Pc Suite</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By doing this, you ensure that any time you need to connect the phone to PC without the benefit of a screen, all you need to do plug one end of the cable into the phone and one into the PC. The downside is that if you need another mode, you would always
 need to go through the menus to switch them and remember to switch them back afterwards, but if anything does happen to the screen of your touch phone, you'd at least be certain that you could protect your precious data before the phone goes off to the repairer
 if fate deals you an unfortunate blow...</p>

<p>The problem is that you can't set up a real relationship between 2 databases which is what you are really doing when you use the front end to set relationships in the back end even though the tables are in the BE.</p>
<p>It's just a thing Access can't do.</p>

<p>Thanks...I guess I never thought about it before.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm still confused though...I have referential integrity set on other tables that also reside in the back-end, but when I look at their relationship in the front end, the relationship shows one-to-many.&nbsp;
 When I add this table to the relationships window in the front-end, it shows no relationship.&nbsp; So, I create it as a one-to many (just to see, since I now have it set in the back-end) but it only shows a straight line between the two, not the expected one-to-many
 line and symbols.&nbsp; Could this be because the other relationships were created before the table was split?</p>

<p>Bets way to get out of Insider program is to restore previous installation of Windows with all installed apps and personal data from disk image.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you didn't take that image before installing insider preview you need to take copy of all your personal data to external disk and perform clean install with latest public released Windows v1803.</p>

<p>Rolling back isn't going to do you any good</p>
<p>if the prior build was an Insider build.</p>
<p>As Pauli stated you have to do a clean install</p>
<p>back to the last Public Release 17134.</p>

</p><p>Apply the Resource Usage view to see all of your project resources, along with their task assignments.&nbsp; In the Data section of the View ribbon, click the Tables pick list and select the Work table.&nbsp; Click the AutoFilter button in the Remaining Work column
 header, deselect the 0h value, and then click the OK button.&nbsp; You will now see the uncompleted tasks for each resource.&nbsp; Look for the resource in which you are interested and study this resource's remaining tasks.&nbsp; Press the F3 function key to remove the AutoFilter
 when done.&nbsp; Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>You'll need first to create a custom filter. &nbsp;Apply a task view (Gantt is fine) and create a filter with the definition below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d208e3a4-390b-4006-9fda-38d1f42647b3" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Test the filter to make sure it works as expected. &nbsp;The filter will prompt you for the name for the resource, allowing you to run it to show different data when the report loads.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm guessing you want to create a table report. &nbsp;Create the new report and add a table using tasks. In the Field list pane, select the filter you just created. &nbsp;When you need to run the report for a different resource, set the
 filter in the Field List pane back to "All tasks" to show all tasks and then select the custom filter again. &nbsp;If you don't have a large number of resource, I suppose you could create a separate table or report for each resource.&nbsp;</span><br />
