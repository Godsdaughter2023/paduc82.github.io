            Go to <a href="http://www.symbiansigned.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.symbiansigned.com</a> and choose the option "Open Signed Online". Enter your IMEI (type *#06# in standby to get it), your email address and the application to be signed. Select all
 the capabilities from the list, agree to the "Legal agreement" and submit. You'll receive a confirmation email, and after that an email with the download link.<br />
<br />
And in case this isn't already so, I would advise you to go to Settings-&gt;Applications-&gt;App manager-&gt;Software installation and set it to "All" instead of "Signed only".<br />

<h2>            Failed to log in to Onedrive with a school email</h2>
                    
<p>I have a school email *** Email address is removed for privacy *** &nbsp;with this mail i have office 365. But i can not log into the one drive application that i have downloaded to my mac. It is no problems with using word,excel, powerpoint. But it only says wrong email or password when
 i try to log into one drive.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When i log into office the loginscreen changes to something that is called feide login when i have typed inn my email, and then i put in my student number and password inn on the feide page. But this redirection to feide dos not happened when i use one drive.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
One-drive is working with no problem om the webside, but i need it on my mac so i can open and send the files on my mac without going thru word or exel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi knut haavard,</p>
<p>please confirm whether the onedrive app you mentioned is the same as below.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=1b4ee888-b99a-4203-9394-bd444bb9b38a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d1b4ee888-b99a-4203-9394-bd444bb9b38a" /></a></p>
<p>if so, this app is used for personal files. onedrive for business is different from onedrive in syncing files and other functions. about it, you can see
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-is-onedrive-for-business-187f90af-056f-47c0-9656-cc0ddca7fdc2#__how_does_skydrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
how is onedrive for business different from onedrive?</a><br />
<br />
to use the files in your onedrive for business library, you need to use the onedrive for business client to sync files to your mac. we recommend you install the new sync client. you may need to go through the documentation for the installation steps as well
 as the instruction to report any issues back to us.<br />
<a href="https://preview.onedrive.com/sync/setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://preview.onedrive.com/sync/setup.html</a>
<br />
note: to use the next-generation onedrive for business for mac, please uninstall onedrive for mac firstly. for detailed steps, please refer to the uninstall and reinstall the onedrive app section in
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/fix-onedrive-sync-problems-on-a-mac-6129abf1-a6c8-4526-9d66-119cd650acf4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

if not, about “ it only says wrong email or password when i try to log into one drive”, could you&nbsp;provide a screenshot of it?<br />

<h2>            adding dates to Outlook calendar from e-mail message</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way I can quickly add a&nbsp;date to an Outlook calendar from an e-mail message? I currently drag the message over to Calendar and drop - but then still have to add all the date&nbsp;information from the message. The nearest&nbsp;"clue" I've been able to find
 has been Smart Tags but I'm not sure how to activate them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

            OK, not quite as straightforward as I anticipated :(<br />
<br />
There are two main problems.<br />
1. You cannot grab a selection from a message body without additional software<br />
2. The format of the date you select must be convertible in vba to a recognised date format and with random dates styles that may not be possible.<br />
<br />
Taking 1 first - you will need to download <a href="http://www.dimastr.com/redemption/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Redemption</a> and install the personal developers version. Instructions are included in the download file. Then having registered the DLL as instructed, from the Outlook VBA editor Tools &gt; References, locate and check 'Redemption Outlook and MAPI COM
 Library'. The following macro uses Redemption to recover the selected text.<br />
<br />
2. I have done my best to correct likely date formats to an acceptable format, so see how you get on with<br />
<br />
Sub CreateAppt()<br />
Dim olAppointment As Outlook.AppointmentItem<br />
Dim strDate As String<br />
Dim datOutlookDate As Date<br />
Dim olInsp As Object<br />
Dim olMsg As MailItem<br />
Dim strAsk As String<br />
Set olMsg = ActiveExplorer.Selection.item(1)<br />
Set olInsp = CreateObject("Redemption.SafeInspector")<br />
olInsp.item = Application.ActiveInspector<br />
strDate = olInsp.SelText<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, ",", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "st", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "ST", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "nd", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "ND", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "rd", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "RD", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "th", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "TH", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "Monday", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "Tuesday", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "Wednesday", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "Thursday", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "Friday", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "Saturday", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "Sunday", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "MONDAY", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "TUESDAY", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "WEDNESDAY", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "THURSDAY", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "FRIDAY", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "SATURDAY", "")<br />
strDate = Replace(strDate, "SUNDAY", "")<br />
strDate = Trim(strDate)<br />
If IsDate(strDate) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; datOutlookDate = CDate(strDate)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set olAppointment = CreateItem(olAppointmentItem)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With olAppointment<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Start = datOutlookDate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .ReminderSet = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .AllDayEvent = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Subject = olMsg.Subject<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .BusyStatus = olBusy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Display<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MsgBox "Operation cancelled - " &amp; vbCr + vbCr &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strDate &amp; vbCr + vbCr &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "is not a valid appointment date format." &amp; vbCr &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Select the date and re-run the macro", _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vbInformation, "Invalid date selection"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GoTo CleanUp<br />
End If<br />
CleanUp:<br />
Set olAppointment = Nothing<br />
Set olInsp = Nothing<br />
Set olMsg = Nothing<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
The macro will run on a date selected in the dody of a message either in the open message or the message previewer. If there is no year associated with the date, the current year is used. Add the macro to the Outlook 2010 ribbon or QAT.<br />
<br />
The Outlook macro editor is essentially similar to that in Word - see <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/installing_macro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Office 2010 Products Won&#39;t Print and Computer Won&#39;t Let me Update Driver</h2>
                    A new computer got set up in the office and we all have a shared printer. I can print things from the machine from non-Office programs, such as Internet Explorer and Adobe Acrobat Reader but it will not print from Office (admittedly, I only checked Word
 &amp; Excel but those are the only two Office products we use). I have read the answers to similar questions and I have heeded the advice to get an updated printer driver.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This produces a new problem. I select the most current driver and I start going through the process and when it asks me for the printer location, I choose Find Now and the only office printer shows up in the list so I select and then the Wizard tells me
 that I must have mistyped the location of the printer because it can't find it. So I go back into the Find Now and see that in the details for the printer, it has Name &amp; Model but it doesn't have a specified location.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After abandoning the printer driver, I moved into updating Windows. I thought that, since it's a new machine, maybe it wasn't completely updated. So I went through installing the updates and then I printed a test page from Word. And it worked and all was
 right with the world...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And then I was told that Word reverted back to not printing and that's the state it's in now. Unresponsive to print requests from Office. Any advice on how to proceed from here?</div>
                </div>

            <p>To be able to give you the most appropriate assistance, it would be best to tell us what it is that you want to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are wanting the numbering to restart in a multi-level list, that will happen automatically if you set up the numbering by following the procedure in
<span>the article "How to create numbered headings or outline numbering in your Microsoft Word document" on the following page of the Late Shauna Kelly's website:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span><a href="http://shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html?p=1768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://shaunakelly.com/word/numbering/numbering20072010.html?p=1768</span></span></a></span>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you have invoked numbering by clicking on the Numbering button in the paragraph section of the ribbon,</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea5ed7ca-7fd0-4bfa-962f-09e930ec2854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea5ed7ca-7fd0-4bfa-962f-09e930ec2854" /></a></p>
<p>you can use that dialog to control the starting number for the list.&nbsp; After clicking on OK in that dialog, the number 1. that is enclosed in the red square will change to 5</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b2fd554-ef95-43a6-b5ea-f8e988016eee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b2fd554-ef95-43a6-b5ea-f8e988016eee" /></a></p>
<p>So once again, what is it that you want to do?</p>

jamesricamara.</a> Since you were able to send a text message to another person, maybe it has something to do with the limitation with your text plan. Try contacting your network operator and inquire about it. Before you reset your phone and to isolate the&nbsp;issue,&nbsp;try
 inserting your SIM to another phone and see if you were able to send SMS to&nbsp;your 3 contact persons.

    <title>Headphone&#47;Speaker Audio Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abigail-rose  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headphone&#47;Speaker Audio Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have in the last month, begun to have issues with the audio in Skype. When I have my headphones plugged in, audio typically goes through my headphones, such as the IM ping, ect. However, when someone calls me, or I call someone, the audio reroutes through
 my main speakers. Then I have to quickly go to Call&gt;Audio Settings and change the Speaker Settings from Speakers/HP to Communication Headphones. Then everything reroutes back to my headphones. (Though, the first time I did this, I had to turn the volume down
 extremely low because the automatic settings were deafening.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This would be all good and fine, except, when the call is over, I have to remember to change the setting back to Speaker/HP, or the next time I get an IM ping, it'll go through my main speakers for a few seconds, along with whatever other audio I am currently
 streaming. This is highly disruptive and annoying. I have searched for about a week to find a solution to this issue, to no avail.Please advise.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pertinent Information: </p>
<p>I am using my Windows HP laptop to run Skype, and I have only had this issue recently. My version of Skype is 7.40.0.103. I am using basic headphones plugged only into my headphone jack. They do not have any microphone capabilities.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>
<br />

<p>I appreciate all the work you've done to try to help me fix this problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered a solution on my own. For some reason, my computer isn't properly recognizing my headphones are a separate device, so the audio thought it was going to my speakers when it was really just going through my headphones. Skype recognized the difference,
 though, which was confusing Skype, my laptop, and me. I disabled the "Communication Headphones" and now all my audio goes through my headphones, exactly how I wanted it to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your help!</p>

                    <p>I see that Acrobat supports it this way https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THUEALmv4wE. I see "EstEID National ID Card" when doing that myself, which leads me to the "electronic identification schemes", supported in EU. Does MS provide anything similar?</p>

<h2>            HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I recently downloaded microsoft office 13 for my college, and supposedly it was free, but i recently received an email stating, "</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Your order includes Kivuto's Basic Access Guarantee, which will expire on August 18, 2014.<br />
<br />
After this date, your download and/or key(s) will be archived and as a result this information will no longer be available under 'Your Account' on the WebStore. In the event that you misplace your key or need to re-download your software as a later date, it
 is recommended that you back-up this information to avoid losing access to your product order information."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does this mean? Does this mean i won't be able to access the microsoft i downloaded after August 18th? Do I need to buy it now? Or do I have to backup the program like it says in the email?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need microsoft office for school, and since it expires right before I leave I need help. Thanks so much for your time and effort!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Sorry, but the "Access" in the title of this particular forum refers to Access, the database product that's part of Office. Your problem would appear to have nothing to do with that product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say you "recently downloaded microsoft office 13". From what site did you download it? The message you're getting mentions "Kivuto's Basic Access Guarantee". If you downloaded Office from Kivuto.com, I'd suggest getting in touch with their support group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck with your studies.</p>

            <p>Kivuto.com seems to be a site to distribute licensed software (among other things). I would guess that your school provides a free license for a version of Office and that license can be downloaded from them. Basically, they are telling you that you will
 no longer be able to access the license key you received from them under your account with them after 8/18. It doesn't mean your license will expire then or you won't be able to use the software after that date. It just means you won't be able to get the key.
 So what you need to do is store the key in a file on your system somewhere. I store my keys in Notepad txt files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, as Doug pointed out, this has nothing to do with Microsoft Access the database. It actualyl has nothing to do with Microsoft since you received the license from Kivuto.&nbsp;</p>

            &nbsp;Hi Willy,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
Basic storage uses normal partition tables supported by all Windows versions right from MS-Dos, while a Dynamic disk storage has the feature that basic disks do not have, such as support for volumes spanning multiple disks, RAID 1 or RAID 5 disk arrays.</div>
<div><br />
The downside of use Dynamic storage is that once the disk converted to Dynamic and being partitioned and used it cannot be converted back to Basic without losing data, as the Convert to Basic Disk option will be greyed out once it’s been used.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: I would suggest you to back up all your data before taking any steps.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps to convert Dynamic partition into basic partition:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open the computer management console. To open this console, click the "Start" button, then "Control Panel," then double-click the "Administrative Tools" icon, and then double-click "Computer Management."<br />
2. Click the "Disk Management" heading in the leftmost pane of the Computer Management window.<br />
3. Right click all volumes contained in the dynamic disk you wish to convert.<br />
4. Select "Delete" from the context menu that appears.<br />
5. Right click the disk after all volumes are deleted and select "Convert to basic disk." This will convert the disk and set it up for normal usage.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Disclaimer</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;You can delete recovery and driver partition. But you will not be able to roll back if you delete recovery partition to your previous Operating system. Windows 10 is still a beta version and can have certain
 problems which can cause data loss in your system and you may want to roll back to your previous Operating System.</div>
<div><br />
You can install any operating system only in a Basic Partition. So to install Windows 10 Basic partition is needed. So I would suggest you to back up all your data’s and then convert Dynamic partitions into Basic partitions and then install Windows 10.</div>

    <title>Build 15007 broke down my SD card reader - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnmapache  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 15007 broke down my SD card reader</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,<br />
<br />
I have a Toshiba Tablet WT310 with the insider preview installed.<br />
<br />
After updating to the build 15007 the SD card reader stopped working (yellow triangle at the device manager), using other drivers or trying to reinstall it doesnt worked.<br />
<br />
Thats when I tried to use the built in troubleshooter, the USB troubleshooter said it fixed the problem and the yellow triangle disappeared from the device, but still couldn't read SD cards, so maybe a reboot is needed.<br />
<br />
Tried to reboot and got the green screen of death, stating problems at the boot disk.<br />
<br />
Opened the startup repair and, after trying all the other options, resetted the PC. (now I cant go back to the previous compilation anymore)<br />
<br />
With a brand new resetted PC I tried, 1st thing, the USB hardware troubleshooter again, again it broke down my PC and a new reset was needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the PC reset made impossible to came back to the previous build, I switched to the "fast track" to see if a newer build would fix the problem, 15014 have the same problem.<br />
<br />
Any idea on how to fix it without having to reinstall the RTM build?<br />
Any idea how a hardware troubleshooter can break windows?<br />
<br />
Many Thanks,</p>
<p>Igor</p>

            <p>The most recent Fast Rings builds seem to have brought on a variety of issues that result in a bugcheck or blue/green screen crash of Windows. My 2007 laptop crashes with a blue screen if I use the specific video driver it needs (the most recent driver is
 from 2009) so I have to use the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter driver instead, which does not properly match the screen's full native&nbsp;resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes using an old, outdated driver may work, if the most current driver does not. Maybe Toshiba has some other old driver versions available that you could try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is software from Nirsoft called BlueScreenView which can help to pinpoint the cause of the bluescreen crash.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Ensure that you report the details in Feedback Hub, or Microsoft may never know that this is an issue.</p>

The Green Screen happens everytime after the USB troubleshooter reboot, its pretty easy to reproduce.</p>

Also put my system on the fast track to see if a newer beuid would solve it, updated, and still not working.<br />
Looks like I have to live without a SD card reader or goes back to a previous build (probably need to format for that)</p>

                    <div>I have used Word for Mac for decades but I have a serious problem now with last &nbsp;upgrade. When I am trying &nbsp;to convert PAGES &nbsp;into DOCX equations have become non-editable. Moreover it has poor resolution and
 even shifted outside a line so a text can not be presented for publishing. I am using newest software</div>
<div><br />

Word for Mac v.16.16

<div>I red you TechNote 103 "Equations have become non-editable pictures in Microsoft Word”; it is simply not working. Do you have any ideas how your product can work?</div>

<p>OLE is not a Mac technology, so that's not part of this. The equation editors in the two programs use different math languages. From your experience, it sounds like the conversion is too complex to proceed automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using MathML for equations in Pages, this page has a tip for how to copy it over to Word using NotePad. On a Mac, TextEdit in plain text mode may be able to do the same thing:&nbsp;<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25430775/copy-mathml-into-word-to-use-as-equation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Copy
 MathML into Word to use as equation</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using LaTeX for equations in Pages, this pages has tips about importing onto Word:&nbsp;<a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/25223/embed-latex-math-equations-into-microsoft-word" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Embed LaTeX math equations
 into Microsoft Word</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have MathType installed in macOS and are using that in Pages, the MathType site has some useful pages about converting:&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.wiris.com/en/mathtype/mathtype_desktop/support_notices/tn43" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Transferring
 Documents Between Windows and macOS</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't find much specifically about converting Pages equations directly to Word, so you might have to work out a method yourself by searching and testing suggestions.</p>

            Sounds like you have some corrupted files, suggest that you do a clean install or at least a reset this PC, as I posted in your other posting your system CPU is at the bottom end of the spec's, it might work better with the 32 bit version.

<h2>            How do I organize my bookmarks as in my PDF&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm using office 2010. As far as I understand, the bookmarks option in Word 2010&nbsp; is very limited, because of the length of the bookmark, and the fact I can't type spaces or numbers..so perhaps I'm not using the right tool?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a very long Word document, which contains many chapters, and I would like to bookmark each and every chapter, and to be able to access them on the left sidebar. What is the best way to do it?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance</p>

<p>I don't know about bookmarks, but the "old school" way to do what you are asking for is to use the built in heading styles and document map.</p>
<p>You can change the look of the default heading styles as much as you want to do what you want. Then apply the heading styles, say Heading 1 for Chapter, and heading 2 ... for lower subdivisions in the chapter you would like to break it up into.</p>
<p>Turn on the document map, sorry it is now called the "Navigation Pain" (sic, pane): View tab / Show group / Navigation Pane check box</p>
<p>NOTE: the "old" short cut &lt;alt&gt; &lt;V&gt; &lt;D&gt; still works to toggle it on and off. Or you can start right away by using the "Right", ie the new combo &lt;ALT&gt; &lt;W&gt; &lt;K&gt; (even though it makes absolutely no logical sense ... why W for view when there is no other tab
 names starting with "V" ?&nbsp; And why "K" for "Navigation Pane"? I want some of what whoever assigned these shortcuts was "on" when they did it, Wheeeeee!</p>
<p>In the 2010 Navigation Pane there is the "Find" input box at the top and 3 mini tab buttons below it. What used to be call the "Document Map" is the leftmost tab, "Browse the headings in your document". (The middle one is a "snapshot" view of the document
 pages, and the rightmost one highlights snips of text around each "Find" hit)</p>
<p>In the Document map view you will see a text version of your headings. If the heading has sub headings there is a little grey triangle to the left of the heading text. You can click on this triangle to expand and compress that headings below that heading
 level.</p>
<p>The right context menu displays some heading related editing options. Check them out. The bottom three are relevant to this discussion: Expand All, Compress All (down to Heading 1's only), and Show Heading Levels ddl. The Show Heading Levels is handy if
 you only want to see headings down to a specified level, ie H1 &amp; H2, or H1 H2 H3 &amp; H4.</p>
<p>2010 has also introduced a new feature. Just like Outline view, in the navigation pane you can click on a heading and drag it, and it's associated text, to a new location in the doc.</p>

            <p>I'm unsure why you marked my previous post as the answer when, apparently, it did not solve the issue.&nbsp; Please unmark it and, in the future, mark as answers only those posts that actually solve your problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best way to handle junk mail on Outlook.com is to change your junk filter to "Exclusive".&nbsp; Click the Options gear, then "More mail settings".&nbsp; Click the link labeled "Filters and reporting" in the right-hand column.&nbsp; Select the radio button labeled "Exclusive".&nbsp;
 Click Save.&nbsp; Subsequently, only messages from people in your Contacts or Safe Sender list will be delivered to your Inbox.&nbsp; Periodically (every few days), review the subjects and senders of messages in your Junk folder.&nbsp; If you see any that should have been
 delivered to Inbox (false positives), then mark them as "not junk" and put the senders (or the senders' domains) in your Safe Sender list.&nbsp; From then on, those messages will make it to the Inbox.&nbsp; After a while, the vast majority of good messages will be delivered
 properly and the vast majority of junk will arrive in the Junk folder, to be automatically deleted after ten days if you don't empty the folder sooner.</p>

<h2>            Appointments&#47;Contacts and Memory&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, this is a silly question but one that is bothering me.&nbsp; I am using Windows Mobile for the first time and have a phone with a microSD card.&nbsp; When I make appointments or contacts, however, instead of saving them to the microSD card it goes
 to (I guess) the built-in RAM of the phone.&nbsp; As a result, I've basically filled up my RAM and can't make more appointments!&nbsp; I don't like downloading and then deleting my appointments to my computer -- is that the only way I can free up more memory, or is
 there a way to get it saved to the microSD card?&nbsp; Thanks for the help!</p>

            Unfortunately, it is not possible to save your appointments or contacts to the storage card. I advise you reduce the number of contacts and appointments on your phone and keep the most important ones.

<p>It is highly unlikely that your contacts and appoinments would take up all ur ram.&nbsp; I have imate jamin using wm5 and i have a bout 800 contancts and my callender spans over a years info, the file size is only about 7mb.&nbsp; Whilst that is big,
 it wil not be filling up ur storage memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>are you leaving a lot of programes/file running in the background?&nbsp; If not, have you installed a lot of programs into ur fones storage in stead of sd card?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I always close every program/file if im not using them to keep things running at max speed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>try that as i think that is ur problem.</p>

            Just as a general rule of thumb Sprintman, I would reccomend always installing any program to your memory card.&nbsp; For the most part, virtually all software will run nicely from memory cards.&nbsp; The few that need to be installed in main memory will indicate
 that to you.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Let me assist you with your concern. We understand that your&nbsp;emails went missing&nbsp;after being upgraded to Outlook.com and you want to recover those emails.&nbsp;I would like to inform you that b<span>y
 upgrading to Outlook.com, you are only upgrading the user interface of Hotmail to the new user interface; hence all your emails should still stay in your Inbox.</span></span></p>

<p>You can use the recover deleted / lost email feature to bring back your lost emails. However, our system can only restore recently deleted emails and emails that are still available on our server. There is no guarantee that the messages that you are looking

<p>hi ashish,</p>
<p>if we are syncing the onedrive for business library, we will have a green check mark on the file icon as below:<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6c1ea745-c404-4ef0-877a-8c2d3aad0e63" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d6c1ea745-c404-4ef0-877a-8c2d3aad0e63" /></a></p>
<p>from the screenshot you provided, i noticed that the onedrive for business library are not syncing. therefore, could you check if you are syncing it via right clicking on the cloud icon<strong> &gt; stop syncing a folder</strong>. all the libraries which are
 syncing display in the window.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=552c028e-4550-4011-b241-a60f874f8d2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d552c028e-4550-4011-b241-a60f874f8d2d" /></a><br />

<p>if you can’t find the onedrive for business library, please follow the steps to resync it:</p>
<p>1. back up all these files in this problematic onedrive for business local folder.&nbsp;
<br />
2. go to the onedrive for business library in the browser. <br />
3. click <strong>sync &gt; sync now</strong>.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e7b6494c-0f96-412f-a35c-2096a162d438" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3de7b6494c-0f96-412f-a35c-2096a162d438" /></a><br />
4. after syncing, check if a new onedrive for business folder is created. if so, please copy the files you back up in the old folder to this new onedrive for business folder.
<br />
5. go to the onedrive for business site to check if the files are synced to it.</p>
<p>if it persists, could you share with us more detailed steps or some screenshots about the menu after right clicking the cloud icon?</p>
<p>to upload images, please click <strong>use rich formatting</strong> when replying to the post, then click the
<strong>insert/edit media</strong> icon.</p>

<p>Hi Shirley</p>
<p>Thanks for response. </p>
<p>I rechecked it and realized that it is misunderstanding from my side. Desktop folder is not in OneDrive folder, it is out of this folder, thne obviously how this can be synced? Then I put desktop folder and Bingo, Desktop folder is also synced.</p>
<p>But my problem if user makes any changes in riginal desktop folder which is out of OneDrive folder, every time user has to copy the updated or new file to copy in to OneDrive folder then it will sync. Is there any way that External desktop folder information
 can automatically synced?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Hi Avian,</p>
<p>Thanks for your clarification.</p>
<p>If you would like to sync the desktop folder so that the changes you make in the desktop can be synced into the site, I would explain that from my experience, no customer tried doing this and it is also not recommanded. Your understanding is highly appreciated.</p>
