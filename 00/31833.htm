    <title>HTML5 &#60;video&#62; and &#60;audio&#62; support demo for - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HTML5 &#60;video&#62; and &#60;audio&#62; support demo for mult-browsers including IE9. How does it view&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>After much work, I now have a page at http://www.cwdjr.net/html5/layoutDemoWithIEfix3.html that uses valid html5 code and gives examples of use of &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; of html5 for media only. In the first place, most browsers now will offer only one or two
 house video or audio formats, and these are not the same in various browsers. Thus you have to provide at least 3 format choices for video and audio for all 7 of the browsers that could use &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt;. I use a Microsoft conditional script from Google
 to force IE 7 &amp; 8 to render much more of html5, but alas this script will not force them to render &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt;. Thus you must have IE9 beta to see the &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; media on IE. You can check what of html5 each browser supports by going to http://www.html5test.com
 on the browser being checked.</p>
<p>Starting with IE9 beta, the audio is a snap because it can use mp3. However video was a lot of trouble. You need a special mp4 file called&nbsp; AVC with codec H264, and an encoder for this format is not always easy to find free or at a low price. There is/was
 a low cost encoder that will do this, but I have forgotten the name of it. I used the Sony Pro Vegas 9 to encode, set up as:</p>
<p>Source: 5 Mbps .mpg (mpeg2)<br />
Vegas Pro 9.0<br />
Saved as type MainConcept AVC/AAC (.mp4), width 640, height 640, frame rate 29.97,<br />
field order - upper field first, pixel aspct ratio - 1.0, reference frames 2,<br />
variable bit rate - 2 pass, maximum bps -&nbsp; 2000000, average bps - 768000, YUV;<br />
audio - 128 Kbps, stereo AAC</p>
<p>The video was good, but when you use it on a html page using the html5 &lt;video&gt; the video becomes distorted. See http://www.cwdjr.net/html5/IE9_640x480MP4avcH264.png . You can take this mp4 and run it through Apple's pay Pro QT player to easily convert it
 to .mov&nbsp; hinted to stream for use on a Safari browser. However when you view on Safari for Windows, the video is distorted, but in a different way than for the mp4 on IE9 beta. See&nbsp; the screen shot at http://www.cwdjr.net/html5/Safari640x480mov.png . It turns
 out that this problem on both IE beta and Safari is resolved by making the video field a square, in this case 640x640. Then the video is not distorted, but there are blank strips at the top and bottom of the video field.</p>
<p>The Chrome browser had a big black box just to the left of the video. However this problem is solved easily by changing a little css to make the background-color black for the division containing the video.</p>
<p>Since valid conventional code for media also works on html5, I intend to use it for media until html5 is final and has a few less bugs. Although there are $ and political reasons why some large companies are pushing html5 so much, it is not ready for prime
 time for me. If you want IE users to view video, you are going to also have to to provide a conventional video path until most IE7 and 8 browsers are gone, or Google or someone else can provide an expanded script to force IE7 and 8 to support &lt;video&gt;.</p>

<p>Thanks for the link. It concerns&nbsp; problems in installing IE9 beta, of which there can be several, so many may find this reference useful. Fortunately I had no problems installing IE9 beta on Vista 64-bit with all updates on which I had IE8 installed.</p>
<p>On Sept. 15 Microsoft released notes for developers for IE9 beta, which of course are subject to revision since IE9 still is in beta. These notes include a section on video and audio. See http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/ff468705.aspx . For those of us
 writing web pages that we wish to be viewed well by most popular browsers, these details help a lot when considering what the new IE9 may require.</p>

See my new video page at http://www.cwdjr.net/html5/layoutDemoWithIEfix4.html .Since I have only&nbsp; IE9 beta on my newer computer with 64 bit Vista and IE7 on my old computer with XP, I would like a report on how the new page views on IE8. I would like to know
 if you are offered&nbsp; another type of video (flash) there as it is on IE7 if you have flash installed. The top version of Windows 7 sells for over US$300, and other versions are less expensive, but far from cheap. I doubt if many will upgrade from XP to Windows7
 just so they can install IE9 to be able to view html5 properly, especially since most of the more popular browsers are free and can be used on XP, and some have supported much of html5 for some time.<br />

I was sent a screen capture that confirms that IE8 is responding the same as IE7. The moral of this story is that if you write xhtml5 pages now, you must consider how several recent versions of various web browsers will respond. This is especially true for
 media. And the situation can change rapidly, as some browsers have frequent updates that often concern html5 support among other things.<br />

<h2>            local account set up</h2>
                    <p>It's almost impossible to set up a local account when installing windows 8.1, personally I prefer to have different&nbsp;password to logon to my computer and&nbsp;different password for different accounts, especially if they have details of my bank or credit cards.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there a good&nbsp;reason for Microsoft doing this, or is it that they just want complete control over us?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Sloop57,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font><font color="#000000">It is sad to hear about your dissatisfaction.
<span>&nbsp;</span>The reason to have a Microsoft Account can be explained in few points here:</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font>·</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><font><font>Microsoft account is the glue that holds together so many useful features of the new Windows.

<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font>·</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><font><font>Without one, you won't be able to, for example, get new apps from the Windows Store, automatically sync your settings and documents between PCs,
</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font>·</font><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><font><font>You won’t be able to back up your photos to the cloud so you can get to them from anywhere, or see all your contacts from multiple email and social networking

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>There is much more benefits to have a Microsoft account associated, it is just integration of all the services from Microsoft by once medium.

<p>Now the answer you are looking for: </p>
<ul>
<li>There is not limitation or compulsion for using a Microsoft account. you can use local account&nbsp;and change it any time.</li><li>you can use a local account as you were doing on legacy Windows like Windows 7, Vista, XP.</li></ul>

<p>&nbsp; The problem is that I had to install the update before I found that there was no "obvious" way to set up windows 8.1 without setting up with a Microsoft account login. Even when trying to find out how to&nbsp;reset to local login, I found the answer from other
 sources before I found the answer from Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;As I said, I prefer to logon to my computer with one password and have other passwords&nbsp;to access other all accounts, after all we are encouraged to have different passwords for every site we subscribe to.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I do not have a problem with having a Microsoft account, I think the fact that I posted to the community proves that I have an account. I manage to logon to my computer using local&nbsp;account and then into my email to read your reply, I logged onto the community
 to reply to you, and,&nbsp;I have downloaded an app from the store. So it does work perfectly with local account login.</p>
<p><br />

<p>&nbsp;Regards</p>

            I have a similar question, but just want to change the user name shown on my computer.&nbsp; I went online and it changed my name at the outlook.com email address, but it didn't change on my computer.&nbsp;Where did the link go from windows 8.0 that allowed you
 to change your user name?&nbsp; Seems ridiculous that it has been removed as an option.&nbsp; Now I show one name online and a different name on my computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also want to use some features of having a Microsoft account, but not all.&nbsp; If I set up a local account,
 will it let me copy everything over from my Microsoft account?&nbsp; I'm afraid it will delete everything that took a long time to set up.

<h2>            Fallout 4 DLC broken</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, so I went to start my latest Fallout 4 save but it stated that the Vault tec workshop DLC was missing so stuff would be missing from my save. I checked and the DLC was installed. I tried a previous save to see if it was just corrupt but it was the
 same for all saves and all character profiles. I restarted my xbox and cleared the cache and restarted it again and still the same. I deleted the vault tec dlc and went to re-download it but now its stating that I need to buy it again even though I have purchased
 the season pass???? I cannot remember if you needed to download the season pass or not but I cannot download it anyway and cannot locate it on my xbox to delete it. so now I cannot play my save and cannot download the vault tec workshop again unless I pay
 for it when I have already paid for the season pass and had it downloaded previously! anyone got any advice??</p>

<p>I have same Fallout Vault Tec/ Season Pass issue, but have read mention of a fix applied the needs to "propogate" through to eventually fix issue. I just wish to mention along with losing ownership of the dlc, my ownership of the base game is also gone.
 Might be an unnoticed detail not dealt w/ in fix. Pre-purchased game if. that's of any help.</p>
<p>So, back to waiting for trickle down patch from a cloud.</p>

I have three email addresses or entities.&nbsp; I exported all the email files (Inbox and Sent) in&nbsp;my first Identity&nbsp;to an empty folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am following the backup and restore WLM procedure, but I wanted to make sure I could restore these emails before I deleted
 them.&nbsp; So&nbsp;I deleted all the emails in the new folder except one, and then I followed the restore procedure, but the restored email went into my Storage folder instead of back in my first edentity (Inbox).&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this normal?&nbsp; How can I direct the restored files
 to go back into the same identity file?&nbsp; Thanks, Tomc</p>

 change anything significantly??&nbsp; Please let me know how I can send you this log file.&nbsp; Thanks, Tomc<br />

            Thanks Ron.&nbsp; I'll go ahead and proceed with the uinstall and reinstall of WLM with the prosumption that it will work fine when I restore&nbsp;all the&nbsp;files that I had&nbsp;backed upped.&nbsp; So the way I understand it, if I back up each identity separately, then I could
 restore each identity separately or should I back up all folders and restore all folders together??&nbsp; Thanks Tomc

<h2>            My HP Stream&#39;s C drive is full and I just bought it.  What can I do to free up space&#63;</h2>
                    <p>hello. My HP Stream's C drive is full and I just bought it.&nbsp; It has a 32 GB SSD.&nbsp; When I purchased it there was 14 GB free space on my C drive now there is only 3GB 5 weeks later.&nbsp; I have already bought an SD card that has all my docs videos pictures music
 on it so none of that stuff is on my C drive. When I go to the window where I can delete programs it says at the bottom that the programs I have add up to only 2.78 GB.&nbsp; My question is what the frig&nbsp; is taking up so much space on my C drive? My computer is
 now incredibly slow now and I don't know what to do.&nbsp;What can I do to free up space??</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do you think I could return it to HP?</p>
<p>ANY advice would be sooooooooo appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the wireless is not seeing any networks you might try doing a hard reset on the console. &nbsp;Although, it could be possible that the wireless card is malfunctioning. &nbsp;Hold the power button on the console for 10 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.
 &nbsp;Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes. &nbsp;Plug the power cord back in and restart the console. &nbsp; Once it is back up and operational test for results.</p>

</p><p>I purchased a Windows 8.1 retail version disc quite some time ago , but I can not find the box it came in that had the oem product key number on it ( I think that is correct ! ) .</p>
<p>The PC that it was loaded onto is now in heaven , I have a old ish laptop that I wanted to put the W8.1 onto , but it is asking for a product key , so the question is how can I find the product key from my OEM Microsoft Windows 8.1 instalation disc !!! .</p>

<p><em>I purchased a Windows 8.1 <strong>retail</strong> version disc quite some time ago , but I can not find the box it came in that had the

</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<em>so the question is <strong>how can I find the product key from my OEM</strong> Microsoft Windows 8.1 instalation disc !!! .</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Retail License is not OEM</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a Retail License.</p>
<p>There is an OEM preinstalled License on a Dell, HP, etc computer that you buy with Windows already&nbsp;installed by Dell, HP, etc..</p>
<p>There is an OEM System Builders License.</p>
<p>__________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Laptop/Computer came with the Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc) , that Product Key that came with the Laptop/Computer is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines)&nbsp;is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above&nbsp;rule also applies to OEM System Builders Licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Retail Operating System&nbsp;License, that you buy and install yourself, are allowed to be transferred to another machine.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;Retail Licenses can also only be installed on one machine at any particular time.</p>
<p>___________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was OEM you can't transfer it anyway.</p>
<p>And if it was Retail, but the computer you installed the Retail license on has been scrapped and you lost the Product key, you will have to buy a new License.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Bill</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply , quote "And if it was Retail, but the computer you installed the Retail license on has been scrapped and you lost the Product key, you will have to buy a new License " unquote .</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I purchased the Windows 8.1 disc , so why can I not register it to another pc , the previous pc is not around now so it will not be registering with Microsoft has still being used ! .</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I purchased the retail version I was not told I could not transfer it to another pcif the pc it was on packed up&nbsp; , just because I mislade the packaging it should not mean I can not use it again ,</p>

</p><p>You have got a DVD, but you haven't got the Product Key.</p>

</p><p>When you bought that 8.1&nbsp;package it would have come with a Product Key you would have used to install/activate on the scrapped machine.

            <p>Don't know how the previous response was supposed to help with the question you asked, so here's a proper answer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no Media Centre included in Windows 10, so you will need 3rd party software such as the OpenSource application VLC Player, which is available via the Microsoft Store.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p>This happened to me, as well as a few other people on the forums.&nbsp; I got suggestions to swtich browsers, and/or clean your cookies.&nbsp; This worked for&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;people, but not for me.&nbsp; If it doesn't work for&nbsp;you, you could&nbsp;go to InPrivate mode on your browser
 by pressing "CTRL", "Shift", and "P" at the same time.&nbsp; This worked for me.</p>

<h2>            Event viewer flooded with TabletServicePen errors</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having issues with some weird game behavior, to the point that I started snooping around in Windows "Event Viewer."&nbsp; To my puzzlement, I found the "Windows Logs&gt;Applications" screen absolutely flooded with something called "TabletServicePen" errors.&nbsp;
 It looks as though every time I boot up or log in to my user account, Windows10 tries to load this service and is failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is TabletServicePen, exactly, and how can I go about telling Windows10 to stop uselessly trying to load it?&nbsp; I don't have a tablet or a pen, so it simply isn't needed for anything, and I'd like to see all these errors gone from my system.&nbsp; Makes it
 tough to find the errors I'm looking for without having to filter through all of these stupid things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any thoughts,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Karl</p>

            Hey Karl,
<br />
<br />There was an issue in one of the latest hotfixes issued by Microsoft. I realize that you do not use a pen or stylus, but I think this coincides with this known issue.
<br />
<br />Follow these steps here:
<br />
<br />From Start, search for cmd
<br />Right-click Command Prompt in the search results, and choose Run as administrator
<br />At the command prompt, type or copy/paste:
<br />reg add HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Pen /v LegacyPenInteractionModel /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
<br />Press Enter
<br />
<br />Let me know if this error is persisting after this, or if it disappears. Good luck.       
        </p>

<p>Hi Ethan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did as you suggested (cut &amp; paste... don't trust either my reading or typing that much :)&nbsp; &nbsp;).&nbsp; I still have multiple instances of TabletServicePen errors; they appear to occur (when sorted by date/time) in clumps of eight or so instances, then there's
 a bunch of informational entries, then another string of TabletServicePen errors, and so on.&nbsp; Today's entries in Event Viewer&gt;Windows Logs&gt;Applications shows seven "clumps" of TabletServicePen errors, as well as several Dell app errors (SupportAssistAgent),
 but I'm not concerned with these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something else to try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hello David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>run startup repair from Windows recovery environment
</strong>and check if it helps. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have installation media for Windows, start (or boot) your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>", do
 so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, click "<strong>Repair your computer</strong>"
 to start the <strong>Windows recovery environment.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the <strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>, on the "<strong>Choose an option</strong>" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" and then click "<strong>Startup Repair</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may <strong>download Windows 10 files and create an installation media.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer this article:<br />

<h2>            Turn10 Studios Customer Service...a Must Read&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello fellow gamers im going to post my most recent encounter with a company that doesnt care about its people, and im going to explain why and hopefully you all can give me some feedback as to why?</p>

<p>ok about 3 weeks ago they held a facebook challenge, its is where you race around track and then go and vote for the car you would like, rare car also known as inicorn car.</p>
<p>I attempted to do the race 3 times, with no success my disc would freeze, so i replaced the disc the next day and then DL it to the HD which i usually do with all my games anyways but for some reason i didnt with forza horizon.</p>
<p>Anyhow So I went back to do the race and it had closed 2 hours before i could replace my disc, Im a 36 yr old father of 4 and I understand customer service, I am an ambassador for Xbox live as well.</p>
<p>So I decided id vote for my car and send them an explanation as to why I couldnt complete the lap, this was on Feb 21st, I send 1 via email copy and pasted and sent one through the forums they have setup at www.forzamotorsport.net and waited.......after
 a week no one had responded to my email nor did any one respond to my message sent via Forums, So I printed and copy and pasted a letter and sent a physical letter to there po box in Redmond WA.</p>
<p>I live in washington as well and usually takes about 2 bussiness days to get to anywhere in the state, Im sure they get alot of mail so i figured since there website says they read all there mail, that they for surely got to my letter within 3 weeks??</p>
<p>Nope nothing I have sent messages over xboxlive and have done everything possible to reach this company.</p>
<p>Some may say that Im worrtied about something silly who cares its just a car. right?</p>
<p>Nah to me its all about the amount of money I have paid playing forza qith all the downloads and the support they give to the people that support them, very careless and neglectful.</p>
<p>situation number 2: they had game night from 11am- 1pm on february 26th, I joined the session and most of the DEV's that where there were playing forza 4 which is cool tried to get in game with them no luck and then no unicorn car as well.</p>
<p>They false advertise and when they say they read everything dont believe them I have lost all faith in Turn10 studios and this will be the last forza I purchase along with any other game that has turn10 studios involved, love the game but customer service
 is crucial in order to keep people using xboxlive and supporting them, I volunteer alot of my time toward ambassador these guys are getting paid good to do there job and in this situation they failed bigtime.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this and if you have any comments please feel free id love some feedback.</p>

                    <p>So, I bought Forza Horizon 3 Ultimate Edition on amazon, and Redeemed it on my Xbox Account, now, when I went to the PC store I can't download the Forza Horizon 3 Ultimate Edition game. It says that I own it, but I can't redeem the code as it has already
 been redeemed, and when i click manage it just pops the games tab on me, and it doesn't even show up there. I don't know what to do, as I have spent 80 Pounds on this and I feel robbed.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5f3af42-cb29-4571-9396-c6f315c31cdc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5f3af42-cb29-4571-9396-c6f315c31cdc" /></a></p>

            What appears when you&nbsp;try to download it from another PC/Xbox-One?&nbsp;<br />
Also, try to reset the cache data from the Windows Store, with the settings app &gt;&nbsp;System &gt; Apps &gt;&nbsp;Store &gt; Advanced options (If you're on the last build of Windows Insider, the path is settings app &gt; Apps &gt; Store &gt; Advance Options).

            <p>As div89 said, try resetting the store cache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is not preferable, but if you still cannot get it working, you can always open the Xbox app on your PC and stream directly from your Xbox. I am guessing that this is not your issue, but it could also be caused by your computer not meeting the
 system requirements.</p>

<p>So whether you be a CLAN looking to have some fun and friendly banter while competing in a league format, or a Free Agent looking for follow like-minded gamers to join and and have some fun then TheWGL is the place to be.&nbsp; Just post a free agents app in
 the forums I’m sure many clans will come calling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Leagues</span></p>
<p>We run a 5 separate leagues for MW3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mixed Modes – 6v6. Demolition, Domination, CTF, Hardcore Kill Confirmed, HC S&amp;D.&nbsp; These modes cycle each week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Half Health S&amp;D – 6v6. This game mode is based around Counter Strike S&amp;D with the famous Knife Round to start things off.&nbsp; First to 8, attack 4 times, then defend 4 times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HC S&amp;D – 6v6.&nbsp; Based on the normal HC S&amp;D you find in public lobbies, best of 3 maps, round switch every round.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Core 4v4&nbsp; - This league was set up for the more competitive minded community in theWGL.&nbsp; Based on the current Decerto Ruleset.&nbsp; CTF – S&amp;D – CTF.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HC 4v4 – Very similar to the Core format but obviously everything is HC.&nbsp; Demolition – HQ – S&amp;D&nbsp; on a rotating basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">REQUIREMENTS</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you do have some requirements for clans who wish to enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to have a working website in order for clans to contact you to arrange fixtures and also to stop fly by night clans who sign up and disappear after 1 loss and spoil it for the rest of the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will also need to meet the current roster requirements for the leagues that you wish to enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the most important one. Have fun and show respect to fellow like minded Gamers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if this sounds like something that could interest you or your clan then don’t be scared sign up to the WGL and we may see you on the Battlefield.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We also run GOW 3 leagues, BF3 leagues and Fifa Singles, Clubs, and Dream team.</p>

            No.&nbsp; Find the installer "program" for Virtual CD-Rom control panel v2.0.1.1 and with the mouse, right click on this file.&nbsp; You should see a "menu" with "Run as Administrator..." as an option.&nbsp; This should install a "pre-Windows 7 / Vista" application as

            <p>Has Microsoft actually finally decided to turn the "save apps to" feature back on?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless something drastic has changed in the last day or so, this person is not experiencing an issue, but rather running into a feature that Microsoft arbitrarily decided to turn off until further notice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AS POSTED ON ANOTHER THREAD ON THIS ISSUE:</p>
<div>
<p>(We have actually made the decision to postpone the apps on SD functionality to a later release. While I know this feature excited many of us, we didn't feel like it was ready for prime time. Our goal is to delight users with everything that we build, and
 we truly feel that that is what will happen once we have fully built&nbsp;our vision for this feature.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Suggesting that running system file checker will fix the issue is like IT telling you to reboot the system for the 27th time... It won't fix the issue, but hey at least it looks like we are trying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to either restore this feature or announce that they have disabled it... Sending people on random Snipe Hunts to try and fix it is just plain wrong. (Not to mention infuriating if you have installed your OS to a small SSD with the expectation
 that the "feature" would remain available)</p>

            <p>Apologies, if this wasn't Microsoft.&nbsp; I understand&nbsp;if the person replying was attempting to describe what was understood to be the case.&nbsp; I meant the frustrating comment be directed at Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is so frustrating when people answer based on a question that was not asked.&nbsp; The person asked why the feature was turned off for the hard drive.&nbsp; The answer provided was, "We have actually made the decision to postpone the apps on SD functionality to
 a later release."&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>He asked about HDD not SD.&nbsp; My PC has an SSD C: drive. It is relatively small and its main function is to hold the OS in order for a fast bootup.&nbsp; The Hard drive is not external and therefore not removable.&nbsp; Any app installed from the Store installs on the
 small SSD C: drive.&nbsp; This is not good. For this scenario the feature should be enabled.&nbsp; Or is the feature not enabled for everyone?&nbsp; Thank you</p>

    <title>Windows Hello not working ASUS Laptom - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vanessabosworth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Hello not working ASUS Laptom</h2>
                    <p>I have an ASUS Q534UXK Touchscreen laptop.&nbsp; After the latest updates to Windows 10, Windows Hello stopped working.</p>
<p>I found my camera driver and updated.&nbsp; Windows Hello started working. This morning it again stopped recognizing me.&nbsp; Tried to have facial recognition run again, my image is there, but it keeps telling me to center my image and never completes recognition
 process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I removed facial recognition and tried to set-up again. (Restarts in-between)&nbsp; Still doing the same thing.&nbsp; It seems that the infrared sensors are not activating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried researching on this site, but the and dvice to Re-install Windows Hello Driver. I have searched everywhere in my device manager and found nothing that resembles "Windows Hello Driver."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Samsung WPD 2.14.9.0 update broke something - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlzm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Samsung WPD 2.14.9.0 update broke something</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 8.1 Professional.&nbsp; I have a Samsung Galaxy S5 phone.&nbsp; Everything worked fine until January 25th, 2019, when I permitted Windows Update to install&nbsp;Samsung WPD 2.14.9.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, my phone doesn't show up as a connected device when I connect it via any USB 3 port on my computer.&nbsp; Nothing happens.&nbsp; When I try to connect via a USB 2 port, I get the following error message:<br />
<br />
The last USB device you connected to this computer malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it.<br />
<br />
Under Computer management/Universal Serial bus controllers, there is a flagged error entry for "Unknown USB device (Device descriptor request failed)."<br />
Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems (Code 43).<br />
<br />
The driver for the phone has been installed but, just to make sure it was not corrupted somehow, I have downloaded it and installed it again in the directory C:\Program Files\Samsung\USB Drivers.<br />
<br />
I tried to go to Control Panel / Programs / Programs and Features / Installed UPdates and uninstall this update, but IT IS NOT LISTED.<br />
<br />
So... Windows Update broke my functioning Samsung connection and I can't undo it.<br />
<br />
Some help, anyone?<br />
<br />
I don't really expect any, since I had a similar problem with a Samsung device on a Windows 8.1 machine last year, posted here for help and got nothing.&nbsp; Link to that thread in reply.</p>
