<h2>            Undeliverable emails on outlook app</h2>
                    My emails I send from my iPhone via the outlook app are suddenly bouncing back as undeliverable with an error message saying they are triggering their junk email filters. I can send them on my iPad and laptop but not the iPhone. It happens with some and
 not others. Can anyone help in plain English as not tech savvie and after chatting with numerous Microsoft helplines am getting nowhere. Extremely frustrating.&nbsp;

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now the Delete icon is the furthest to the left, forcing me to X out then save.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I look at customizing the ribbon there is a Save As command available but not a Save &amp; Close</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any idea how to get a Save &amp; Close on the ribbon?</span></p>

            Hi GeorgeInCT,
<br />
<br />I'm Craig, an Independent Advisor and I'll do my best to help you today. Let's try with the following procedure:
<br />
<br />Right Click on the Ribbon and choose "Customize the Ribbon". Make sure you have the NEW APPOINTMENT / EVENT window open.
<br />
<br />On the right side of this next screen, click on APPOINTMENT and at the bottom select NEW GROUP. 
<br />
<br />Rename the NEW GROUP to (SAVENCLOSE).   
<br />
<br />Then highlight the new group name and use the arrows on the right to move it to the top of the menu. 
<br />
<br />Make sure the new group name is highlighted first, then on the middle column under CHOOSE COMMAND FROM: use the drop down and SELECT ALL COMMANDS.   
<br />
<br />Scroll down until you see SAVE &amp; CLOSE, highlight and click ADD in the middle of the window. 
<br />
<br />This will add the SAVE &amp; CLOSE to the new group SAVENCLOSE.   
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Once this is complete, click OK at the bottom and it will be restored.   
<br />
<br />
<br />If this no work use the shortcut:
<br /> "Save and close (except in Mail view) Alt+S"
<br />

<p>It has been god awful and it is driving me nuts. This is obvious, garbage spam that should be easily filtered into junk mail. I am normally not very bothered by spam, but whatever list I am currently on is bombarding me with 7-10 emails in a row at the top
 of every hour and my phone goes nuts with notifications for each one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The normal suggestions that the staff normally make here are especially useless. Sweeping and Inbox rules just don't work. I get the same messages over and over again. The Sender NAMES are always the same. Mark Cuban on Forbes, Peruvian Brew, Choice Home
 Warranty, J Daniels etc. But the actual Sender email addresses are random spoofed addresses *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. And the domains on the spoofed addresses are phony too. Almost all of the Sweep and inbox rules only use the actual address,
 not the name. I have not been able to find any way to set up a filter based only on Sender Name. Filtering by the message content is also useless. The spams contain no text. They are usually 2 or 3 jpegs with the ad, business and unsubscribe info on them.
 Every one of these emails has the same street address listed in the unsubscribe jpeg, 910 West Van Buren Street #209 Chicago Il 60607, but since it is a jpeg and not text, I can't filter it out. The only rules that are somewhat helpful are filtering by subject
 line, but the wording varies slightly from email to email so I can't use exact quotes of previous spam messages, just keywords. And I have to pray the keywords don't intersect with the subject lines of my legitimate email. Not ideal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am pretty fed up already and if this continues on like this, I am giving up on Outlook.com altogether. I will just set up a gmail account and forward all my outlook.com mail there and let them filter it properly.</p>

<p>Doc NJ, thank you for your detailed reply. This is exactly what is happening to me and the email topics you mentioned are identical to what I'm getting which means these have to be machines that Outlook is not capable of detecting and blocking.&nbsp; Something
 either has to have changed on Outlooks side to start allowing these to penetrate our junk inbox or the technology on the creeps side is too smart for Outlook.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wish Outlook would acknowledge this and say they are looking into it rather than tell the user to set up filters that will do nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting really important emails that i actually need to read from first time senders that wind up in junk totally as designed so i know the filers are working in that respect. Issue is they get lost between 20 garbage addresses and occasionally missed
 by me which is starting to be a big problem. I understand that spam will get through time to time but the amount of emials that are getting through indicates something is wrong with their back end and they need to address it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm with you, if this doesn't stop sooner or later I'm done with Outlook.</p>

<p>Try to keep up, genius. We are complaining about obvious garbage spam making it directly into our Inbox instead of being properly filtered into the Junk Email folder. No one is expecting to eliminate the Spam altogether, we just don't want it in our Inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After posting here last night, I decided to go ahead and set up a new Gmail account and give it a try. It was surprisingly easy and painless. I didn't have to change any settings on my Outlook.com account and it now works exactly as I thought it would. When
 I checked it this morning the new Gmail account had 8 emails in the Inbox and 50 emails in the Spam folder. Gmail did incorrectly move 2 valid messages to Spam, but I marked them both as Not Spam and they should go directly to my Inbox in the future. The Outlook.com
 account had 38 messages in the Inbox and 27 in the Junk Email folder. 8 Spam messages were detected by the Gmail Server-side spam filters and deleted before ever being downloaded to Gmail. I am very pleased with the work around so far and most importantly,
 my phone has stopped blowing up with notifications every 10 minutes with multiple spam emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone else wants to give it a try, just create the new Gmail account, go to Settings&gt;Accounts and Import&gt;Check mail from other Accounts and choose the GMAILIFY option. It is similar to the Connected Accounts feature from Outlook.com. You don't have to
 set up any forwarding or anything. Once you enter your Outlook address and log into it, the new Gmail account downloads all of your messages from Outlook automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My outlook account has been in use for over 10 years now. I have multiple aliases and connected accounts as well as my xbox and Windows credentials. Dumping Outlook altogether is simply not an option for me. This work around seems to be a solution I can
 live with for now. Hopefully, Microsoft can figure out what has changed from even a month ago when things were generally fine. Anyway, hope this helps.</p>

<p>It is extremely frustrating Amy. Hopefully Microsoft can get a handle on this problem soon. The funny thing is, I remember these exact spam emails with the same Senders and Subject Lines being correctly filtered to Junk Email in the past. Something changed
 in the past 2 weeks. I guess the spammer figured out what they were filtering and modified it. Now it is up to Microsoft to respond to those changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my other reply, I did set up a new Gmail account as a temporary fix and it seems to be working for now. Google flags the messages that Microsoft is missing and correctly puts them in the Spam folder, so it can be done. Now we just have to be patient,
 I guess. Good luck.</p>

                    <p>This isn't so much a question as an issue, but I couldn't find anything that seemed to address the problems my computer is having. &nbsp;The most recent Windows 10 updated somehow erased my audio driver and now it won't let me reinstall it. &nbsp;Most Windows apps
 won't launch now either, including the calculator, the insider hub and feedback apps, the Windows store, and more. &nbsp;My machine is a Dell Inspiron i15RV-953BLK. &nbsp;Thanks!<br />

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To resolve this issue we need some information. Let us know the following:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What is the browser through which you are trying to login to your Microsoft Account?
</span></li><li><span>What is the edition of Office 365? Is it Office 365 Home or Office 365 Personal?
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the meantime you may try the following step:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to try activating Office 365 while working in InPrivate browsing mode in Internet Explorer (IE).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2811180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2811180</span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Now try launching activating Office 365 and check if it works. If it still doesn’t work then check the Internet Connection
</span>(Wired or Wireless)? If you are using a wireless connection then you may try to hardwire the connection to the computer/laptop. Once this is done try following the same steps as above once again and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope the above steps help you to resolve the issue. Let us know the result.

    <title>Formatting Data Labels in powerpoint Office 365 ProPlus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erryrieszu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Formatting Data Labels in powerpoint Office 365 ProPlus</h2>
                    <p>In a my previous version of powerpoint, I would format the data labels by clicking on the data label, click on the box with the"+", and it would ask me where to place the data label:&nbsp; "outside top", "inside top", "inside bottom", "middle".&nbsp; With the 365
 ProPlus version of powerpoint, these options are not available.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get those options back, when there are several bar graphs it is a great way to make sure everyone is looking at the correct label by the position of the data, not just color alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            What happens when Outlook 2007 expires&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My Cingular 8525 came with a trial of Outlook 2007, I believe. I already had an older version of Outlook, and a fairly new version of Outlook Express. Activesync is working fine, but what happens when Outlook 2007 expires, or does it?&nbsp; Should I&nbsp;uninstall
 Outlook 2007, so it will sync with one of the others, or will that not work?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

I would think that everyone that get the "invalid number" check the number and try to call several times before they ask for help. Does this mean that you don't have the solution to this issue?

<h2>            One Drive for Business - Credentials needed, please enter credentials</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have OneDrive for Business which currently cant sync 13 items because it says "Please enter your credentials" yet gives you no option to do this, if you click on "Open item" it just goes to the sharepoint site where all the files are located, from
 here I can open the files with no problems. I've tried Repairs, reboots and have also started from scratch but still no joy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!!!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Justin</p>

<p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>For this issue, could you try the following suggestions and check the outcome?</p>
<p>1. Clear the Windows credentials. Go to the&nbsp;<b>Control panel</b>-&gt; search&nbsp;<b>Credential Manager</b>&nbsp;in search box-&gt;click&nbsp;<b>Mange Windows credentials</b>&nbsp;-&gt;then delete all credentials under&nbsp;<b>Generic Credentials.</b></p>
<p>2. Clear the cache of OneDrive for Business sync from using the fix it tool in this KB:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627</a></p>
<p>If the issue persists, do this: go to <a href="https://portal.office.com/account/#installs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 portal Software download page </a>to deactivate the Office that was installed on your PC-&gt; then completely uninstall the Office by referring to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2013-Office-2016-or-Office-365-from-a-Windows-computer-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>-&gt; reboot the machine-&gt; open Word or Excel to activate the Office using your Office 365 work or school account. Then start syncing files using OneDrive for Business sync app then check the outcome.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, the next step I will do is to collect some logs from you to further investigate the issue.</p>
<p>We appreciate your patience and efforts. </p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Iris</p>

<p>I have tried every suggestion on this form including the fix cache tool, reinstalling office 365 and removing the credentials plus other suggestions but nothing works.</p>
<p>I have spent nearly a year putting up with bugs like this in OneDrive for Business and I have to say how you trust Microsoft software with your important business documents when they can't even get the own sync tool to work properly.</p>
<p>There are thousands of people all having the same problem around the world. The impacts on their organisations and business would be enormous if they committed to using Onedrive as their primary cloud storage service.</p>
<p>This is beyond a joke and Microsoft really need to resolve these sync issues with Onedrive once and for all.</p>
<p>I have used Dropbox, Owncloud and countless other file sync services and have never had the kinds of problems we have experienced with Onedrive for business.
</p>
<p>So sort it out Microsoft for gods sake!!</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">Hi !</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I have the same problem as many people here: a few weeks ago, this pop up," Are you sure you want to leave this page........" appeared in IE11&nbsp;on all my laptops and desktops, some running good ol'&nbsp;Windows7 and some running Windows
 10 latest update (and still IE11 as I don't care for Edge).</p>
<p class="contentStandard">This happens in varied situations, always when I want to leave something that is not terminated. Examples:</p>
<p class="contentStandard">- When I want to stop writing an email (in Gmail) and save it&nbsp;as a draft; it tells me my draft has been modified (which is false)</p>
<p class="contentStandard">-When I view a You Tube video or any video and want to view another one before having viewed or listened to&nbsp;the totality of the video. It gives me a good reason to stay on this page !! Always sensible reasons !</p>
<p class="contentStandard">And in many other occasions.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">All the solutions offered don't work and make me mad: I cannot turn off Active Scripting because that will turn Java off and Gmail NEEDS Java to function normally. Also, if I have add-ons , it is because I NEED these add-ons &nbsp;(and
 in the case of my Win7 computers, they have remained the same for years !)</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I could be made to believe that this is due to the latest Windows 10 update, the Falls Creator Update, it appeared just a few weeks later, and as all my computers are connected together, this would explain why it happens in Win7
 too (where I've never had this problem)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anyone with a bright mind help me? Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi Stephanie,<br />
<br />
The message you are referring to is designed to inform you that you're leaving a webpage even your task is not yet completed.<br />

As per checking, the options to resolve the issue is by disabling add-ons. If you prefer not deleting the add-ons, we suggest resetting the<strong> Internet Explorer</strong>. Refer to this

<br />
<strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>When resetting Internet Explorer, all previous settings will disappear and it cannot be recovered. We recommend backing up your homepage settings before resetting this browser.</em><br />

<h2>            Office 365 for University PROBLEMS&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to request help since I am having a number of problems using Word 2013, Excel 2013 and PowerPoint 2013.</p>
<p>I have had this programs for about a year now and installed it when I had Windows 8.1 Pro in my laptop. They all worked perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Now, I have upgraded my Windows OS to Windows 10 and started using the Office 365 programs a week after updating, prior to my university work. Now for my key problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Word 2013&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It always displays this message every time I launch it: "Word could not create the work file. Check the temp environment variable."</p>
<p>Also, opening saved Word files also notifies me with this error with some having a&nbsp;<em>repair
</em>notification.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Excel 2013</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to create a <em>Blank Workbook</em>, this message always pops up: "Microsoft Excel cannot open or save any more documents because there is not enough available memory or disk space."</p>
<p>I don't understand why this message always pops up with my disk space still heaps plenty. I also can't create normal spreadsheet documents using this main template but I can use other templates available to download.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">PowerPoint 2013</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only use the main<em> Blank Presentation template&nbsp;</em>in creating presentations. I cannot create other templates available to download. It always notifies me to&nbsp;<em>repair&nbsp;</em>the other templates when I try to use them and it always fails to repair</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Solutions that I have tried:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Both Quick Repair and Online Repair with the Office 365 program in Control Panel &gt; Programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I've tried changing the registry using Doug Robins solution: </p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp-word/office-apps-could-not-create-the-work-file-check/dc3e458e-9e63-4516-9eb1-3ea08015f2d7</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not fixed the&nbsp;<strong>Problems </strong>after trying these two solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help/advice me on what else I can do to fix these Problems. Any help will be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guilbert</p>

            <p>Try additional points from below. Leave whatever you have already tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Repair the office installation - https://support.office.com/en-NZ/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b<br />
<br />
2. Follow the instructions given on this page to make older programs compatible with Windows 10 - http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows&nbsp;<br />
<br />
3. Review the response of E. Harter at following link where sharing has solved the problem - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-excel/2010-office-docs-all-open-as-read-only-after/31a64e6b-60e1-4d51-a897-9f8958660859<br />
<br />
4. Install latest Windows 10 cumulative update KB3081438 (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3081438) which is released on 14-Aug-15. If you want to download standalone KB3081438 then you can download from http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Thanks.aspx?id=140.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
5. Turn off Hey Cortana and reboot your computer (useful particularly if Excel performance is slow).<br />
<br />
6. Right click on your Excel shortcut &gt; Properties, In Compatibility tab, uncheck all options. Start the Excel again.<br />
<br />
7. Right click on your Excel shortcut &gt; Run as Administrator<br />
<br />

<br />
10. Read the response of Try*3 &nbsp;(http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-excel/windows-10-excel-files-changed-to-read-only/cba3c358-21b5-472d-b5e2-f690f1b0a49b). He has provided a link which also has solutions for problems.<br />
<br />
11. If above don't, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license keys ready before
 you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.

            <p>Hi Vijay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to use the programs without any errors or problems using this method.</p>
<p>I presume that this might be related to my laptop having administrator/user problems as I have also found out recently from the past few days that I cannot create
<strong>other users.&nbsp;</strong>i.e., I can't log in with the other users account even though I have authorized them already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>I've similarly been having this problem with my University Office 365 suite. Solved it the same way by just making windows always load it up as administrator. I don't think I have any user issues though. However I do have a different account for the Office
 365 subscription as its my University account in comparison to my standard microsoft account. Could this be the reason and its just a bug?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers for the solution anyway to this as it was really annoying me :)</p>

    <title>OneDrive and MS Office 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> houston west  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive and MS Office 2016</h2>
                    <p>I decided to go from Windows 7 to 10 for home laptop about a year ago. I then purchased Office 2016 outright.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dislike OneDrive and have never "intentionally" used it to store docs. It slows down everything I do in Word and Excel so I decided to delete One Drive entirely thinking it would be ignored in the File Manager. I took all steps necessary to delete OneDrive
 from my laptop, but it also deleted my Office 2016 program entirely (ugh!).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to restore to a prior time to no avail. Should I reinstall Office 2016 by itself, or will it not function without OneDrive on the OS? Or will I have to reinstall Windows 10 to restore OneDrive before reinstalling Office 2016?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate help with this. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>OneDrive is totally gone from my computer, but somehow Office 2016 was connected to it (possibly because Office 2016 was downloaded while I was operating under Windows 10 w/OneDrive?)&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I understand that I can reinstall Office 2016, but have decided that I dislike Windows 10 and OneDrive enough that I will try to return to Windows 7 before reinstalling Office 2016. &nbsp;</p>

 Prints fine in normal internet modes and Microsoft Edge.

<p>Anyway, in Zune, you can set it not to sync your photos from the phone. You can find it in settings.

            <p>Hello gmt3010:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issue you are having with pictures and the Zune software.&nbsp; If you find pictures transferred to the computer that you do not want on the computer you can delete them via the Zune software by going to your collection
 and selecting pictures.&nbsp; Click the picture you want to delete and then right click to get the option to delete.&nbsp; If you want to delete multiple pictures, click one picture, click and hold ctrl on your keyboard and click the subsequent pictures you would like
 to select.&nbsp; Right click one of the pictures and select delete and all pictures selected will be deleted from your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want newly taken pictures to not sync to your computer you will need to set up a guest sync relationship.&nbsp; The steps to do this can be found here,

            I've done that. It won't delete multiple. HEY when someone has done everything and is in so frustrated you want to SCREAM.
<br />
<br />
One has to delete photo by photo, which is arduous given there are so many. I set up the Zune software, downloaded and it installed. This took all my photos music etc. without having a section saying "settings" or an intro on how to use it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I spent plenty enough time trying to learn it, way too much for my needs which is sync music as a playlist and get a ringtone I would enjoy. I ended up finding someone set up an xbox name and I never heard of such a thing&nbsp; being done I thought my password
 was logging me into someone else's account. I had to delete my credit card, was quite concerned.<br />
<br />
Last, I bought points but in honesty, couldn't find any real ringtones, it was all tones done by other artists. I bought better ringtones from the tmobile site, which doesn't sell them anymore.
<br />
<br />
All I want to do is find software that will sync my music to my phone as a playlist, so I can listen to it as an mp3 player, and sync a ringtone or two. When I finally figured out you had to use certain way to put your music in, not just transferring it, and
 I finally got a long playlist in with my music, it would not play my most recently purchased songs. I couldn't believe I got his message about a zune "ticket" -- I paid for every single not of music in my computer, either through paying for download or buying
 the CD. Why in the world would Zune block me from listening to my music? I was all the more enraged with this after going through all that I thought finally I have my music in and then can' listen to it. I used zune to delete everything from my phone, then
 uninstalled it.<br />
<br />
I am open to any suggestions of other software. I really don't see how to download and install zune without it just doing what it wants.<br />
thanks for your help in answering and I USE CAPS WHEN I WANT TO JUST SCREAM AND I WANTED TO SCREAM AFTER THIS.<br />

            <p>I am no stranger to screaming myself. It is just that, reading all caps is difficult.&nbsp; There are times when non-English folks post questions in their native tongue. I go to the extent of using bing translator. Translate what they have said. Find the technical
 answer. Translate it back to their native language and then post it. Despite me being a guy who goes to such extents to answer&nbsp;a question, even I was put off by the all caps :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, lets' tackle your issues then. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>One has to delete photo by photo, which is arduous given there are so many. I set up the Zune software, downloaded and it installed. This took all my photos music etc. without having a section saying "settings" or an intro on how to use it.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Photo management on the phone is pathetic. I will be the first to admit that. On the very first 'Zune connect', your phone will sync everything. Let it finish. Then, you can go to settings. you can change the sync behaviour to NOT SYNC your photos. That
 way, going forward, it won't sync. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once everything has been synced, it is easy to manage photos. At the top you will have QUICKPLAY, COLLECTION and PHONE. Select PHONE. Here go to PICTURES. Here, you can select multiple pictures. Then delete them. Easy!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;I ended up finding someone set up an xbox name and I never heard of such a thing&nbsp; being done
</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows phone is connected to Microsoft services. One of the microsoft services is XBOX. XBOX has a direct line to your phone. It is too bad, no one told you about this.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>, it would not play my most recently purchased songs</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About this. Well, I don't have a solution. The only way to put songs to your phone is through Zune. If Zune won't detect your songs, it is pretty much the end of line :(</p>

            <p>Hello gmt3010:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the follow up.&nbsp; I want to start by saying I understand you frustration and hope I can help.&nbsp; There is going to be no alternative to syncing content to and from your computer to your phone.&nbsp; The Zune software is it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to delete pictures from your phone, that does have to be done one at a time.&nbsp; If you are trying to delete them from the computer, what it looks like your original post inquires about, that can be done in&nbsp;bulk.&nbsp; I will provide the steps for you
 again as I have done this multiple times on multiple computers and verified it works like a charm.</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the zune software.</li><li>Click collection.</li><li>Select pictures.</li><li>Select MY PICTURES/SAVED PICTURES or the name of the album that houses the pictures.</li><li>Click one picture.</li><li>Press and hold the shift or ctrl button on your keyboard.</li><li>Click the other pictures you want deleted from the computer.</li><li>You will then get a confirmation pop up of the number of pictures that will be deleted.
</li><li>The pictures will now be deleted from the monitored folder in which Zune is pulling these photos.&nbsp; You can verify this by going to the software and click settings &gt; software &gt; collection.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>In regards to your music issues.&nbsp; By Zune ticket I have to assume you mean the Music Pass.&nbsp; This is something you should only need if you have music that was downloaded with the pass.&nbsp; I believe you mentioned in one of your multiple posts that you did have
 this at one point.&nbsp; There is a chance that copies that will not play on your phone were files previously downloaded with the pass.&nbsp; I have a couple suggestions to try and get this working the way you want.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to your computer and enter your MY MUSIC section or your music library.</li><li>Look for a folder titled subscription.</li><li>Delete this folder.</li><li>Close the zune software and the relaunch the software.</li></ul>
<p>This should ensure that there is no music on this computer that is related to the music pass.&nbsp; To verify this do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Zune software.</li><li>Click collection.</li><li>Select music.</li><li>From the right side of the software sort by songs.</li><li>Now look above the song titles for a drop down arrow that allows you to select sort options.</li><li>You should have the following options; All content, DRM free content, protected content and Zune Music Pass content.</li><li>Sort by Zune Music Pass content first and verify that no songs are showing here.&nbsp; If any are, I would suggest you right click that track and delete it.</li><li>I would also suggest that if you create a playlist in the Zune software you use this sort filter to ensure you are building your list out of "DRM free" content.</li></ul>
<p>Now that we have covered that and should have purged some music that will cause trouble on the phone let's see if we can get the phone to a clean slate.&nbsp; Connect the phone to your notebook.&nbsp; When you connect this you should see the word phone appear to the
 right of the word marketplace.&nbsp; Click this and you should be on the summary page for you connected phone.&nbsp; If a sync starts you do not want, click the stop sync button.&nbsp; Once you are here do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If there is any music, pictures or videos on your phone that you want to keep and do not have on the PC do the following,
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/zune/software/syncing-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/zune/software/syncing-media</a>.&nbsp; We are going to erase all the media on your phone in a moment so please make sure anything needed is backed up.</li><li>Once you are comfortable that nothing will be lost, go to the Zune software and click settings &gt; phone &gt; sync options &gt; erase all content.&nbsp; Once that has finished, click the forget this phone button.</li><li>At this time, disconnect the phone from your computer and then reconnect the phone to your computer.</li><li>Shortly after the phone is connected you should get a pop up that allows you to name the phone, then checks for updates and finally allows you to set the sync options.&nbsp; Proceed through the first two steps.&nbsp; When you get to the sync options section, set
 everything to manual and click OK.</li><li>Once this is done you should be back to the summary page that shows a picture of your phone.&nbsp; If not, click phone &gt; summary.&nbsp;
</li><li>If a sync does start it is likely pictures being synced to the phone.&nbsp; If you do not want this to happen at this time, click the stop sync button.</li></ul>
<p>Now, we should be in position to sync music to the phone.&nbsp; Below you will find the steps to get music synced to your phone:</p>
<ul>
<li>With the phone connected to the computer and the Zune software open, click on collection.</li><li>I would suggest you sort your collection by either song or by playlist.</li><li>When sorting by song be sure you have selected only DRM free music.&nbsp; </li><li>At this point you should see a black phone icon in the bottom left corner.&nbsp; </li><li>Click a song and drag that song to the icon.</li><li>If you want to do this in bulk, click the first song in your collection &gt; click ctrl + a &gt; all songs should now be highlighted &gt; grab the list and drag it to the phone icon.</li><li>If you have created a playlist, sort by playlist and simply grab and drag the name of the playlist to the phone icon.</li></ul>
<p>Finally, I am passing along this document that further discusses ringtones, adding ringtones and creating your own ringtones,
<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp7/start/create-ringtones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp7/start/create-ringtones</a>.&nbsp; If you do continue to have issues with getting your music to play, provide the following details:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the songs that will not play, what is the exact error message and any code you receive?</li><li>For the song or songs that will not play, what is the file format of those songs?&nbsp; To verify this, go to the Zune software and sort your collection by song.&nbsp; Find the song that is giving you an error and right click that track.&nbsp; Select properties from the
 drop down menu.&nbsp; Review the details of the track and take note of the "media type" listed.</li><li>While you are reviewing the properties, let us know what you see in the DRM section as well.</li></ul>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns we can assist you with.</p>

            The problem is not the phone. It is Zune. I don't want all my photos and every bit of audio and video in the software. I don't know why when I installed it it took it upon itself to suck everyhign up. I had a real difficult time trying to not have put
 into my phone audio that isn't songs, is business recordings, no music, and yet, while in the software zune software, cannot delete them.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;There is no mass deleting. I know how to highlight batches of items and delete. You just can't do that. The phone never had more than a&nbsp; photo or two of my practicing with it. To delete the music that went in wrong, as storage (who would do that with a phone?)
 not a playlist, i had to get the software to delete everything from my phone.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I don't want this Zune software to set itself up, and take up every single thing in my notebook because I do not intend for that to be used in my phone. I can't fathom why microsoft would create software with so little flexibility or give people so little
 control over it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Why ever woudl this Zune software also think that MY songs I paid for are not my songs that i get a message telling me I need a zune ticket?<br />
The error message I get for the songs that do not play is to the effect it goes to a screen that says "okay" or something and then it says I need a Zune ticket. That tells me, it's trying to tell me it wantsm oney from me for me to play MY paid for songs.<br />
I already am gnashing my teeth paying for two ringtones, buying "points" for bogus ringtones they aren't even by the original artist. I have fabulous ringtones in my other phones I just am going to ask tmobile to use their transfer device. Maybe it will work
 that way.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;But using this as an mp3 player without having to carry everythig around? or to get my photos out of the zune software? Why does it do that? It should ask, or say, If you want to add photos from your files or something.<br />
This is bad software, zune, Not well conceived or windows though it could get away with shaking ever more money out of people.<br />

            <p>Hello Gina:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point the steps have been provided to set the software up to not see the content on your phone.&nbsp; As myself and Jay described you can indeed delete multiple pictures from the software.&nbsp; If you are still having issues with this I suggest you make some
 adjustments to the monitored folders the Zune software is pulling content from.&nbsp; If the content is not see in the Zune software it will not be transferred to the phone.&nbsp; More information on doing this is described here,
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/music-and-video/zune/software/manage-your-collection#3870543469f94dcfb4d2983a005552f3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/en-US/music-and-video/zune/software/manage-your-collection#3870543469f94dcfb4d2983a005552f3</a>.&nbsp; The section titled "Add media from your computer to your collection" will describe how to set specific folders to be looked at by Zune.&nbsp;
 If you have content on the computer you do not want seen by Zune, put it in a location not being looked at by Zune.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand you are not a fan of the Zune software but that is the only software that can be used to move content to and from your phone.&nbsp; There have been specific steps provided to try and correct the issues you are having or so we can explain what is
 happening.&nbsp; Without specific details it is very difficult to assist you.&nbsp; Please review my previous post and go through the steps outlined and provide the details requested.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We hope that you are able to make some progress and can get the software to work for you enough to enjoy your phone.</p>

            Of course why in the world do you assume it's a problem with my folders?<br />
<br />
My music is under&nbsp; my library, which is split between documents, music, video and something else I can't recall.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;then my other audio is under a totally different place, it is transferred to my notebook via a completely different software, a sony software because I use a sony recorder.<br />
<br />
It is NOT my folder. Zune does not discriminate. It just takes everythign. When I saw that, I thought OMG, how is it pulling this up?
<br />
<br />
You assume the issues are the phone. It is probably both, mostly Zune. <br />
<br />
Zune has exhausted me, but I am going to re-download a fresh zune, install, and try to see if it will set up the way it would best work for me, using your info above.<br />
<br />
thanks for trying to help, but I still think that windows phones need not be forced to use zune. I rather liked the ease of windows media player, personally.<br />

<h2>            Why won&#39;t my W8 phone connect to Zune&#63;</h2>
                    I just bought a Nokia Lumia 520, and I love it! But I want some music on it, and I can't seem to get it working.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a W7 laptop, and I downloaded Zune. My phone connects to the computer just fine, but it won't show up on Zune. I tried all the usual fixes, like changing USB ports, restarting phone/laptop, troubleshooting etc, but nothing has worked. I then came
 across a forum saying that I'm better off using the Windows Phone app, but I can't download it because my computer is W7. I'm really pissed off and I don't know what to do - does this mean I can't transfer files from my laptop to my phone?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Sorry if the answer is obvious - this is my first Windows phone and I'm new to all of the available software and apps.</div>

            Congrats on your new phone.<br />
<br />
The Zune software was only for Windows Phone 7 devices. The 520 runs Windows Phone 8.<br />
<br />
The Windows Phone sync app can be found <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/how-to/wp8/windows-phone-app-for-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> and runs on both Windows 7 and 8, so you're good. But honestly? Don't bother with it unless you want to sync with iTunes. It's a really, really bad app. Like "what were they thinking" bad without the backing of iTunes.<br />
<br />
Your phone shows up as a device in Windows Explorer, so you can just copy/paste files onto it that way. Drop music in the music folder. Videos in the videos folder. Etc.<br />

<p>
</p><p>My AIO computer has 1 hard drive. The "E" partition is the Data drive. I replaced the hard drive on my computer after saving the "E" partition to an external USB drive. Before the replacement my documents folder was "My Documents". The O/S remained Windows

<p>
</p><p>After installing all of my software I found that the Word Mailing Templates don't link to the data sources (excel workbooks).&nbsp; I also have some Word documents containing linked Excel worksheet cells and they also are not working. &nbsp;Are there ways to fix this?</p>

<br />
<br />Double click personal
<br />
<br />Change that value data to E:\My Documents then click OK
<br />
<br />Close the Registry Editor and restart your PC
<br />
<br />You may need to manually move your data from E:\Documents to E:\My Documents
<br />
<br />Then, your file references should be correct again . . .

<h2>            transfer custom labels to a new phone</h2>
                    I am trying to move my contacts from a Nokia E50 to a E71. I have made extensive use of edited (custom) labels in the contacts.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to transfer labels in contacts from one phone to the other?

            I have tried and not got the desired results to<br />
<br />
back-up E50 to PC -&gt; restore data to E71<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
transfer data via bluetooth (switch / sync)<br />
<br />
Any other ideas? For sure I must not be the only one who is using the "edit label" feature extensively.

            While searching for a solution to my predicament I found a program called Contacts Transfer that is supposed to be doing a full-featured transfer of contacts from phone to phone here:<br />
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately it did not install on neither my E50 not my E71.<br />
<br />
Any other suggestions for the transfer of contacts including the edited labels?

<p>I have started to use custom labels. I wish there was something that could carry my custom labels from nokia to google address book and vice versa. MfE and RoadSync failed me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really wonder why these softwares can not respect each other :(</p>

<h2>            Is it possible to change the video orientation from vertical to horizontal on the recorded Skype call&#63;</h2>
                    When viewing a recorded Skype call the video is set in a vertical orientation and only leaves enough room for one person. I ultimately need said recorded call to be in a horizontal orientation so it can fit two people on one side and one on the other in
 view.&nbsp;

</p><p>So id just about finished writing an assignment and had saved it for the billionth time, and closed word. I then remembered i hadnt emailed it to myself (which i do to avoid any chance of losing it) so i open up word again to find it has reverted my file
 to the save from the 1st of may.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive checked the auto save folder, and the temp files but no joy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else i can do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note i printed my version from the 2nd of may but the file on my mac is from the day before that!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone could tell me how to fix this and why this has happened id be eternally grateful. I use word 2011 for mac</p>
<p>

            Hi DanHarrison1986,<br />
<br />
If your missing document was saved on local, the previous version of the document might not be recovered.
<br />
<br />
If it was saved in SharePoint, please refer to below article to get more information. Hope it will work.<br />

<h2>            Lost notes OneNote 365 on Mac and IOS devices</h2>
                    Hello!&nbsp; I use OneNote from Office 365 on several Macs, my iPhone and iPad.&nbsp; Yesterday on my iPad I moved notes from one section in a notebook to 4 new sections I created there - and now those notes have mostly disappeared, though a few appear as titles
 but say 'content not available yet' or just open with no content visible at all.&nbsp; I've opened this notebook on my iMac, iPad, iPhone and OneNote Online straight from my OneDrive folder, and they all look the same - the pages are missing.&nbsp; Nor do I see anything
 in 'deleted pages.'&nbsp; And I don't see 'Info' on the drop-down file menu, so I don't see any backups.&nbsp; Is there a way to recover all these lost notes?&nbsp; THANK YOU!&nbsp;&nbsp;
