<h2>            &#34;can&#39;t display this page&#34; Windows 10 IE 11</h2>
                    <p>I've been reading message boards until my eyes are crossed but I haven't been able to come close to a solution to this aggravating problem.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; I'm running Windows 10 and using IE 11.&nbsp; I keep getting stuck reading posts about Windows Vista or 7 or 8
 and/or IE 10 and most of those posts are dated 2012 or 2013 (and guess what?&nbsp; They didn't get solutions to their issues either!&nbsp; Amazing!)&nbsp; My use of my computer is restricted to 15 or 20 minute sessions because when I web surf, I constantly get shut off by
 a message "Can't display this page".&nbsp; It happens randomly and constantly, whether I'm looking at my bank statement or browsing on eBay or flipping through Wikipedia.&nbsp; It doesn't matter what I'm doing.&nbsp; After 15 minutes, it's inevitable; I click on a link and
 I get nowhere, the message displays, and I have to X out, go back to my desktop, and&nbsp; I'm unable to access that webpage again.&nbsp; Help.&nbsp;

            Thank you for responding to my request for help.&nbsp; I have taken NO troubleshooting steps to remedy this glitch because I have been unable to find any mention of this condition when one is running Windows 10 and Internet Explorer 11.&nbsp; I've found references
 to this "This page can't be displayed" condition from 2011 and 2012 for people running Windows Vista or Windows 7 but that's it -- nothing about Windows 10.&nbsp; By the way, I find it odd that my glitch says "This page
 I went to the "Fix-It" page referenced in the link above, but I saw no specific mention of my 'can't be displayed' problem.&nbsp; I took a chance and chose 'Find and fix problems with Internet Explorer performance' but got the result 'Troubleshooting couldn't identify
 the problem'.&nbsp; By the way, I couldn't help but notice that this "Fix It" page is dated August 2011.&nbsp; My problems with this being dumped off the internet started when I started running Windows 10 about a year ago.

</p><p>I'm looking to create a report where if in one column (e.g. A1) a value is inputted, then automatically, a value will appear in column B1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>for example:</p>

    <title>home.aspx crashing IE 11 on multiple sites, &#34;Wiki&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerry.weeks  say:</h3>
<h2>            home.aspx crashing IE 11 on multiple sites, &#34;Wiki&#34; implied&#63; Sharepoint update &#40;perhaps this weekend - 25th - 27th June 2016&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have multiple SharePoint sites, some sub sites, some separate., all hosted on 365 online (corporate account)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until last Friday everything worked fine.</p>
<p>Today I go into one of the sites, and it cashes IE11 with the "A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you&nbsp;if a solution is available." &lt;Debug&gt; &lt;Close Program&gt;. Close program re-launches the page
 load attempt, the error repeats, and eventually - a quick press on &lt;Cancel&gt; allows me to get to the grab below.</p>
<p>I have fixed this on several sites, by going straight to "Settings" - pasting #/_layouts/15/settings.aspx into the URL, then rolling back "home.aspx" to its earliest versions (slightly annoying).
</p>
<p>One thin common on all the rollbacks, is if I can get to prior to a "Wiki" addition, the page works, on sites where the "Wiki" was present from scratch, I am presumably going to have to edit home.aspx / community.aspx, / about.aspx etc (all the pages use
 the Wiki it seems).</p>
<p>Has something just occurred to alter the "Wiki" feature of SharePoint sites? Most of the impacted pages haven't been edited for weeks, even months!</p>
<p>&lt;update, the error debugged in VS gives: <strong><em>"Unhandled exception at 0x6FE9468B (ucrtbase.dll) in iexplore.exe: Fatal program exit requested."&gt;</em></strong></p>
<p>And the next step of debug gives some sort of missing: &lt;<em><strong>"ucrtbase.pdb"</strong></em>&gt;</p>

            <p>Hi Ran,</p>
<p>Here is the working page, and the version history.</p>
<p>Wiki is present&nbsp;on all these, so not sure why the more recent (still old) ones failed.</p>
<p>Other sites where there is no Wiki in "version" have not failed.</p>
<p>And sites where I have only 1 version - with a Wiki, I haven't so far been able to fix (I will need to use SharePoint designer I suspect!).</p>
<p>I'll clear out my cache now and get back to you.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>But a relatively new custom (but very simple) site front page crashes. (image attached below)</p>
<p>In this instance the site has some text, as little navigation as possible, and 2 lists with associated text.</p>
<p>One list has security parameters so users can only see their data. I am owner and a member of Site Collection admin on the site. It works in Edge, but crashes in IE11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am beginning to think it might be IE on my machine which is a Windows 10 machine, I have done very few changes to IE, the only one really was to get Fiddler to work -for&nbsp;your request, but&nbsp;I'll try running in safe mode and report back.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 16.25 - High cpu usage using IMAP Gmail accounts</h2>
                    <p>Outlook is idling at 50-100% on my mid-2014 MBP 15". I found that it was because of IMAP is constantly syncing. I removed my 3 IMAP Gmail accounts and the problem went away. It's now only spiking to 25-40% from time to time while idling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone here with the same issue? I ended up using Mail app for Gmail and Outlook for Exchange.</p>

    <title>Lost tons of old e-mails from my &#34;Outlook&#34; Hotmail&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lost tons of old e-mails from my &#34;Outlook&#34; Hotmail&#39;s &#34;Inbox&#34;, and maybe folders as well&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My Hotmail account that had been recently (a month or 2 ago) switched to Outlook appears to have suddenly "lost" or deleted up to 100 older e-mails from my Inbox dating back to as long as a year or more ago.&nbsp; They were there yesterday &amp; now they're gone.&nbsp;
 I'm not certain, but it appears&nbsp;I may have also similarly "lost" older e-mails that I had moved into folders.&nbsp; I can't seem to find any from 2011 or before in most cases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm CERTAIN I had these in my Inbox thru yesterday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas what may have happened, where they are, and if they are recoverable?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ONLY activity I performed which MAY have some&nbsp;impact is that I just upgraded/downloaded/installed Office 2010 Professional to my PC, but had some issues with it not updating some applications from the Trial version to the full-blown purchased version.&nbsp;
 A tech helped straighten things out, after which I went into each individual Application and selected FILE - - HELP&nbsp;&nbsp; to see what version was installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had never worked in Outlook before, so I had to set it up.&nbsp; I linked it to the Hotmail account in question,
 but just enough to be able to open it &amp; do the "File - -&nbsp; Help" status check &amp; then exit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did that have anything to do with it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help in advance!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes your Emailes are recoverable and this is a bit of a mistory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you would like to recover your emailes then you would have to speak with a someone from Microsoft, However they are busy and it could take some time for them to get to you.
</p>
<p>If you have set up a new account and a linked account then it may take up to 48 hours for all of your messages and settings to be linked. If this is not the case then you may have deleated them by mistake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this has helped you answere your Question. If yu wait for a moderator they will be able to help you in more depth with your problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>As far as I know, I didn't do anything more than click on Outlook to run &amp; was told I must first set it up.&nbsp; It then asked for my e-mail account &amp; password.&nbsp; Then the initial Outlook screen (with calendar, workspace, message area, etc - - I'm not certain,
 as I have never actually used/set-up Outlook) came up.&nbsp; All I did after that was go to FILE &amp; HELP, verify I had the right version &amp; then closed Outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't actually do anything in there beyond that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office Outlook 2010 will access&nbsp;Hotmail in one of two ways.&nbsp; You must either configure a POP account or install the Outlook Hotmail Connector and create an account with that.&nbsp; Which did you do?&nbsp; Describe the process you used&nbsp;exactly, step-by-step.&nbsp; Open
 Outlook, click File&gt;Account Settings&gt;Account Settings and examine the Hotmail account in the Email tab.&nbsp; What type of account is it?</p>

            <p>I had 2 e-mail accounts in Hotmail.&nbsp; One was "upgraded" not too long ago to an "Outlook"-format hotmail account.&nbsp; That's the one I'm having trouble with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I went into Office 2010 to verify the versions of each Application, a notice popped-up when trying to open the Outlook application for the first time that I needed to set it up. I chose the option to download/install/use the "Connector".&nbsp; It asked which
 account I wanted it "connected" to, and I indicated the existing account in question.&nbsp; Once that was complete, I was able to open the Outlook 2010 application itself&nbsp;&amp; select "FILE==&gt;HELP" to see what version I had.&nbsp; Then I immediately closed the file &amp; application
 &amp; was out of it.&nbsp; That's all I did.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How would that result in my losing most or all my older e-mails, but not my recent ones, both&nbsp;of which were in my "Inbox"?</p>

            I am not familiar yet with Office Outlook to know what I need to do, but would Office Outlook have just some or all of my older e-mails, same as my "Hotmail" outlook?

            <p><span>Until recently, when I wanted to check out my e-mails on-line, I went to the Hotmail website &amp; logged-in. Both accounts came back to me in the usual "Hotmail.com" format.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then, a few months ago, my 2nd account (the one in question) started appearing on the website in what was identified as the "upgraded" Outlook format.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Yesterday, completely separate from that, I upgraded my PC's applications from a limited Trial version of Office 2010 to Office 2010 Professional. Before then, even though it was included in the Trial version on my PC, I had never opened the Outlook
 2010 application.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Because there were issues in my installing the full-blown Office 2010 Pro version (I was originally linked to a 32-bit vs 64-bit version), I needed the Microsoft tech to take control of my desktop to uninstall/re-install Office 2010 Pro.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When the re-install was complete, the tech asked me to go into each to verify that I now had the new purchased version (because part of the problem was that Word, Excel, &amp; Powerpoint were still showing up as the Trial versions vs the Pro versions (Having
 never even opened the Trial Outlook, it said that I needed to set it up first).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>So, when I went into the now-Pro version of Outlook to verify it was the full version, I first had to set it up, which is when I downloaded/installed the "Conector", &amp; then went in &amp; verified it was the upgraded version.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>That's all I did.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Today, when I went online on the web to access my 2nd "Outlook-format" Hotmail e-mail, I discovered all those older e-mails in at least the Inbox were missing &amp; started this thread. I closed out of that website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I just now opened the Outlook 2010 application on my PC to verify what type of e-mail account I have there. My hotmail account in question is identified as a MAPI type, with the comment after it "send from this account by default".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>While in the Outlook 2010 application, I checked my most recent e-mails, and opened/deleted a few. I also read about archiving older e-mails, but I don't see any archive folder listed anywhere (is it hidden? Could they be in there?), and a quick check
 based on what little I know about Outlook seems to indicate I haven't established any Archive folder, nor set up any default timeframe for moving from active to archived. Could Outlook have done this initially automatically? Or deleted the older ones?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In any event, after that, I closed my Outlook 2010 application on my desktop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Later, I went back into my e-mail account via the web, only to find that some of the e-mails I had "deleted" while in that e-mail account in Outlook 2010 were still in my Inbox on the web version of the e-mail account. So is there also some sync problem?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Personally, for now at least, I have no need to use the Outlook 2010 application from my desktop. I need Word/Excel/Powerpoint only. So I'd be accessing my e-mail accounts the old way via the web going forward.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I just want to find out why I lost all those older e-mails, and to be sure nothing will be messed up going forward if I stick with just the web access to my e-mail accounts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hopefully, this is enough specifics to give you an idea of what might have happenned, as I can't think of anything more to mention/explain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>Thanks! </span>

<p>I understand your frustration with regard to losing important emails in your account. Let me help you find those emails

<p>
</p><p>EDIT: What I want is to be able to see is, first, both the inbox and a reading pane (right or bottom, doesn't matter). And then, second, when I select an email, I want to have it open in the inbox, such that the reading pane disappears. This was possible
 once, but isn't anymore.</p>

<h2>            Exchange 2010 to Office 365 migration - how to</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'm looking for some guidance on migrating from Exchange 2010 to Office 365. At a high level, I have the following:</p>
<p>0. Ensure domain has correct UPN and UPNs are registered against users.<br />
1. Setup ADFS servers (sts.contoso.com)<br />
2. Ensure Exchange 2010 is at the correct SP level, autodiscover and SSL certs are OK<br />
3. Configure Directory Sync - I'm assuming AD Connect is OK? Should I allow AD Connect to configure the ADFS servers?<br />
4. Add Domain within O365 (verify domain)<br />
5. Run the Office 365 deployment readiness tool<br />
6. Setup PowerShell hybrid configuration – can this just be done by AD Connect? <a href="http://www.msexchange.org/articles-tutorials/office-365/exchange-online/configuring-exchange-hybrid-deployment-migrating-to-office-365-exchange-online-part6.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.msexchange.org/articles-tutorials/office-365/exchange-online/configuring-exchange-hybrid-deployment-migrating-to-office-365-exchange-online-part6.html<br />
</a><br />
7. Choose OUs for AD Connect Directory Synchronisation<br />
8. Add an SPF record for Office 365<br />
9. Add an Exchange organization for Office 365 within E2010 (EMC, needs global admin permissions)<br />
10. Follow EMC wizard for Cloud deployment stage</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>- Can I/should I allos AD Connect to setup the ADFS trust?<br />
- With the migration scenario, what's the recommended delivery for mail? Should the MX record point to your on premise server which will then forward to Office 365 (if so, does Exchange create appropriate Office 365 connectors?)<br />
- How is mail delivered to target mailboxes in Exchange online? Does the migration wizard modify the "Target Address" for email delivery?<br />
- Once all of the on premise users are migrated, can we decommission on premise Exchange?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance - I've some research already, but have read a lot of contradictory statements.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi JustAnotherCloudGuy,</p>
<p>As different migrations have different mechanisms, can you let us know which migration method (Hybrid remote move or cutover migration) you are looking at so that we can precisely answer your question? Generally, the deployment of ADFS can be set up separately
 with Azure AD Connect tool, customers don’t have to set it up from Azure AD Connect tool though it provides the interface to deploy ADFS.</p>
<p>Hope any updates from you.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Ran<br />

<h2>            How to reinstall Microsoft Office 2010 and Click To Run 2010</h2>
                    I somehow managed to uninstall these 2 items. &nbsp;I was uninstalling something else and must have clicked on them by accident and just automatically pressed Enter to confirm, thinking at first it was what I actually wanted to remove. &nbsp;Is there a way of reinstalling
 these products?

            Yes, you will simply have to re-install MS Office 2010 the same way you did originally. Run the same installation file. Click to Run is installed as part of Office 2010 that was bought as an online download.<br />
<br />
If you don't have the installation file and you did buy it as an online download, you can return to the site you bought it from:<br />
<br />

            Hi Daniel and thanks for your help. &nbsp;I didn't purchase the Office product, it came preinstalled on my laptop. &nbsp;I don't have a product key at all. &nbsp;All I have is a key from the Microsoft label on the underside of my laptop which isn't the Microsoft Office
 Key (however I still tried and failed to attempt your advised course of action and failed with this key). &nbsp;It was Microsoft Office 2010 Home and Student (Starter Edition) and also and Click To Run too. &nbsp;I have a bad feeling I'm going to have to shell out for
 a new download of the latest software as I need the word and excel software for loads of documents I regularly access.

Here are some ways to re-install Starter<br />
<br />
<div><b><span>Re-install STarter</span></b> </div>
<p>There are 5 ways of re-installing starter that I am aware of:</p>
<p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>use the <span>"MS Office Manager” labeled “Microsoft Office 2010”
</span>entry in Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features</p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>re-install Windows from the recovery partition </p>
<p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>you have a backup copy of the Starter program files</p>
<p>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>you can find a copy the Starter installation file, SetupConsumerC2ROLW.exe, somewhere on the internet (another poster was still able to find this file at the beginning of this month)<br />
</p>
<p>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>talk to your computer builder</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Option 2 wipes out all of your installed programs and personal data files. You have to have a good full disk backup before doing it.
</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Option 4 requires some dedicated googling. Another poster said he recently found a copy of it.&nbsp; As well, you have to decide if you trust the source to be clean of malware ...</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Option 5 is a very long shot. They typically, ERRONEOUSLY, tell you to talk to MS for help.&nbsp; They are unlikely to give you the installation file.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>Here are the various links I've collected on re-installing Starter.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div><b><span>HP instructions on Office Starter Repair, Program Manager, Uninstall Starter and Re-install Starter via Program Manager in Pictures</span></b>
<div>
<p>The best instructions I've seen for "fixing" Office Starter are this page. Although they are by HP, they can by used on many computers:</p>
<p>http://h10025.www1.hp.co`m/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=uk&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;docname=c02981221#N272</p>
<p><span>Starter is not actually installed on your computer. It runs inside of a “virtual computer”</span> , “computer within a computer”,
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>located in the “Q:\” drive and the program code is downloaded over the internet every time the program is started. Therefore there are limited things we as users can do to "fix" starter:</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Run an Office Repair on Starter</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Confirm that you have the KB 2553141 update (in theory it should be there ‘automatically’ … )</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Use "MS Office Manager” labeled “Microsoft Office 2010” in Programs and Features to re-install Starter from the Windows program Manager</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Re-install WINDOWS from the recovery partition, wiping all installed programs and personal data files!</span></p>
<p><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Phone the OEM who supposed to support Starter. They will tell you to do steps 1-4 and then lie to you and tell you to call MS!</span></p>

<p>On this HP notebook, if you go to the Advanced Recovery Methods page in Control Panel, you're given an option to "Return your computer to factory condition." After a restart, you're presented with these three options. The Minimize Image Recovery option does
 exactly what it sounds like. You get a clean Windows installation, with the proper drivers and required HP utilities. But trialware and other unwanted software are completely missing. On a default installation, the Programs option in Control Panel includes
 50 entries. Using this option, the same list is stripped down to a mere 25 entries.</p>

<p>Office 2010 Starter is only officially installed by computer builders. If you google skillfully, there are a few links to the installation files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Home users do not have access to the installation file so there are only 3 options for “re-installing” it.</p>
<p>There is an option that allows users to re-install Office Starter without using the recovery partition.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It requires that you have the Microsoft Office 2010 Program Manager installed. If you go into Programs and Features dialog, look for the “Microsoft Office 2010” entry.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The link above shows how this entry appears in Programs and Features, and how to use it to re-install Office Starter.</p>

</b>
<p>Hard drive recovery is a requirement for distributing Office Starter 2010. A hard-disk-based recovery solution enables Win7 to automatically recover from most known causes for unbootable systems as a result of loss or corruption of files.
</p>
<p>This type of recovery will wipe out all of your installed programs and personal data files. Therefore, before starting this type of “repair” you should make a backup of your disk and make sure that you have the installation files and product keys for all
 of your applications.</p>

Install the patch in KB2742694 <b>BEFORE</b> upgrading to Win8</p>
<p>MS have now fixed the Office Starter 2010 files to run in Windows 8.</p>
<p>You have two options. You need to be connected to the internet for both.</p>
<p>1. Run the latest "To Go" and install to a USB stick from Win7. This stick will now run on Windows 8.</p>
<p>2. In Win8 run the "SetupConsumerC2ROLW" app as administrator in isolation from any of the other installation files.</p>

            What version of Windows?<br />
<br />
Exactly how did you reset to factory. <br />
<br />
To re-install Office you need 2 things: your unique 25 character Product Key and the associated generic installation file. Without your product key you are totally lost, no Office.<br />
<br />
Take a look to see if you can find a c:\windows.old folder.&nbsp; If you have one, let us know and I'll give you a list of tools you can use to extract the Product Key.<br />
<br />
Yes, there is a good chance the "free" Office is infected with malware.

            Starter does not require you to enter a product key. That is provided at the factory. As long as you use one of the "approved" recovery techniques I gave you, you won't need a Product Key.<br />
<br />
Yes, if you have the 2007 product key you can install it and use it on Win 7 with no problem (I have).&nbsp; If you don't have the installation file, tell us which Office bundle and we can probably provide a download link for it.<br />

<h2>            How to remove Vodafone software from my phone&#63;</h2>
                    Dear All,<br />
<br />
I have a Nokia 6630 which I was using with Vodafone but now I have another provider. I was wondering if there is a version of the software Nokia provides that I hope has nothing to do with Vodafone. If this version exist please let me know. I did the Nokia
 software update with the USB cable but I can still see some remaining Vodafone things going on I do not like. I hope you can help me. I paid for this phone and I'd like to be free to use it with a proper software, not a personalized version.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

Although this site is provided by Nokia, this is a users self help forum. i.e. the replies you get to your questions are from other Nokia users taking the time to help you, not from Nokia itself or its employees, unless by a moderator.<br />
<br />
And yes, any talk about 'debranding' handsets is against the forum rules. Whilst you may think that debranding a mobile phone is your 'right' it's not an activity that Nokia supports. If you want help you'll have to go to another phone forum of which there
 are many.<br />

<p>Cpu: 4790K<br />
Motherboard : Fatal1ty Z97X Killer<br />
Graphics : Geforce gtx 660 (Integrated is disabled)<br />
Primary output monitor: Dell U2713HM 1*DVI (always works)<br />
Secondary output monitors 2x: BenQ GL2450, 1*DVI and 1*HDMI (these guys are dropped)<br />
<br />
The reason why i suspect online account(i assumed some display settings are synchronized,work pc background was updated on resume that i set@home )&nbsp;<br />
and it only happens when following 2 conditions are met:<br />
1. Resuming from Sleep<br />
2. I Have logged in with Microsoft online account on my home pc while this work pc is in sleep</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If i put pc to sleep now and wake it up everything works as should.</p>
<p>If issue occurs displays are not detected on Control Panel "Screen Resolution" view, just like when unplugged.</p>
<p>I can't recall if displays were listed in dropdown list (this morning work pc was sleeping but all monitors resumed), but they were'nt shown on visual representation box so i assume they would'nt be in dropdown either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be sure i'll check if displays are listed on dropdown list next time issue occurs and Win+P also.</p>
<p>Edit: checked into event log, after yesterdays first resume there was about 25 Kernel-General entries on different settings.dat files, which i assume, again, are associated with my Microsoft online account.</p>
<p>If i think back , my monitors were dropped maybe because i set different desktop background@home. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So i would maybe add third condition (wallpaper change) here to the condition list, i'll test this theory and will let you know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Don'nt know why but it won't fail anymore like this, 3 times in a row and works.</p>

    <title>nokia 8800 and battery firmware issues. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dani2xll---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            nokia 8800 and battery firmware issues.</h2>
                    Taken from another post which was closed as this was off-topic. Now it is on-topic in this post.<br />
<br />
"Coming late to this discussion I seem to see different performance issues with the 8800. Basically it is all power related, but in my case its not just battery capacity.<br />
<br />
The battery is of a smaller capacity than many other phones... fine, so we expect lower operating time. Again that is not the issue.<br />
<br />
We have two 8800's both have had the firmware updated and now both are unusable. In the case of these two phones (each from a different batch) the issue changed with a firmware revision. Its a power managment problem, not a capacity problem.<br />
<br />
Like others on this forum, replacing the battery with a 'fully charged' one from the cradle and you can get variable results. Sometimes some hours, other times only a few tens of minutes (standby not talk).<br />
<br />
The phone cuts off calls with a low battery warning within 3 seconds of the first warning. Power cycling the phone sometimes gives another 15 mins talk time, other times it shuts down immediately.<br />
<br />
The battery 'gas guage' doesn't seem to be telling the truth... I am fairly sure that there are actually enough Coulombs of charge in the cells... it just that he firmware doesn't 'realise' it.<br />
<br />
Something is badly wrong with the firmware... this means that broadly speaking, this can be improved. Nokia don't seem to want to solve this issue. All I was given was a postal address to write to so that I may complain. I don't want to complain... I want substantially
 fixed software.<br />
<br />
The Nokia service centre is 'stuck' and all they can do is send it to Nokia. Speaking to Nokia, they say take it to the service centre. They can't even promise a loan phone whilst it is away for up to 3 weeks. Not a good response for a £500 phone (times 2).<br />
<br />
With the present software, this 'phone' is not fit for purpose. Come on Nokia, sort this issue out."<br />
<br />
I have this exact same problem and have the phone software upgraded with the same problem. I have now purchased a new nokia 8800 as i like the design a lot, and this new phone has the same problem using the new batteries that it came with.<br />
<br />
What is the point in upgrading the software, if the software is not correcting the problem. Maybe it is more of a hardware issue that nokia is not forthcoming about.

            Also an additional problem that i get in the old and new phone is the text messaging bug where by an earlier read message now appears in your inbox as unread and even tho you read it again, it does not change to read, until you have actually read the new
 message that arrived. For example, you receive a new message at 8pm and when u check your inbox, it shows 4 messages new, when you read, you find that 3 of them are old messages that you have already read, but they do not appear as read, until you have read
 the actually new message received at 8pm. Come on nokia fix these things. And who do we actually contact with these things as saying upgrade software to software that does not work, does not help. My firmware on both my handsets is v 03.78 17.10.05. This is
 the newest software update which was done on my initial handset apprx 2 weeks ago. The brand new handset purchased a week ago already had this software version. The nokia 8800 has been out for over 10 months time and a permanent fix shoul

            I have just had my firmware updated to 3.94. I hope that this will now correct the problems. If not, you can expect a further post from me in the very near future.

            All battery problems now solved with the upgraded software. Only bud i have left is the text message bug. But as i seem to be the only person in the world with the problem, i dont think nokia will fix it. Mayb in the next software upgrade. I'm getting
 about 5 days with approx half hr talk-time each day, i dont use it for wap, use it for text and calls only. And i dont switch off at night. So thats good in my opinion.

<p>One solution is to reduce the bitrate. Not to kill to much quality by this, one trick is to use only half of the original frame rate. Another solution is to resize the video exactly to the amount of pixels of your screen. Did that help?</p>

<p>I have had the same issue on my Toshiba Satellite A665-S6094 since 9860 was released. My only exception is that Windows Update wants me to install the Nvidia GeForce Driver Update but if I do, the system goes into an unrecoverable endless error loop. If
 I change the Video Driver to a MS Generic Display, no change. I am about ready to just put the Toshiba Satellite A665-S6094 back on the shelf.</p>

    <title>Mailbox migration to Office 365, CreatingFolderHierarchy taking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> logitech72  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mailbox migration to Office 365, CreatingFolderHierarchy taking forever</h2>
                    <p>We have 2 on premise Exchange 2016 servers.</p>
<p>We recently ran the hybrid configuration wizard to implement hybrid connectivity with Office 365.</p>
<p>So far we have migrated 2 mailboxes to O365 and the transfer rate is super, super slow.</p>
<p>The remote connectivity analyzer does not report any issues.<br />
We are on a symmetric 200Mb/s internet circuit.</p>
<p>CPU/RAM utilization on the exchange servers is minimal.</p>
<p>Examining the migration report shows hours worth of entries for "creating folder hierarchy. percent complete: 10" over and over.</p>
<p>Neither of these mailboxes has any unusual folders or a large number of folders.</p>
<p>Thank you for your suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the data in the report for the move I kicked off 3.5 hours ago and shows 250KB of data migrated:</p>

<p>Hi Logitech,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes. It takes hours to create folder hierarchy. In my test environment, it takes hours to migrate severa mailboxes with little data to online too. Please give the migration process a little more time.

    <title>Groove vs. Xbox Music Pass - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denniscdays  say:</h3>
<h2>            Groove vs. Xbox Music Pass</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Xbox music on my win 8.1/10 computer, along with android and iOS phones for the past year or so.&nbsp; I've been adding Xbox music passes purchased at Target.&nbsp; Everything is working fine.&nbsp; My Xbox music pass expires tomorrow.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that the app is Groove Music, I see on your site the following, "Note Groove does not require a Groove Music Pass. However, a music pass gives you access to a large library of music. If you don’t have a Groove Music Pass, try one free for 30 days."</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the benefit of having a pass?&nbsp; I can still only purchase Xbox Music Pass at Target (as of today), and not Groove Music Pass.&nbsp; I do not wish to use a credit card or other payment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are my requirements and options to continue to use my Groove player as I have been using it?</p>

            I believe because you have access to all Microsoft services with one account, your Xbox Music Pass should essentially be the same as a Groove Music Pass. I am just about to subscribe to a Microsoft music service too, which is why I came across this issue.
 What I'm going to do is just buy a Groove Music Pass, seeing as it seems to be the new name. Microsoft should clear this up with other confused people.

            Well, it turns out I was using a zune pass that I had purchased as an xbox pass on eBay this time.&nbsp; On November 16, the pass was cancelled, and all of the music on all of my devices stopped.&nbsp; I spent 1 1/2 hours on the phone with Microsoft Support. &nbsp; This
 consisted of numerous calls, as each person wasn't familiar with Groove and tried to connect me with someone at Xbox, which failed, and the line went dead.&nbsp; Finally I reached someone at Xbox, and he had to try to find someone familiar with Groove.&nbsp; The connection
 went dead, and I gave up.&nbsp; I had an Xbox Music Pass that I bought at Target, put the code in, and it worked.&nbsp; So, as far as I know from my experience, an Xbox Music Pass will work with Groove.&nbsp; A Zune pass will not.&nbsp; Of course you can purchase a Groove Pass
 directly from Microsoft.&nbsp; I've also been paying for a pass for my kid, and didn't want to give her my credit card to deal with Microsoft, which made a pass on a card&nbsp; a better option for me.&nbsp; Maybe in 3 months when this pass expires, things will be clearer.&nbsp;
 Good luck to the other people with this problem.&nbsp; Hope this helped.&nbsp; I still find Groove to be one of the best music apps out there.&nbsp; The only thing missing is the ability to move to a different position within the song (like wanting to hear a portion of the
 song again, or skipping to a favorite part).<br />

            <p>XBox Music = Groove Music&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; They are the SAME thing</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox Music is being REBRANDED as Groove Music...This is just a name change. The actual service is the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The xBox or Groove music app can be used to listen to music.&nbsp; This can be music that is streamed via an xBox/Groove Music Pass if you subscribe to a pass or it can be music that is streamed from your OneDrive account or that is stored locally on the device
 (so no need for an internet connection) </p>
<p>
An Xbox Music Pass is the same thing as a Groove Music Pass.
</p><p>
</p><p>There are Groove Music apps that can be installed on iPhones and Android devices. Windows 10 and Windows 10 mobile devices include the Groove Music app. The Groove Music app can be used to stream and download any Xbox/Groove Music Pass subscribed music.&nbsp;
 The Groove Music app can also be used to stream your personal music collection - this is any of your personal music collection (purchased or ripped from CDs) that you have uploaded to your OneDrive account.<br />
</p>
<p>The Xbox Music app is installed on Windows Phone 8.x devices and is used to stream and download any Xbox/Groove Music Pass subscribed music.&nbsp; The xBox Music app can also be used to stream your personal music collection - this is any of your personal music
 collection (purchased or ripped from CDs) that you have uploaded to your OneDrive account. You can also use the app to listen to any music you've copied from your computer to your phone via the computer's File Explorer and USB connection.</p>

            <p>Thank you @profjulie, for your explanation.&nbsp; That still doesn't explain the cryptic note on Microsoft's site- ""Note Groove does not require a Groove Music Pass. However, a music pass gives you access to a large library of music. If you don’t have a Groove
 Music Pass, try one free for 30 days."&nbsp; What CAN you do without a pass?&nbsp; My iOS and android apps went dead.&nbsp; My windows 10 computer app didn't function.&nbsp; Playing music I already own is not something I need another player for.&nbsp; There are better ones than Groove
 that I use for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Xbox Music and Groove Music are, in fact, "the same", why did they cancel my kid's Zune Pass (again- sold on eBay as an Xbox music pass- certainly not with Microsoft's blessing) with 2 months of service remaining?&nbsp; It was nice of Microsoft to offer a
 free month for the inconvenience though.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only real problem with the change was that there was no one at Microsoft available to answer questions.&nbsp; Should I have spent another 3 hours searching for that one person that could answer?&nbsp; It appears that Xbox and Groove needed to separate, and maybe
 have their own support people?&nbsp; And to have a better explanation or FAQ available.&nbsp; I haven't checked lately to see if that has happened.</p>

            <p>The cryptic note on Microsoft's website simply means you can use the Groove app to play or stream your personal music collection....you do not need to have a Groove Music Pass to use the Groove app.&nbsp; If you subscribe to a Groove music pass, you will have
 access to Microsoft's large library of music which you can stream and download to Groove enabled devices.&nbsp; If there are other music apps and music subscription services you prefer to use, then the Groove app is not necessary and you don't need to install it
 to your device.&nbsp; If you decide to subscribe to a Groove music pass, then you will have to use the Groove app to listen to any Groove subscribed music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox and Groove music are the same thing, but Zune is NOT.&nbsp; Zune is Microsoft's legacy music service, which is not compatible with Groove.&nbsp; Microsoft is currently closing down all of its Zune services, including its old Zune Music Pass and its related Zune
 Marketplace and any users who held a Zune Music Pass are being forced to convert to a Groove Music Pass (or cancel their subscription altogether - which is what I did).&nbsp; The conversion of the Zune Music Pass to a Groove Music Pass was done automatically earlier
 this month.&nbsp; Microsoft has not sold any Zune Pass cards in several years, but I know there are plenty of them being sold on eBay and elsewhere.&nbsp; Any of these old Zune Pass cards that are being sold on eBay or anywhere else might be utterly worthless in a month
 or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The xBox Music subscription service was created a couple of years ago, around the same time that Windows Phones 8 devices were first marketed. At the time, the Zune Music Pass was discontinued and users were encouraged to replace their old legacy Zune pass
 with the new xBox Music Pass.&nbsp; But Zune music pass subscribers who wanted to maintain their current Zune subscription were allowed to do so (these were grandfathered Zune music passes).&nbsp; From that time until now Microsoft has run the xBox Music service in
 parallel to its Zune Music service.&nbsp; Microsoft "allowed" Zune subscribed music to be streamed or downloaded to windows phone 8 devices.&nbsp; Now Microsoft is turning OFF all of its Zune Music services and shuttering it permanently.&nbsp; The only music service that
 remains is the Groove/xBox Music service. </p>

FAQ about the retirement of the Zune Music Pass has been online since October and you can read it here.</a></p>

<h2>            Form not opening in datasheet view</h2>
                    <p>I have a form called Retrieval with buttons to launch various reports and forms. Using the form wizard I set up a quick and dirty payment history form based on a query. I chose the datasheet view for the Payment History form. My problem is that the view
 is different depending on how a launch it. If I i open the form from the navigation sidebar I get the datasheet view of the form, but if I launch it using the command button on my Retrieval form I get a columnar or&nbsp;form view.&nbsp; The default view of the form
 is set to datasheet and I tried to change the other form properties to prevent any view but datasheet but it doesn't seem to matter.&nbsp; I am at a loss as to what else to change.</p>

<h2>            Document folders are changing &#34;date modified&#34; when no changes are made to folder files</h2>
                    <p>I have tried to find a solution to this problem through searches and see that it has been a problem for other Windows users but I have found no online&nbsp; solution. This is on my personal/business computer,.&nbsp; Files are not on a network.&nbsp; I am still stubbornly
 using Windows 7 Pro, 64-Bit.&nbsp; My files/folders are extensive and tracking down latest versions of documents is dependent on being able to have accurate date modified search capabilities.&nbsp; Similar to other user complaints, here are the problem details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I open a folder and then a file (Word, Excel) within the folder.&nbsp; I make no changes to the file/document, close the file and folder, and then the date modified is updated to the current date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) This does not seem to occur if I open a PDF file within a folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I found one thread that suggested making sure than in My Documents - Tools - View that the box is checked for "Always show icons, never thumbnails.&nbsp; I did this and it makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem began after the most recent updates.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone solved this issue?????</p>

<p>Since 2007 went out of support in 2017 and at that time updates stopped, it can have nothing to do with Office, but is down to your unknown version of win.</p>
<p>When you open a doc/file the win archive atribute will mark the file as modified, whether you have physically edited the data or not. Which is why you cannot use incremantal backup on certain types of files (well you can but it will be a full not incremantal
 backup)</p>

<p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; It seems to me there must be a solution to this issue because there has never been a problem in the past.&nbsp; If the system is changing the win archive attribute even if no file is modified, as you mention, then is there a way
 to prevent that from occurring? &nbsp; As for Windows 7 support, I still get updates and Windows 7 versions are included and referenced.&nbsp; For instance, this pending update which references Windows 7:</p>
<p>
</p><p>2019-02 Preview of Quality Rollup for .NET Framework 3.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.6, 4.6.1, 4.6.2, 4.7, 4.7.1, 4.7.2 for Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 for x64 (KB4487256)<br />
<br />
If anyone else has an ideas I'm very interested in any suggestions to address this problem.<br />
