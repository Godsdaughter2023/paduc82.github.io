<h2>            How to change &#40;add or subtract&#41; a cell value without a formula</h2>
                    I would like the ability to change&nbsp; the value of a cell without using a formula.&nbsp; I understand this may be consider poor practice,&nbsp;but I'm working with non-critical data.&nbsp; For instance, if cell value contains 100 I would like to be able to click on it,
 select a menu option (i.e. right-click menu option) and simply&nbsp;enter a value to add to the existing 100 value.&nbsp; So if 100,&nbsp;right-click, select function/macro from menu, enter value B and&nbsp;then add the two value together.&nbsp;

            <p>Use code like the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub AddToCells()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim V As Variant<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim R As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; V = Application.InputBox("Enter the number to add", Type:=1)<br />

</p>
<p>Assign this to a menu item or a shortcut key. It will prompt you for the number to add to all the numeric,non-formula cells in the Selection cells. If you cancel the InputBox, the procedure exits. Note that Application.InputBox is not the same as just InputBox.
 You need the Application qualifier.</p>

<p>You can create a shape that contains shape data. The basic shape will contain several text blocks that refer to the shape data.</p>
<p>So...</p>
<p>Create several text blocks and arrange them the way you want. Then&nbsp; group the blocks. This will create a new shape with the text blocks as sub shape. Select this new shape Right Click Data &gt; then Define Data and start creating the data fields you will need.</p>
<p>Now for some surgery. </p>
<p>Find the name of the shape. From the Developer ribbon select Shape Name and remember the name. I will assume the name you found was Sheet.13.</p>
<p>Select the shape and then select the text you want to change. From the Insert Ribbon choose Field in the Text Group.</p>
<p>Chose Custom Formula and set it to =Shape.13!Prop. You will get a drop don list showing the shape data you created in the top shape. Chose the appropriate one and repeat for the other text blocks.</p>
<p>You can then move the shape to a stencil and make it a master that you can reuse. Any changes to this master will be reflected in all occurrences of this master.</p>
<p>You can now tie a drawing with these shapes back to an Excel spreadsheet so you have an easy way of updating the shapes.</p>
<p>Developer Ribbon? Turn it on by going File &gt; Options &gt; Customize Ribbon &gt; check the Developer check box.</p>

            <p>Excel is displaying the value for 37 hours in its time format.</p>
<p>Which, in this case, is 1 day and 13 hours.</p>
<p>If you re-format that cell to be numeric, it will convert to : 1.54166666666667</p>
<p>where whole numbers represent entire days and partial days are decimals.</p>
<p>1.54166666666667 = 37_hours / 24_hours_per_day </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<p>29.5 hours would be represented by: </p>
<p>=29.5/24</p>
<p>=1.22916666666667</p>
<p>That value, displayed as an Excel date would be: 1/1/1900&nbsp; 5:30:00 AM</p>
<p>If you use a custom date format of [h]:mm:ss, it will display as: 29:30:00</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does that help?</p>

<h2>            Cumulative Update KB3081444 restart issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 3 day old clean install of Windows 10 Home with few new programs installed and received the prompt to install the update 'Cumulative Update KB3081444' which apparently patches a critical vunerability in Internet explorer amongst other things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update seemed to install ok going through the usual procedure of restarting the machine and making the changes accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when i get back to my desktop after the install procedure, everything just hangs and nothing loads correctly or runs correctly - Nothing shows on my taskbar, the start menu is missing and nothing is accessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to use ctrl-alt-del to get to the task manager and logoff my account and when i relogin everything loads as it should, but again if i use the restart option nothing will load again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i uninstalled the KB3081444 update and everything works perfectly again, and i have temporarily managed to use the 'Hide Update Tool' to stop this update auto installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously this is not a good situation if i am missing out on a critical vunerability patch and would appreciate some advice of what i can do to workaround this issue so i can patch internet explorer, i'm not particularly bothered what the rest of the update
 does.</p>
<p>

            <p>Well, as Microsoft have offered 'no support' or 'workarounds' whatsoever regarding this issue so i decided after my frustrations had subsided to see if i could find a way to get this update to install without causing the restart issues as mentioned in my
 inital post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think i have found what has been my problem and here are the details of what i did to sort it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have alway used Zonealarm Free Firewall as i always found it nice and easy to use and block stuff that i didn't want leaving my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway the only version of Zonelarm that would work on Windows 10 for me was version 14.0.508.000 so i have been using that since installing Windows 10 and even though it is terrible compared to early versions did the job as i can't stand other third party
 firewalls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately it appears to be causing conflicts within Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What worked for me was to go into the preferences window of Zonealarm and turn off the 'Run at Startup' box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then do a 'restart' so i had no firewalls running at all including windows firewall - not a great idea, but it is only temporary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then i unhid the KB3081444 update and installed it again which automatically / schedule restarts your computer to fully install and everything loaded as it should with a fully working desktop - hoooray !</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i decided to do then was i 'restarted' the laptop again about 3 times to see if everything was working as it should&nbsp; - and it seemed fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then ran Zonealarm from 'Programs' and went into preferences and turned on 'Run at Startup' and then did a 'restart' and again performed this about 3 times without any issues, i then tried a 'shutdown' followed by a 'restart' and fortunately everything
 seems to be working as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the only conlcusion i'm getting from this is Zonealarm was potentially interfering with the security update part of this cumulative update whilst installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you're running a third party firewall i would suggest turning it off and try re-installing this particular update and see if it helps as it seems to have worked for me for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this is of help to anyone who is having issues with this update, it would be interesting to know if anyone who is having this issue is running Zonealarm Free Firewall :)</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything is running great at the moment and wasn't really a major issue for me as i used a spare laptop to test if Windows 10 would be a reliable OS to upgrade to as i had the forsight and experience to know that most software these days is riddled with
 bugs - however i will NOT be upgrading my main machines currently running Windows 7 as the new OS is obviously not ready for release and has some 'Major' issues that are not being dealt with in an honest and open way by Microsoft - You need to keep your customers
 updated even if you haven't found a fix for the problem otherwise you will just retain your bad reputation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Critical Error: Start Menu and Cortana aren't working. We will try and fix them when you restart" bug is something that is a 'major' issue for alot of people including myself that just has not been dealt with in a professional manner and probably the
 main reason i will not be upgrading as this is an unforgiveable bug at this stage - I'm sorry but Apple would 'never' release a new OS with a bug like that and will result in a lot of less experienced customers losing the contents of their hard drives due
 to bad advice from these forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the machine i have running Windows 10 i have disabled 'Windows Update' in 'Services' as i think this is potentially part of the issue, due to the fact that 'Windows 10 updates and App updates' are installed silently in the background without any notification
 at all, the user then has no knowledge that an update may be installing at that moment and potentially do a random restart or shutdown and possibly force close their machine if it seems to hang, corrupting the update in progress and possibly causing these
 ongoing issues that people are experiencing after an update has been installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either 'Forced Updates' needs to be re-thought or removed and made similar to Windows 7 or a 'Notification' needs to be displayed that 'Updates are in progress' to avoid corruption of a partially installed update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a postive note, Windows 10 does run very fast on older machines and definitely has potential, but for now is just not a viable product in it's current form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Send to recipient very slow</h2>
                    <br />
<pre><p><span>Send to very long recipient with Outlook 2016 Office more
&nbsp;
This problem suddenly affects a fully updated Windows 10 user with the Office 2016 Suite and an Office 365 subscription. Several Exchange account are configured in the Outlook.
Before, the simple act of sending "send to recipient" or using the adobe Acrobat function send email to Outlook, or ask the scanner to send directly to Outlook (Brother Control Center 4 sending to email) this simple action took between 1-4 seconds.
The brand of the computer is a Lenovo LENOVO THINKPAD X1 CARBON 20FB-006A I7-6600U, 16GB, 512GB S equipped with an external docking station by Lenovo's proprietary connector.
The Windows 10 is protected by its own antivirus not McAfee, Norton, Avast or anything else!
Since the events that I will list below sending "send to a recipient" outside of Outlook 2016 now takes between 40 and 60 seconds which is an unacceptable loss of time for a user who sends between 20-30 PDF by days. Surrounding a loss of 30 minutes a day. It is enormous.
&nbsp;
Apparition of the phenomenon on March 13, 2018 after:
- Complete update of Lenovo with system update, bios, controller, chipset, in short a good amount
- At the restart some Windows update of which I do not have the list
&nbsp;
Operations performed to try to work around the problem:
&nbsp;
- Office quick repair 2016 without result
- Completely complete repair 2016 around 2H blocked at 75% then error message
- Attempt to reinstall the application with the same error code as full repair
- Automatic uninstallation with the cleaning utility provided by Microsoft
- Antivirus deactivation
- Office relocation 2016 without problem-
- Reconfiguration of accounts impossible</span></p><p /><p><span>
- Disabling add-ons tested in safe mode without result
- Cleaning the identification manager account creations ok
&nbsp;
The problem remains the same "sending to a recipient" takes between 40-60 seconds and works perfectly.
Effect, collateral, Outlook 2016 gets freeze sometimes intermittently a few seconds around 15-40 seconds. Then everything returns to normal.</span></p><p /><pre><span>The question is simple:
&nbsp;
- Reinstall everything should solve but you know reinstalling is not always a guarantee of success and requires time to redo all settings approx 3-4 hours?
- Do a restore to an earlier date is risky given the manipulations of the 2016 office suite previously listed?
- Lenovo update bug?
- Microsoft update bug?
- Corruption of DLL file or registry, DNS problem, proxy, etc ...
&nbsp;
So my friends if you have suggestions I am a taker and my client will be delighted.
&nbsp;
Thank you in advance</span></pre><p /><p /><p /></pre>

Hello All,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I have a very similar issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
I have an application that sends emails through Outlook.&nbsp; Using the Jan2018 version of Office 365 (2016, Click to Run) the application sends emails quickly and one after another with no delay (I send between 20 - 50 emails at a time).&nbsp; Using the May2018 version
 results in emails sending very slowly with a significant delay between "sends".&nbsp; Note: by sending I mean the email is added to the Outlook Outbox.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
This issue started to occur around March, so the March2018 update may be the issue.</p>

<p>Can confirm this bug still exists, I have 25 Dell Precision workstations using Outlook 2016 and they all have this issue straight from the factory.&nbsp; I believe this bug manifests itself in several ways, specifically when any 3rd party app calls Outlook's
 MAPI functionality.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Adobe Acrobat 2017 Standard's email PDF feature has a similar delay when calling Outlook 2016, and our firm's case management software (Trialworks) experiences the same delay when using an Outlook add-on to transfer email.&nbsp; Everything hangs for anywhere
 from 5-30 seconds, then it goes through and works as expected.&nbsp; Our old workstations use Windows 7 Pro / Office 2010 and have none of these issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp; Also noticed one more issue with Outlook 2016, if you use Right Click --&gt; Send To --&gt; Mail Recipient, not only is there a 10-15 second delay before the mail window pops up, but once that mail window is active it locks you out of interacting with the
 rest of Outlook until you have sent the message.&nbsp; This is in contrast to opening a new email and attaching a document manually, which still allows you to interact with Outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Using Legacy Tools and Text Boxes in Word 2010</h2>
                    I am creating a number of forms that i want to be filled out electronically.&nbsp; I know the basics of using the legacy tool to create a Text Form Field, and know how to limit the number of characters in the field.&nbsp; The problem is, when i fill in the form,
 it pushes all the other text out of position, ruining the rest of the form.&nbsp; A couple years ago, when i worked at another department, i created similar forms, and I am sure i created text boxes and put a legacy tool text form field inside it in order to avoid
 the movement of text on the form, but i can't seem to do it now.&nbsp; Whenever i try to put a&nbsp;text form field in a text box, the legacy tool is greyed out and unaccessible.&nbsp; I've tried&nbsp;inserting tables, but&nbsp;they are&nbsp;hard to move around and place correctly (especially&nbsp;when
 i have to place two&nbsp;separate&nbsp;tables on the same line)&nbsp;and it also moves text&nbsp;around.&nbsp; How do i solve this problem.&nbsp; I want to create text f

    <title>Is there going to be a Bulgarian keyboard also for Windows Phone 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is there going to be a Bulgarian keyboard also for Windows Phone 7 &#40;Lumia 610&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, my mom bought last year a Nokia Lumia 610. In May, I bought the newer version: Lumia 620. My cell phone has a Bulgarian keyboard but when I told my mom to activate it for herself, she could not find it. I tried it myself and was disappointed to
 discover that indeed the windows 7 phone does not have a Bulgarian keyboard! Is there any chance you would add this feature? Would it be hard to adapt it now that you offer it for the Windows 8 phone? Thank you in advance.

            <p>Hi Darina BG,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Community. I understand you're interested in changing your mother's keyboard language to Bulgarian, but it isn't available on the phone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows phone 8 features support for a lot of newly added languages that weren't previously available on Windows Phone 7, including Bulgarian. I haven't heard any information about whether or not Windows Phone 7 devices will receive any updates that would
 allow for expanded language options. There has been a website set up for consumers to post requests for Windows Phone straight to the Windows Phone Development Team, and there have been quite a few requests there for added language support. I would encourage
 you to check out <a href="http://windowsphone.uservoice.com/forums/101801-feature-suggestions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windowsphone.uservoice.com/forums/101801-feature-suggestions</a>&nbsp;to see if the request for Bulgarian has already been posted. If you can find one you can add your vote to the request. If the request has not been made you may certainly create one.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any further questions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards, </p>

<h2>            One drive for business language</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had a question regarding the OneDrive for business site language.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After assigning licenses to the users in our tenant, they clicked on the onedrive icon from O365 menu which provisioned their onedrive for business sites (web).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However these sites were provisioned in language apart from english, even though the preferred language attribute for these users is set to en-US.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We have users who are distributed geographically.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can you please let me know how the onedrive for business site language is selected?</div>
<div>Is it based on the computer / browser (language) settings ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div>Nitin</div>

            <p><span>Hi Nitin,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In SharePoint Online, site collections will be created with many languages. So users whose language is not site default language, they can also let the site display their
 language. The site default language is determined when we choose the country at initial setting up for the tenant.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you want a Japanese user see Japanese in his OneDrive for Business, you can navigate to SharePoint admin center&gt;<strong>user profiles&gt;manage user profiles</strong>&gt;find
 that user&gt;<strong>Language Preference</strong>&gt;add Japanese and move it to top&gt;<strong>Save and close</strong>. After a few time, this user’s OneDrive for Business site will display Japanese.
</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d9746300-0881-4446-a553-de520594138a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d9746300-0881-4446-a553-de520594138a" /></a></p>
<p><span>If the site default language is not English, and you want to let one user see English in his OneDrive for Business, you can move English to top. Meanwhile, let him navigate
 to OneDrive for Business&gt;click setting gear&gt;<strong>Site Settings&gt;Language Settings</strong>&gt;Make sure English is selected under
<strong>Alternate language(s)</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That is to say the selected language in language settings means the language can display in the site, Language Preferences means the language display order. If Japanese
 is at the top, and the site supports Japanese, it will display Japanese rather than the default language.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let me know if anything is misunderstood.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Tim</span></p>

<h2>            Installing Office Home on a tablet</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently been given a HP ElitePad 1000 G2, Windows 10 Pro 64 bit, tablet by a collaborator.</p>
<p>The device seems to have had the Office suite installed, however, the app is not active any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to purchase a classic, if you will, version of Office, any version from 2010 to 2016, one the I would own. Reason being, is that the location where I would occasionally work has poor mobile coverage and the building has no wi-fi. So a 365 version
 wouldn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is, can I install such software on this tablet, which has 4 GB RAM and 128 SSD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>
<p />

<p>"2013 and later require a net connection" - I understand these to be close to 365 and requiring constant net connection. Correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, the year makes little to no difference to me, as long as I can open spreadsheets and documents. So any older version, pre 2010, would do it. Can I purchase and download any of these from the MS site?</p>

<h2>            Can not deactivate Office 365 University through Portal so can not reinstall</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment I have no access to Office on my laptop that I use and need&nbsp;for university.&nbsp; I'm hoping somebody can help me.&nbsp; I'm trying to&nbsp;install/activate Office 365 but can't do it without deactivating it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how it started.&nbsp; I was having a problem with oneNote so I tried to do an repair.&nbsp; upon entering login details the following message was displayed "install limit reached. You've already installed Office on two computers. Go to your account to deactivate
 an install".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked the link and tried to deactivate, by clicking "deactivate install" under the laptop I was having a problem with.&nbsp; Clicking the deactivate button takes you to back to the same settings / portal&nbsp;page.&nbsp; I tried to deactivate in IE and Chrome, signing
 in and out of office.com/myaccount and restarting my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These were not working so I went to remove programs and uninstalled from there and hoped to reinstall but I'm stuck with the same problem.&nbsp; I still cannot deactivate from the portal and I can't reinstall as it always states "install limit reached. You've
 already installed Office on two computers. Go to your account to deactivate an install".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted tech support and they remotely accessed my machine and did the above, along with disabling browser&nbsp;add-ons and deleting histories etc.&nbsp; The tech thought it may be a problem with billing and put me through to billing.&nbsp; Billing checked my account
 and said everything was fine with my account.&nbsp; He then put me through to a Level 2 tech who also took remote access of my PC and tried the above along with running a script to completely remove office from my laptop.&nbsp; He also deleted temporary files and a
 few other things. &nbsp; He then started a install of Office 365.&nbsp; The re-download of Office 365 was taking a while to download the tech said he would call back in an hour or tomorrow but it was after 1am in the morning (I'm in the UK) so I said tomorrow would
 be fine.&nbsp; He said once it downloads I should be able to login and I should have Office 365 available again.&nbsp; Once it finished downloading I logged in and received the same error message again "install limit reached. You've already installed Office on two computers.
 Go to your account to deactivate an install".&nbsp; I tried he same steps in the portal and still cannot deactivate the copy on my laptop.</p>

            <p>Today I have tried to deactivate by using two different machines. &nbsp;I used one at university running IE, the same thing happens. &nbsp;I click deactivate and then the deactivate button and I'm just taken straight back to the settings page / portal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried on my desktop machine that's located elsewhere that has the other copy of my Office 365 installed on it. &nbsp;Going to the settings / portal and trying to deactivate brings the same results. &nbsp;Both the PCs I tried today were running Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been trying to deactivate it from the office.com/myaccount page.&nbsp; I called it portal as I seen that mentioned whilst searching online for help&nbsp;and thought that may have been the name of the page where I can click the deactivate options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got the Student Office 365 University edition, can't remember if the word student or university is used.&nbsp; I bought it last year and it cost £59.99 for a 4 year licence that can be used on 2 PCs.&nbsp; I'm based in the UK.&nbsp; I may try from a mac to deactivate
 as I'm at university at the moment.&nbsp; I don't think it will make any difference though.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What next steps can be taken?</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp; No I was unable to disable it from the Mac computer at uni either.&nbsp; They disabled the Safari browser and firefox&nbsp;was installed.&nbsp; Exactly the same thing happens on all machines I tried.&nbsp; I think on Friday I went to support again from the link on the
 settings page and spoke to a tech who only seemed interested in putting me back to the level 2 tech I spoke to; by leaving a message for that tech to say I need a follow up call.&nbsp; I'm sure there was about an 8 hours difference between me and that level 2 tech.&nbsp;
 It's Sunday now and I have not had any calls.&nbsp; At the time the tech said that the "level 2" tech is due at work in 14 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not checked the link you have provided so I'll give that ago.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

</p><p>So I'm standing at this point now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My case is pending escalation for the last 4 days now, waiting for a callback from "level"/"tier" 3 or whatever they call it (every call it seems the departement is changing name. So once I hear back from them I'll update this post with what ended up fixing
 it.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I'll agree with that, poor support. &nbsp;Now I wish I was tied up in the Apple eco system as atleast they have good customer support. &nbsp;I contacted another of these support people through the settings page and the person wanted to sell me an $149 1 year support
 package or a one of fee for $99, when i declined she said she will give me a link to a webpage instead. &nbsp;Which had the general uninstall information, then tried to leave the conversation lol. &nbsp;Then sent be another link when I said that didn't work. &nbsp;She seemed
 to just want to leave as I didn't take out either package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then on the 14th I get this from the Team Manager for the Answer Team</p>
<p>

 from my engineer. While it's always appreciated, I completely understand if you don't have time to provide me with any detailed feedback. If that's the case, please take just a moment to send me a Yes or No answer to the following two questions:</span><br />

</p></blockquote>
<p>I was on to them again yesterday twice. &nbsp;The first tech support was one that I spoke to previously who was of no help. &nbsp;This time he said that he would get me a level 2 tech to call me back and if I don't get a call within an hour to contact support again.
 &nbsp;I waited 2 hours and no call. &nbsp;I contacted them again and I spoke to another support person who was much more helpful. &nbsp;He mentioned that he didn't see any notes (I think that's what he basically said) from my previous chat with tech support earlier that
 day even though I asked the previous one if he left notes on my account. &nbsp;The first one don't seem to want to help both times I've talked to him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second one took remote access of my machine again. &nbsp;This is the 3rd time. &nbsp;Did all the common things again. &nbsp;Reboots, completely remove, re-install etc. &nbsp;Trying deactivate from office.com/myaccount etc. &nbsp;He gave me a new case number and arranged to have
 a level 2 tech call me later today between 7-9pm. &nbsp;I imagine I will watch him repeat all the steps done by the last three techs including the level 2 one that didn't call me back before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did ask if it could be a server issue, I mentioned that as somebody also posted in this thread about that ending up being their problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have not heard from that manager who emailed me to try and close my case, what a joke of a service. &nbsp;Hopefully I can get this sorted as I can't even take notes on my laptop with the programs I want to at uni while these guys are giving me the runaround.
 &nbsp;I'll keep this thread updated with any developments.</p>

<h2>            Disable inking with hand&#47;finger&#63;</h2>
                    I recently purchased an HP Spectre and have been using a Dell stylus to write notes on my Word documents. However, my hand keeps leaving dots all over the documents where I rest it. (Also, being able to scroll with my fingers would be nice :/) Is there
 any way to disable anything but my pen from inking?

<h2>            How can I have the Demo games in English&#63;</h2>
                    When I go into Demo Games on my 6500 Classic all words are in a foreign language (I think Spanish). Is there a setting that I can use to change it to English? It appears to just be on the Demo Games, everything else on the phone is in English and is fine.<br />
<br />
Thanks in anticipation.

            Try to find someone who knows Spanish to see if the demo games have a way for changing the language from within the game itself.<br />
<br />
You can also try to translate the words with, e.g., Babelfish:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://babelfish.yahoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://babelfish.yahoo.com/</a><br />
<br />
If the demo games are only in Spanish, then you just have to live with it, or uninstall them to free up the space they taek (and maybe try to find English language versions separately).

 I tried to install dotnet 2 after downloading from Microsoft's site, but couldn't get it to work. Any help appreciated!</span>

            &nbsp;Thanks for the reply J377.&nbsp; I've got 8 partitions with 18323, and interestingly EasyBCD works in 5 of them.&nbsp; Everything else in my test bucket works fine on all installs, so I guess I've just got something corrupted in the 3 where it doesn't.&nbsp; I'll run
 SFC, DISM, and maybe a troubleshooter or two and see what happens.&nbsp; These 3 partitions don't have much additional stuff installed, so I may just decide to do clean installs if it gets to bugging me enough.&nbsp; ;)

<p>This is a real pain for us as we are getting suggested groups that seem to based on organisational business units (maybe from AD - I have no idea).&nbsp;&nbsp; We have six groups we have explicitly created and the ones being suggested to new members joining Yammer
 don't exist so our colleagues are naturally 'joining' their group (because the employee is a member of that business area) and inadvertently creating the group which as network admin I have to then go and delete.&nbsp; This is a nightmare !!&nbsp; Surely Yammer should
 only be suggesting groups that exist not just making things up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx.</p>

    <title>Code to see when ODBC table was last edited - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> confused newb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Code to see when ODBC table was last edited</h2>
                    
<p>Is there a way to check when an ODBC table last had data added to it?&nbsp; I have a database that uses several ODBC connections which are incredibly slow.&nbsp; Therefore, I want to make local copies, and have code automatically update the local tables&nbsp;when the ODBC
 tables are editted (which is about once a month).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Unless there is a flag in the table that indicates when it was edited no. I have a similar issue. I use a parameters table to store the date the local tables where last created/updated. On the splash or menu screen I include that last update date so the
 user can decide if they want to refresh.

<p>The&nbsp;address book view is never used for manipulating data. Data should only be accessed where it actually resides: in the Contacts Folder. Moreover, you never use export or import for transferring Outlook data. Copy your Outlook data file if you want to
 transfer it. The file you need is your Personal Folders file (*.pst) It's where all the mail, calendar, contacts etc are stored.</p>
<p>Take a look at these pages for info on Outlook data backup or transfer:<br />
<a href="http://www.slipstick.com/config/move_outlook.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.slipstick.com/config/move_outlook.asp</a><br />
<a href="http://www.howto-outlook.com/Howto/backupandrestore.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howto-outlook.com/Howto/backupandrestore.htm</a><br />

<p>Note that some of the information on the Microsoft page is outdated and contains errors, particularly when applied to Outlook 2003, 2007 or 2010. Specifically:<br />
1. Ignore any advice to copy your PST file to Outlook's default location to connect it to your profile. Doing so will often corrupt your Outlook profile. Copy it anywhere BUT the default location and then open it within your Outlook profile.<br />
2. Ignore any advice that tells you to use export or import to transfer an entire Outlook data file. That has never been sound advice, but the process has become too deeply flawed to be trusted.</p>

            How (or even if) you export addresses or anything else depends on what email client you intend to use on the new computer.&nbsp; If you'l be using Outlook on this machine also, there's no need to export or import anything.&nbsp; Close Outlook on the old machine,
 make a copy of your .PST file, place this copy on the new machine in a folder where it won't overwrite any other files, open Outlook on the new machine and attach it to this copied .PST file using 'File|Open|Outlook Data File'. If you will NOT be using Outlook,
 it would help to know what program you will be using so we can get the right export formats.<br />

<p>That's highly unusual:&nbsp; Excel IRR is more reliable than Excel XIRR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, when Excel IRR and XIRR return #DIV/0, it should be interpreted the same as if they returned #NUM, to wit:&nbsp; a "guess" rate might be needed to help the internal algorithm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is difficult to offer any other suggestions without seeing the data.</p>

    <title>HTC Mozart on Orange &#40;Sound issues&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HTC Mozart on Orange &#40;Sound issues&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Recently purchased a HTC Mozart on an Orange contract in the UK. Having issues with the sound on the phone turning off completly. No changes to the settings(ie profile) have been changed and the only common theme seems to be that it happens after I listen
 to music through Zune. Has always been a case of turning on and off again and it has resolved the problem but this morning my alarm did not go off, only the vibrate function of it, meaning that when this problem occurs, ALL sound from the phone is not working.</p>
<p>Any suggestions or anyone else having similar issues?</p>

<p>The sound volume of your Zune, Ringtone and Alarm are for the moment all linked together. If you did not set the&nbsp;sound&nbsp;volume to minimum, I would advise you to Hard Reset you Device. But I think that it will not help in this case.. my opinion would be to
 go to your store and exchange the device..</p>

<h3> god_dos  say:</h3>
<h2>            5800 - Memory Full message</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm getting Memory Full on my 5800, when there are 24 MB free on the phone memory.</p>
<p>Also, there seems to be 43MB of Other Files, that I can't find anywhere when I browse the phone, so can't get rid of them.</p>
<p>When I tap Applications, sometimes it opens, sometimes I get Memory Fill, please close some applications (or something similar to that message).</p>
<p>I can't open Installed Apps to try to remove any.</p>
<p>When I remove the Memory card and try to uninstall apps, of course its only the apps that are in the phone memory, so I can't remove anything that is on the memory card.</p>
<p>I've removed all that I can fromthe phone memory, but can't get rid of the 43MB of other files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I can't change to the Home Screen Theme to the Shortcuts bar, as it doesn't work. I've updated the software to V31.0.101 and it didn't help. This was prior to the error mentioned above with the Memory being full.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help with this, please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>DOS</p>

<p>the invisible 43mb and the memory full message&nbsp;with apparently 24mb free seems to be a common prob with these....you need to a/ go round in circles for ages&nbsp;then sell it,&nbsp;or b/&nbsp;use code *#7370# to reset&nbsp;it to its new status -&nbsp;back up anything u dont want
 to lose first, inc phone book, format mem card, then use the code, it will now have its full&nbsp;77mb phone memory free.</p>
<p>make sure your foftware is up to date (*#0000#) and beware&nbsp;anything you re-install in case it causes this to happen again!</p>
<p>hope this sorts it and phone&nbsp;will work like new now</p>

            I’d suggest downloading classic Skype and use it to see if that corrects your problem.

    <title>Office 365 Sign in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roger branton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 Sign in</h2>
                    <p>Signing in to Office 365 is very temperamental. I have Office 365 on a work PC, a home PC (a separately paid account), a laptop, a netbook and a smart phone. I frequently get the message on any one of my devices that says my ID and/or password are not recognised.</p>
<p>The whole system of reporting to Microsoft is set up so that, without being able to sign in, you cannot access anything, including the community, to ask for help!</p>
<p>Suddenly, for no apparent reason, my ID and password will work, as now when I have managed to sign in. None of the answers provided by Help is any use so I have to resort to the community.</p>
<p>To say it is frustrating is an understatement and it disrupts my work!</p>

            Hi Roger,<br />
<br />
Thanks for taking time let us know what you have experienced.<br />
<br />
According to yout description, you have two Office 365 accounts, one from work and one is paid by yourself. If you use both of your accounts on your devices, this may happen because of browser cookies and credential confuse.<br />
<br />
I suggest you try the following steps to check the result when the issue happens again:<br />
1. Make sure your ID and password are correct.<br />
2. Use an InPrivate mode of the browser.<br />
3. Use another browser.<br />
<br />
If this is not your situation and the issue happens again, I would like to confirm the following information to clarify the issue:<br />
1. Did it happen when you sign in <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;rpsnv=4&amp;ct=1480437103&amp;rver=6.7.6640.0&amp;wp=MCMBI&amp;wreply=https%3a%2f%2fportal.office.com%2flanding.aspx%3ftarget%3d%252fdefault.aspx&amp;lc=2052&amp;id=501392&amp;msafed=0&amp;client-request-id=ecbc1e63-0e1d-4c36-a541-9dddf7f20a5f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a><a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;rpsnv=4&amp;ct=1480437103&amp;rver=6.7.6640.0&amp;wp=MCMBI&amp;wreply=https%3a%2f%2fportal.office.com%2flanding.aspx%3ftarget%3d%252fdefault.aspx&amp;lc=2052&amp;id=501392&amp;msafed=0&amp;client-request-id=ecbc1e63-0e1d-4c36-a541-9dddf7f20a5f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office
 365 portal</a> with your work account? <br />
2. Did you use both of your accounts on your devices?<br />
3. A screenshot of the error message.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, you can use a Microsoft account(<a href="https://outlook.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</a> to access community for help when your Office 365 accounts cannot sign in again.<br />
<br />
Regard,<br />
Linda

            <p>I believe I have got to the bottom of part of the problem. When I opened my Home Office 365 account, it was before my office opened an account and I used my office email address as the ID. Subsequently, my employer opened Pro Office 365 accounts for his
 employees and my office email address was used again as the ID. My employer pays for his Office 365 accounts annually while my Home account is paid monthly.</p>
<p>Following this, my employer had a problem with his domain name and had to create new email addresses. The administrator of my employer's Office 365 has changed the account IDs to the new email addressed. However, I am unable to do anything with my Home Office
 365 because the ID is the now defunct email address and I cannot get into the account to make any changes. Everything is dependent on having an ID that Microsoft recognises and an associated password. I am still receiving notification of my monthly payments
 to Microsoft but I assume that is because emails to the old email address are being forwarded automatically to the new email address.</p>
<p>How do I get my Home Office 365 account ID altered as, without this, I just go round in circles where I cannot access Microsoft because I am told the ID does not exist or the password is wrong?</p>

            <p>Hi Roger,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your information.<br />
<br />
According to your description, the <strong>primary</strong> work email address which you used to set up your Office 365 Home account has been changed to another domain, and you found your Office 365 Home account cannot do anything.<br />
<br />
I would like to explain that, when you use your Office 365 for Business account to set up an Office 365 Home account, the email address will be considered as a Microsoft account. Office 365 for Business account and Microsoft account is different thing, no matter
 how you changed the Office 365 for Business account, it will take none effect on your Microsoft account. So you can still use the<strong> primary</strong> email address as your Office 365 Home account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your reference: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Sign-in-to-Office-b9582171-fd1f-4284-9846-bdd72bb28426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sign in Office</a></span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you: <br />
1. try logging in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 Home portal</a></span> with the
<strong>primary </strong>work email address to check if your Office 365 Home account can work fine.<br />
2. open another browser or an InPrivate mode, log in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<a href="https://portal.office.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office 365 portal</a></span> with your
<strong>current</strong> work account to check if your Office 365 for Business account can work fine.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, if your Office 365 for Home account still cannot work but your office 365 for business account works fine, I suggest you open a new thread to focus on your Office 365
<strong>Home</strong> account sign-in issue, the new thread will also benefit other users who have the same issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time and effort and we are always here for you.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your help Linda</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand it, the fact that my primary work email no longer exists is not a problem for signing into my work Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I confirm that I can sign in to my Microsoft account using my primary email and I have been able to change the email address for receiving emails in my Profile to my current work email, so the primary email is no more than an ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also confirm that my current work email works for signing into my work Office 365 account so, as far as work is concerned, I have all the necessary access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not been able to sign in to my home Microsoft account with the primary email I used originally so will take your advice to start a new thread for this. I can sign in to Office 365 on my laptop and home PC but only using my current work email, so I
 am obviously not using my home Office 365.</p>
