<h2>            Red Dead Redemption BC Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I just recently bought an Xbox One and picked up a physical copy of RDR to play. However, when I inserted the disc, nothing happened. I tried for about an hour and still no success. I contacted the support via phone and live chat, and they sent me through the steps of&nbsp;resetting my xbox (twice) and still no luck. We figured it must have been a problem with the disc, although it was brand new and worked on a friends console. So, I returned it and picked up another copy. The exact same thing is happening, nothing. So, I figured I'd come to the forums for help this time around.</p>

<p>Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says <br />
RealTek High&nbsp;Definition Audio&nbsp;(that is an example and yours may have an <br />
entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - <br />
write down version.&nbsp;Now Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as <br />
MS is far behind certifying drivers.&nbsp;<strong>Then RIGHT CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;-
</strong><br />
<strong>REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack</strong>.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go <br />
to right click on&nbsp;and RUN AS ADMIN (This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each <br />
driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation
<br />
and the reboot to see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the <br />
install&nbsp;- reboot&nbsp;until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many <br />
rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
</span></span></span><br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using <br />
the methods above&nbsp;is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker <br />
and Device makers are found)<br />

            Hi Deep 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Since Skype account is attached to your Microsoft account, then Microsoft account will also get closed if you close your Skype account which means all your Microsoft services will be impacted. Hence, it is not recommended to close a Skype account.
<br />
<br />However process to close Skype account is below (if you need)

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>The 'support' page tells me that if I log in, select a topic, and keep pressing next, I will be offered a live chat option. That has not happened despite me trying many times. 'Ask the community' seems to be the only option. Can anyone help?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Joseph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me. My audio is working in other applications just not Skype. So, I make a Skype call, can hear the person at the other end, but they can't hear me.</p>
<p>1. I tried the echo test call, which confirmed that audio on my side wasn't working&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I'm on a MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2014), OSX El Capitan 10.11.6</p>
<p>3. I have Skype&nbsp;Version 7.58 (501)</p>
<p>4. Not getting any error messages, just finding that the people at the other end can't hear me</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            Hi <strong>Yogalady,</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
Windows 7 is pre-installed with .NET Framework 3.5. I suspect that in this case this feature is turned off.
<br />
Let us cross check this setting and verify if it helps.<br />
<br />
You may also check if this feature of Windows is turned off.<br />
1. Go to Start and in the search type "Turn Windows features On or Off".<br />
2. Click on "Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1".<br />
3. Expand "Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1" and place a check mark on 2 options listed.<br />
4. Restart the Computer.<br />
For more help refer to the following the article:<br />

<br />

Hope it helps.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft community!<br />
You've reached the right forum for your question. As I understand, the system stuck at 15% during Windows 8 upgrade. I would suggest you to follow the troubleshooting steps to check if it helps.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
I would suggest you to disconnect all the external devices except Monitor, keyboard and mouse and restart the computer. Check if the issue persists.
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
I would suggest you to delete all the temporary files on the computer and check:<br />
a. Open Run by pressing Windows key + R on the computer.<br />
b. Type “%temp%” and press Enter.<br />
c. Delete all the files.</div>
<div><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong><br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why you are experiencing a BSOD issue with your computer. These may include an outdated device driver or corruption within your system files. Answering the following questions may help us in uncovering the underlying cause of the
 issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Were there any changes made on your computer prior to the issue?</li><li>Were you able to install all pending updates on your computer?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you already performed?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, we recommend following the steps provided from this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/14238/windows-10-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> in order to troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p>

<p>1. It tends to happen shortly after various updates, but that is not always the cause.</p>
<p>2. It automatically does so.</p>
<p>3. I've looked at the linked article. I've checked for updates, updated my driver, Windows Defender constantly says that my system is fine, and I have previously toggled fast startup already. I have also used the command prompt to run "sfc /scannow" and
 "chkdsk".</p>

<p>I'll try that at some point. I did notice something while looking through Event Viewer, though. The crashes seemed to coincide with the day I downloaded the game System Shock 2 from the Twitch desktop client (I obtained the game for free via the Twitch Prime
 program). I've uninstalled System Shock 2 in order to see if that has any impact whatsoever.
</p>
<p>At the very least, the install date listed in "Apps and features" seem to correspond to the first time this crash happened. Looking in Event Viewer, the crash itself has these details:</p>

            I will, yes. The fact that it may have caused the crashes is confusing, though. Twitch is a trusted streaming service and I can't imagine why a game distributed via their Twitch Prime program would cause issues (the program itself is a sort of partnership
 between the Twitch streaming service and Amazon's Prime membership thing). Maybe the game just doesn't like Windows 10 very much? It
<em>is </em>from 1999.

<p>Due to technical advancement, the program may have not been updated recently thus, problems like BSOD may arise due to incompatibility issues.

<p>I just looked into this. It looks like Adrenalin is buggy to some degree. Not sure how much it's been patched but the thread I found recommended rolling back to Crimson:&nbsp;https://community.amd.com/thread/224061</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will admit that I'm not 100% sure if Adrenalin is entirely related but it could be. Based on this search on the AMD site forums, however, it's likely the cause: https://community.amd.com/community/support-forums/drivers-software/content?query=atikmdag.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>Part of my unsurety, however, comes from the fact that my first crash predates Adrenalin's release.</p>

<h2>            usb&#47;bluetooth mouse not working.</h2>
                    
<p><span><strong>I have a mobile memory 8000 mouse that for some reason isn't working. The issue started yesterday after I used WUBI to install ubuntu alongside vista. When I booted back into vista my mouse wasn't working. The cursor doesn't
 move and it doesn't respond to clicks. I have tried it in both wired and bluetooth modes with the same results. I uninstalled and then reinstalled an updated version of intellipoint. I uninstalled all the mouse related or possibly mouse related drivers I could
 find through device manager and let them reinstall on a reboot. The computer recognizes that the mouse is there, it says everything is working correctly and up to date. Any ideas on what might be causing this?</strong></span></p>
<p>Edit: I have also tried uninstalling Ubuntu with no effect. Device manager and intellipoint still say all the drivers are working and up to date and the mouse is working as well. Using mousinfo no movement or clicks from the mouse are detected by it.</p>

<h2>            Possible malfunction in xbox caption management</h2>
                    <p>Hi i'm IceKoolWolf3000 as i'm known on xbox live. I'm also an xbox ambassador. Lately i've discovered/noticed a not so good function in y (manage captures) option on my xbox one. When i'm recording my game play and caturinga game pic shot the game clips
 and capture section tend to become filled 2 capacity where i'd get a message during gaming that i need to delete some of them before any new captures can be saved/stored. The problem begins when I go 2 "manage captures" I play each one before I dicide 2 delete
 or share them, but before I could finish sharing a game clip while it's playing the screen automatically goes back 2 the xbox home screen and with a lenghty delay at&nbsp; a blank screen I may add. Now is this normal, or is it because of any xbox updates that may
 be causing this "malfunction" or is it time for an xbox overhaul????😣😩 This is fuustraating. Can anyone respond 2 this problem to which i'm serching 4a soolution that may help others in the future who may encounter the same problem.. Thx🐺👍</p>

<p>Hello Michael!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a few things as far as capturing goes:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Clip resolution is fixed at 4K HDR for certain games on Xbox One X—even if you’ve selected a lower default resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">At 4K HDR, game clips can be up to 30 seconds when capturing to your console’s internal storage.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">To allow longer clips for the game you’re playing now, or to record at lower resolution, turn off HDR in&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Display &amp; sound</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Video output</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Advanced
 video settings</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Another way to record longer clips is to capture to external storage. Press the&nbsp;<strong>Xbox</strong>&nbsp;button&nbsp;&nbsp;to open to guide, then go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Preferences</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Broadcast
 &amp; capture</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Capture location</strong>. Depending on available storage, external clips can be as long as 60 minutes.&nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Not sure if this was the exact answer you were looking for but I'm still researching any possible solutions.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> lkkc62  say:</h3>
<h2>            Jan 23, 2018 Wind 10 Pc Slow Crashing -System Restore err 0x80070017 &#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Good Day,&nbsp; </p>
<p>Jan 10 the story begins, PC HP Pavilion Slimline (I bought brand new in 2011- lite user, don't add a lot of programs, just running simple already installed software) running Win 10 (that loaded all by itself over a year ago when the automatic upgrades happened)
 I believe it had an operating system of Win 7 or 8 when it was bought... was running suitable, other than Chrome&nbsp; crashing...I'd lost Firefox a month or so prior...so I decided to do a defrag. all optimized...I restarted a few times, then wanted to upgrade
 iTunes (so I could add CD's to my music) but it wouldn't work, kept getting an error message that it couldn't find the proper extension winpack to install...so deleted itunes off the computer. Also had an old HP printer 8500 all in one, that I no longer had,
 deleting the software for that too, I do know how to delete program software, with no problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried several more times to get chrome on put it would not load so I settle for the 'e' Microsoft Edge that I believe comes with Win 10. The computer was slow, but usable, I could live with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Internet and other programs started freezing so I thought it might help to load one of the recommended PC 'DriverSupport' on 1-14 and Speedy Fixer on 1-17 that Microsoft suggested on Microsoft website I did do a search for the issue I was having and
 those were recommended, I loaded the software, paid the fee and ran them, not much changed so I cancelled the subscription and uninstalled those programs once I got my funds back.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then Jan 25 I sat at the PC (I usually put it to sleep, not shutdown and restart it only a couple times a week, I heard that was best) and the PC must have frozen sometime between 12pm and 8am. So I did a force restart by unplugging the machine
 (yes I know you are not supposed to do that) but nothing else was working. PC came on and was really really slow, so slow that it takes 30 min to restart.&nbsp; I have been attempting for the last 3 days to look thru the entire computer following all the instructions
 that are provided and finally decided to do a restore. The restore would not go back to Jan 11, thinking I'd go back to the iTunes uninstall...but I could only go back to the 19 when I uninstalled the hp printer software.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then my PC will not work proper, that was Jan 26.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just did a restore 2x and an error message came up that read&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Restore did not complete successfully. Your computer's system files and settings were not changed.</p>
<p>Details:</p>
<p>System Restore failed to extract the original copy of the directory from the restore point.</p>
<p>Source: %ProgramFiles%\WindowsApps</p>
<p>Destination: AppxStaging</p>
<p>An unspecified error occurred during System Restore. (0x80070017)</p>
<p>
</p><p>help help help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not have funds to take it to a store for any computer man to work on, please if anyone can provide instruction or talk me thru the issue I can listen. I used to work at HP in the late 90's till 2004 I worked in networking, but so much has changed and
 what we did then doesn't seem to work now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks so much!! LC</p>

            Hi LC.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.
<br />
<br />I would run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Is this still a Factory Install with an Upgrade on top of it?   
<br />
<br />Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>thank you greg,</p>
<p>I'm currently saving every to an external drive and was considering doing a complete reinstall. I can't find the original cd's that came with the computer. so i considered what MS said to do was a total reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I can't even see email, I'm on another computer in the house ((A MAC) that I can read email) to see your message. Hopefully after the move of all the doc's from the HD to the external drive, i can follow the suggestion. lc</p>

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            You don't need to read the email, just Sign In to your account in Microsoft Community at <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/</a> and read this thread under the History list at the bottom.   
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy.

    <title>Unable to manage &#47; uninstall &#47; launch game after patch - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to manage &#47; uninstall &#47; launch game after patch download</h2>
                    
<p>I've enjoyed my Xbox One trouble-free since launch. I've also been enjoying The Division since it's release with zero issues. That all changed yesterday.</p>

<p>Upon returning from a vacation I launched the game and was prompted to download a patch. Once the patch completed, the game would no longer launch. It would pop up the title screen and then immediately drop back to the home screen. Over the course of trying
 to launch the game I've had multiple issues:</p>

<p>- Game just drops back to home screen</p>
<p>- Prompted with errors (neither code is recognized on Xbox.com support article database)</p>
<p>- At one point lost the option to 'manage' game at all (had to navigate to system/storage and from there I could at least manage)</p>
<p>- System wouldn't let me uninstall any games at all until performing multiple hard-resets</p>
<p>- Attempt to launch game and it takes me to the store page and "Install" is an available option. I click on install and then it spins indefinitely with no progress (I've let this go on for two hours to no avail)</p>

<p>I have tried everything I can think of so far:</p>
<p>- Have fully reset console multiple times (have held down power 10+ seconds, have also unplugged power brick for a few minutes, etc..)</p>
<p>- I have already uninstalled the complete game and re-downloaded it&nbsp;(took 7 hours to download).&nbsp;&nbsp; **My console also inexplicably loses the ability to uninstall games, took multiple tries/resets to finally get Division to even uninstall</p>
<p>- I tried clearing alternate mac addresses/reset per some other forum tips I found with similar issue</p>
<p>- I have removed/re-added my account to the console</p>
<p>- I have disconnected / reconnected the external HDD</p>
<p>- I have removed from external and re-installed on internal HDD. Same results. Sometimes it tells me there's not enough space (console shows over 175GB free, over 1.5TB free on external)</p>
<p>System/storage shows a mysterious Division file on the internal HDD but i'm unable to uninstall it. Nothing happens. The full game is located on the external HDD. Yesterday I uninstalled from external and re-downloaded to internal but still wouldn't work.
</p>

<p>I suspect that the Division patch failed to fully download/install/apply and as a result has left the game in a broken state and perhaps left bits in some temporary cache that's causing cascading issues. Still, I'd expect a full uninstall/re-download to
 fix such an issue but it has not. So far support doesn't seem to have an escalation process applicable to this issue.
</p>
<p>The only thing I've yet to do is a full factory restore of the console itself which I'm dreading but starting to feel desperate and frustrated enough to do. I'd need to wipe all content as that'd be the only way to make sure the mysterious Division scraps
 are wiped away. Then, based on how long it took to just re-download the 32GB of the Division yesterday, I should have my entire game library back in about 20 days of continuous non-stop downloading. :(&nbsp;

<p>After reading your post I headed to the Division page and found out that this issue regarding Xbox one players is recognized and will be soon addressed by the publisher. This is the statement released by Ubisoft regarding this issue:</p>
<p>"Some of you reported that their characters went missing after Update 1.1. Our team has identified and fixed the source of this issue to ensure that your characters could be correctly restored.</p>
<p>The issue was caused by a malfunctioning server that couldn’t synchronize character data correctly and corrupted them instead. The game client was unable to read this corrupted data, and simply assumed that the character didn’t exist. Once this has been
 identified, we were able to restore the server to its normal functions, thus ensuring that the issue will no longer occur for other players.</p>
<p>For those who experienced the issue: your character is not gone. We are currently working on a fix that should make it available shortly. Implementing this fix will require a server downtime, and we will let you know when we are ready to perform it.</p>
<p>Please note however that in order to make your character available, we will need to restore the latest uncorrupted save of your entire account, which happened during the server maintenance of April 12. In other words, your character will be back just as
 you left it on April 12 at 9am CEST | 3am EDT | 12am PDT. You will lose any progress made on this character or any other one from the same account between April 12 and the next maintenance.</p>
<p>We apologize for the inconvenience and want to thank you for your understanding and your help in identifying this issue"</p>

<p>I recommend you to Restore Console to Factory defaults....but don't worry, it is not a complete default. There is actually an option that does not delete the games and apps, only the OS and possible corrupted data.</p>

<p>Big thanks to Jeff on Xbox support chat for spending nearly 90 minutes trying every possible work through. As expected the only real recourse was a full factory reset of the console and then re-downloading The Division.</p>
<p>Thankfully, that worked. And I was able to move everything else to external to avoid having to re d/l it all.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you guys for your recommendations/help! I wasn't aware of a Division character problem but I don't think that was my issue. I'm 99% certain that the patch download failed to complete/install properly and corrupted my game locally. At one point
 I could see game files showing up on both my internal and external drives. I was unable to uninstall the mysterious file that kept showing up on my internal HDD thus needed to go with the full restore/erase to make sure it was purged.&nbsp; It was. :D
</p>
<p>As a side benefit, I had been unable to uninstall several games from my internal HDD, including Titanfall which I haven't played in maybe 2 years, so this at least freed up that space again too.
</p>
<p>Appreciate the help!</p>

<h2>            No audio on Asrock 990FX Extreme3 MB w&#47;Realtek High Def &#34;speakers&#34;</h2>
                    <p>This all started after i update the bios and drivers for my motherboard from the manufactures website, its also in conjuction with a windows update. In my sound control panel the speakers for my monitor were controlled by "Speakers Realtek High Def Audio"
 .. This was always my default device. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In the list I also have </p>
<p>
</p><p>Nvidia HDMI Output Ports 0-3 (ALL "NOT PLUGGED IN")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Realtek Digital Output</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speakers 2-Logitech G35 Headset</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I can hear any audio is to set my audio default device to the Logitech G35 Headset. All other configurations I have tried do not work. I have went to device manager and uninstalled Realtek's drivers, updated drivers, etc.. I have tried most
 of the fixes I have seen on these forums and nothing is working to restore sound to my two monitor speakers. I have always just had the HDMI cable coming from my Nvidia Graphics card and it plugs into the back of my HANS-G 28'' monitor. As long as "Speakers
 Realtek High Def Audio" was the default device I could hear sound. Now since the updates I have no sound and when I do these restarts after uninstalling audio drivers Windows will default sound back to the USB headset everytime. Im ready to call it quits as
 I just tinkered around for almost two weeks to find a workaround for my monitor not having the correct resolution detected. It still isnt detected and I had to find a loophole to get it to work. Does anyone out there know what the hell is going on???
</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: When i ran windows 7 my monitor was correctly displayed as a Hans-G monitor. It displayed in the correct resolution and I had sound. Not sure if this has anything to do with the problem but unfortunately the manufacturer of my monitor does not seem
 to be in buisness anymore and there are no drivers out there to download. I also have downloaded and ran latest Realtek Win10 drivers in compatibility mode and tried setting the driver to just a generic high def audio device.. No sound.. Please Help</p>

<p><span>Hi Peter Kornfeld,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Did you install the chipset/LAN drivers after installing Windows 7?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d suggest you to check if Internet connectivity is working fine in&nbsp;<strong>Safe<span>&nbsp;
</span>mode with Networking</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart your computer
 and before Windows logon screen appears press F8 continuously which would bring&nbsp;<strong>“Advanced Boot”</strong> options.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Please select&nbsp;
<strong>“Safe mode with networking”</strong> and hit enter to start your computer in Safe mode with networking.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>After you login in
 safe mode with networking, check if the issue is persisting.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong><span>
 is a Diagnostic Mode of Microsoft Windows Operating System running with minimal set of services and drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link below for more information,</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, run the Internet Connectivity troubleshooter. It will help determine and guide you
 to diagnose your Internet Connection issue. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click the&nbsp;
<strong>Start</strong> button, click <strong>Control</strong> <strong>Panel</strong></span><strong><span>‌</span></strong><span>,
 and then, in the search box, type&nbsp;<strong>troubleshooter</strong>. Click <strong>
Troubleshooting</strong>, click&nbsp;<strong>Connect</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>
the&nbsp; </strong><strong>Internet</strong>, and follow the on-screen wizard instructions. For more information please see</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>Using

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you! Unfortunetly the safe mode does not helped me.</p>
<p>When I am in safe mode I have no red X on the network icon so naturaly the troubleshooter finds nothing. The problem is that also in normal mode, when I have the red X, it finds nothing.</p>
<p>The only difference I saw that in safe mode I have no 'Home Group: Joined' on the 'Network and Sharing Center' page... but removing the Home Group not seems to change anything...</p>
<p>And, yes I installed the original LAN driver from Intel's dvd that came with my motherboard then run a update session to let windows update if any (I can't remember if there was a update...)</p>

<h2>            iTunes Toolbar Miniplayer Not Working &#91;SOLVED&#93;</h2>

<p><strong>Solution: Follow the specific uninstall&nbsp;/ reinstall instructions here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204275</strong></p>
<p><strong>Also use a registry cleaner after you've uninstalled (I used CCLEANER). I hope this saves someone else from a headache.

<p>
</p><p>I'm having an issue with iTunes taskbar player working. When you right click taskbar &gt; Toolbars &gt; iTunes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I minimize iTunes, it shows the player, but it doesn't allow me to do anything.

<p>Hello :)</p>
<p>I have uninstalled iTunes, then reinstalled. Still doesn't work.</p>
<p>When I click on the mini player, I'm able to adjust the volume rocker, and when I press the buttons there is no response.</p>

            Just adding a note that 12.3.3 seems to no longer have this bug, but there are issues with the miniplayer when not using the toolbar minimized. The same behavior too - May be related..

<p>Yes, it is.&nbsp; It's safe to delete all of the items that Disk Cleanup shows.</p>
<p>If you upgraded the computer from a previous version of Windows, <em>Previous Windows Installation(s)</em> &nbsp;will contain files from that installation.&nbsp; To see the files, look in the folder&nbsp;<em>C:\Windows.old</em> .&nbsp; If you need any of the files, such as
 your <em>My Documents</em> folder from Windows XP, copy them to another location before running Disk Cleanup.</p>

<h2>            Need help with fresh windows 10 install on newly built pc</h2>
                    <p>My son and I have built pc with intel 8700k i7 cpu, gigabyte gaming 5 z370 mobo, samsung 970 nvme ssd (m.2), team t force 16 gb x 2 ddr4 ram, gibabyte ti1070 gpu and have fresh windows 10 usb flash drive with activation code for install.&nbsp; We powered on and
 got initial windows 10 install options (i.e. english, etc), but then got a corrupted file 0x080070570 error.&nbsp; Tried to reboot and now I no longer get option to load drivers, or repair.&nbsp; Rather, if I select correct boot device I get BSOD with stop code of PAGE

<p>
</p><p>It seems like windows only partially installed, but I cannot get past the BSOD. I tried removing one of the ram sticks and also changing channels of ram sticks, but this did not help at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Hi<br />Probably the drive you used for installation or the ISO file was corrupted. Can you use another drive, create it bootable and then try to boot the computer? No need to boot to the partially installed OS.<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a><br /><br /> Disclaimer:<br />This is a non-Microsoft website which would provide accurate and safe information.

            I used usb drive purchased from Microsoft, so a bit doubtful that that would be corrupted. &nbsp;Also not sure if i could download another copy of the OS to different flash drive with same activation key?

            It might be the case the destination drive might be faulty.
<br />Do the installation without the product key again through a spare drive and if it successfully installs, ask Microsoft about a replacement for the drive.

<h2>            Password loop on resetting password. Cannot remember password and cannot reset &#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Cannot remember password, OR typed it in wrong on both entries. When I use the tool for recovering/resetting the password. The system takes me to a reset function, where I am able to put in a new password twice, but the screen that follows does not show
 successful entry, but rather one block asking me to enter the old password. Cannot break this loop. Have been running W10 for 2-3 months and cannot roll back computer.<br />
<br />
Cannot understand why system calls for "old password" when I do not know the old password, which is the reason for trying to create a new one.<br />
<br />
Please some help to recover the password, OR remove the Windows Live account logging on<br />
<br />
Settings show I am using the Microsoft Server, but I cannot download from the Store.
<br />
<br />
Although this password problem is recent, I have never been able to get to the store.
<br />
<br />
I created a whole new Live Account, but I cannot break into the login process to change the user. Also can do contro-alt-del, to switch user, but this also does not work.

    <title>Fuzzy white screen on startup, fuzzy green screen on videos - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> baleron83  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fuzzy white screen on startup, fuzzy green screen on videos</h2>
                    
<p>So I've been researching this issue since I bought my xbox a few months ago and haven't had any luck finding anyone with a similar issue or any solutions that work for me. My xbox will load to a white static filled screen for about 30 seconds before it loads
 properly, which is fine because in the end it does work but I thought I'd add that since it might point to an underlying issue. The main issue is that any video I try to play, whether it's a preview or live stream from the store or netflix or anything in between
 will only load a fuzzy green screen. Playing a dvd or bluray disc will show part of the screen interlaced with green blocks. The audio works fine for each video and the network never has any issues. I've tried a lot of the suggested video fixes such as testing
 multiple hdmi cables, clearing the cache, deleting my profile and reinstalling, and even a factory reset. Nothing works. Actual game play is perfect, I've never had any issues with any games whether from a disc or direct from the hdd. I'm at a loss here, help?</p>

<h2>            Undetected Virus&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I'm wondering if I have a virus on my computer than none of my anti-virus programs (AVG and Windows Defender) have been unable to detect. My screensaver seldom comes on, and when it does, sometimes it goes back off without me touching the computer. Other
 times, my computer goes into sleep mode and it hasn't been long since I was on the computer. There are times when I'm not using my computer that it makes noises like it's working hard. Oh, and although I've tried to delete as much as I can from my computer,
 it seems like it does not make a difference in available space. When I scan with AVG &amp; Windows Defender, they say everything is okay. I also downloaded a malware thing from Microsoft, and it didn't find any problems, either.</p>
<p>About a month ago, AVG detected three trojan horse viruses. They were in a temp file, so I was able to get rid of them by deleting them from that file and then emptying my recycle bin. Is it possible they're still lurking somewhere affecting things? I know
 that those trojan horse viruses messed up my picture files.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>Note the following three points:</p>
<p>1. AVG is an anti-virus program, but Defender is <strong>not</strong>. Defender is an<br />
anti-spyware program.&nbsp; Viruses and spyware are two different types of<br />
malware (MALicious softWARE).</p>
<p>2. Besides being an anti-virus program, AVG also checks for spyware.<br />
So since it largely duplicates what Defender does, it turns Defender<br />
off. As a result, you are running AVG, but not Defender.</p>
<p>3. AVG isn't a terrible anti-virus, but it's a not a great one either.<br />
Here are my standard recommendations:</p>
<p>For an anti-virus program, I recommend eSet NOD32, if you are willing<br />
to pay for it. If you want a free anti-virus, I recommend one (do not<br />
run more than one) of the following three:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Avira AntiVir<br />
Avast<br />
Microsoft Security Essentials<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You also need anti-spyware software. I recommend that you download and<br />
install (freeware) MalwareBytes AntiMalware.</p>

<p>I can't be sure of course, but those symptoms don't sound like a virus<br />
nor any other kind of malware.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Normally when you delete a file it doesn't disappear, it goes into the<br />
recycle bin, so you can change your mind and get it back if necessary.<br />
So no free space is gained.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Exactly <strong>what</strong> was the "malware thing" you downloaded?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About a month ago, AVG detected three trojan horse viruses. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A clarification on the terminology: there's no such thing as a "trojan<br />
horse virus." A Trojan Horse is one kind of malware, and a virus is<br />
another kind of malware.</p>
<p>Can you tell us what the names of these Trojan Horses were?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Is it possible? Yes it's possible. But from what you've described<br />
above, it doesn't sound likely.</p>
