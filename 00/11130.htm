<h2>            Is there any update about issue &#34;</h2>
                    <p>It's been about 10 months from this issue occured. Is there any update about it?</p>
<p>Currently, I'm force to&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Close OneDrive&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Open Excel/Word/PowerPoint and edit documents&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Close&nbsp;Excel/Word/PowerPoint and start OneDrive for sync&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's nonsense at all, if i must do it like this, an FTP solutio will be better than this.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Long,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The article you provided is the known issue that is still under the process to get fixed. However, there are other possible cause of a read-only file. We can check some information below to see if you are meeting the known issue or other issues.</span></p>
<p><span><span>For example, 3</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup></span><span> antivirus, you can temporarily close any to see the result.
</span></p>
<p><span>In the meantime, it seems you are using OneDrive to sync changes. What if you open the file within from Office programs directly (not from OneDrive sync folder)?</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, do you meet any error message? You can provide us the screenshot about that.
</span></p>
<p><span>Last, a co-authoring problem may cause a file to be read-only as well. For example, you are using the Office client version not supporting co-authoring while the file is being edited by others, then you will meet read-only problem. The feature is working
 well in monthly channel but not for semi-annual channel.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Rena</span></p>
<p>

            Just saw that one, thanks, KB4469342 downloaded. Must be another test CU again, nothing on Microsoft Catalog. Good to see MS finally using the Preview Ring now for the second time.

            So the previous update moved to .165 and this one only moves it to .167..&nbsp; Maybe just a modified prior update?&nbsp; The public never got the .165 version, at least as of this morning.

<h2>            Contacting Customer Support</h2>
                    <p>I have a PAID subscription to a Skype number AND a calling plan. I have tried to contact support on the following issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>No more customized incoming voice mail message</p>
<p>
</p><p>WRONG times (and days) on voice mail messages</p>
<p>
</p><p>NO e-mail notifications on voice mail messages</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype window cannot be closed. The CLOSE X just minimizes it, leaving it to take up memory unnecessarily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to support, I get routed around and around and can NEVER get to any way to actually contact anyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering that I am PAYING for the service, customer support should be available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the support forums but they do NOT seem to be monitored by anyone from Skype/Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a Microsoft "Insider" I am extremely frustrated. I can only conclude that they WANT to alienate customers and have them leave.</p>
<p>
The topic choices I am forced to use do NOT cover the issues I am experiencing, so I am selecting all of them.</p>

<h2>            sharepoint 2013 intermittent webpage error and have to manual update WOPI proof key</h2>
                    <p>
hi all experts,&nbsp; my current Sharepoint 2013 sometimes (probably every month at least 1 incident) the business user complaint the sharepoint "down" and after checking is because the wopi key not updated daily for unknown reason.&nbsp; &nbsp;So the only workaround i know
 is to manually update&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Update-SPWOPIProofKey ... so i would like to know any permanent fix to avoid this issue?&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
My current WOPI Discovery synchronization schedule is every 30 minutes.&nbsp; &nbsp;Please advise if i should change this?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Raymond,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a lot of similar threads in our forum and we understand the confusion. This forum focus on code-free SharePoint Online issues. TechNet has categories for SharePoint Server and customizations in SharePoint that need scripts.</p>

    <title>Mirror &#40;two-way&#41; data entry with condition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ignasvitalis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mirror &#40;two-way&#41; data entry with condition</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am trying to solve a complex problem for which I need a reasonable macro. You can download a sample excel sheet very similar to what im working with in the link below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>https://1drv.ms/x/s!AgcnhTO-WExMdfDU3ra-tjo-MxI</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have one large sheet where part of data is written by hand, part is formula-based and protected, part is dropdown-entered. There are multiple columns, last column is AG, but there are only a few that matter for this problem. One row corresponds to a contract
 made to sell a specific object. Various columns provide different information about this contract, such as date, type of contract, type of object, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Column B corresponds to the type of contract signed and there are three possibilities, Early, Mid, Final contract (EC, MC, FC). EC is signed when a buyer wants time to think about buying the object. He pays the Early Amount (EA) (Column P) for the seller
 to hold the object for him for some time. MC is an agreement to sign the Final contract at a later date, on specific terms. On signing MC the buyer pays the seller the Mid Amount (MA) (Column Q). FC is what it is, its the final agreement where parties agree
 on the actual exchange of the object for the Final Amount (FA) (Column N).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The amounts (EA,MA,FA) are ENTERED after SIGNING the contract, NOT after RECEIVING the money. Also, FA is actually agreed upon every time any of the three contracts are signed, but the actual amount the seller will be RECEIVING will always be only FA, after
 FC is made. Nevertheless, FA is entered after each type of contract is made. For example, EC is made, seller receives EA, and FA is agreed upon - the corresponding sheet entry would be EA to Column P, FA1 to Column N. Then, say MC is signed, entry would be:
 MA to Column Q, FA2 to Column N. Then, say, FC is made, entry would be: FA3 to Column N.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some limitations for the contracts: FC cannot be followed by EC or MC, as FC is the final contract. MC cannot be followed by EC, but can be (and will be) by FC. EC can be followed by either MC or FC. So, if EC is signed first, the parties can either
 sign MC before going to FC, or go straight to FC. Also, there may not be EC or MC at all, and parties can jump to FC straight away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A very important detail is that when one contract FOR THE SAME OBJECT is followed by another contract (e.g. EC followed by MC), then another row is NOT added, but instead, in Column B EC is changed to MC. If, say then FC is made, then MC will be changed
 to FC, in the same row. So, each row will always correspond to only one unique object. After the FC is made, this row will remain, and other contract specs will be added to other rows for other objects.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, the entries being made that I have discussed to Columns B (Contract type), N (FA), P (EA) and Q (MA) are made by Staff1. There is also Staff2 whose job is to fill other columns about the contract. Staff2 are basically accountants who want to know
 what the EA/MA/FA are so that they can forecast cash flows into the future and calculate how much is owed. For that there is Column AA, which, for now, uses a formula, which checks the latest contract signed (EC,MC or FC) and then based on that, takes the
 corresponding amount from the correct amount column (P (EA) if its EC, Q (MA) if its MC and N (FA) if its FC). The problem is that sometimes the entries of EA, MA and FA (Columns P,Q and N) made by Staff1 are not correct and Staff2 wants the option to change
 these entries. They could simply change values in those columns, but since the whole sheet is long and their info is on the right side of the sheet, they would have to slide each time to change the values, which is slightly inconvenient (The actual sheet is
 much longer than the example one).</p>
<p>Therefore, I need a macro which would change values in Column AA after Columns P/Q/N are changed, and also values in Columns P/Q/N would be changed after entry to AA. As mentioned, AA corresponds to the amount of the latest contract signed. So, there may
 be values in Columns P/Q, however if its FC made, then Column N (FA) has to be changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried to solve this problem partially with a macro I found on the internet, but it doesn't fully solve the problem. It basically syncs and mirrors Columns N and AA, so if either is changed, the other follows. The problem with that, besides not capturing
 Columns P and Q, is that if two or more cells are deleted at once, then the corresponding side doesnt update, and you have to double click a cell for the update to happen. Also, if you change a cell it updates the whole column, whereas I would like it to only
 update the cell being changed at that time to avoid the risk of messing up the data. The macro is embedded in the example worksheet, but I put it in the Module1, instead of Sheet1, to retain the formulas in AA for you to see as well as the macro.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Id really appreciate if someone could help me solve this problem.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p />

<p><span><span>A very detailed</span> <span>description</span><span>,</span> <span>
unfortunately,</span> <span>very confusing</span> <span>because it contains</span>
<span>a lot of details</span> <span>that are not relevant</span> <span>for a programmer</span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>But your understanding problem is clear, so I can give you a simple sample how to accomplish a change of a cell based on other cells in the same row.</span></span></p>
<p>You know the simple Pythagoras formula <strong>a² + b² = c²</strong> and my sample shows how to have 3 cells in a sheet and calculate this without a formula&nbsp;<span><span>back and forth</span></span>
 in a sheet in every row.</p>

<p>The sheet is protected (as yours), but you can also unprotect the sheet and write values in other columns or rows, doesn't matter for the code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest to start with that simple code, copy that into your sheet and establish the simple rules to calculate the value in AA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that you can go further with the other rules in one row. If you have that working then come back and we can talk about how to establish a rule that is affected by values of other previous rows (you said: "<em>FOR THE SAME OBJECT</em>").</p>

<h2>            nokia messaging registering problem</h2>
                    
<p>I had created a nokia email account and then removed it. I got an E63 and tried to get the free subscription and am frustrated with the following issue. When I try to sign up for a new account with the same email address, it tells me "The email address you
 entered is already registered to a Nokia Messaging account. Please log in to manage your account." An attempt to log in with the same address and password gives the error message "The user name and password you entered do not match any accounts on record.
 Please make sure that you have correctly entered the first email address you used when you signed up for Nokia Messaging. I also see that nokia has removed the ability to recover password altogether on email.nokia.com. Which other website has this "great feature"
 of not allowing a user to either re-register or recover the account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried nokia care line and everything, but nothing works. I feel like returning my E63 back. Is there a solution to this longstanding problem or not?</p>

<p>Column D returns the difference between B and C. I then need column E to return an ABS value for D based on the following: if Column A does not contain JPY it should multiply the result in Column D by 10000 and if column A does contain JPY it should multiply
 the result in D by 100.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore Row 1 Column E should return 5.2 and Row 2 Column E should return 1.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone able to help with this if it is possible please?</p>

            Hi. We can try fixing the "not up to date error message" first. Do you have a stable internet connection? To check, browse any websites using the phone's browser. Make sure also that your MS account's information&nbsp;is complete. You can also try resetting
 its password by going to this link: <a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.live.com/password/reset</a>. However, if you still wanted to&nbsp;it,&nbsp;you have to&nbsp;reset your phone to its&nbsp;factory settings.&nbsp;Doing that will delete all&nbsp;your saved data. Keep us posted.

<p>
</p><p>Samuel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to covert the file to all other formats - none will open it in the format I need. &nbsp;RTF worked, but all my formatting is lost and I really need to recover the doc in its current format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the background - was working in Word around 2 in the afternoon and paused (didn't close anything), came back around 5:30 to finish. &nbsp;Worked on the doc for about 20 minutes then went to save and the rainbow wheel of death came up. &nbsp;Had to re-boot and
 when I went back to the file after re-booting, none of the new work was saved, so I found a recovered file and loaded in on my desktop. &nbsp;Was able to open it, edited it, etc. &nbsp;Closed it, then went back and got the "file corrupt" message. &nbsp;Found another recovered
 file, did some edits and then had the same issue - closed it, then reopened to find it corrupted!! &nbsp;This is an extensively formatted document so I would really like to recover what ever I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there are some doc recovery software out there, but I don't like to load too much of that stuff on my Mac as I find that it tends to create issues down the road...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?? &nbsp;Here's my version info...</p>
<p>Microsoft Word for Mac 2011, Version 14.7.3</p>
<p>Thanks for any insights or help you can provided!</p>

<p><span>Hi Cjewett2,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please </span><span>try and perform the following steps to see if the document can be recovered:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Copy everything except the last paragraph mark to a new document.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>1. Open the document.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>2. On the&nbsp;<strong>Edit&nbsp;</strong>menu, click&nbsp;<strong>Select All</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>3. With the document selected, hold down the SHIFT key, and then press the LEFT ARROW key one time. (This removes only the last paragraph mark from the selection.) Release the SHIFT key.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>4. On the&nbsp;<strong>Edit</strong>&nbsp;menu, select&nbsp;<strong>Copy</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>5. On the&nbsp;<strong>File&nbsp;</strong>menu, select&nbsp;<strong>New Blank Document</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>6. In the new document, click&nbsp;<strong>Paste</strong>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<strong>Edit&nbsp;</strong>menu.&nbsp;<br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note</strong>&nbsp;In the new document, you may have to reapply section formatting or style formatting.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>7. Save the document and check if the issue occurs.
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these steps don’t work, please go to method 2.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Drag the document onto the <strong>TextEdit</strong> application.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>1. &nbsp;Click <strong>Finder </strong>&gt; <strong>Applications</strong> and locate the
<strong>TextEdit</strong> application.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>2. &nbsp;Open the folder which contains the document in Finder and drag the document onto the
<strong>TexEdit</strong> application and release to open it.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>3. &nbsp;Click <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Duplicate</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>4. &nbsp;Click <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save…</strong> &gt; select
<strong>Word 2007 (.docx) Document</strong> to save and check if the issue happens.
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>If these steps don’t work, please go to method 3.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Copy the undamaged parts of the file to a new file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes you can determine the location of damage in your file by looking at the file or by testing the file to determine where the problem behavior originates. Another way to determine what area of the file is damaged is to copy one page at a
 time or a series of pages into a new file. Save the new file, and then test for the problem behavior. If the behavior does not occur, continue to copy pages, saving the file and testing until the problem behavior recurs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; If you can determine what area of the file is damaged, you can then copy everything except the damaged part to a new file, and then follow these steps to reconstruct your document:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>1. Copy the undamaged part of your document and paste them into a new file. (You may not want to select the final paragraph mark of this selection, because that paragraph mark may contain problematic information).</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>2. Save a copy of the damaged document in text-only format.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>3. Open the text-only file.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>4. Copy the text from the file, and then paste it into the file that contains the undamaged part of your file.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>5. Reformat the sections of the document that you pasted in step 4, and then save the recovered document.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, please provide the following information to help troubleshoot:</span></p>
<p><span>1. A screenshot of the “file corrupt” message.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Your Mac OS version (e.g. 10.12.5).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<h3> chapelstboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            S40 call log complaint</h2>
                    
<p>Has anyone noticed that with recent S40 phones (eg 6600 slide, 6700), in the call log, when you have called / recieved a call from the same contact multiple times, you can only see the date/time/duration of the MOST RECENT event? In previous phones (eg 6300),
 you were able to see the date, time &amp; duration of the last 5 (I think) events from that one contact. Annoying much?</p>
<p>This should be changed, sometimes you need to know previous dates/time and call durations of people you have spoken to or tried to call!!</p>

            These new symbian phones are like that, they don't list the previous times of calls from/to the same person. Rather annoying. The older nokia phones used to show that. I hope ther realize this problem and fix it.

            Try to see if there isn't a way to access the log via the menu and not by pressing the call button. On newer S60 phones when you get to this log you just have to press the right navigation key to access a log with a lot more detail. I think it's the same

<p>I had already tried accessing the dialled numbers / received calls in this manner as well, and it still does not show the last 5 activities with the same contact as earlier S40 phones did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a major flaw in the design of the call log and needs to be fixed, there are many times when you need to know previous times you attempted to call a contact, or previous calls received from the same person.</p>

<p>I have investigated this (major) software bug and found the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you have called a contact that is stored in your phone using different numbers (eg called them on home number AND mobile number recenty), the call log will display all recent multiple calls.</p>
<p>The same applies if you have called the same contact's number but using a different notation (eg perhaps once using the standard national number, and another time using #31# to hide your own number sending).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOWEVER, the problem still remains that if calling a contact / receiving a call multiple times from the exact same number (as is often the case), multiple calls do not show up in the call log.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>### THIS IS A MAJOR GLITCH that no one seems to be aware of and needs to be fixed urgently!!! ####</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you need to see your prvious call history, you can simply call the contact with the #31# prefix and then hang up straigth away, when you go back to your call log you will see the last 5 calls made and/or received from that contact, not
 just the last one.</p>

<p>Further investigation reveals there are also issues with the call duration that is showed for calls in the call log/dialled numbers/received calls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes the correct call duration will be shown; other times a totally incorrect and random call duration is displayed; or it may display --:--:-- even though the call connected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will occur without even power cycling the phone (ie the duration of a particular call may change just by going out and back into the call list!).</p>
<p>Note that the handset being used is a 6700, V7.90&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly this is a software bug; taking the phone to a Nokia Care Centre would be a waste of time. Someone on the relevant team at Nokia needs to fix this problem urgently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note; the incorrect call duration will be displayed for an entry in the call log when you have
<em>first gone and selected "Details" for a given entry in the call log</em> (where multiple numbers eg mobile/home for the same contact have been dialled/received, as this is currently the only scenario that "Details" will be an option). You then go to view
 the call duration for a <em>totally separate</em> call (<em>without leaving the call log menu itself</em>) and an invalid, random call duration will be displayed.</p>
<p><br />
Definitely some software coding that needs fixing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Don't hold your breath sca393. I advised Nokia of this directly months ago and nothing has been done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now what even happens sometimes is that I will call someone in my contacts, and then amazingly if I look in my call log after I have completed the call it is not in the log at all, or it claims that I have dialled "no number"!! How can you dial a "no number",
 you can only receive these calls!!!!!</p>

            Hello JovsP, <br />
<br />
I understand that you are having an issue with Microsoft Outlook as you are returned with the following error:
<code>Error code: 0x80004005</code>. I know how annoying this can be and I will try my best to help you with this.
<br />
<br />
I am an Independent Advisor for MS Community and I am sorry to inform you that you have posted this thread in the wrong forum. The correct forum is
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum">
<em><strong>Office</strong></em></a><strong><em>&gt; <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook">
Outlook</a>.</em></strong> <em>(You don't have to create a new thread, simply edit the thread!)</em>
<br />
<br />
It is important that you post your thread in the correct forum so that users equipped with the right expertise can better serve you. Nonetheless, I can still try my best to help you with this.
<br />
<br />
In order for me to properly assist you, I need additional information from you: <br />
<br />
1. What is your antivirus? <br />
2. How long has this been an issue? <br />
3. How can you replicate this error? (usually: send or receive emails) <br />
4. Do you recall undertaking any recent change that could possibly result in this?
<br />
5. What are the troubleshooting steps have you taken thus far? <br />
<br />
Does it work in safe mode? <code>Win</code>+<code>R</code> and enter <code>Outlook /safe</code> If yes, please disable all add-ins.
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Depending on your answer to my question (3), we may need to remove and re-add the affected email accounts. Otherwise, try to create a new profile entirely and see if it resolves the problem.
<br />
<br />
If you have <strong>Northern antivirus</strong> installed in response to my question (1), then you can skip all the above suggestions and
<strong>disable the antivirus</strong> and try again. If it works, you can reinstate your antivirus but make sure "Enable Script Blocking" is
<strong>unchecked</strong>. <br />
<br />
Hope to hear from you soon, <br />
<br />
Sincerely, <br />
Sutharsan <br />

            Is the problem document-specific? In that case, the document may contain a protected content control.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if this happens with any document, either your Office installation is damaged or you are running an expired trial version. You can try repairing the installation by starting setup from Control Panel (the details depend on which operating
 system you are running).<br />
<br />
If you need a new version, you have to purchase one.<br />

    <title>Why does it take so long to open a spreadsheet&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jfieldingw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does it take so long to open a spreadsheet&#63;</h2>
                    Excel typically takes a few <i>minutes</i>&nbsp;to launch and open a spreadsheet. &nbsp;I double-click a spreadsheet (with no more than 7 columns, 30 rows) and I get the spinning beach ball for about two minutes while the spread sheet opens. &nbsp;Is this normal? &nbsp;It
 seems excessive for a simple, small spreadsheet with no (or one) formula.

            Your experience shows that open formats are not always the most desirable way to save files. The old format (.xls) is binary, meaning it is optimized for computer efficiency, not human readability. The open XML format (.xlsx) is designed so that humans
 can read the contents. If you change the file extension from .xlsx to .zip and double-click the zip file in Finder you can readily see and read the XML text files of which the workbook is comprised, and see the media files (if any) that are in your workbook,
 such as pictures and movies. <br />
<br />
The trouble is, text is a horrible way for computers to store complex files if speed is important to you, which seems to be the case here.
<br />
<br />
When you open a file saved in the old (.xls) format in Excel 2011, many commands are grayed out and there is a notice at the top of the workbook window that you are in "compatibility mode." Essentially, all features added to Excel since 1998 are turned off
 in compatibility mode. So saving in the old format may not be the best way around this problem.<br />
<br />
There is another new file format in Excel 2011 you may wish to try out. It lets you save in an efficient binary format, but doesn't disable any commands because this new format supports all the new features. Try saving your file using File &gt; Save As and in
 the Format pop-up choose Excel Binary Workbook (.xlsb).&nbsp; This format might give you the even better speed opening and saving as the old (.xls) format while avoiding compatibility mode.
<br />
<br />
Try saving your workbook in each of these formats. I expect you will find the following:<br />
.xlsx - largest file size, slowest to open and save<br />
.xls&nbsp;&nbsp; - smaller file size, faster to open and save<br />
.xlsb - smallest file size, fastest to open and save<br />
<br />
If your findings match my predictions, you can change your Excel preferences so that any new workbooks you make default to .xlsb. Go to Excel &gt; Preferences and click on Compatibility. In the Compatibility preferences dialog, in the Transition section, where
 it says Save files in this format, click the pop-up menu and choose Excel Binary Workbook.xlsb.<br />
<br />
Where I work we have standardized on .xlsb for Excel workbooks.<br />

<h2>            IE 11 won&#39;t open some links or show some videos</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running IE 11 on a windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit computer. In the last few weeks - seems like after the latest MS update KB3104002 - my IE program is exhibiting some strange and erratic behavior. It won't load certain webcam pages - no matter whether
 Active X Filtering is on or off. It also won't load certain links or allow some pop-ups like captcha boxes. I can't seem to resolve what the issue is, and would appreciate any help in figuring out what settings might need to be adjusted or changed to get it
 working properly again. It was working fine before the Dec 11 update - though there may have been some intermittent issues after the earlier KB310073 update as well - though I am noticing it a lot in the last 2-3 weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to corrupt Internet explorer files or settings. This may also happen due to website
</p>
<p>incompatibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to use steps provided in this article and check if it helps.<br />

            <p>Hello Ratandeep and thanks for the reply. I tried all of the things listed, as well as clearing cookies and uninstalling the latest 2 IE updates, and the problem still exists. There isn't even any Flash player-type box that needs to be activated - just a
 plain white page where the webcam should be. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am pretty frustrated with this as I had hoped that these steps would have helped. I guess I am just not going to use IE11 until a future update possibly fixes the problem.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

            <p>I am having the same problem on my IE 11, Win 7 Home Premium 64 bit desktop&nbsp;as LilyHNY. Many websites will not open certain links, or some pages on their websites are not "interactive" (e.g., hgtv, vons, target, mtw, shutterfly). I have a laptop which also
 runs IE 11, Win 7 Professional 64 bit, but it works fine. I have compared&nbsp;as many&nbsp;settings as I can imagine&nbsp;between my desktop and laptop and they all appear to be the same.&nbsp;What I find funny--but not so much--is that I tried using the two&nbsp;links provided by
 Ratandeep,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Microsoft Support pages open, but there is no content on them! I have read various other suggestions on various community forums&nbsp;from many frustrated folks, but none of the suggested fixes have helped&nbsp;(mostly aimed at blocked cookies or
 defective&nbsp;Java).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry that you seem to be having the same issue - I hope that someone does have a suggestion or solution as it is quite frustrating. Can you remember when yours started?&nbsp; I keep thinking it has something to do with one of the MS Security or IE updates, but
 can't quite pin down which one. I know things were all working fine not very long ago and suddenly this strange behavior started.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem and am unable to access Adobe Flash Videos on any website...&nbsp; This problem has been going on&nbsp;for several weeks but only in IE in which I have version 11.0.9600.18124.&nbsp; AF shows as being installed and active in my IE addons and whenever
 an Adobe Flash Player page comes up a box asks whether to allow flash videos to play.&nbsp; I answer allow and nothing happens - in fact that same window stays there until I either close it out or close out the&nbsp;open tab or IE&nbsp;itself...&nbsp; I have checked and all my

            <p>Mine is also version 11.0.9600.18124 - with the same behavior as Wade. It does say Flash is installed and active - but all I get is a white background - not even a box to ask for Flash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop also doesn't work right - on that I have version 11.0.9600.17959 as I had uninstalled the two latest KB updates for IE11 - one was KB3104002 - and that didn't help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ratandeep - thanks for the information - hardware acceleration IS already disabled, so that doesn't appear to be the problem either. I tried turning it on and off again - same thing both ways - and I did also just update Flash, too.</p>

<p>Having followed that thread earlier this week I went ahead and disabled Hardware Acceleration,&nbsp;that did not solve the problem, nor any of the other suggestions in that thread...&nbsp; Obviously there is a problem with IE as flash works on my other 2 browsers
 - Chrome and Firefox - and it probably has to do with some IE updates, however I do not know which ones.</p>

<h2>            Can I disable metro mode in ie10 &#63;  I use W8.</h2>
                    <p>I don't have touch screen and every time I click a link in Outlook it opens IE10 in Metro style. I then click settings and change it to desktop style.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life would be much simpler for me if I could either disable Metro or make Desktop always the default.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this possible ?</p>

<h2>            Logging in using Android app</h2>
                    
<p>I use Outlook 365 email on &nbsp;multiple devices. I have no trouble logging in on the Windows app for Windows 7 and 8, &nbsp;and no trouble logging in using Google Chrome on a Android phone - but logging into Android app on the same phone does not work. When I try

<p>Hi Albert,</p>
<p>Firstly, to better understand the situation, I’d like to collect the following information:</p>
<p>1. About “Android app” and the detailed steps of how you configure the account into the app, can you please share corresponding screenshots with us for analysis. After receiving them, we’ll do further investigate about this issue. To protect your privacy,
 please upload the screenshots to a workspace I have set up for you, I have sent you the login certificates of the workspace by private message. To access the private message, please click the following link:
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations<br />
2. Please try logging into OWA (<a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a>) with the same account in Windows machine to see if it works properly.</p>
<p>Moreover, based on my personal experience, if you're using Outlook for Android, on the first page of choosing accounts: If you choose “Office 365”, you need to login to with the account like *** Email address is removed for privacy *** or *** Email address is removed for privacy ***; If
 you choose “Outlook”, you need to login with *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Given this situation, please double check if you input the right account in the right place.
<br />
Also, we have a dedicated channel name in-app support which coping with Outlook for Android related issues, you can report this issue by clicking “<strong>Need Help? Contact support</strong>”.</p>
<p><strong>Note when using the in app support:</strong></p>
<p>1. It can take a while for a representative to get back to the user. It is recommended that the user turn on notifications for Outlook in order to know when the technician is available.</p>
<p>2. If you don’t have notifications turned on, then when the user opens the app again and goes to support, you will see a response from the technician.</p>
<p>3. It is recommended that the user’s initial question be as fully descriptive as possible of the situation.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Zoey</p>

<p>I initially tried logging in using "Outlook", but it didn't recognize my account info. I then tried logging in through "Office 365", and it did recognize my account, but it gives me an error message that my password does not meet requirements of my administrator
 - if that's true, then why was the password accepted at all when I created the account? The current password works fine when I login to Outlook through Google Chrome, and it works fine when I login through the Windows app on my work PC - but using the password
 in the Android app does not work.</p>

<p>hi albert,</p>
<p>thanks for the updates.</p>
<p>i understood that you're using outlook for android and after choosing “office 365” on the first page of choosing accounts, the error message "that microsoft account doesn't exist" doesn’t appear and the outlook for android can recognize the office 365 accounts
 now. however, there is a new error message after clicking <strong>sign in</strong>. please correct me if anything is misunderstood.</p>
<p>we could give different solutions based on the different error messages. so the screenshots of the error messages are very important for our analysis. please provide the following information so we can further assist you:</p>
<p>1. about “my password does not meet requirements of my administrator”, please share the screenshot of it for our further investigating. to upload screenshots, click
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> &gt; <strong>insert\ edit media</strong>.</p>

<p><br />
2. please try another android machine to see if the same error message appears.<br />
3. based on my personal experience, the issue may be related to mobile device mailbox policy settings, i need to confirm some admin settings in exchange admin center. may i know if you're an administrator of office 365 tenant, if no, please involve an administrator
 of office 365 tenant in your organization here.</p>
<p>we appreciate your time and continued efforts.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />

            This started to happen when the changeover to Outlook.com started to appear whenever I load my Outlook Live shortcut. I have been able to send to other mail. I believe this problem occurred when there was a problem with my Yahoo! mail connected account.
 It was not synching and showing as update in progress all the time. I ended up having to delete that sync and re-establish it as an IMAP connection to Yahoo!. I believe this one item in my draft folder a from my yahoo! account. Opening up the item in the draft
 folder does not give me the ability to replace the from so it's stuck there. I can't delete it although when I do it shows has having been deleted but at the next push it reappears in the folder. Any idea how to approach this and get rid of the item?

            <p>Have the same problem. It started on October 6th. Microsoft contacted me&nbsp;on the 9th&nbsp;and tried to fix it. On the 16th they went to "Level 3" and still could not fix. They&nbsp;(Global Escalation Services Technical and UR T3) now say they are testing a "fix" and
 will be releasing it globally in a few days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your response doesn't seem to even relate to&nbsp;DesShaw's problem. DesShaw can not delete "Drafts" and your "solution" is to send suggestions and feedback? How about a solution!</p>

            <p>This started happening to me this morning on my writers group outlook.com mail account. &nbsp;Composed message to group including my private email, pressed send, message didn't arrive at my private email. Found in outlook.com in draft folder with same message
 as DesShaw has above, i.e. </p>
<p>"something went wrong and we haven't been able to send your message yet".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-composed. Same thing. &nbsp;Now the email (with attachments) is there twice. &nbsp;Sent test emails to my private account. &nbsp;All now stuck in drafts folder and I cannot delete (they disappear but re-appear with the minute).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 'Outlook Mail' at top left of screen. I last sent an email successfully from this account on October 20.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide a solution. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sue</p>

            Was in contact with them again today:&nbsp; They are testing the fix and it will be included&nbsp;in their next "Update".&nbsp; Whenever that will be :-)
