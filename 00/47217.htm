<h2>            ScreenShots Folder Not working as intended.</h2>
                    <p>I was following the advice of a thread on this topic but it's been locked I use the powershell option to bring up the registry list (I assume that's what I've got) and my Screenshots folder in my pictures does not appear on the list instead there is one
 listed in my D: Drive - which has me perplexed as I don't have a D; drive only a C; drive ......</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows Key + print screen button was working up until I moved everything to an external hard drive to keep it safe when the laptop threatened with imminent death. (All fixed now) Windows has made a new screenshot folder / I may have left it empty in
 the same pictures folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took a few screenshots using the windows printscreen option and despite the dimming of the screen it's not saving the files anywhere - aka I search png and I have NO picture files come up int he search.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Windows 10, and the error only occured after emptying the pc of all the pictures and documents I had on it. It seems to be something that commonly occurs in the forum but couldn't find one that was current and complete.</p>

            Hi Amie,
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Click View and make sure 'Address Bar' is turned on
<br />
<br />Paste this into the Address Bar at the top and hit Enter
<br />
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
<br />
<br />In the right hand pane, do you see an entry:
<br />
<br />{B7BEDE81-DF94-4682-A7D8-57A52620B86F}
<br />
<br />If so, double click that and set its value data to:
<br />
<br />%USERPROFILE%\Pictures\Screenshots
<br />
<br />Click OK, close the Registry Editor and restart your pC
<br />
<br />That should put the screenshots in its correct location . ..

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- How are you trying to shutdown the computer?</p>
<p>- Do you receive any error message while trying to shutdown the computer?</p>
<p>- Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> Run the performance troubleshooter from the link and check if that helps.</span></p>
<div><b><span>Open the Performance troubleshooter</span></b></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong></div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start the computer in Safe Mode and check if it helps.<br />
<strong>Start your computer in safe mode<br />

If the issue does not persist, then follow the article to find the cause of the same.</div>
<div><strong>Step 2: Clean Boot Mode</strong><br />
I would suggest you to keep the computer in clean boot mode and check if the issue still persists. A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.<br />
You may refer the following KB article to set the computer in clean boot: <br />

<strong>Note:</strong> After the trouble shooting steps, refer to <strong>Step 7 </strong>
from the clean boot link to set the computer back to normal start up mode.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Method 3: </strong>If the issue persists, I would suggest you to download and install the<strong>Hotfix
</strong>from the link and check if the issue persists.</div>
<div><strong>You cannot make a computer that is running Windows 7 shut down or sleep</strong></div>

<h2>            Skype to phone &#40;landline&#41; no longer connects</h2>
                    <p>I use my Skype number to call from my mobile in the US to landlines in the UK, voice calls mainly.&nbsp; In the last couple of weeks, with one number in particular, the connection is either never made, or appears to ring once then disconnects.&nbsp; I always have
 enough credit to make these 'Skype-out' calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem appeared a week or two ago.&nbsp; I upgraded to the latest version of Skype for iOS and the problem has persisted.&nbsp; Network connectivity is good. Other numbers in the UK connect fine.</p>

<h2>            suddenly Windows 7 requires UAC for perl programs&#63;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've been happily running perl programs on my Windows 7 Home Premium PC for almost a year, and now suddenly they won't run without UAC intervention. When I give permission, they run in a new window, blink/scroll their output and close -- no chance to see
 the output. Piping the output to a file doesn't work either, producing an empty file.</p>
<p>Anyway, the only software which I recently installed - knowingly - is for my Nokia phone. I've now uninstalled that software, and cold started, but the problem persists. (Apart from that, I have recently had problems with my Trend Micro Internet Security
 Pro slowing down the system, but Trend fixed that.)</p>
<p>I tried a "repair" installation of perl, but the problem persists.</p>
<p>So I also installed the latest Windows updates, but still the problem persists.</p>
<p>Please advise how to recover from this problem.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Regards<br />
Doug</p>
<p>PS. This problem has not yet occurred on my Vista SP2 PC.</p>

<p><span>Hi doug5947,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does
 the issue occur only with the Perl programs?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>There is a possibility that some third party programs installed on the computer is causing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest that you perform clean boot and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal
 set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer the below link to know more about clean boot procedure.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><strong><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></strong></span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Reset the computer to start as usual</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your
 password, or click Continue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above step fails then I would suggest that you disable User Account Control (UAC) and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Turn User Account Control on or off</span></strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Turn-User-Account-Control-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Turn-User-Account-Control-on-or-off</span></strong></span></a></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Important:<span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></span><span><span>User
 Account Control (UAC) can help prevent unauthorized changes to your computer. UAC notifies you when changes are going to be made to your computer that require administrator-level permission. These types of changes can affect the security of your computer or
 can affect settings for other people that use the computer. We recommend that you leave UAC on to help make your computer secure.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue persists in the clean boot state then I would suggest that you contact the program vendor to check if they have released
 any update or patch.</span></span></p>

<p>Many thanks for the reply Halima,</p>
<p>But neither suggestion resolved the problem.</p>
<p>Turning off UAC removed the prompt for permission to run, as expected, but the related problems of perl running in a separate window and not behaving normally, remain.</p>
<p>Apologies for this&nbsp;late&nbsp;reply. I've been busy on another PC while backing up my data,&nbsp;and re-installing (upgrade) from&nbsp;my Windows 7 "... Upgrade Option Program" DVD.</p>
<p>That appeared to re-install Windows 7 without affecting other software &amp; settings, but failed to resolve the perl UAC problems.<br />
So I took my PC to my friendly supplier who tried to do a "repair" installation (which was not an option given to me by my "Upgrade" DVD), but this didn't work either, as my "upgrade" had re-installed Windows (?)</p>
<p>Anyway, next suggestion given me is to do a clean re-installation of <strong>everything</strong>, reformatting the C: drive &nbsp;<strong>:(<br />
</strong>Presumably this will be possible from the "Custom" install option on my Windows 7 DVD.</p>
<p>... unless you have any other, quicker solutions ? :)</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Doug</p>

<p>Oh and to answer your question, the only development software I run is perl,&nbsp; .. plus&nbsp;some .bat scripts.</p>
<p>Other software does require UAC permission, but&nbsp;I haven't noticed any recent change&nbsp;except for running perl.&nbsp;</p>

I guess that depends on your meaning.
<div><br />
<div>You can get third party (or Microsoft created) applications like has always been done for all operating systems before it: obtain said applications at a physical store or online and get media (CD, DVD, Bluray, USB stick, downloadable installation file,
 etc.) - they will either be free or at a cost depending on what it is and how the manufacturer distributes it, etc. &nbsp;install, use, keep updated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you mean "use the Windows Store for applications (apps) made for Windows 8" - you don't. &nbsp;You have Windows 7. &nbsp;If you want to use the Windows Store and the Windows 8 apps - you run Windows 8. &nbsp;If you want to use the Google Play store and the Android
 apps, you run an Android OS on and Android capable device. &nbsp;If you want to use the Apple Store and the iOS apps, you use an iPad/iPhone and do so.</div>

<p>You (or someone else who uses the computer) installed them. &nbsp;Directly or indirectly (meaning the application was installed and that is what is advertising to you or the application was installed and it came with riders.)</p>

</p><p>Those are the best case scenarios, simply uninstall the applications, run Malwarebytes and ESET online scanner to be safe and move on - with the knowledge you should always custom install and read while doing it to avoid such crud in the future.</p>

<p>The good thing about phoning to cancel auto renewal is MS tend to offer you a great deal if you don't cancel it.&nbsp; I got 50% off my next&nbsp; yearly subscription, which is a lot better than anything you'll find elsewhere.&nbsp; £19.98 - can't argue with that.</p>

<p>Good deal indeed!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best deal that I managed to get was a one year subscription at US$50 that comes with free 800 MSP.</p>

            what are the specific issues you're having with the controllers?&nbsp; A lot of gamers actually choose Xbox in part because of the amazing controller that comes with it.&nbsp; MS is always looking for constructive criticism to help make their great products even
 better....but you'll have to be a tad more specific I would imagine.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>If you do a bit of online research (or use the honey browser extension) you can find Xbox one controllers for cheaper than retail. I personally have not had quality issues with any of the 5 controllers I owned, but I know that doesn't mean defects don't
 exist. If you have hardware issues, make sure to go to&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/devices</a> to get it repaired.</p>

            I throw it down on the floor for 12 times in the past 1,5 years. With batteries all over, And that great controller never stops working. Amazing! Maybe you have a faulty product. Have you tried another one?

            I really don't understand these types of posts because in 11 years playing Xbox I have only had one controller break on me and trust me I have had over 50 controllers. I think it is all a matter of care. Just my experience and opinion.&nbsp;

<p>I would check the Microsoft website whenever they are having a sale on their controllers. My controller came with my xbox and i dropped it numerous times and it still functions well systematically lol. Some buttons are broken but it'll manage.&nbsp;</p>

            you should be more specific in your questions, here we can help with some tip, even with providing you with some options of stores so that you can get products at a more accessible price.

<h2>            Cannot change picture properties in Windows 7, will not copy without losing properties</h2>
                    <p>I want to copy picture files from a Windows 7 system to a new Windows 10 system via a flash drive. When I try to copy pictures (and a video) from the Windows 7 system it says,"Cannot copy properties..." &nbsp;I go to properties for the folder, "read only" is
 checked, un-check it, click "OK" or click "apply" then "OK". Open the properties again and the folder remains "read only" checked. &nbsp;"Read only" is also check on each individual photo (jpg).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I resolve this issue, I tried geek squad and they couldn't figure it out. &nbsp;I am the administrator. &nbsp;The pictures moved to dropbox but one cannot move the entire dropbox folder to another system, I can only move one jpg at a time. &nbsp;There are thousands
 of pictures!</p>
<p>

    <title>JOGOS MAIS BARATOS&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> unevencougar675  say:</h3>
<h2>            JOGOS MAIS BARATOS&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Boa tarde pessoal, estava vendo Tv e saiu uma propaganda de um telefone 0800 onde podemos encomendar jogos mais baratos e originais para Xbox.</p>
<p>Quando fui anotar o número já era, fiquei horas vendo o mesmo canal para ver se a bendita propaganda passava de novo e nada.</p>
<p>Alguém sabe me informar desse número onde podemos comprar jogos mais baratos? Está muito caro, sem falar que o povo tá sem noção do valor do dinheiro, estava andando em shoping e em feiras e alguns jogos como o Formula 1 2010 e o Kinect Sports estava pelo
 preço de R$ 199,00, e achei estes mesmos jogos nas Lojas Americanas por R$ 79,90. Infelizmente não achei mais outros jogos.</p>
<p>Alguém manda uma luz aí pra mim?</p>
<p>Abraço a todos..</p>

    <title>Microsoft, windows 10 upgrade&#59; inability to upgrade desktop to - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft, windows 10 upgrade&#59; inability to upgrade desktop to free win10 due to windows 7 update problems&#59; problems continue &#38; increase</h2>
                    <p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I am giving opinions, asking questions</span>, apologize for it being bulked all together. Individual threads have me confused. My problems are interrelated, I am quite sure. Having to do with Microsoft, windows vista,
 7,&nbsp;and supposed free upgrade&nbsp;10. Updates, upgrades, hardware &amp; software problems (updating improperly if at all). None of equipment working right since this free win10 upgrade started; problems in literally ALL areas, all home devices (mobile devices excluded,
 except when tried to add reward program &amp; ms email), from desktop, ibook, laptops, web printer, haven't tried much more, home network only partially works, and more than I can list. I hope this is OK. I need guidance, advice, answers if possible, but would
 be happy with a friendly word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't even know where to start. every question or information I try to find brings up more questions. My machines were in working order. We were able to upgrade laptop to win10 when free. Desktop running well with win7spk1, wouldn't back up, though, and
 win7 updates became major problem; aside from inability to&nbsp;use as is anymore, certificates, programs everything out of date, unable to find drivers, won't backup to my ibook (&amp; more)&nbsp;&amp; although eligible for free win10 upgrade, it wouldn't work. Trying to find
 answers is all I ever do. Support not following through. Why should I pay for upgrade when the error lay with ms &amp;/or windows. Home network won't work with all devices. Printer is web all-in-one that basically only works manually now. Looking at different
 threads with different questions that I have;&nbsp;I am very confused; old info mixed with new. Windows 7 will no longer be supported or is being phased out? But have to pay? I have reached out, tried the fixes from tech advice, always using restore point. System
 is older but not that old and was in very good working order; all of my machines were. Nothing but chaos from what looked promising but was a lot of trouble since the changes started, messed up my home network, want money for what should not have to pay for
 since it was not caused by me. The same issues have popped up all over the internet. I am on disability, low income, and&nbsp;pinched pennies, saved up&nbsp;for what I own, and take good care of everything. Many families whether working or other issues struggling day
 to day, this isn't just my problem, it's happening to&nbsp;people everywhere!&nbsp;I depend on being able to use these machines &amp; programs for my needs, my uses, not constant fixes, that only sort of work until the next update if at all. I don't know what is or isn't
 true with these updates &amp; upgrades anymore, can't afford a new system or it would be a done deal.&nbsp;My equipment is in good shape. I know these are my opinions but I would have proof, if I was a tech &amp; knew more. I am quite good at most technical stuff; it just
 shouldn't have to be so long &amp; confusing; and the fixes &amp; updates should work! One of my first support emails to ms/win support came back telling me that it was the wrong place. I have saved all emails. Don't know much about screen shots but learning. Having
 to learn too much when I don't have the time because I need to do what I bought it for or health issues get in the way. In my free time, I love knowing, learning this stuff, was going to school for it before I became ill.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MY questions are many so will reduce to one-can anyone help me get done what should've worked to begin with or mostly, advise me, update me on what's really happening, and why Microsoft support sends generic emails to let me know they'll get back to me with
 answers in 24 hours, then about a week later wants me to fill out a survey on their support when they never called or emailed anything, not even saying they needed a bit more time to look into-nothing. Sorry, more than one question, I just don't know where
 to turn. Have been&nbsp;&amp; plan on asking where ever I can to get this resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to say, the forums, blogs, and a couple tech sites set up just to help, give advice, have been the most friendly, understanding, explaining in understandable terms, and gave the best help. Sites like this one, which I have participated in before,
 real people helping real people the best they can. THANK YOU!</p>

            <p>I find your answer honest, &amp; to the point and it is helpful for part of my huge post (LOL), or a bit big?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if you agree with microsoft's decision, if that's their policy. I feel if I make&nbsp; a mistake, I need to own up and make it right. What happens when it is not my mistake?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the reply; love win10 when all is running properly, and lately this, at least is good news since we got the upgrade on the laptop. I've noticed many updates, additions that have been making the use of the programs much easier. I am getting more
 of my own things done, at least with the laptop, even though it's not exactly mine, we share!</p>

            <p>
</p><p>I see no one dares answer my question about being responsible for one's mistakes or issues, or if their actions caused problems for others. I don't blame anyone. I do say that after all I have read, learned, fixed, tried to fix, still trying to fix, etc,
 etc, and the fact that I see so many other users going through the same thing, I find it hard to believe it's the users who are causing all the issues with, it turns out - at least for me (&amp; I've heard others) - all versions of windows from vista, xp, 7 and
 up to and including windows 10 &amp; ms programs, whether free upgrade, paid for &amp;&nbsp;installed on user equipment, or paid for &amp; included with new system. I am finding I understand a lot of the even more technical info, can even answer a few questions based on this
 and personal experience. Why won't MICROSOFT &amp; WINDOWS OWN UP TO THIS AND TAKE CARE OF THIER CUSTOMERS PROPERLY. Even the tech's who've spent their lives in this career &amp; are retired, are having issues; &amp; some have even commented on how MS is letting their
 customers do their work, that they are being pushed into getting the upgrade and new devices &amp;/or software without having a choice. And then, they can't even get the website support pages right, so when a question is asked, the links are messed up &amp; I know
 I've ended up with answers for the wrong version of windows, support sending me to a special link only to be told to reword my question (link ended up wrong, copied and pasted.), I've had pages disappear; answers that are so general as to be of no help; THEN,
 when I find something new to help looks so great, the info they send back to me has no explanation as to how to use &amp; sends me to several different pages to read - I have to read what amounts to a chapter or 2 of a text book as if in school.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I stated above, I love the new stuff when it's working right. Well, as true as this may be, what I didn't explain was that only SOME things worked at any given time; which is still true. Still a work in progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at home mom with youngest a senior in HS. I have been disabled for 30 years - no big deal, I've learned to live with it; many people are in tough situations doing the best they can everyday. I was lead to believe that I would have some help &amp; support
 due to my situation; some new stuff with accessibility programs, was one, and that there would be a way I could still upgrade my desktop and printer even though it is after the deadline. Since it was the update failures that shut me down making me miss the
 deadline, they should work something out with me, anyhow, and not just me, but the other users who had the same problem &amp; are looking for answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have posted in this forum regarding general issues with this whole upgrade &amp; problems caused; I have also asked specific questions - which is a bit harder since many issues overlap. I see the same problems happening to so many users all over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So:</p>
<p>1. MS/WIN support, I see your website pages slowly improving. Is the support actually there for us or going to be there for us soon; REAL support REAL answers REAL people backing up what they say with action?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. How can users get the free upgrade like they should've (many of users should if not all); are you going to address this issue or do regular, low income, struggling families, and individuals like myself and my family get nothing for all our work, our loss
 of device usage, in home network, all our efforts (time, money, frustration,) go for nothing. I am tired of the same one-liners, tired of working with one device when I had a whole system of devices running smoothly, and tired of repeating the same actions
 with the same results; the issues are not getting fixed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The few that have improved or are now working, I received the best help from users like me, research, and retired techs (or semi-retired) all of who realize that big business is not your only customers but regular people like us. How many letters, posts,
 support questions, research, do I have to do before I get a straight answer, like Lawrence gave me in the above post in answer to my question. No details, but an answer. I've done everything but call; some days and some things are difficult for me at various
 times; health very up &amp; down. But I do the best I can. That's why letters and posts are so lengthy, gotta do what I can, while I can. Then I may be down for a few days or more. One step at a time, for me, &amp; follow through for you. PLEASE.</p>

</p><p>I have a similar problem, not exactly re: which browser to use as default, I don't really want to set a default. I work in the browser with the search engine that gives the best benefits for whatever I am doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel the same about many issues, going round in circles, trying to get my little home wifi internet to work as it should; like it DID before the big changes. Why have an insider program when that's what everyone is doing, anyway. We should be getting paid
 for figuring these issues out. Sorry, it's been a long nite and still having browser issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hadn't really had too many problems with Google in Google Chrome, one of my main search/browsers. I used to use IE but with Edge, I had so many problems with this browser, freezes, kept changing browsers, cookie settings, &amp; more; since it seems Edge is
 improving and is the next IE, more or less, anyway, I stopped using. Certain sites only worked well on IE (.gov sites, for example) so it was a slow change over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the last couple months, MS/WIN10 updates seemed to occur around the same time as Google Chrome. Chrome started freezing up, crashing, Facebook wouldn't work, a pop-up ad wouldn't close, replaced FB site full-screen and wouldn't close. Again, another
 freeze/crash/websites not working normally. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The most recent was the last couple days. Chrome did another update withinthe last week or so, updated from 53 to 54; currently 54.0.2840.99m; and the usual MS/win10 updates for this time every mmonth. I now have found a regressive Hack file http://crbug.com129406
 which is at least a yearly occurrence with Chrome, and may have malware that has yet to be found, actually i think one has been found called wajam, which came through MS somehow. So, these may be possibilities for any other browser issues that are going on.
 and a quick FYI used IE11 for a quick search before finishing this post, cookie issues are back, and thought site was freezing up it was so slow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Good luck to all. If any more browser issues/questions/answers/frustrations/and just plain overwhelmed; I can
 listen, too, as I say Thanks for listening. </p>

</p><p>Defender was FINALLY running fine as far as I could see. Read soooo much info, am not a tech, although have learned much cause had to. The replies for this issue are understandable. BUT I am having issues that had been resolved since the December update
 on 12/14/16. Internet &amp; programs NOT online are all running slow, but not all the time. Off &amp; on. Now it is really bad, This may not go through, other sites having streaming issues, slowing, freezing, trying to restart or just shutting down. Programs NOT used
 in browsers AND, I use MS Onenote Office 2010 &amp; I work offline. It is also acting similar to internet programs. After a couple days of the up/down but basically warm boots, manual update checks, etc, keeping things smooth. Pain in butt though, esp limited
 time shopping, paying bills, etc. Rewards issues so sent a post off to them with details. The same answers when these things happened before (since Win10 upgrade-so many things the same in posts, tech support questions, etc, all over the internet) that didn't
 really fix anything, aren't going to work now. I kind of think we have these issues so we HAVE to get help from MS, and use their products; a PREMIUM defender that isn't free/ included with programs? I've also had Facebook blamed for leaking malware, &amp; it
 turns out that was NOT the problem before, either. Whether my laptop is the same package, 64 or 32 bit, doesn't seem to matter. The basic issues have been the same when you sort through it all. and it's happening again. Defender wouldn't update definitions
 tody and when I thought it was going to work; just before I ended up here looking for answers; I got an error message and the HELP sent me here. I hope this makes sense; I am tired of working on my PC every time issues hppen after the monthly update, I paid
 to have this equipment &amp; what it came with; I am - along with so many others - feeling like I am being used to help MS work out the kinks of their product without getting paid, losing personal time because of the issues, losing PC time &amp; money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like many parts of your reply, things that make sense with all the research done, some new &amp;/or different angles to get things running properly. I could've been the author of so many of these posts; I hope this was OK to reply this way; although have used
 this (&amp; similar customer help/MS/MS &amp; Win tech help) site before; I am unsure of how to go esp when issues build up &amp; can't do what I need cause of fixes needed for MS/windows. That's basically how it has been, with improvements along the way&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UNTIL this
 update. I need help, too, but repeating what Hasn't worked before and working so hard on what MS shold be taking care of to begin with a person gets overwhelmed. I appreciate people like you who help the best possible to get answers for the problems others
 are having. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If anything new comes up, I'll be checking back in if I am able :)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see a place where that can be answered while doing the daily updating. Updates has this info, because it shows up in the internet wifi details page. So Yes about the wifi.</p>
<p>Some past updates, I had to go back and check various settings, like the proxy info mentioned in a previous post. It makes sense to do this again, &amp; return the settings back to where I had them. I wish the updates would not change settings - for all parts
 of the device/programming that it affects - that helped a lot &amp; hope it's that simple (although time consuming pain in butt), or MS has caught it already (as I type, even) and all will work great again as I go back to check on the Defender update &amp; see if
 all is well, again.</p>
<p>Lots of letters with same issues. The December updates seem to be the start point of most recent issues. I don't know. Just tired of issues &amp; working for fixes when I have things that need to be done, on a device that doesn't have so many issues, bigger
 than the average family should have to&nbsp; work so hard to resolve. </p>
<p>Those who truly help - or at least try - are greatly appreciated! Many good ideas from forums/ support sites to help others who don't know how, don't have time, whatever, but THANKS.</p>
<p>Hope it's fixed, but not too much, so the let down is easier lol. Gotta smile so it doesn't get too me that it's happening AGAIN.</p>

            I've seen reference to the Everfocus DVRs and the ePlayer program.&nbsp; I saw mention that you could save the archived .ary footage in an .avi format too.&nbsp; You might try that.&nbsp; See if the .avi file is then playable in Media Player.

<h3> cochise man  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media Streaming Options</h2>
                    <p>With Windows 10 media streaming options, is it possible to stream video to multiple devices, i.e., smart TVs connected to the same network via ethernet cable?&nbsp; In other words, if I play a video on my computer (either on the hard drive or via the internet)
 can I stream this to multiple smart TVs simultaneously if they are connected to the same network?&nbsp; Is it just a matter of placing a check in the checkboxes on media streaming options for all devices seen by the utility?</p>

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />If you attempt to cast to a second display with Miracast, the first display will be disconnected. Miracast currently only support one output display.
<br />
<br />You could try plugging one display in with a HDMI cable and casting to another. If you're looking to use more than two displays though, you may need to buy a HDMI splitter. Miracast will still only be able to wirelessly cast to one display though.
<br />
<br />Hopefully this helps! Please let me know if you need further assistance! Thanks!       
        </p>

                    <p>Can you Change the Font in the "Title Bar" on windows 10?</p>
<p>Also can you increase the border around windows to make them easier to move around as the th title bar[Quick Access Toolbar] is full of crud all the way to left edge. this requires clicking on the window in an unused spot and then placing ur mouse in the
 small unused center portion of th title bar. Or add a buffer or space to th top left of th title bar. making that top left portion of th title bar grabbable n thus movable.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>System Restore</span><span>
 is a very useful feature of Windows </span><span>Vista</span><span> but it has one main
 drawback. After running for a few weeks, it can use a lot of your hard </span><span>disk space</span><span>.
 With the default settings turned on, System Restore might use up to 15 percent of the space on each disk. For example, if you have a 250GB
</span><span>hard disk drive</span><span>, System Restore might end up using 37,5GB of
 it. </span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Also, right-click on the Recycle Bin &gt; Properties &gt; see how much drive space that is using.<br />

7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />

            <p>To use compatibility mode, download the driver, right click on i before running it, Select Properties, then Compatibility and use an operating system that the printer worked with before. I picked XP, service pack 3, which worked for the 64 bit Windows 7
 driver as well as for MP navigator.&nbsp; Now I can print, scan, etc. as before.</p>
<p>
Ok did some more digging and found a solution!! &nbsp;Do the following:&nbsp;
</p><div>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall your printer through control panel</li><li>Go to this website and download the driver (it's from Europe, so use Google to translate... trust me it's the only way to make it work): &nbsp;<span>http://de.software.canon-europe.com/software/0035935.asp</span></li><li><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Before </span></strong>running the app, right click and go to Properties / Compatibility / Compatibility Mode, and select Windows 7. &nbsp;And don't forget to click the box for "Run this program in compatibility
 mode for"</li><li>Double click the file and it will re-install and show up as a printer <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
and</span>&nbsp;scanner!</li></ol>
<div>This totally worked for me and should work for other Win 8 users too. &nbsp;Hope this helped!</div>

            <p>hello user2@16,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thx for quick reply! :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just 2 questions on your solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I've uninstalled the printer via control panel; should I re-install using control panel first or will it install itself when running the driver installation program? I've tried just running the .exe file (after changing properties like you posted), but
 after completion, the printer doesn't show up on the control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I think this driver is for MP600; shouldn't I be using an MP520 driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thx!</p>

            <p>Hello Niranjan!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx for directing me to this page; I have to admit, I didn't find that page and hadn't tried all options listed there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went over the steps and will share what I tried now:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. check hardware; I did a check following as much as possible the steps listed on that page. I did not find any issue there. Also, this printer is working for other devices (and for my old windows 7 machine) and the printer is found without problem on this
 one (windows 8.1), so I doubt it's a hardware or bluetooth issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I launched the troubleshooter and selected the printer (was listed properly, so that's good). Troubleshooter pointed out the printer I should enable homesharing; I allowed the troubleshooter to fix it (i.e. I just followed steps as troubleshooter suggested).
 That worked properly. I tried to print a test-page from the print after troubleshooter closed; problem persists: document stays in printer queue with status "sent to printer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. printer drivers; this is what I have tried before. I did not find anything new in the list compared to what I've tried. I've tried this so far: I've run windows update to find new drivers, no change. I also downloaded from Canon webpage and installed
 new driver, no change. Then, I tried to solution mentioned by user2@16: run the driver in windows 7 compatibility mode, didn't work either...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My guess it's still some kind of driver problem; How can I check when I installed a new driver, following the setup as indicated, it's indeed this new driver that's "driving" the installed printer?, should I remove the device before installing any new driver?...</p>
<p>
</p><p>thx!</p>

            <p>Hello again Niranjan and thank you for your patience :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly no luck this time either; maybe I'm doing something wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the exact steps I've taken after your referral to the 2 articles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I've successfully removed the printer. I noticed when I removed it, it mentioned "driver not available", so clearly, it's a problem with the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I've downloaded the correct driver from the Canon website (windows 8.1 x64)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. after downloading, I opened the .exe file and installation began; I did not need to do anything special to install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. after installing the driver, the printer did not show up in control panel -&gt;devices and printers, so I added the printer like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. clicked "add printer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. printer showed up after looking; I did not need to enter a pass-code to pair (none set)</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. setup completed without difficulty and printer showed up in control panel</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. tried to print a test page... same issue: doc is stuck in queue, status: "sent to printer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just checked via pc settings interface, under bluetooth; printer is there but message is " driver is unavailable"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm stuck now; it's clearly a driver problem; I did download and installed the correct driver, but I can't seem to select this driver for this printer...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was much easier in windows 7; I don't know how to do this in windows 8. Should I post a screenshot of all events on this printer?, would this help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thx...</p>

            <p>Hello Niranjan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, to be honest, that isn't really helpful as I tried that before; as far as I know, I have downloaded and installed the latest driver from the Canon website, so I don't see what more I can do on that side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I don't understand is when I check the printer properties:</p>
<p>
</p><p>right click printer in control panel -&gt; properties -&gt; hardware tab -&gt; properties -&gt; details tab -&gt; property pull-down menu -&gt; driver date: I get 21/06/2006, most likely not the most recent version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is, I've installed the latest driver, but for some reason, the driver the printer is using is still an old one. I've been looking how I can update the driver; I've tried this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>right click printer in control panel -&gt; printer properties -&gt; advanced tab -&gt; new driver -&gt; complete wizard and add new driver (I've tried a few, there are several linking to MP520, I don't know which one I need) -&gt; apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer is processing changes (takes a few seconds), so I guess with that operation, I assign another driver to the printer. However, if I check again the driver date, like I did earlier, it still says the same value (21/06/2006)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, my guess is, I'm unable to assign the right driver to the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it help if I upload a screenshot of the event viewer?...</p>

<h2>            Upon start up, my computer is unresponsive and slow&#63;</h2>
                    For the past two or three days, I've noticed that my computer has been really slow and unresponsive. None of the programs that I click on will open and usually every will freeze if I press anything. When I put my computer in Safe Mode (With Networking)
 everything seems to be running fine. When in Safe Mode, everything I click actually runs but it seems that it does not when I boot my computer using the "Start Windows Normally" option. I have a laptop that is running on Windows 7 currently. Would anybody
 happen to know how I may fix this problem? What steps can I take to fix my laptop? I've also tried scanning for viruses and so far it says that my computer is fine and has no viruses. I used CCleaner (Pro) to ''clean'' my computer and my computer still seems
 to be going slow, unresponsive and freezes quiet a bit. I have also system restored my computer to an earlier time, but it still is giving me the slow, freezing and unresponsive problem. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbs

            <p>Hi Chuck,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you clarify which update did you do today?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial troubleshooting, we can run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe). Check out this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to access the tool. This will help us scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files which can be the cause why the event viewer keeps on popping up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this is helpful for you.</p>
