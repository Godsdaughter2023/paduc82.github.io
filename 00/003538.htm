    <title>F1 Key and Help Function spawning multiple ad windows in Chrome - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kbsalazar  say:</h3>
<h2>            F1 Key and Help Function spawning multiple ad windows in Chrome</h2>
                    <p>This odd behavior occurs across all Office 2013 applications I have tried - Word, Excel, Visio, and Powerpoint. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hitting F1 or invoking the help function from any in-program help shortcut when having Chrome set as the default web browser invokes an avalanche of separate browser tabs, each bearing one iteration of whatever ads are being served on the main MS help site.
 &nbsp;These tabs keep multiplying as long as any help window is is open, until Chrome is overwhelmed by the sheer number of open tabs, and crashes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I know MS would prefer that I use IE, my work location mandates use of Chrome. &nbsp;Switching isn't an option.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are others experiencing this?&nbsp;Any advice on mitigations? &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any/all help or advice. &nbsp;-kbs</p>

            <p>I don't see that behavior at all. Hitting F1 in an Office program opens a window like this:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Clicking any of those links returns results in the same kind of window. Some of those results will link to web sites, which will open in your default browser, but I've never seen one open more than one tab -- and none of them contain advertising of any kind.</p>
<p>

    <title>Why is Outlook so terrible&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hewcumber  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Outlook so terrible&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It's not the god awful condescending answer of, "<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I can feel how it looks a little offbeat for you to take away something that you are used to." It's not the
 change of the looks, people can understand things look different and buttons are in different places. The outlook service now simply DOES not work. With&nbsp;Hotmail, I could right click some bs' email and left click for this sender, bring up a rule to send this
 email,&nbsp;along with all the other emails I currently have, along with all future emails - to any certain spot I choose. Be it junk, or a proper folder such as accounts or online shopping or whatever it may be. Outlooks version of this, creating rules, does not
 work. It does not move all previous emails from that sender, making me go behind and manually clicking every single email and sending them thereafter to the correct place, (and then hope that the new rule I created works and doesn't conflict with any other
 rules - which it shouldn't but hey the rules don't work for me to this day so eff me, right?) Outlook is terrible. I miss hotmail. I just want to be able to create a new hotmail, (mine is out dated for both the name and the fact it has so much spam email sent
 there due to its age it's not even funny.)</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I suppose old Hotmail is gone forever. I do not plan to hang around Outlook and its terrible apps and low functioning search tool.</span></span></span></p>

            By downgrading Outlook it looks like Microsoft is trying to get rid of users. The latest downgrade is nearly useless. Microsoft: Please recommend a way to move emails to another service, or point out another Microsoft product, for whatever cost, that has
 useful search features.

            Microsoft updated to using their Office365 infrastructure for Outlook.com. With a migration of that size there are bound to be a few issues here and there on some of the servers. Have you reported your issues to Tech Support as they would be the only ones
 able to rectify back server issues that us peers can't.

                    I'm not really sure what's going on here. It has said this in my update history about 6 times since the release on the 29th. I'm really eager to get Windows 10 although I don't want to pay over 100 dollars when I can get it for free. I've ran Microsoft's
 "Window's Update Diagnostic" and while its said its fixed some thing's the update is still failing. I'm on Windows 8.1 if this is of use to you. If anyone could help me out or help me fix this problem, that would be great. Thanks in advance, Devan.

            <p>After doing a bit of searching I found a fix as far as I know that worked for me and hopefully works for you too.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>1. Go into "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download" and&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>delete everything<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;in
 that folder.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Now, run the command prompt as an administrator. Type in "wuauclt.exe ...Space... /updatenow".</span></strong><br />
<p>
</p><p>I had to do this about two times after it not working the first time but it looks like its now working (hopefully) so I hope it helps you too!</p>

    <title>Where do I start with implementing Project Online&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael j. zmuda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where do I start with implementing Project Online&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have used MS Project in the past as a standalone and understand all the details of managing projects. &nbsp;I have never been involved in the implementation of Project Server and now a smaller company I work for here in St Paul, MN is trying to decide whether
 to use Project 2016, Project Online, Project Lite for managing projects and resources collaboratively. &nbsp;All videos and demos make it appear the way to go, but we are still trying to understand initial set up. &nbsp;We just started with migrating back to Office
 365 and Office Online and trying to understand how Sharepoint sites and OneDrive all work together and where certain files end up or should be placed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What has happened to the days of tutorials that go back to initial set up? &nbsp;Am I just looking in the wrong areas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) Where does my master project, my old companyresource.mpp file need to go so all projects are pulling from one group of resources? &nbsp;Is this even still how it's referred? &nbsp;I created one that sits on our Company Sharepoint Site, but then it states the project
 has no site associated with it when I try and create tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.) &nbsp;I have a projects created in Project 2016 on my server and I read through steps that show me how to migrate and even connect it with Project Online and again the error about not having a team site. &nbsp;Do I need to be an overall administrator to our Project
 Online Software in order to create projects?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.) &nbsp;If we can't do this ourselves, How do we find a Certified Partner? &nbsp;I've tried Pinpoint and get no where or don't see anyone listing Project Online as one of their fields of expertise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are a Transportation Engineering firm designing projects for the DOT and hoping to find someone with AE firm experience in implementing Project Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>

<h3> jwt072  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint for IPad and SmartArt</h2>
                    <p>I created an organisational chart in Powerpoint on my Mac computer using SmartArt and saved it to my OneDrive account so I can access it anywhere. &nbsp;As I often travel for work I use my iPad Pro when I’m on the road.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So today I’m visiting a client and after some discussions I need to make some changes to the Organisational chart (I’m a management consultant). No matter what I do I can’t seem to be able to edit the org chart. I can click on it, but can’t edit it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone tell me what the secret is as surely there must be a way given this is not exactly an advanced feature? Its quite an extensive org chart so recreating it with some boxes and adding some text and lines etc will take me hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PowerPoint for iPad is a light version with a subset of features found in the desktop version. SmartArt creation and editing is one of the missing features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PowerPoint User Voice forum has a suggestion to add this feature:&nbsp;<a href="https://powerpoint.uservoice.com/forums/288952-powerpoint-for-ipad-iphone-ios/suggestions/32312461-there-is-no-smart-art-feature-available-in-offline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">there
 is no smart art feature available in offline version for ipad</a>&nbsp;You can vote on this. Microsoft uses this feedback to prioritize their programming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, keep the presentation on OneDrive and edit it in PowerPoint Online using an iPad browser. PowerPoint Online supports SmartArt editing.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The WhatsApp will no longer be supported on Windows Phone 8.0, the availability of the app will be on Windows 10 Mobile, it stops working on a selection of smartphones and mobile platforms since 1 January 2018. The good thing is, your phone is eligible for
 Windows 10 upgrade.<br />
<br />
If you want to upgrade your Lumia 640 to Windows 10 Mobile, you can initiate the upgrade via the
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/upgrade-advisor/9nblggh0f5g4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upgrade Advisor</a></strong> app. It will tell you if your Windows Phone 8.1 device is eligible for upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile. If your
 device is eligible, Upgrade Advisor can help free up space on your device to prepare for installation.<br />
<br />
Here's how to download the app:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On Start<span>&nbsp;</span>, swipe over to the All apps list, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Store</strong>.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</li><li>Search for the Upgrade&nbsp;Advisor app, and then install it on your device.</li><li>Open the app on your device. It&nbsp;will check&nbsp;your device and let you know if it's ready for the upgrade, if&nbsp;another update is required before you can get the upgrade, or if your device can't be upgraded.</li><li>If the update is available for your device, select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Enable Windows&nbsp;10 upgrade</strong>.</li></ol>
<br />
<p>For further reference, please refer to this article: <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13778/windows-10-mobile-upgrade-advisor-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upgrade Advisor app for Windows 10 Mobile</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Note: Before you start the Upgrade Advisor app, it’s important that you backup your phone data to OneDrive or another storage location. Check this link on how to back up your files:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17232/windows-10-mobile-back-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Back up your stuff.</a></strong>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 Can&#39;t receive e-mails</h2>
                    <p>Outlook 2010 - Windows 10</p>
<p>As of Feb 1, 2017, in the middle of the day,&nbsp; I was no longer able to receive e-mails.</p>
<p>I have deleted many e-mails,&nbsp; to get any size issues down.&nbsp;&nbsp; Senders are not getting any message full errors.</p>
<p>I can send e-mails fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have checked all the settings,&nbsp; Even asked one of my desktop guys at work to review.&nbsp; Set ups are correct.</p>
<p>I have compacted my .pst file.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have created a new account.&nbsp;&nbsp; My service provider was no help,&nbsp; in resolving the issue.</p>
<p>(ATT)&nbsp;&nbsp; I know e-mails are there,&nbsp; as I can see them,&nbsp; signing in to Mail,&nbsp; on att web page.</p>
<p>When starting Outlook,&nbsp; I get the send/receive at the bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp; looks like its trying.....it never comes up with a 5 of 50 e-mails receiving. (just an example).&nbsp;&nbsp; It just goes from Send/receiving....to nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; To me...its like its looking at the server...and
 does not see anything to receive. Its is taking longer,&nbsp; than normal,&nbsp; when there really is no e-mails to receive.</p>
<p>Something had to change on Feb.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm out of ideas.</p>

<p>If so;</p>
<p>With outlook closed run scanpst, the repair tool, against your primary pst data file, if it finds/fixes any error run it again/again until it finds no more to fix</p>

    <title>Using pens in Presenter View - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rich007a  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using pens in Presenter View</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've been using the Presenter View set-up in PowerPoint 2007 for some time now, but I have the following issues which I hope you might be able to help me with.</p>
<p>So the traditional set-up is me with laptop showing the presenter view, and large screen/projector (behind me) showing just the slideshow (so the desktop is extended across the two screens).</p>
<p>I often need to point at things on the screen with my mouse, however if I point the mouse arrow at something on my screen, no one can see it on the main projector screen!&nbsp; For me to point at things on the main screen, I have to move my mouse across to the
 other screen, then turn by back to the audiance...</p>
<p>Then I thought about using the Pens (Ballpoint, Felt-tip, Highlighter).&nbsp; I could draw a circle around the item of interest, then clear with a push of the letter E... but...</p>
<p>If I draw on laptop screen (presenter view) as soon as I release the mouse, the slide show advances.&nbsp; Is there a way round this?</p>
<p>Secondly, the pointer for the pens is a tiny dot that's really hard to see.&nbsp; Is there a way to have the functionality of the pen, but with the visibility of an arrow?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any tips.</p>
<p>Cheers<br />
Rich</p>

            This site has a few options: http://www.fxc.btinternet.co.uk/assistive.htm<br />
<br />
Sonar 4 - adds a submarine sonar type shrinking circle
Chunky Cursors - is a collection of really large mouse cursors that are REALLY visible. I've used them for years.
<p>Enourmouse - they also have absurdly large mouse pointers which I have played with.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
See the control panel &gt; Ease of Use applet &gt; Make the Mouse Easier to Use. You can select built in larger cursors (I use one by default)<br />
<br />
See the Control Panel &gt; Personalization &gt; Mouse Pointers &gt; Pointer Options.&nbsp; You can turn on "Pointer trails" that leave a fading trail of mouse pointer images as you move the pointer. Combine with chunky cursor and you can make it very easy to see where there
 cursor is circling.<br />
<br />
Turn on the "Show Location of Pointer when I press &lt;CTL&gt; KEY to show a shrinking bulls eye around the mouse poitner when you hit the control key.<br />

            <p>Thanks Rohn007.&nbsp; I'll look into those.&nbsp; I was aware of the "Control Panel" options, but I've never tried the "Show Location of Pointer when I press &lt;CTL&gt; key" option on a split screen set-up.&nbsp; I'm sure the bigger arrow will help.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all of these solutions (I think/guess)&nbsp;requre the pointer to be moved to the projector screen that is showing the slideshow, and me to grow eyes in the back of my head...</p>

            Yes they do require you to move the mouse on the monitor, but you don't have to grow eyes in the back of your head. If you are using the mouse pointer to point on screen, they will see the same on the projection. That is the whole point of a 2 montior
 presenter view, you can see both what is projected for them to see and your additional notes.<br />
<br />
If you really want to watch the screen, have you put your laptop off to the side so that you are at almost 90 degrees to the screen and audience. That way you can see both easily and you don't turn your back on the audience.<br />
<br />

</blockquote>
<p><br />
I beg to differ... in ppt 2007, to use "Presenter View" (SlideShow tab &gt; Set Up Show &gt; Show Presenter View...) you have to extend your desktop across the two monitors (or laptop screen and projector in this case).&nbsp; In that case, the mouse is NOT duplicated
 on the two screens.&nbsp; Yes, I could go back to the old way of me seeing just the slide show on my monitor, but then I loose sight of the notes, what's coming up next, timing information, etc...</p>
<p>Is that not what you see?&nbsp; Or am I missing something?</p>

            Sorry, I was looking at PowerPoint 2010. It does use both monitors automatically.<br />
<br />
So I then checked in 2007, it works the same as 2010.<br />
<br />
I do believe you are missing a setup option, or maybe it is just your specific system setup that does not work as expected. Take a look at this article:<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>There are a few reasons Cortana may respond with this message, but if she does, she’s having difficulty with the audio quality:</span></p>

<p><span>Here are some steps you can try:</span></p>

<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>When this message occurs, there’s a prompt to the wizard to set up the microphone.<span>&nbsp;

    <title>Backup outlook file that syncs with office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Backup outlook file that syncs with office 365</h2>
                    How do I backup up my outlook file that I sync with Office 365? I want to back it up directly from my computer because I use the Franklin Covey add-on that doesn't appear in 365. I tried the Personal Folders Backup Tool but the file does not appear as
 an option. I do not want to export because that is only one folder at a time and I will archive when I need but not now. I did copy my .ost file to another location. Will that work? But it is clumsy and I'm prone to forget. Are there any other methods? Thanks.

            <p>If you want a copy of eveything, export your mailbox to a pst. If you just want to back up calendar and contacts (those are most at risk in a sync), you can export just those folders.
</p>
<p>FWIW, when you sync over the air with exchange&nbsp;there is less risk of loss or duplicates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ya it's possible and it works. However, when i tried with my Soundspeats q30 plus, it directly connected to the stereo type which have better sound quality while for the sony wh1000xm3 it only connected to the handsfree. When i tried to connect the stereo
 it just said connected but nothing happen, the icon still in disconnected condition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>when i check the driver events i found this</p>

<p>The other thing you might do is remove the device from your phone or make sure the phone is out of reach. &nbsp; Then, if necessary, remove the headphones from the computer and re-pair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what my Bose Bluetooth headset looks like.&nbsp; Some of this is handled by the headset in conjunction with Windows.&nbsp; If you were using a wired headset, I would suggest choosing headphones or headset, whichever one works best.&nbsp; Bluetooth devices normally
 set themselves up.</p>

            The problem is right now i couldn't connect to the stereo device (Headphones) it only connected to hands-free(Headset) which is confusing for me. I tried to connect the headphone to other laptop&nbsp;and it works, so im not sure what happen to my PC. I also
 try to connect other headphone version at gives the same result as mine which could not connect to the stereo.

    <title>Lost access to sharepoint site after Azure AD Connect - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark kolenbrander  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost access to sharepoint site after Azure AD Connect</h2>
                    <p>An end user had created a new sharepoint site called "Maintenance". After I completed the cutover from AD to a preexisting tenant. Which went well with very few issues. The end user lost access to their site. &nbsp;I'm assuming because end user was the site administrator
 and their account was modified enough to make it now a different account in the eyes of sharepoint. &nbsp;As the administrator I also do not have access to this site and everyone involved get an access denied. &nbsp; I attempted to create a new site from the admin console
 with the same name (Maintenance) hoping the data would show up under the new site. &nbsp;But I was also denied even creating the site indicating insufficient rights to do so. &nbsp;This tells me the site is still there and the data is still there, just cannot access
 it. &nbsp;Is there any way to override the rights to the site and force in a new administrator?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank in advance for any help,</p>

<p>My solution was to restore the Office365 group from the deleted groups.&nbsp; Regain access to the data and back it up.&nbsp; Then deleted the group once again. and Created a SharePoint Site from the sharepoint admin page.&nbsp; Restored the data.</p>

<h3> jersey-devil  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote Storage and Backup</h2>
                    <p><span>I'm running Windows 10 Pro along with Office 365 Home on a desktop computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have many OneNote notebooks in OneNote.&nbsp; Some of them appear in a OneNote Notebooks folder on my C: drive under Documents.&nbsp; I don't know how the Notebooks got there or why many are missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where are OneNote Notebooks supposed to be stored, and where are they typically backed up?&nbsp; For example, are Notebooks typically backed up on OneDrive, or are they usually backed up along with everything else when the C: drive is backed up?&nbsp; At the moment,
 the Notebooks appear to be backed up on OneDrive, but I haven't verified every Notebook is there and don't recall how they got there.&nbsp; One check I made showed the Notebook to be missing from OneNote.&nbsp; When I clicked on the Notebook in OneDrive, Windows warned
 to proceed could be dangerous.&nbsp; I attempted to decline to proceed but somehow elected to proceed.&nbsp; The result was the missing Notebook appeared in OneNote on my computer, apparently recovered.&nbsp; What's up with that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't understand completely how OneNote is handled, although I've been using it for years.&nbsp; There is also an online version of OneNote, and I don't know if its a duplicate of the OneNote and all its chickens on my computer.&nbsp; My goal is to learn
 where OneNote stores its Notebooks and contents locally or wherever, verify I got all my stuff, and then ensure all Notebooks and their contents are backed up somewhere -- OneDrive for instance.</p>

            Onenote 2016 can store notebooks on the local drive or in onedrive. If you store them on the local drive, a backup copy is created in the %appdata% path (look in file, Options for the exact path). They would also be backed up by your backup routine. 
<br />
<br />The universal app only stores notebooks in onedrive.  It cannot open notebooks stored on your hard drive.

<p>Thanks for responding.&nbsp; I found "Customize how OneNote saves and backs up your notes."&nbsp; Apparently, the Quick Notes Section saves notes to an online folder, the Backup Folder is on the C: drive, and the Default Notebook Location is also on the C: drive.&nbsp;
 I didn't see anything about storing stuff on OneDrive.&nbsp; Further, I have no idea where the online folder is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I don't seem to have a C:\Users\my name\AppData\Local\Microsoft\OneNote path, which is the current selected path for the Backup Folder.&nbsp; I do have a&nbsp;<span>C:\Users\Default.migrated\AppData path.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Likewise, I don't have C:\Users\my name\Documents\OneNote Notebooks path, which is the selected path for notebook storage.&nbsp; But, I do have a C:\Users\my name\Documents\OneNote path, which is where my notes seem to reside.&nbsp; However, I also have a&nbsp;<span>C:\Users\my
 name\Documents\OneNote Notebooks path where some of my notes reside.</span></p>
<p><span>I have no idea how things got so screwed up.&nbsp; Perhaps you can suggest a method to straighten out this mess.&nbsp; For starters, maybe I could change the backup path to specify a location on OneDrive.&nbsp; Strangely, the notes stored on OneDrive stopped
 being stored in 2017.&nbsp; No 2018 notes are there.&nbsp; Clearly, I need lots of help.</span></p>

<br />Strangely, the notes stored on OneDrive stopped being stored in 2017. No 2018 notes are there. Clearly, I need lots of help.

<br />That should only happen if you moved them to local storage.

 Microsoft to help me solve my OneNote problems.

                    When I do a search of Appointments and Meetings for the word&nbsp; "$&gt;" or "@" in the subject field only using Advanced Find, it returns a large number (possibly all) of my appointments.&nbsp; In the first case it should return no results (as no appointments have

<p><br />
Not 100% sure about appointments or meetings, but for messages you can use <em>Advanced Search</em>. Press
<em>Ctrl-Shift-F</em>, or alternatively, when you click inside the search field, there is a link in the ribbon
<em>Options</em> area for <em>Search Tools</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click that and open <em>Advanced Find</em>. You will probably need to click the
<em>Browse </em>button to change where you are searching - Selecting <em>Outlook/Search&nbsp;Subfolders
</em>searches everywhere, but is slow.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: Now, click the <em>Advanced </em>tab and enter search parameters.</strong> You can add more than one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This does allow for things like "sold!" being distinct from "sold", And you can search in one field only, such as the subject.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;total rigmarole for something that came standard with XP search... Why on earth anyone would want to find "sold" when they are searching for "sold!" beats me...!

            Advanced Find searches in Outlook don't behave as I would expect.&nbsp; Punctuation, as far as I can tell, is all treated equivalently.&nbsp; A period is the same and a hyphen is the same as a comma is the same as an at sign is the same as a&nbsp;space.&nbsp; Every subject
 contains a space or some other delimiter so searching for any delimiter will find something.&nbsp; Likewise, putting a non-space symbol between words is the same as using a space.&nbsp; Searches are case insensitive as well.&nbsp; For example, if you have an item with "One
 Two" in the subject, you can look for "One two", "oNe^TWo", "ONE(TWO" or any other combination as long as the letters match.&nbsp; Moreover, it doesn't matter how many separators you use.&nbsp; "One Two" and "!@#one%^&amp;two" are equivalent.&nbsp; Finally, matches work only
 on the beginnings of words.&nbsp; If, for example, the subject contains "popcorn", you will get a match looking for "p", "po", "pop", etc, but not "corn"

            This is a known bug that is being worked on. This happens when you have your Screen sizing set to something other than 100%. So you need to either set the screen to 100% or endure it until fixed.

<h2>            Adding a merge field to an email hyperlink in an email mailmerge</h2>
                    <p>I am using word 2010, excel 2010, and outlook 2010 to send out the following email with email mailmerge to 50 + people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The highlighted names in the greeting are two merge fields - First_Name and Last_Name.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce884295-2679-43b7-9f34-a755cd47d4e9" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The hyperlink is an email hyperlink to the following email message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Will you attend?&nbsp;&nbsp; ___ Yes&nbsp;&nbsp; ___&nbsp; No</span><span> </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The hyperlink is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03c994af-2e82-4ee3-9b41-87f134d3ed2a" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would like to place the merge First_Name Last_Name in the hyperlink to sign the RSVP email back to me. I have tried many modifications of the hyperlink code&nbsp;and nothing works consistently. It will place one name as the signer but will not pick up the following
 names the merge fields.</p>
<p>I would like the final email hyperlink to look like this: </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Will you attend?&nbsp;&nbsp; ___ Yes&nbsp;&nbsp; ___&nbsp; No</span><span> </span></p>
<p>Jody Smith</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me how to add the First_Name Last_Name to the hyperlink email so that each ricipient's name&nbsp;from the original email will appear in the hyperlink email as shown above?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>(Edited a little...)<br />
I can get this to work here, but there are some things you need to pay attention to when merging to HTML email (rather than to new documents etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Hyperlink field code I start with is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>{ HYPERLINK }<br />
<br />
Insert that using ctrl-F9 to insert the special field brace pair { }, insert the Word HYPERLINK, then select the field and update it using F9.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>View the field code results (press Alt-F9 if necessary). In the English language version of Word you should see&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Important point number 1: </em></strong>Do not update the result of this HYPERLINK field again (i.e. don't select it and press F9). If you do, every email will always show the same link text. As far as I can remember, this behaviour is different
 when you merge to a document rather than email, or perhaps merge to attachments. This can be a problem if you need to update other fields in your email, or if the email is being used by other people who might (for whatever reason) update the HYPERLINK field</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now modify the display text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the Arrow keys to move the insertion point so it is between the "E" and the "r" in the Word "Error", and type<br />
<br />
Click here to RSVP!<br />
<br />
Then you can select and delete the "E", and the "rror! Hyperlink reference not valid."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the text and apply the Hyperlink style to it (Home tab of the Ribbon-&gt;Styles).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you toggle field code display using alt-F9, you should see the original field</p>
<p>
</p><p>{ HYPERLINK }</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now click after the K of HYPERLINK and insert the following fields and text (or copy them from somewhere else):</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;"{ SET x 1 }mailto:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***?subject=July%20Wine%20and%20Spine%20&amp;body=%20Will%20you%20attend?%20%20%20___%20Yes%20%20%20___%20No%0A%20%0a%2{ MERGEFIELD First_Name%20{MERGEFIELD Last_Name }"</p>
<p>
</p><p>so that your field now looks like</p>
<p>
</p><p>{ HYPERLINK "{ SET x 1 }mailto:*** Email address is removed for privacy ***?subject=July%20Wine%20and%20Spine%20&amp;body=%20Will%20you%20attend?%20%20%20___%20Yes%20%20%20___%20No%0A%20%0a%2{ MERGEFIELD First_Name%20{MERGEFIELD Last_Name }" }</p>
<p>
</p><p>As usual, all the {} need to be the special field code brace pairs that you can enter using ctrl-F9 on WIndows Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, experienced field users will have to resist the temptation to select the fields and update them. Dont do it!<br />
<br />
Save the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Test the email merge. At this point, I would hope to see the results you want.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, I do not know why this works OK on my system but not yours.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong><em>Important point number 2</em></strong>&nbsp;You may be wondering why there is a { SET x 1 } field inside the HYPERLINK code. It's because when you are working with a .docx, if you save, close and reopen your document, you may find that Word has resolved
 all the merge fields nested inside your HYPERLINK field (i.e. replaced the field codes by their results). This behaviour can appear arbitrary, and the reason that (for some reason), Word does not resolve the nested fields if there is a Word bookmark inside
 the HYPERLINK field. Now if the insertion point or selection ws inside the HYPERLINK field when you save/close the document, there will be a bookmark in there, because Word inserts a bookmark called _GoBack, which enables the user to go back to the previous
 selection. But if you click outside the HYPERLINK field before you save, there wil be no such bookmark and Word will resolve your field codes. So we put the { SET x 1 } in there to ensure that there is a bookmark (in this case, called X) to prevent that from
 happening.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, if you save as .doc format (not recommended these days if you can avoid it) Word does not resolve these fields and you don't need the { SET } field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And that's it. Whether that will be enough for your Merge to work as you hope, I cannot be sure, but all I can say is that without doing those 2 things, it almost certainly won't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[[I originally had a third thing. I actually now think it's incorrect, but I'm going to leave it here just in case.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Important point number 3</em></strong>: If it does not work, there is at least one other thing that could be wrong, although I think it is highly unlikely. There is a Windows registry setting called FieldCalcSecurityLevel, which was introduced
 about 12 years ago when Microsoft made some security-related changes to the behaviour of certain types of field. I'm not going to step through how to look for that, but for example, in my registry, for Word 2010, it is at</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Word\Options</p>
<p><br />
It may be elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot find that Option, or it is there and is set to the default value (1), then something else is wrong and I do not know what it is. However, if it is set to 0 (which makes Word use its original behaviour, you will have to set it to 1 to get this
 to work.</p>

<p>At this point, the only thing we've seen of 7.8 is the enhanced Start screen.&nbsp; There's been rumours of some of the other features of WP8, but nothing confirmed as of yet.&nbsp; I'd rather wait a while and see what else Microsoft can include for us....</p>

            You will have to reinstall Microsoft Office as well as all other programs you installed from their installations discs or from the original download site.&nbsp; .&nbsp; Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to assist you.
