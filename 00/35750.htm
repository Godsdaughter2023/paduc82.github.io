            <p>Thanks Mr Winston,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have resolved the "Network troubleshooting' issue by un-installing .net frame package and all its updates. Afterwards, i installed latest version of .net frame package i.e. 4.5.2 and and its updates ( updates of .net frame 3.5.1 ) except the last 2 i.e.
 KB2901112 and KB2911501.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, network troubleshoot is working. I doubt that one of these updates was causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>can you confirm how to verify that .net frame is installed properly because I am trying to install one software ( 1995 built) tiffsplitter.exe but it is showing error " This setup requires .net frame version 1.1.4322. Pl install .net framwork and run setup
 again'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control panel shows the Microsoft .Netframework package 4.5.2 in the "Installed program" and also windows update history shows the updates of .netframework installed on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your support.</p>

            Hi ZWINPLAYS,
<br />1809 may be delayed for certain PC or not delivering at all.
<br />See <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/11/13/windows-10-quality-approach-for-a-complex-ecosystem/#I0GVrKCTu65XCX2d.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/201...</a>
<br />The first principle of a feature update rollout is to only update devices that our data shows will have a good experience. One of our most recent improvements is to use a machine learning (ML) model to select the devices that are offered updates first. If we detect that your device might have an issue, we will not offer the update until that issue is resolved.

    <title>Windows 10 random crash. My first dump and BSOD probably on this Pc. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 random crash. My first dump and BSOD probably on this Pc. KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED ffffffff&#96;c0000005  . PC parts, drivers or what it seems like&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello. So I have the dump file attached and I don't know how to read or open all the text inside it. I allow anyone to open the text and what it contains for the possible crash reason. Consider too low voltage in idle for CPU as one possible one.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My onedrive link for the dumpfile in raw form:&nbsp;https://1drv.ms/u/s!AqCCA3sur0bBhCz3pxNRmf0qNpta<br />
<br />
I have done some CPU OC and my GPU automatically overclocks itself. My RAMS are like 2.5 years old. 2133mhz ddr4 from my older rig, just updated cpu 2 gens and gpu 1 up.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Anyway, I kept the same PSU. So my PSU and RAM are the same in the system. My pc parts are the following:&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(41, 47, 52, 1)">

<p>This contains a lot of rambling. There are some things about my CPU settings down below if ctrl+F "45x" for example. Also asking why my CPU doesn't reaaally idle. Like it downclocks sometimes to really low, but for half a second, then maybe drops from 4.5hz
 to 4.2ghz and goes back to like 4.4ghz. Maybe like 4ghz is avg for it and some voltages don't drop really the following ones: +5v, +3.3V, +12V,&nbsp; VIN3, VIN4, VIN6, VIN7 &lt;--- Vin7 is on constant 1.216V and my Vcore is max 1.200V atm on HWmonitor. S my VIN7 is
 more than my Vcore, and is static number. I mean the VIN7 is on static voltage. It seems to be DRAM voltage since that voltage is the same in HWiNFO64. Could be just memory, aka RAM? Not cpu related? Also Intel Extreme Tuning Utility says that my Cache is
 on static with a yellow text. And I don't remember setting it static in Bios. Sometimes I tinkered with XTU, to see live what the settings do. But I don't think it's affecting my settings now. My Bios is the main source for that. Or else XTU would've probably
 overwritten my settings. Or, maybe I didn't touch the static cache there and XTU is handling it. Don't want to change it to adaptive from that software though, or would it be harmful. I know softwares like that are bad, I use it for monitoring on top of HWiNFO64
 and HWmonitor. I have balanced power mode on Windows, C-states enabled, SVID support on so I can use adaptive vcore voltage. But my cache may be on static, is that normal or not? And the CPU sits on 4.08ghz usually. Also my Load Line Calibration is at 5 .
 Asus board btw.. Strix boards ain't good.<br />
<br />
I'm asking these questions alongside this, since I haven't been answered properly on /r/overclocking and I had really well written thread. Not like this, not full of rambling. Just straight to the business, bios pictures, under load pictures, what's the deal
 about and few simple questions. You can look it up under an username "Kustomised". I don't think I can link those, but my recent thread there contains relevant and recent information about my hardware.<br />
I just want everything under control, working, worries about frying parts like now I'm worrying super hard since it was my first BSOD probably, since I got dumpfle, so it is 100% bsod? I'm really worried about that. Also I had MB switch at one point, so it
 might have lost the other dumpfiles, 1,5months ago maybe or 2. But still don't remember myself crashing often at all. Like really seldom and never saw bluescreens. Just PC that has been shutdown and I have no idea why. Maybe CPU voltage drops too low in idle
 and shuts down..? Since due to my knowledge I'm running semi low ones, 45x core and 42x cache and 1.200v maxing out vcore. And my CPU idles at like 0.704V minimum recently. Idk has it dropped lower. Maybe it's a good sign that my crash wasn't while playing
 or anything else. Just tabs open, stream open in them and I wasn't even touching the PC for an hour.<br />
<br />
about the reddit thread -&gt; (different settings now, the pics don't mach. Providing if needed. Hope they are not needed.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
I updated my Nvidia drivers after the crash also, if it had anything to do with it. Also I was handling very many YouTube video links, programs etc. But I have had more tabs open and it hasn't caused a crash. My OC in HWiNFO64 says IA: Max Turbo Limit "Yes"
 under Performance limit reasons on CPU. But I have already tested this current clock well with prime95 torture tests. And it stopped giving me few other limit reasons, no more also workers crashing in Prime95&nbsp; (yet, *knocks on wood*).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This was the only dump file I had. I'm not sure was it BSOD, but the file seems to say that it was some sort of bluescreen when I googled few of the bugs+something. Don't remember well. But yea, these RAM sticks have been working well. I got these new pc parts
 (except rams are 2.5 years old and PSU too as I mentioned earlier) like maybe close to 2 months ago. My MB is poor, it has 6 vrm power phases, even though it was more expensive than the good ones. Like the good ones are 160€-170€ and I got ripped 180€~ , didn't
 know about the vrm power phase think when buying, found out later.<br />
<br />
I have posted my Bios settings to Overclocking reddit, and some people noted nothing unusual about them. Well the thread didn't reach much attention. But anyways I think it's an okay overclock and seems stable to me. I only can't monitor VRM's but I think my
 Motherboard checks how hot those are but doesn't have sensors. Since my Bios has options for VRM like, ignore the heat limits etc. I haven't changed them, except VRM SPREAD SPECTRUM. That I disabled, people recommended for OC. And when I read about it, it
 didn't seem too bad. Anyway, I can't know if my system is overheating, I have a good cpu cooler in my opinio and PSU shouldn't easily also do stuff like that. Been working well till now, and RAM is usually more unsteady. Unless it started crashing now for
 the first time, but still knocking on wood. Since I had to RMA my Rams back then when I bought my parts 2.5y ago when I had my old rig.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When the code is checked and somebody may have an idea, like if it says that Nvidia driver crashed me or something else, then I'll try to fix that. And hope fingers crossed that it wasn't pc parts fault. I don't know is like first or second crash ever on newer
 parts something I should start to worry about?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I don't even remember when it last crashed, and when it did. It was actually too low voltage Prime95 torture stress. CPU had no enough voltage etc. So I haven't had like suspicious BSOD's. And also I'm not sure did I have BSOD now since my monitor was in sleep
 mode. My Pc casually shut down when monitor was in sleep mode. I did a mistake and instantly pressed PC's start button. I know it was a mistake, since if it was PSU the PC wouldn't have restarted if I recall correctly the last time when I was trying to figure
 my PC out when the RAM was failing. I got different manufacters RAMs back then. So I don't think my current ones are bad, maybe the Corsair ones were. I still don't believe it could've even been PSU. And sleep mode is scheduled for me in 2 hours of no activity,
 monitor sleep in 1 hour.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I was texting for 1h30min. Also I don't think that I had any Windows updates, since I went to check my update history. And Nvidia for me doesn't force them. Kinda bugged that I didn't see was it bluescreen and what error code there was. It's probably in the
 dumpfile.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I had a lot of pages open on Chrome, like 60. But most of them were semi demanding ones, Videos on pause, don't know is that demanding or not. And some random webpages, 2 of them auto refreshing as their function. Probably not too much, since I tried to google
 chrome pc crash if too many tabs are open etc.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Anyway. My GPU is not Overclocked by me, it OC's on default depending on it's temperature and MSI GAMING X one should have good cooling. The cpu also, and I have 5 120mm fans. Also my fan curves are pretty aggressive. I had nothing which was stressing for GPU
 open, no games in the background, none of that. Hmm also I don't know do streams play in the background when opened in tab but muted.. Well I had then a stream also in those tabs playing at full quality.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Anyway. If the problem is something which could be pc part related. I can post bios pictures and HWiNFO64 torture test temperatures, after some extreme time spy testing also. Since Prime95 torture is about CPU and I need to test GPU a bit. But that 3dmark tests
 cpu and gpu both a little. Don't have GPU tester to my knowledge downloaded.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also I have ran my pc for days with these Bios settings.. And I doubt that it would crash in desktop mode after not being touched for an hour. I'm still kinda worried and upset that the whole shutting down thing happened. Since it is one more worry on top of
 the others. Since at one point I worried about my OC settings, Bios etc and was fixing and modifying stuff for 3 days straight. Like 12 hours on the PC. And it was really boring and felt like a huge waste. Since I couldn't play any games. Now I've been playing
 for two to three days with these new settings. I'd say that nothing much changed.&nbsp;<br />
Only it's kinda weird that when I didn't change much and I actually balanced it more since I lost so many performance limit errors. I took off power consumption limit, aka tdp packet power consumption sizes. 95 TDP used to be a limit with short 115W boost or
 something like that. Now in torturetest it can go to 1150W-130W, usually sticks on 130W without AVX offset. And it's running Avx workload. But I've been playing games like Fortnite etc, with low settings. Nothing that stressing. The TDP has been probably lower
 than 100W for sure, but occasional spikes still when I play something else. Except I haven't in recent days.<br />
<br />
Is it possible that&nbsp; any stress testing earlier has fried/broken something, which now acts in a weird way? But don't know what yet since there's no often occurring crashes. *knocks on wood*, man gotta knock so many times on wood. I would phrase that other way.
 If it seems like PC part related, I can't really know which one is causing it. Don't want to say yet, because this beauty has been working good.<br />
<br />
My last rig which crashed a lot due to RAM was a lot different. Faulty stuff crashes a lot more, and if like my GPU is becoming fried it would probably give other code, crash in 100% load etc. Motherboards are weird, can't say anything about that. CPU, ehh
 not really since I monitor it all the time and it can withstand tests really nice. Only thing which I can't see are the VRM heats.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My Vcore is pushing like 1.210v-1.230v at max. Other voltages are on my motherboard defaults, and some CPU related are probably on Intel/Motherboard ones. I have speedstep and turbo enabled. But to my knowledge turbo when enabled doesn't work, if you have overclock.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My Overclock btw is 45x core multiplier, aka sync all cores 45x, c-states enabled, vrm spectrum disabled, xmp not on, most stuff on Auto, cache 42x multiplier max, min 8x. Vcore is on adaptive totaling like 1.210v voltage.. ohh, no totaling 1.200v max I checked.
 VID is 1.210v. VIN3 1.080V CONSTANT I don't know why it's constantly on that voltage.<br />
+5V 5.040V<br />
+3.3V 3.360V<br />
+12V 12.192<br />
VIN4 1.952V&nbsp;<br />
VIN6 1.008V&nbsp; &nbsp;These are from HWmonitor, not HWiNFO64. But what I've seen those show the same things pretty much. Except HWiNFO64 may have different names for stuff.&nbsp;<br />
VIN7 1.216V&nbsp; &nbsp;BTW, my PC is doing Blend test atm on Prime95. It isn't the most CPU intensive. The torture one above stresses my pc more, this was like more balanced stress test and tests ram also. Since I can't use usb/floppy/disc, anything like that currently
 for Memtest. Maybe when I can buy Usb-stick and at this moment I really doubt anything like that. Could be when there was RAM load, but hope not. Now doing Prime95 stresses just to test some bits of my RAM. I can't ofc know which packages it is taking. So,
 might not find anything. For example when my RAM was faulty when I ordered Corsair ones. I did 16h Memtest test, and I had 2 sticks plugged in. No problems in the test.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When I couldn't figure what was wrong, I sent all my parts, my whole pc to where I ordered it. And it was RAM's fault.. I didn't test 1 stick at a time. So I know this stuff can show positive etc. Now since I have S model of Noctua I have more working area
 under the cooler and may be up to that if it comes to it. And even if I don't start crashing I will probably just incase check if it has something sneaky. Like when my RAM got faulty, it crashed maybe once in 10 days, but started occurring more often. First
 it happened in the game called Rust, then on destop.. then it was 5 mins after booting. Not fun.<br />
<br />
But yea.. Enough of rambling. I add few parts more. I'm running Windows 10 64bit Home version, original copy of course. Windows is up to date, don't remember downloading any recent drivers to anything.. New installations yes, but no new drivers. I mean like
 plugins, addons and some game files.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also if anyone can solve one thing for me. Why I have my CPU at 4.5ghz most of times, even though my vcore is on adaptive. Cache could be on static, at least Intel Extreme Tuning Utility says say on CPU Cache, that it's static. Written in yellow.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My powerplan has minimum of 5%, it's in adaptive. I have also set up all the things in a way it could sleep. Previously I didn't have cache at 42x though at all times. I had too little of voltages, avx offset on (caused problems), my CPU ran on 4.7ghz no problems
 and cache was hovering in 4.3ghz or more. But it was throttling due to some limits etc. Like powerlimits, ICCMAX for example is at 255 right now. And the CPU powerlimits are at maximum since the CPU doesn't draw more than it needs. I don't know is my MB designated
 to withdraw 110W-130W CPU power consumption on torture tests. But it was one thing that was throttling me, having too little power draw. Now I'm at 4.5ghz core, but cache is 4.2ghz. It was previously too, but it was throttling, like. I played games, no fps
 drops nor crashes. But HWiNFO64 was saying Yes on performance limits at many parts. And cache fixed it, so I think it was downclocking or something else. And now if it's static but too much, maybe like VRM on Auto thought it was too much. Then I don't know.
 Since that, that I've been running only for 4 days. Wouldn't go back to those old settings though since I had problems with those. And automatic settings ramps up the voltage too much. I can run decently low voltages on my chip, tdp packets are the problem
 but it was prime95.. It's a good chip still, I just upped the voltages really much when it didn't work steady in Prime95 avx workload without offset. Like +0.30v. So I could run this even lower voltage. So the Auto settings are out of window, and I don't want
 to run the Intel/Asus boost. Like it harms too much the pc. I know I can set up manual vcore and rest on Auto, but still. I have enabled and disabled features, not upped all the clock rates. And still most things are on Auto or defaults after Bios update to
 the latest.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
GPU settings I haven't touched in Bios, and I feel like it isn't even done in Bios. Afterburner I haven't touched either, only ramped up the curves.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi  Saucoj
<br />
<br />The mini-dump file indicates your Nvidia graphics card device driver as the root cause of your system crashes.
<br />
<br />You mention it is overclocked?
<br />
<br />Possibly reverting the device driver for that device to an earlier version may be more compatible with your system . . .

<p>I don't understand it much, maybe it's Nvidia related what I googled earlier. But why you think it's not something to worry about? Just thinking, because bluescreens are no joke after dealing with PC part issues in the past. I just want a relief, that's

<p>Okay that sounds okay. What about changing motherboard, activating the same Window with connected Outlook account. Do the dumps get removed, or do they get removed as the time goes on?&nbsp;<br />
(Bought OEM, Outlook linked) Since I have had pc shutdowns randomly sometimes, but I don't have any dumps of them. And I haven't seen my screen any time this has happened. But would you say the code only states it was driver related crash?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I searched the internet, some crashes like this same driver crash had more code from dumps to read. Like what stuff was running when it crashed even though the drivers or gpu was at fault. So in that code is there more info about the crash and what was running
 also and other possible reasons? Because when I was viewing my eventlog viewer and put those codes into the internet it said that it is probably hardware related. Overheating etc. So does that dumpfile contain information like SystemEvenLog does? Or do I have
 to import them some way?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Since there is like recent 10+ critical and red errors. (Critical yellow triangle, and red just the white arrows in red circle) I don't mean in a row like, but few today and some during recent days. Like few critical and multiple red ones.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
From 24th day it is loaded with that stuff, like "a lot". Many are DistributedCOM, but there are different ones of course. Dozen+ yellow triangles and a lot of red errors. Sources for red ones: EventLog, DistributedCOM, Kernel-Power, Kernel-Boost. Of course
 there are the info ones. And the triangles are a whole different story. But those red ones contain. Event ID on one EventLog is: 6008 .&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Then there's bugcheck with:&nbsp; (sorry it's in Finland. Don't know how to change EventLogs language, been too busy to change whole operating systems language. It picked Finnish on force.);&nbsp;<br />

            I have also few red EventLogs and source is EventLog. And I googled it down, like eventid qualifiers, eventid, keywords. I found that it was hardwarde issues.. So could my BSOD be a hardware issue, or would it have showed on the dump for 100% ?&nbsp;<br />
Or did the dump show even 28/08/2018 and it was 8:12am here, around that time. Like I don't know, I think it should show my local time to people viewing the file. So if it doesn't show that far, it may has dumps about something else. Like a crash when I have
 been doing something else and have shutdown pc by force. (It's been some time since something like that has happened, Nvidia share froze and I had to shut down. But only has happened once.)<br />
<br />
But can you see in the dump posted in the thread, in the onedrive link at the first post. That when were the last eventlogs. If there was no EventLogs during like 8:12am and after that like 8:16am and so on, then it contains and old dump containing something
 else. I need that confirmed. So if it is 100% in the dump what happened, and it doesn't look bad. I can get a small relief. But if it doesn't show that far, it's an another dump and maybe like my eventlog has then the hardware crashes in it..? If it's the
 case, can you give me instructions how to post todays or recent eventlogs. Not one, but multiple or something, in a way that is easy to also read and check.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But I hope and cross my fingers that the dump file shows long enough and that eventlog isn't a separated thing which shows different types of problems.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hello there, sorry to hear you're having a corrupted save issue, been there myself and it's not a good feeling.</p>
<p>That said, once a save file has become corrupted there is nothing that can be done to restore or fix said save. &nbsp;All you can really do is delete the corrupted save file and if possible, revert back to an earlier save and continue from there. &nbsp;If the game
 in question does not allow multiple saves and instead uses a auto-save single save model, all you can really do is start over and if possible backup your save on another device so that so have a copy of the save that you can use to restore your progress should
 it happen again.</p>
<p>Sorry hate to be the bearer of bad news</p>

<p>Sorry but knowitall is right a corrupt file cant be fixed, the only option you have is to delete it and start again. this happen to me on assassin's creed 2, so i know how this feels. but the achievements you have got wont be lost, only the in game items
 you have collected will be lost.</p>

<p>Try loading the game up and instead of continue, select load.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>This happened to me on Fable 2 when they game froze up while saving. When you hit continue, the game will always load the last save you made so just load the auto save under that.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>After that, you should start alternating saves. Save on slot one and then save on slot 2 the next time you wish to save...that way you will always have a slot that is probably 5 - 10 minutes away. (if you are saving frequently)<br />
<br />
What I always do with large scale games is also create a back-up copy on a flash drive too...as long as the game lets you copy the files to a usb.</p>

<p>Alright well my Xbox Froze on me 2 days so i turned it off and then back on. tried to play Skyrim again and it said that my save file was corrupted looked all over on line to see how to get it back and everyone said the same thing "Too Bad Cant get it back
 Start Over" So unfortunately I did... however i did not erase my file. Then today i tried to see if there was anyway to get my file back and i did. I don't know if it was a fluke and i just got lucky and don't know if it will work for you but it did for me.
 wish you guys luck! Okay so this is what i did. First i Deleted the System Cache. Then i went to System Apps/Games went down to my Game (Skyrim) selected the Corrupt Save file Copied it from My EXternal drive to my Xbox memory. then i deleted the original
 save file ( External Drive). Next i Copied It again from the Xbox Memory To the Cloud and deleted the one in the Xbox memory. After That i Moved it Back to my external drive. Then deleted the save file From the cloud memory. Started the game up selected to
 load my saved game and presto! It loaded and started to play with no problem.</p>

<p>Thank you Chica.</p>
<p>your answer gave me a little help.</p>
<p>I only recovered my most important save sadly :(</p>
<p>however it worked.</p>
<p>I had a backup of the files on my external hard drive and laptop. I kept overwriting and sometimes i could get the files transferred when it didn't say that it was corrupted.</p>

<p><strong>hi;</strong></p>
<p><strong>ok i have a really old microsoft works for windows, version 3.0 from the mid 90's.</strong></p>
<p><strong>with many .wks files. these files use "" for empty cells in the spreadsheet, and</strong></p>
<p><strong>numerical equations that act if the cell is not "" and has numbers in it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>openoffice and excel seem to do strange things with the "" and also thinks that non</strong></p>
<p><strong>numerical values have to be acted on... so in open office/excel i get garbage out</strong></p>
<p><strong>of these equations. ( i have hundreds of spreadsheets like this ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>later versions of works (7) have no problem.</strong></p>
<p><strong>this ms works 3.0 has worked on my machincs for the last decade plus, running</strong></p>
<p><strong>windows 95, 98, xp and vista ( all were 32 bit or smaller ).</strong></p>
<p><strong>my new machine runs windows 7 64-bit and will not run this ms works 3.0</strong></p>
<p><strong>error: "the version of this file is not compatible with the version of windows you're</strong></p>
<p><strong>running. check your computer's system information to see whether you need an x86</strong></p>
<p><strong>(32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version of the program, and then contact the software</strong></p>
<p><strong>publisher."</strong></p>
<p><strong>i tried running it in vista, xp compatibility mode, but the programme will not even</strong></p>
<p>start.&nbsp;</p>
<p>anyway of getting windows 7/64 to run this old old old programme or is it time to buy a new</p>
<p>version of ms works?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<blockquote>or is it time to buy a new version of ms works?</blockquote>
<p>Your copy of MS Works is a 16 bit based application. Yes, it may be time to air out the wallet, but there are some alternatives.</p>
<p>I believe you will need to run and install&nbsp;<strong>Virtual PC</strong> in&nbsp;<strong>XP Mode</strong> to have any chance of a fully operational 16 bit subsystem. If you are running Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate, you can use<em> Windows XP Mode</em> and<em>

                    <p>I have many other errors too but this is getting out of hand. These are seemingly random. It will happen when I am watching twitch.tv streams, watching netflix, playing video games, and even when I'm not at the computer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Steps I have taken:<br />
<br />
Enabled Driver Verifier<br />
Ran MEMTEST86 for 6 1/2 hours on both sticks</p>
<p>Ran MEMTEST86 for 1.5 hours on each stick individually</p>
<p>Ran Western Digital SMART HD scans (short and long version)<br />
Ran Windows Refresh</p>
<p>Ran SFC.exe /scannow<br />
Ran DISM /online /<span>Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</span><br />
<br />
I have done all this and still have Blue Screens. I can't seem to figure out if I am having driver issues or if this is a hardware issue. Hopefully with all these hardware tests this shouldn't be an issue but I am not ruling it out.<br />
<br />
Here is a link some of my DMPS (9)<br />

<p>Hi Guys,<br />
<br />
I'm making a new thread because my old one is not receiving attention and I made it almost 2 weeks ago. The blue screens have come back. I have enabled driver verifier again and have 3 new dmps with it turned on. They are all pointing to ISCTD.sys and ntoskrnl.exe.
 I will be uploading the dmp's here. Thanks for your help!<br />

I have already enabled Driver Verifier and had 2-3 crashes since I enabled it. Since I enabled it yesterday the DMP's from today should be able to pinpoint what drivers caused it. If I didn't do the driver verifier properly I will reset the verifier and try
 it again.<br />

            <p>Sorry for replying so much but I thought this might be useful to you, after I re-enabled driver verifier I went to restart my computer and it blue screened twice on boot, so fast that I almost didn't see it happen. After the second crash on boot Windows
 8.1 went into a repair mode and went to a quick system diagnostics for less than 30 seconds. At which point a screen came up and said that windows failed to boot and it was suggested that I could either do a restart, or I could go to advanced options (I'm
 guessing it had windows repair and windows refresh options in there).<br />
<br />
I opted to restart and it started normally. After making it into windows I verified that driver verifier was still working using verifier /query in elevated cmd and verifier /querysettings and it looks like driver verifier is still running.<br />
<br />
I guess I just didn't know if the crash on boot was normal or not, seems strange that it happened two times in a row, but after windows went into that repair mode it was able to get in.<br />
<br />
Regardless I will be keeping this running until I get some more blue screens (If I get anymore). I also posted my verifier /query and my verifier /querysettings below incase something in there catches your eye.
<br />
You do some amazing work! Thanks so much!!!<br />

            I know you want two but this may be the best that I can get, after Blue Screen my computer will hang. The monitor will not turn back on, no response from mouse or keyboard. After hitting my restart key it blue screens on start up and hangs. The Blue screen
 code for that one is DRIVER_VERIFIER_IOMANAGER_VIOLATION. It will not create the dmp file, it sits at zero percent. After hitting my restart key again it starts normally. I am attaching a dmp it did create this morning, If it happens again I will upload another
 one but hopefully this one will help tune into the driver causing the problem. Thanks again for your help.<br />

            This driver came with my motherboard's cd drivers. It's an ASRock z87 Extreme4 LGA 1150. Although I downloaded the drivers from the ASRock website, the official Intel website provided the same driver. Regardless I uninstalled the drivers from ASRock's
 website and installed the drivers from Intel's website.&nbsp;

</p><p>But... if I shut down my PC the normal way, and I start it again, it starts with a black screen. Only my curser can be seen. I have to press start for 10 sec.&nbsp; to shut down the PC, and when I start the PC up&nbsp;again, it works OK.</p>

                    So, I recently updated my windows, and with that, it automatically updated my intel graphics driver, which I don't want as the latest one does not allow custom resolutions. Is there any way I can roll back my intel graphics driver?

<h2>            Forcing WMC to use a specific physical channel all the time</h2>
                    
<p><span><span>What is the registry setting to use a specific physical channel all the time? And not be replaced when the guide is updated at night?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In Chicago ABC is on physical channel 7.x (excellent reception) and 44.x in the far suburbs (poor reception for my location). I’ve already gone through using different

<p><span><span>Answer of “Windows is sold as is” is not acceptable. As I’ve ask this question before and I know Windows 7 works when it uses channel 7.x.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi, Tim.<br />
There should be an "un-mark as answer" link shown (to you, since you "own" the thread) in the footer of that reply.</p>
<p>Next idea:&nbsp; split the channel.&nbsp; In Edit Sources for that channel, next to the ordering arrows, you'll see a button that says 'split.'<br />
Click that (for 44.1), and it'll be moved to a separate listing in the Guide.&nbsp; Hit Save.<br />
Now, back in Edit Channels, un-check 44.1 (to disable it.)&nbsp; To make it even more unlikely that MC will ever use that channel again (because, sometimes it'll re-enable a channel on its own - that problem goes back at least to MCE2k5....), edit that channel's
 listings to 'use no listings for this channel' (and, make sure that it's still disabled when you're done.)<br />
Do those, and MC&nbsp; <em>should</em>&nbsp; never try to use 44.1 again.</p>
<p>HTH,<br />
Chris</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 recovery.</h2>
                    I had been using windows 8.1 for about a couple of years now. But owing to a sudden
<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">hdd crash</span> I lost all my data including my OS. I could not even create a copy of my recovery partition. Is there any way I can get back my genuine windows OS back?

<h2>            Sony HDR-FX1 video camera is not recognized in Windows 7 &#40;using 1394 legacy driver&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I spent the entire day yesterday surfing the Web for a solution.&nbsp; Sony's website claims the HDR-FX1 ( a $3k High Definition Video camera) should work with the drivers included in Windows 7.&nbsp; I have&nbsp; Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; There is no response from the
 system when I connect the FX1 to a Firewire port and the video software (Sony Vegas 9) can't see the device.&nbsp; Also, the camera does not show up in the Device Manager.</p>
<p>I am not a novice user.&nbsp; Also, I have two FX1s and neither works under Windows 7.&nbsp; Both worked under Windows XP&nbsp;with Sony Vegas 9.</p>
<p>I read Microsoft's white paper on the switch to IEEE1394b.&nbsp; That paper implies, but does not state absolutely, that the 'legacy'&nbsp;IEEE1394 driver in Windows 7 is the same as the driver that was in Windows XP.&nbsp;&nbsp;From the&nbsp;problem I am experiencing it&nbsp;appears
 the two drivers are not completely equivalent.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;have not tried Windows XP compatibility mode yet because I have no assurance that the original XP drivers are implemented in compatiblity mode.&nbsp; Please verify.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your effort in&nbsp;helping me solve this problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Who is the manufacturer of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may check if the FireWire port is working fine or not. You may check in Device Manager if IEEE1394 port is available under Port category.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, go to the manufacturer’s website and check if there are any updates available for the FireWire port for the computer. Update the driver and check if the devices are detected.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If there is no driver update from the manufacturer available, then you might have to update the chipset drivers from the manufacturer and check if that helps.</span></p>

<p>Hi Amrita,</p>
<p>Thanks so much for your reply.&nbsp; It&nbsp; is indeed comforting to know that someone at Microsoft is listening.</p>
<p>As it turned out there were several contributing factors:</p>
<p>1. The ASUS motherboard I am using is not listed as compatible with Windows 7.&nbsp; So, although I am able to get most of the functionality I need running Windows 7, the built-in IEEE1394 ports may not be working at all.</p>
<p>2. But the main problem is that the IEEE1394 port on the Sony HDR-FX1 is not hot swappable (in spite of what the IEEE1394 standard calls for) and it seems I have blown out the IEEE1394 port on one of my FX1s during my attempts to connect to Windows 7.</p>
<p>3. Since the port on the camera is dead I have&nbsp;no way of knowing&nbsp;if the IEEE1394a PCI card that I inserted in the motherboard during one of my attempts to connect was actually working.</p>
<p>Fortunately I have two FX1s.&nbsp; On the other camera, the IEEE1394 port is still working.&nbsp; So I bought an IEEE1394a CardBus card for my Windows XP laptop and I am now up and running.&nbsp; I will keep an XP machine alive as long as I have&nbsp;my cameras so that I will
 always be able to download the video to that machine&nbsp;and then move it to the machine on which I am doing the editing.</p>
<p>Thanks much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It might well be possible that because the motherboard does not support Windows 7, you are experiencing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are planning a change in the motherboard and if the IEEE1394 port on one of the cameras is taken care of, I am sure there shouldn’t be
 any problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I too am having issues with the Sony HDR-FX1 camera and Windows 7 64-bit. Immediately upon connecting the camera to my firewire port, Windows downloaded and installed drives for the camcorder. It is listed under "Devices and Printers" however not under "Device
 Manager". None of my capturing software detect it either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also came across this page (&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/Windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;p=Sony%20Handycam%20HDR-FX1%20MiniDV%203.5LCD%2012x%20Camcorder&amp;v=Sony&amp;uid=HDR-FX1&amp;l=en-US&amp;pf=1&amp;pi=2&amp;c=Cameras%20%26%20Photo&amp;sc=Camcorders&amp;os=64-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/Windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;p=Sony%20Handycam%20HDR-FX1%20MiniDV%203.5LCD%2012x%20Camcorder&amp;v=Sony&amp;uid=HDR-FX1&amp;l=en-US&amp;pf=1&amp;pi=2&amp;c=Cameras%20%26%20Photo&amp;sc=Camcorders&amp;os=64-bit</a>&nbsp;).
 Does this simply mean, it is not supported and thats the end of the story? Is there a way to run it in compatibility mode so that I can use it on my system? The camera worked perfect on my previous XP computer.</p>

            <p>Guys&nbsp; Sony Cameras Such as the Sony HDR FX1 E&nbsp; and the Sony Z1-p&nbsp; Operate in "FILE ACCESS MODE"&nbsp; you will need&nbsp; Windows&nbsp; to understand&nbsp; "FILE ACCESS MODE"&nbsp; or it will not identify your connected device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should know this !!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Windows will not have the "FAM" drivers for the Cameras included on Windows 7 , 8 and 10&nbsp; Under IEEE 1394 Legacy Drivers. your Pc will not understand what to do with them or associate a device type by simply connecting the camera.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;You need to connect these cameras with an I-Link Cable Firewire to your PC, (as well as Macs).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also need to tell your Computer What your connecting on your "IEEE 1394 Firewire Cable port" and get it to recognize it as a Video Camera otherwise Windows won't know what to do with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>get the&nbsp; "FAM" (File Access Mode) Driver" for all HDV and DV Cameras Here....this Driver does also work with other Brands of Cameras&nbsp; such as Cannon and JVC etc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Sony FX1 HDV&nbsp; and Sony Z1p Cameras&nbsp; they have I-links on the side of the cameras...you need an i-link cable, connect it to your camera and your firewire port on your PC have it turned on "Camera"..&nbsp; not VTR TAPE !! (Doing this will page the live camera
 through to your PC and is easier to identify your camera without having to run tapes for your Pc to find the feed). you can switch&nbsp; to VTR mode later when your camera is identified and start capturing and transferring data.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">RESOLUTION: </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Download&nbsp; The Sony Video Camera FAMDriver Here: </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/famdriver</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The Fam Driver is Compatible with Linux, x32 Bit, and x64 Bit Computers running windows 7, 8, and 10 as well as other operating systems</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>i.LINK FAM Driver is a driver software that allows users file operations by file access mode (called FAM) from a computer connected to a XDCAM product such as PDW-F1600, PDW-HD1500, HDRZ1-P, HDRFX1E.. .etc....any camera using the HDV and DV i-link.</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can direct capture live camera, use it as a webcam, skype video calls, facebook calls, and Web Stream Live camera.&nbsp; as well as Download Tape capture and detect CF cards on the Sony Z1-P&nbsp; Camera as a Hard drive, in case your Pc does not have a CF card
 Reader, you can search the CF Card&nbsp; directly through the firewire cable&nbsp; and send onto Your Editing and or Capture Program such as Sony Vegas Pro, and Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SONY Play Memories Software will not recognize these kind of I-Link cameras because of the lack of on board software as it does not contain an on board hard drive, whereas other cameras that have onboard HArd drives include the drivers and software on board
 the Hard Drive Cameras...The Sony Fx 1 does not have self loading drivers...so install those FAM drivers on your Pc.

</p><p>USE OTHER VIDEO CAPTURE SOFTWARE WITH THE "SONY I-LINK FAM DRIVER INSTALLED".</p>
<p>
</p><p>However Sony Vegas Pro 11, 12, 13, Pinnacle, and Adobe Editing software does recognize the I-link Cameras with the FAM Drivers installed on your PC, (so does Mac Final Cut Pro)

<p>Bummer, sorry the steps didn't help. Are you seeing this issue with others games on the console as well? Are you using an external hard drive to store the game or the internal drive? If you're using an external drive, try to install the game to the internal
 drive and see if that helps. </p>
<p>Let us know!</p>

<h2>            Restarting my PC increase non paged pool</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have actually a really weird issue. As I said in the title, the non paged memory of my computer increase a lot when I restart my PC.</p>
<p>If I shut it down, and then start it again, I will have around 170Mo of non paged memory, which is, I guess, normal. However, if I restart it, then I will have around 1,2Go of non paged memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's almost 1/3 of my total RAM !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't figure out where it's coming from, I looked everywhere..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help !</p>

<h2>            Clean install Windows 10 Activation problem &#40;0xC004C003&#41; Key has been blocked</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center"><strong>Clean install Windows 10 Activation problem (0xC004C003) Key has been blocked</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been reading this forum about the Activation problem and I'm confused. After my chat with support MS told me to wait 24/48h, 5 days also. I see that some people here have been waiting for more then a week with no result.
<br />
<br />
I bought this <a href="http://www.msi.com/product/nb/GT70-2PE-Dominator-Pro.html#hero-specification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
new&nbsp;laptop </a>in december with Windows 8 already installed and not soon after I Uprgraded to 8.1. The setup crashed my laptop and I had to do a system Recovery, installed Windows 8, and upgraded to 8.1 and again&nbsp;it crashed, but after reboot it worked and I
 used it till Windows 10&nbsp; came out.<br />
<br />
Same problem with upgrading from 8.1 to 10. After the upgrade&nbsp;my laptop started crashing and getting black screens. I also was annoyed Cortana wasn't supported in my country, didn't even work when I changed region to US. I also contacted support about the Edge
 browser that didn't let me share web notes with the email-App. My Windows 10 experience was a big disappointment.<br />
<br />
After I installed&nbsp;the new Nvidia graphics driver (355.60) it crashed and gave me a black screen. After reboot my Windows 10 wasn't working properly. Couldn't use the start button on the task bar, edge browser&nbsp;was gone, mouse tool was gone and my laptop was
 laggy.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Then I&nbsp;decided to do a clean install using the 'media creation tool'&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong><em>"Can I perform a clean install using the Free upgrade?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>No, it will require that you are running a previous qualifying version and start the upgrade from within the qualifying version. You can initiate a clean install after completing the Upgrade."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I clean installed I made sure my Windows 10 was activated --&gt; <strong>Command prompt ---&gt; slmgr /xpr
</strong><strong>---&gt; Enter </strong>and the dialog box said it was permanently activated. So I thought it was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation went fine without any crashes and black screens and my laptop was running great after and still is. Except the next day when I started up my laptop I suddenly have this message on my screen saying I need to Activate windows, "Activate Windows
 Go to settings to activate Windows" "Windows isn't activated activate windows now" Error code: 0xC004C003, key has been blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why, it was permanently activated yesterday but now it is blocked because I cleaned my Hard drive ?<br />
</p>

            <p>It's frustrating that support is saying 2 things :</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Wait 24/48 hours, 5 days and it will activate by itself </p>
<p>2) Shouldn't have done a clean install deleting everything on your Harddisc, now you have to buy</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The other problem I have now is that I can't go back to Windows 8.1 because I deleted the recovery partitions. If my windows doesn't get activated I need to send my laptop back&nbsp;to the&nbsp;manufacturer and pay&nbsp;to get that&nbsp;reinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it would be great if I got some answers.</p>

<p>Guess I'm a noob for doing that and learning the hard way.</p>

            <p>I have that very same problem. I find out that I had Windows 10 <strong>Core</strong> after upgrade from Windows 8.1 Pro and when I downloaded Media creation tool there was no option for
<em>Core</em> Windows, only Home or Pro. I guess that's the reason why it's not activated yet (probably won't be).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I thought you might want to check which Windows 10&nbsp;you had earlier. It's on your Microsoft account.</p>

            I checked my MS Account and I see that I have 2 devices now, both Windows 10 Core. There is a difference in the last two numbers but I don't know what that means. I only have 1 laptop<br />

            <p>I solved my problem. Earlier, I reinstalled wrong Windows edition, Home instead Pro.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try remember what 8.1 you had earlier, Pro or Home, then rebuild it on usb with proper version using Media creation tool, and make clean install again. I didn't have to wait. It was activated instantly. Good luck. :)</p>

<h2>            How do I get rid of this piece of junk windows 8 and reinstall my Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Bought a new computer thinking it was loaded with Windows 7 only to find it has Windows 8 installed.Spent two days grappling with this sorry excuse of a system that should have been aborted before birth.Unable to play chess titans or choose page size&nbsp; 5a
 amongst other grumbles and&nbsp;as for performing a quick transaction ,could have it done and dusted in W7 while still opening up in W8.My computer is an Asus G75VW-9Z396H and if there is anybody out there who can guide me through the uninstall of W8 and remove
 everything with it then I am o.k.for reinstalling W7 as I have the disc to do this.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            Tried the start 8 and yes it did put the start menu back but the heart of Windows 7 is still missing.Just to give a couple of examples your choice of page size in wordpad&nbsp;is sorely limited in W8 whereas in W7 more or less unlimited plus there is an extensive
 selection of free games on W7 but W8 is out to squeeze money for the pleasure of those ugh games that are loaded.Thank you for attempting to help but once I find out if I can return to W7 then I am off like a shot.

            Thank you for making me aware about the printer driver and the games but could you give me guidance on how to load my Windows 7 Home Premium disc into one of my spare drives so I could have the choice of dual booting.

    <title>Problem with driver on emachine desktop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem with driver on emachine desktop</h2>
                    I have a newer emachines ET1641 model with vista home prem. I had a crash that I couldn't restore or recover the machine. I also have an older emachines W3050 model with XP, and I inadvertantly used the recovery disks for the XP on the 1641. It did the
 recovery thing and now i have XP on the 1641, but it didnt install drivers for the 1)Ethernet Controllor 2)PCI Device 3)PCI Simple Communications Controllor 4)SM Bus Controllor 5)Video Controllor. I would like to reinstall Vista, but With these problems I
 cannot access the internet to get the drivers or anything. The laptop I am using has access so can you help me at least get the drivers for it, or is the hardware not compattable with xp? Please help...I am lost. Thanks a bunch

            Hi justagamenot,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Vista Support forum,<br />
<br />
The model you mentioned, ET1641 only support Vista.&nbsp; Emachines (Gateway) only have Vista drivers for that system.&nbsp; You can look for drivers from other source like Windows Update but it won't be support by the system.&nbsp; There is no Windows XP available for this
 system.&nbsp; You should reinstall Vista on it using the ET1641's recovery disk.&nbsp; If you do not have one, you can contact Emachines to obtain one.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,
