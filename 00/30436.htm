<h2>            Themes Downloads</h2>
                    I installed Windows 10 and decided to go back to Windows 7. Now I am unable to download themes. Has anyone else had this problem?

            This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

<h2>            Windows Media Player not finding correct CD information</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Media player does not recognise a CD - how do I add the track names of this CD to the ONLINE Windows Media Player database, so that every computer the CD is put into will automatically come up with the correct CD title and track names?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The CD is called "Ojos de la Tierra" by Mark Barnwell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Media player thinks it is "Passionata" by Mark Barnwell - which has 12 tracks, not 10 ("Ojos de la Tierra" has 10 tracks) and they are all different lengths.</p>
<p>
</p><p>iTunes works fine with "Ojos de la Tierra", but Windows Media Player does not recognise it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get "Ojos de la Tierra" added to the ONLINE Windows Media Player database, so that anyone, anywhere in the world can insert an "Ojos de la Tierra" CD into their computer, and Windows Media Player will find the correct CD name and the correct track
 names?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance</p>

    <title>HPWA_Main.exe Bad Image- Framework 64 diasymreader.dll - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> b.h. stein  say:</h3>
<h2>            HPWA_Main.exe Bad Image- Framework 64 diasymreader.dll</h2>
                    
<p>I recently got a new Windows 7 laptop and from the beginning it has had a strange error that loads on startup. It says;</p>
<p>"C:Windows:Microsoft.NET/Framework64/v2.0.5027/diasymreader.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or software vendor
 for support."</p>
<p>This error message remains on the screen and will reappear instantly once the "OK" button or close is pressed, getting in the way of my work. While it hasn't done anything extremely harmful yet, I was concerned, so I have scanned&nbsp;diasymreader.dll with both
 anti-malware and anti-virus programs. By all accounts, the file seems to be clean.</p>
<p>So what is wrong and how can it be fixed? Restoring my system seems to make it go away for a little while, but I want it to be fixed permanently. Any help would be much appreciated, because if I don't fix this, I might have to swith computer brands, and
 I love this new laptop right now. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello B.H. Stein,</p>
<p>Diasymreader.dll (Dia based SymReader) is a component from the software Microsoft Visual Studio. If you have installed Visual Studio, you might want to uninstall it, download and install it again to see if you can get rid of the error.<br />
<br />
If this is a brand new computer, I would contact the manufacturer for assistance as you stated you have had this error from the beginning.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Secondary hard drive users folder after W10 anniversary update was renamed to pictures and displayed pictures icon</h2>

<p>
</p><p>I have been able to create a Users folder, on drive D:&nbsp; after changing premissions, and copy the users folders with all sub-folders and contents from the created pictures folder after W10 anniversary update and then deleted the pictures folder that was created
 after W10 anniversary update but the programs that were not working are still not working.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I had 4 system running windows 10 pro that I applied the W10 anniversary update and 3 of them updated OK.&nbsp; The 3 had only one drive C:</p>

            <p>I have a configuration something similar to yours, I have an SSD drive for OS and APPS and a HDD for Data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The proper way to move My Documents, My Pictures . . . etc to the data drive is to create a User folder on the data drive, then right click each of the folders e.g. My Pictures and select properties, then the location tab and move folder to data drive by
 settings the location to new user folder/My Pictures</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a6f37caa-5b4c-4603-b373-19257cdb016e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a6f37caa-5b4c-4603-b373-19257cdb016e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think perhaps the program data references have become un-referenced because you copied the files across to the data drive . . .</p>
<p>

            <p>These sorts of issues are par for the course because MS has never supported moving the Users or user account folders to any other non-system partition. As Dave mentioned, only the location of My Documents, My Pictures etc. can be officially modified, and
 that feature too took years to be introduced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are lots of workarounds including using junction points and so on, but invariably these break and cause big messes with updates and especially upgrades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your best bet would be to reinstall the programs to the exact same locations on D: as before, overwriting their existing files. The only other option would be to root through any config files and the registry to set right all relevant paths to point to D:
 again, but you'll most likely just waste your time doing that with no guarantee of success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe one day MS will think about users with small SSDs or those owning devices like tablets, 2-in-1s etc. with small eMMC/flash storage, but I'm guessing they'll just wait till larger SSDs are cheap enough that this ceases to become a problem. Much easier
 and cheaper for them, no?</p>

<p>I had a similar problem with the Windows Creator update to Win 10. &nbsp;My SSD has the OS and programmes on it. &nbsp;The HDD has my personal data files. When I accepted the Win Creator update, it ended up transferring the HDD files to the SSD (totally filling it)
 and I could not use the computer. &nbsp;It was a lot of work to restore it to having the data files back on the HDD since the SSD overflowed and there was little working space left. DaveM121's solution of reestablishing the symbolic links and moving the data will
 hopefully help with the next problems: Win10 is now insisting I accept the Win Creator update on my other machines (4 of them) where I have declined for several months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of all would be in MS let one choose at the Creator Update where one has one's data files. &nbsp;Lots of people run a dual SSD HDD system.</p>

<p>Further to my post of July 9th, 2017: Finally Windows Creator Update gave me no options but to declare a privacy setting and then it was going to download and be implemented. (One can defer the update in the advanced settings, but I am not sure how long
 that would work for). At that point I disconnected the HDD and let it update (a long process). &nbsp;When it was complete, I connected the HDD again and it all worked, unlike the time when the update to the OS (on the SSD) was done with the HDD connected.</p>
<p>So this is a practical way to get around the Creator Update difficulty with SSD (for OS and programmes) and HDD for data.</p>

<h2>            Unable to sign into windows 10 store &#40;Sign in button literally doesn&#39;t work&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I recently redeemed a game, Gears of War 4, and I've been instructed that my game will be available to download through the windows 10 store. Problem is I can't log in. When&nbsp;I launch windows store and&nbsp;click the person with the + symbol, I get a drop down
 menu with the "Sign In" option, when I click this the drop down menu disappears and nothing happens at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried the sign in button where it says "Sign in to post a comment" and that doesn't work either. This is frustrating me!</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on windows 10 and i'm accessing the store by the app already installed on my PC. I am able to sign in to my Microsoft windows account online but that's useless as I can't access my games library to download anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when i'm signed into my Microsoft account online and click "shop now in windows store" it opens the store without me signed in, and it's the same problem. I literally can't click the sign in button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the troubleshooter and it kept telling me I needed a Microsoft account to sync my settings, I don't really know what to do about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>UPDATE:</strong></span></p>
<p>I have fixed the issue after watching this YouTube video:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Apparently all I needed to do was an update, took about 10 minutes to complete and now&nbsp;the store&nbsp;is working fine for me!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype for business only receiving messages on iPhone &#40;Over computer client&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a user who is currently using Skype for Business on both her laptop and her iPhone. The issue occurs very often, where she will receive a message on Skype, but the message only pops up on her phone, and nothing pops up on the laptops. She doesn't
 receive a notification, and she can't even see the message on her computer client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked her settings, and they are just the same as mine, after having tested whether it was an issue for me or not (it wasn't). Has anyone experienced anything similar, or know a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>1. What is the issue that you are facing with your computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. What type of diagnostic files are you referring to?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3. Have you run any Microsoft Diagnostics tool recently?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note</strong>: Windows Stores various logs from different system events and program cycles run within the operating system, there are certain log files that you may delete safely and then the system would recreate them. However, certain log files
 are required for the operating system to maintain and read\review on a regular basis, if those log files are modified or removed their dependent program may not work correctly.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may run the <strong>Disk clean up</strong> utility in <strong>Windows Vista

                    <p>Hello guys! I am using a Surface Go (With 120 GB of storage) running Windows 10 Home x64 1803, and I have a storage problem.</p>
<p>I am running out of space on my C: Drive. I have no USB support (Attaching an OTG (On-the-go) Cable will break it), I have a micro SD card but is for video purposes only.</p>
<p>One VHD was 50 GB, the other was 1 TB.</p>
<p>When I'm downloading a file, the VHD ejects from Windows 10 for no actual reason, the bigger, the faster.</p>
<p>I have only a few MB left.</p>
<p>Please Help Me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S Is there an option to make it PERMANENT?</p>

            <pre>Hi Ryan
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didnâ€:tm:t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you donâ€:tm:t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I donâ€:tm:t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didnâ€:tm:t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore â€“ System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesnâ€:tm:t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. Itâ€:tm:s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

<p>Yes, it is eligible. That task tray icon should show up if you have update <span>
KB3035583</span>&nbsp;installed.&nbsp;the task tray icon should appear&nbsp;in the next few days. That update was released in April and should already be installed. You might try manually checking for updates and

<h2>            Change Print Screen hotkey&#63;</h2>
                    The laptop I recently bought has no print screen key, so when I downloaded lightshot, it asked what hotkey I wanted and I set it to Ctrl+UpArrow. I just found out that a program that I'm using uses this hot key so I need to change it to something else.
 I cant change it via lightshot for some reason, the program doesn't open a UI (even when running as admin). Uninstalling and reinstalling didn't work either. I'm not entirely sure what to do as Lightshot has nothing on the matter, nor do they have any sort
 of forum.

<h2>            Windows Update KB3039703 tries to apply to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 Enterprise installed. It is domain joined.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is prompting me to install an update KB3039703. This is described as "Update for Microsoft Sharepoint Enterprise Server 2013 &nbsp;farm-deployment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It won't install. Error returned is 0x80240017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can only assume is because I am running windows 10 and not sharepoint enterprise server farm ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't get rid of the update like I could in previous versions of windows so now I always see this update available.</p>

            <p>I had this exact problem. To get rid of it I uninstalled Office 2013 completely and re-intsalled, then updated Windows. In fact it did appear again, but this time when it failed I selected retry and it clears and does not come back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is with OneDrive for business, if you uninstall this feature the update will go.</p>

            Same problem, same type of environment. Instead of uninstalling Office 2013, I simply closed/exit OneDrive from the System Tray. Then, retry updates. It seems to have updated successfully.

</p><p>I have genuine windows 8.1 pro, but accidentally my windows 8.1 got corrupted. Now I have install a fresh windows 10 pro, but it is not activated.</p>
<p>My question is Can we do a fresh installation of windows 10 , as we have previously a genuine windows 8.1 pro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have tried all methods ( Call and verification over internet &nbsp;), but all in vain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>How did you get to the "fresh windows 10 pro" install?&nbsp; If Windows 8.1 became corrupt, what method did you use to upgrade to Windows 10?&nbsp; I would think, at this point, to do a clean install of your Windows 8.1 Pro and attempt the upgrade to Windows 10 Pro
 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me, installing a new operating system over a corrupt operating system is not going to have good results.&nbsp; You cannot do a "clean install," without first doing the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be glad to help if you can give me more information, but please carefully read Mr. Da Costa's Wiki article.&nbsp; There is more information at the link below.</p>

            <p>Windows 10 activation is free if you upgrade a computer that is currently running Windows 8.1 or Windows 7 SP1. If a computer is not running either of those two operating systems at the time it is being upgraded, you have to buy a Windows 10 license to activate
 Windows 10.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case, to avoid buying a Windows 10 license you should do a clean install of Windows 8; upgrade to Windows 8.1; and then you can upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you start this process:</p>
<p>1- make sure you backup your personal data (Documents, Pictures, etc.); and</p>
<p>2- make sure you have license information for software you will have to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you are done it would be wise to learn how to make image backups of your operating system. Had you been doing this it would have been fast and easy to restore a backup of Windows 8.1 before it got accidentally corrupted.</p>

            <p>Agreed that I should upgrade first one after the other - </p>

<p>Now,</p>

<li>If my windows 8 is eligible for free upgrade, all the next upgraded versions will also be genuine and Activated?</li><li>I have the (<strong><em>Downloaded&nbsp;bootable DVD or Pen drive</em></strong>) of the latest build of
<em><strong>Windows 10&nbsp;( Build 10586</strong></em>). If I remove my original hard disk that came with the PC and &nbsp;carried the C drive and put in an SSD (<em><strong>No other changes of hard wares. It is on the same PC</strong></em>) and Install the Build 10586,
 will it get automatically get Activated ?</li><li>If not -</li><li>I can <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">extract the Keys of my old windows 10(the one before 10586)</span></strong>&nbsp;installation using
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Speccy or Belarc adviser</span></strong>. And if I re-install Windows on my new SSD can I use these Keys thus extracted to Activate during the progress of Windows installation?</li><li>If not do
<ul>
<li>these keys have any value at all ?.</li><li>If it failed to get activated what is the method of activation ?</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Purpose of Re-installation</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Like all previous version of Windows the whole C drive gets bloated up, and this 'swelling process' is faster as the installation ages.
</li><li>None of file cleaning applications are perfectly effective &nbsp;in under sizing the&nbsp; c drive to original size.</li><li>Re-imaging from images created using <strong>Macrium reflect </strong>or <strong>
Acronis</strong> helps a lot.</li><li>But as you add other applications the swelling process also 'improves', disproportional to what you have added to such a size that those backup programs mentioned above also becomes ineffective. But still they are the best.</li><li>There fore a 'Fresh Virgin installation' with all your applications may help.</li></ul>

You may never have had an infection before, but:<br />

Windows Defender was trying to warn you about it, and get you to clean&nbsp;the&nbsp;Malware&nbsp;from your Computer, but you turned Windows Defender Off.<br />

<h2>            Win10 boot stalls at 4 blue window logo before the dots start rotating</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspiron 620 desktop that's been running great, Win 10 Anniversary Update ( I haven't seen any indication that it's been updated beyond that). I've had no indications of any issues. Last night I performed my usual nightly cleaning and then
 restarted. The restart hung at the windows logo, before the rotating dots started. I let it hang like that for 5 minutes or so, then shut it down and went to bed. The only strange thing that happened during that last cleaning was that CCleaner told me Edge
 was open, but the task bar icon for Edge did not indicate that it was open, so I clicked the box to let CCleaner shut the open Edge and then clean. After that, nothing seemed unusual until the restart hung.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I turned on the computer, and it hung at the same spot. I've tried everything I know to try since then, and windows loading stalls at the same exact spot every time. I've hit F2 during POST and looked through BIOS settings. Didn't see anything
 unusual there. I've hit F12 during POST and selected Diagnostics. I got a short message that was gone before I could read it, followed by a black screen with a cursor arrow in the middle of the screen. I've hit F12 during POST and selected DVD drive to boot
 to a Win10 repair disk. Win stalled at the same 4 blue window logo booting from the Repair Disk. I've hit F8 during POST, and got to the same logo screen, except this time I got the words "Preparing Automatic Repair" below the logo. I let that one run about
 45 minutes before shutting down. I've hit F12 during POST and selected USB boot with a bootable Win 10 Installation USB inserted. Windows hung at the same 4 blue window logo, with no rotating dots.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>During all these attempts, I hear the fan come on normally and&nbsp;I see the hard drive indicator light come on when I press the power button, but get no hard drive&nbsp;light activity during any of the post-POST activity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate any and all thoughts and suggestions regarding my problem and how to fix it. Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
For us to better understand and isolate the issue, we'd like to ask if you're still able to reach desktop and login to Windows? If yes, check your current Windows version and build by following the steps below:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows Key + R.</strong><br />
</li><li>Type <strong>winver </strong>into the Run dialog, and press <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Include the Windows version and build on your next reply.<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>We'll wait for your response.</p>

            No, I can't get to the desktop because windows never finishes&nbsp;loading. It hangs at the 4 blue window logo before the rotating dots start rotating. Last I knew it was the Anniversary update. If the new update was installed, there was notification. There
 was no update beyond the Anniversary update to my knowledge.

            Using bootable USB with Windows 10 installation media would be our next step but since you've already tried doing that and it wasn't able to resolve the issue, we highly recommend to contacting Dell for additional support because we might be looking at
 a hardware failure that is causing the issue.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.

            Martin, thanks for your reply. As it turns out, I just got it running again, and I checked, it is still the Anniversary update (so I hadn't missed anything). Would appreciate your comments on the "fix". Over the last day and a half, I've read gazillions
 of google search results. At least one of them mentioned a problem with USB and my symptoms, so I removed all my USB connections, and it started right up&nbsp; (after going through a repair for an abnormal shutdown). I haven't taken the time yet to research the
 issue, but maybe you can quickly point me to documentation of a problem with USB that prevents a windows boot. Thanks.

<p>Well, I'm providing this update just for the record (in case someone else reads it and thinks there may be a connection between USB and boot failures based on my previous post. After I "fixed" it yesterday, it ran fine all day, but then I did my usual nightly
 clean and reboot. Well, that reboot failed, exactly as before, stalling just after POST, at the 4 blue window logo, before the dots started rotating. I shut it down, went to bed and hoped it would start this morning. But guess what, it didn't boot. It stalled
 on the 4 blue window logo, but instead of dots, I got the message "Preparing Automatic Rep[air". I let it run for an hour or so, ........no change. So I shut it down Later, I inserted a repair disk, powered on and hit F12 to boot from the DVD, again boot stalled
 at 4 blue window logo with no rotating dots. I let it run for a half hour or so, then just unplugged it (instead of powering down), hoping to generate some sort of error that would be addressed. Later, I plugged it back in and powered it up. Now, here's the
 weird part,&nbsp;it immediately opened windows. There was nothing on the screen to indicate&nbsp;that it performed a POST, and it seemed like it opened windows before the POST would normally complete. At any rate, it's been working just fine all day. Right now I don't
 plan to ever turn it off again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate any comments on my travails.</p>

<p>
</p><p>From the sounds of it. it's likely that you'll need to contact Xbox Support directly. Within the above shared link. Scroll down threw the information until you see the "Support Resources" section. Then choose the "<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact
 Us</a>"&nbsp; option. Once in the Customer support section. For step one choose "Billing". For step two choose "Prepaid codes". Then skip to step four and either choose "Chat with Xbox Support" or "Request a call from Support".&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey clmnsr,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear about this issue of not being able to redeem your code that came with your bundle. Unfortunately this issue will need to be handled by
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Support</a> directly as we don't have the tools on the forums to check your code or provide support with redeemable codes. However, that error seems to be related to a&nbsp;bug possibly&nbsp;and
 I don't think the code is faulty. Try to contact support again so they can assist you with this matter, they are available on weekends as well. Sorry for any inconveniences this may cause.</p>

 I HAVE SET UP NIGHTS TRYING TO GET UP THAT LEADERBOARD, ONLY TO FIND THAT POINTS HAVE BEEN SUBTRACTED INSTEAD OF ADDED, THE GAME HAS CHEATERS IN IT THAT HAVE "CHEAT CODES" AND ARE ALLOWED TO STAY. THE JERKS THAT RUN THE GAME HAVE WHO THEY WANT PICKED OUT TO
 BE IN THE TOP TEN AND GOD FORBID THAT AN OUTSIDER THAT THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT, BEAT OUT THEIR OWN. I AM DISGUSTED WITH YOUR SO CALLED GAME. OTHER GAMES AREN'T LIKE THIS ONE. FACEBOOK NEEDS TO RUN THIS GAME OFF OF THEIR PAGES, IT IS BENEATH THEM TO ALLOW THINGS
 LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN. I WAS SO PROUD OF HOW MUCH BETTER I HAD GOTTEN SHOOTING POOL. NOW IT IS AN EMBARRASSMENT. IF YOU DO NOTHING, SO BE IT. BUT IF I DON'T GET A RESPONSE IN 24 HOURS, I WILL GO TO FACEBOOK, I'VE TAKEN SCREEN SHOTS AND PRINTED HOW YOU TREAT
 NEW PEOPLE THAT IMPOSE ON WHO IS ALLOWED TO PLAY AND WHO ISN'T. I'M ALSO PLANNING ON MAKING A PUBLIC STATEMENT ON FACEBOOK, TELLING THEM ALL ABOUT YOU. 24HOURS, TIME IS TICKING...………….THIS IS WHAT I SAID TO THEM AFTER WEEKS OF BEING RUN OUT OF THE GAME. WEEKS

<p>My reply to you concerning the game called Pool Hall</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your game&nbsp; 1.cheats (cheat codes are used and this messes with the screen, the table, and objects just disappear while you are striking the ball. i.e. the ball.) The pool cue floats across the table, making it impossible to shoot the ball at anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.There obviously are people controlling the scores.&nbsp; My score has been frozen for approx.. two weeks. Since I am up nights that would appear to be impossible.&nbsp; You don't play a game for up to eight hours a night and your score never changes, unless I lose
 and the night in question I was on a winning streak. &nbsp; &nbsp; Example, my score started yesterday at 313193, I won five games in a row and ended up with a score of 313078. now you tell me how that happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; I am disabled. I have serious disabilities and at the time I was in the hospital because of them. I found your game, liked it, and played making the top ten.&nbsp; I had been at the top for at least a couple of weeks when these "problems" began to surface.
 They have only gotten worse. Now, everytime I play one game, I have to open the game all over again, just to continue.&nbsp; I have my neighbor typing this but this is why, I AM TYPING NOW. I HAVE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, IT UNFORTUNATELY REQUIRES ADJUSTMENTS WHEN I
 READ OR TYPE, BECAUSE IT CAUSES OPTIC NEURITIS, WHICH BLINDS THE PATIENT.&nbsp; SO, IF I AM TO SEE ANYTHING, IT HAS TO BE WRITTEN OR TYPED SO I CAN SEE IT.&nbsp; THAT MEANS ALL CAPS. IF THIS OFFENDS YOU THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD PUT ON THE GAME THAT ANYONE WITH THIS DISABILITY
 IS NOT ALLOWED TO PLAY YOUR GAMES.&nbsp; IT WOULD SAVE ME THE TIME IT TOOK TO TYPE THIS, AND YOU, THE ANNOYANCE OF HAVING TO DEAL WITH A WHEELCHAIR BOUND WOMAN WITH SEVERE DISABILITIES, THAT YOU HAVE NO USE FOR.</p>

                    <span>

<div>Hi, i am currently using windows 7 home premium 64bit<br />
<br />
I had a wireless lexmark printer (Z4290) and i removed it because of having issues, however now i seem to have two ghost printers, (Printer and Printer (copy 1)).<br />
<br />
i keep removing them but whenever i refresh the device and printers list they just reappear, they arent like the other devices, they are sort of half transparent so thats why i coined them with the name ghost.<br />
<br />
If anybody can tell me how to get rid of them for good i would be very happy!&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwindows7forums.com%2fimages%2fVB%2fsmilies%2fbiggrin.gif" /><br />

            You may have to reinstall the printers and software.&nbsp; Then uninstall them again. Not sure if this will get rid of your Printer and Printer (copy 1) listings.<br />
<br />
Check with Lexmark and see if they have a Remove All type of utility that will clean out all traces of the printers.<br />
<br />
Good Luck.<br />
