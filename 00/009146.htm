<h2>            IE No Longer Plays Audio Under the Lock Screen</h2>
                    <p>With WP 8 and 8.1 DP, I was able to play audio from IE under the lock screen. For example, I could go to m.thisamericanlife.org and play episodes. My screen would go black after a few minutes (per my display settings), but the audio would continue to play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the update to 8.1 came out--and continuing in the current version (8.10.14157.200)--this no longer work. When the screen goes black, the audio stops. I have to swipe to get the screen to come back on, then pause the player in IE, then click the play
 button again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tested with other mobile websites, and gotten the same results.</p>

            <p>Hello ParrotHeadFL:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issues you are having with IE since the latest update.&nbsp; I did a bit of testing with this and here is what I found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the time of this post the only phone I had access to was a Samsung Ativ S.&nbsp; I tested this with YouTube and did not have the same experience you describe.&nbsp; The only stopping of the audio/video that was apparent to me was related to buffering of the video.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said, I would like to get a few additional details from you related to your experience.&nbsp; Please provide the requested details below.&nbsp; If anyone else is having this experience, please provide the details below as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the make and model of your phone?</li><li>What is the current OS version on your phone?</li><li>What is the current firmware revision on your phone?</li><li>If you have a Nokia, what is the manufacturer name, this can be found by going to settings &gt; extras + info &gt; more. info.?</li><li>How are you connected when you have this experience, WiFi or cellular data?</li><li>Are you using a Bluetooth device when you notice this?&nbsp; If you are, do you have the same experience when using a standard headset?</li><li>What country are you located in?</li><li>What is the regional setting on your phone?</li><li>What is the language setting on your phone?</li><li>What is the speech setting on your phone?</li><li>Please provide at least 2 examples of sites that you have this experience with?</li></ul>
<p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns we can assist you with.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello ParrotHeadFL:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the follow up.&nbsp; I have done some additional testing on the Samsung and also on a Nokia Lumia 1520.&nbsp; I have tried this by pressing the power button to force the lock screen as well as letting the phone time out and auto generate that lock screen.&nbsp;
 Neither phone under either condition led to the result you have described in this forum post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This leads me to believe there is something in your phone settings or with the OS installed on your phone that is leading to this behavior.&nbsp; I have a few settings you can adjust and a trouble shooting step or two to try.&nbsp; Ultimately this could come down
 to needing to wait for the official release with firmware updates or you may want to consider using the Nokia recovery tool to restore the phone with a previous OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I would suggest you do is go to settings &gt; glance &gt; set the "glance screen info."&nbsp;to OFF and "Night mode" to OFF.&nbsp; &nbsp;Next, I would suggest you go to settings &gt; battery saver &gt; turn this OFF or make sure it is set to only when the phone is
 low.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>As for troubleshooting I would suggest we start with a soft reset.&nbsp; You can do this by going to settings &gt; storage sense &gt; phone &gt; temporary files &gt; delete &gt; Internet Explorer settings &gt; delete history.&nbsp; Once this is done, press and hold the down volume
 button + the power button until the phone vibrates and reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns we can assist you with.</p>

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's nothing wrong with ParrotHeadFL's phone. Whether it's a bug or it was deliberate move, IE in Windows Phone 8.1 no longer moves an audio stream to the background. You could stream HTML5 audio from websites like SoundCloud and I guess This American
 Life, leave the browser (or turn off the screen) and the audio would continue playing. IE will now stop the audio from playing if you leave the browser/turn off the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we could find out if this a bug or not, that would be awesome because I have been frustrated by this change/bug in WP8.1 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Test steps: If you have a WP7.5, WP7.8 or WP8 phone, play a song from m.soundcloud.com on that phone, then leave the browser. Now attempt to play a SoundCloud song on WP8.1 and leave the browser. The WP7.5/WP7.8/WP8 phone will continue playing the audio
 stream and the WP8.1 phone will stop playing the stream.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: It seems not all songs on Soundcloud are playable over mobile due to copyright issues so here's a song link to test what I'm talking about:

<p>

            <p>Hello All:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the clarification Entegy.&nbsp; I did notice this behavior when closing IE or leaving IE to use another application.&nbsp; I guess I misunderstood the nature of ParrotHead's post and focused on going to the lock screen, which I still have not seen to
 stop any audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try the American life site on both a Windows Phone 7 and 8.0 I simply could not get the site to work on either phone to test this.&nbsp; I did indeed verify that this feature was not present when using soundcloud though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be sure to bring this up and see if I can get some more details regarding this feature.&nbsp; Just in case the news is "this is a feature", I would suggest you get ahead of the game and post to the user voice forum,

</p><p>I have done the "set defaults" and other corrective suggestions but still get the out of date browser notices. I&nbsp;had a "techie" look at the machine but still have not solved the puzzle</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some websites simply aren't correctly detecting IE11. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, Compatibility Mode is probably causing this problem.</p>
<p>Compatibility View tells websites that you're running an earlier version of Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From IE&gt; Tools (or Alt + t) Compatibility View Settings, verify that the site is not in the list and uncheck 'Use Microsoft compatibility lists"</p>

            <p>Since my first note I have done a reset on the laptop -- backed up all my files first as reset deletes everything to get back to original factory settings. IE worked as I remembered it. Then the machine decided to run all the Windows updates that took me
 thru to 8.1 At that stage the IE problems resurfaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then I have followed the steps 1 and 2 outlined above. I have&nbsp;cleared compatibility settings and&nbsp;reset IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the transition from functioning properly to the "hung up" status of the moment, I did nothing in terms of selecting features. Within IE, I selected a few favorites but took no other actions. So I am left with the impression that the transition from Windows
 8 to windows 8.1that is giving me the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go though the default program settings, it tells me that I have IE 11. Displays and performance do not confirm that.</p>

            <p>If I go to some sites, the page will not display or I get a partial display and a message that pops up telling me I am using an unsupported/ out of date browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, if I try visitacity.com, I get nothing to display. used this site quite extensively planning a vacation last year in July / August -- which was before my problems started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use my online broker's log in page, I get a message telling me that it detects that I am using an unsupported browser -- I should consider upgrading to IE 9, 10 or 11 or use fifefox or Chrome (latest versions). It let's me in but the&nbsp;note is there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go to SI.com, I cannot access the articles associated with the sport categories in the top line of the SI website, something I can do in Firefox for example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a restore, reverted back to factory settings last week. That took me back to the original configuration -- saved all my files first so I have all the data. The system worked fine for a day or two then it ran all the Windows and other updates and when
 it was done I am in Windows 8.1 with a dysfunctional IE version which does not appear to be IE11. If I look at default programs, it tells me that IE11 is installed but the day to day use tells me it is not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use Google finance as an easy example, the tab header would show a stock name and price in the tab row. If I had multiple tabs, I could see multiple share price info at a glance. Now the tab headers simply give me name, no price data, for any company
 that I might be looking at.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps provide a little more context.</p>

            this question takes me out of the range of my knowledge of windows and related elements in the operating system. Will have to do a little research to know how to answer, or where to look.&nbsp; I did the reset which was supposed to take me back to the factory
 installed settings. From there, the system has run various updates but I do not recall any settings where I had to choose what to run. As noted previously, IE was working as I would expect before the windows 8.1 update decided to run itself.

    <title>BIOS Corrupt after Windows 10 Preview Crash&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iansluck  say:</h3>
<h2>            BIOS Corrupt after Windows 10 Preview Crash&#63;</h2>
                    This has been a frustrating problem for the past three hours. After selecting Restart on the Windows 10 Technical Preview, I received a BSOD for a split second before my PC shutting down. After powering my PC back on, it does not stay on for longer than
 5-10 seconds. I cannot access BIOS, or start up my backup BIOS. I have taken out the CMOS battery to reset it, but to no avail. My PC is practically a brick now and needless to say, I'm frustrated. I need this PC to work. Can anyone please help me? Would it
 have been possible for Windows 10 to brick my motherboard? I don't know what else to do at this point.

            <p>This sounds like a PSU problem. 100 percent of the time, those symptoms are PSU. I always stress power and the quality of power for a testing is the most valuable.</p>
<p>It takes 20 seconds for a system with a quality PSU to fully shut down, then 20 seconds again for the power to drain. Mistakes I see many doing is impatience's, something go's wrong, they pull the clock battery out while the power switch is still on. That
 is like putting your finger on the electrode of a spark plug while I pull the cord.

<h2>            Printing document with mixed portrait and landscape pages</h2>
                    When I print a Word 2007 document with mixed portrait and landscape pages, the landscape pages are upside down - ie. if I insert the pages in a loose leaf binder, the footer is on the left.&nbsp; I would like the footer on the right.&nbsp; Can those pages be rotated
 so the product comes out of the printer ready for the binder?

I am having the same issue.&nbsp; The only printer option I have when duplex printing is to "flip pages over"&nbsp; or " flip pages up"&nbsp; If I select "flip over" the the landscape pages are upside down, if I select "flip up" the Potrait sheets are upside down.&nbsp; Also,
 it require having two continous pages of portrait and/or landsacpe pages for this to been seen.&nbsp; Example pages 1 and 2 portrait, pahes 3 and 4 landscape.&nbsp; It is almost asif word flips on the long axis of the page, regardless of the orientation.

In my case, the print preview is correct.&nbsp; I should also note that this happens whith duplex printing. (printing on both sides of the page.

You may need to print the document as two print jobs, one for the portrait oriented Sections and one for the landscape ones, selecting the appropriate&nbsp;"flip" option for each one.&nbsp;

<h2>            Account doesn&#39;t exist but works on facebook</h2>
                    <p>Hi I am asking on behalf of my husband as he cannot access his email account.&nbsp; He can use his account for facebook although now and again it will throw a wobbly and say that the account doesn't exist.&nbsp; He doesn't want to change the address as he has too
 many things linked to it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried myself without success to gain access to his account and the only one I can get on is his facebook which indeed shows the email that it was set up with is correct but when I try to connect to the 'live' address it says it doesn't exist.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can this problem be resolved as he just wants access again.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
It is possible that the recent patch update could be causing the saving issue. To properly isolate this issue, we'd like to verify the following queries:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have tried <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">repairing the Excel application</a></strong> after installing the patch KB4011220?</li><li>Have you tried starting the Excel application in <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a></strong>?<br />
</li></ul>
<p><br />
If the issue persists, you can try to temporarily disable the automatic Office updates to prevent
<strong>KB4011220</strong> from installing. Click<span> the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update Options</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>button, and select<span>
</span></span><strong>Disable Updates<span>. </span></strong>Wait for the next patch before you attempt to update. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Furthermore, if you encounter Excel issues recently, you can refer to the article below to check if you have a similar issue:<br />

</p><p>I have since uninstalled this patch until Microsoft has a better workaround or fix. Although, they do recommend to not uninstall the security patch. Here is the latest from Microsoft:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Symptoms</strong><br />
After you install this update, when you click on a shape that has a digitally signed macro assigned to it, you may receive the following error:
<div>
Cannot run the macro.<br />
The macro may not be available in this workbook or all macros may be disabled.</div>
<strong>Workaround&nbsp;</strong><br />
Currently, the only recommended workaround is to update the workbook so there isn’t a shape that is used to trigger a digitally signed macro.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note&nbsp;</strong>We do not recommend you uninstall or delay the installation of this security update because of this issue. This security update resolves a security feature bypass vulnerability that can expose unsafe workflows when using macros,
 trusted certificates, and shapes.<br />
<br />
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information in this article when the information becomes available.</li></ul>

<h2>            Windows 10 pro technical review</h2>
                    <p>I installed build 9879 a few days ago and have been googling about it, among other things and I read that build 9926 is much better and I figured as 9926 must be newer due to the higher numbers, I installed it over top of 9879.&nbsp; It worked fine no problems
 but then I noticed that the build was listed as Windows 10 Pro Technical Preview, where the other version stated Windows 10 Technical Preview without the pro (at least as far as I remember).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have windows 7 pro, I have windows 7 Home and I am wondering if this is going to create a problem down the road?&nbsp; I don't have any issues with the change, I only was trying to ensure I had the latest bleeding edge version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is, should I stick with this or should I reinstall the other iso and go back to using 9879?</p>

<p>Hi Asier,<br />
<br />
Based on your description, you are encountering the slowness issue in one specific plan in Planner. I would like to share some known limitations in Planner with you.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. 250 assigned tasks per user irrespective of plans.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. 1500 tasks can be created by an user irrespective of plans.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. 250 Active tasks (Not Started, In Progress) per plan.<br />
<br />
As there are 800 tasks in one plan, you may encounter the slow performance in the plan in Planner. I would like to suggest you create a new plan and add new tasks to it to get better user experience.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yoga<br />

</p><p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am facing two problems with my Nokia Lumia 520 (Lumia Denim). I am using a 32GB Micro SD card with it.</p>
<p><br />
1. It switches off itself. I tried to correct it myself by using your troubleshooting tool. It directed me to reset the phone to factory settings. I did it but the problem still prevails.<br />
</p>
<p>2. Now when it is restored to the factory settings, it isn't showing suggestions when I type.<br />
</p>
<p>I don't know which option to select from the topics' list because I couldn't find any of them suiting my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help awaited.</p>

            <p>I don't know what you are supposed to do, but this is a community forum and thus is not likely to get a swift response from MS, if at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this seems to be the way forward - large companies create a community forum and encourage ordinary users to help with problems... so they can focus their efforts (and money) in other, money-making areas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There used to be newsgroups where MVPs would offer advice but they're now populated by script-kiddies quoting from crib-sheets based on keywords in the questions. That'll be probably be the best thing you could expect in here too, unfortunately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To actually speak to anyone regarding a specific problem, users are going to have to dig deeper than forums linked to from MS.

            Well, thanks a lot for your reply. This is like a "revolving" door type of thing. The things that you mentioned are what I call Bad Business Practices.... I am really surprised that such nonsense takes place in a company with a high reputation as far as
 client support is concerned.
<div><br />
<div>The problem continues, but I decided to relax and that is &nbsp;an option as well. Unfortunately for them, I am a Business Teacher and trust me, this is going to be an issue to discuss in and out of class. Imagine the things this situation could set loose.....
 What if, for example, I keep sensitive company information in my account? What if... I kept private pictures there? The results are so broad and destructive that I am truly surprised at your comments....</div>
<div><br />
<div>Fortunately, for me, I only use the account for normal email. Nevertheless, I am going to make sure that all the individuals I come in contact with every day, know how distressful I feel by this incident and how alone we are as users. Thank you very much.

            The error "33 5.4.0 Your message seems to have triggered our junk email filters. Could you edit your message and try again?" means that on the email content that you are sending the system is detecting it as a spam mail, that's why you are unable to send
 emails. Try sending out a single line of text and see if it bounces back. You can also check this article for further troubleshooting:

<h3> frank the cyclist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook contact &#34;Display as&#34; field always shows email for contact. Can&#39;t remove or edit it</h2>
                    When editing a contact in Outlook under the "Contact" tab, there is a field called "Display as". This filed is usually automatically filled in with the contact's "Full Name". However, Outlook INSISTS on appending the contact's email address immediately
 after the name. For example, if the contact's name is "First Last", the "Display as" field shows "First Last (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***). The "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" value is exactly as shown in the "E-Mail" field. Since I only want the "Display as:" field to show
 "First Last" I deleted all the email values in all my contacts in the "Display as:" field and did a Save &amp; Close on each one. After closing and opening Outlook, or...after waiting a few minutes without closing, Outlook seems to think I wasn't serious and appended
 all the contact "Display as:" fields with the value in the "E-mail..." field. NOT GOOD. How does one make this change permanent? Is there possibly a registry hack.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am running the Outlook 2010 client on Windows 7 64 bit. I have tested this issue on XP and Office 2010 as well. Same problem. I am not running skydrive or any other web sharing or contact application. I can duplicate this on a different physical machine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This makes absolutely no sense. Can someone please find out where this can be changed permanently?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!!</div>

Hi Girish:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your response. Here are my answers to your questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I forgot to mention explicitly that this is an Outlook.com account configured in Outlook 2010 (although the issue is present in Outlook 2007 as well-I've done LOTS of testing). There is no POP, etc. It is configured in the Outlook client by first installing
 the Microsoft Outlook Hotmail Connector. Then when you create the account, you choose "other" for the service and select the connector. Then proceed as usual and the account will be added to the&nbsp;Outlook client. If there is a way to create an IMAP or POP account
 with Outlook.com and Outlook, I am&nbsp; not aware of it and Microsoft didn't point out any way to do it. So the Hotmail connector is the way&nbsp;it was configured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By "Not running SkyDrive" I simply mentioned this because in this forum, for whatever reason, Outlook and Skydrive appear in the same choice and I wanted to be clear this is strictly&nbsp;an Outlook issue and there is no SkyDrive application on the system in
 question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have any insights as to why the "Display as" field refuses to allow editing. I have many hours in research on this and nothing has changed. I am willing to hack the registry if that's what it takes but I have no idea where to find any connection to
 this field in the registry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            The first thing to point out is that the referencing table into which data is being entered via the form should have a foreign key column referencing the sub-standards table only, and no column referencing the standards table.&nbsp; The standard is functionally
 determined by the sub-standard, so to have a foreign key column referencing the former would introduce redundancy due to the standard being transitively dependant on the key of the table via the sub-standard column.&nbsp; The table would not be normalized to Third
 Normal Form (3NF) which requires all non-key columns to be determined solely by the whole of the table's primary key.<br />
<br />
You can still do what you wish in the context a normalized design, however.&nbsp; You'll find an example as ComboDemo2K.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
The relevant option in this little demo file your case would be that for a simple 2-level hierarchy.
<br />
<br />
The way to do it is base the form on a query which joins the referencing table into which data is being entered to the sub-standards table and that to the standards table.&nbsp; You then use hybrid controls for the standard and sub-standard columns, as in my demo,
 each being a text box superimposed on a combo box so as to appear to the user as a single comb box control.<br />
<br />
For the standard the text box would be bound to the Standard column from Standards, the combo box unbound.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the sub-standard the text box would be bound to the Sub-standard column from Sub-standards, the combo box bound to the foreign key substandard column
 in the referencing table.<br />
<br />
The RowSource property of the combo box bound to the foreign key substandard column in the referencing table should reference the Standard unbound combo box as a parameter in the same way as that for the cboParish control in my demo references the cboDistrict
 combo box. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The combo box bound to the foreign key substandard column should be requeried in the AfterUpdate event procedure of the Standard unbound combo box.<br />
<br />
Both of the text boxes should have their Locked property set to True (Yes) and their Enabled property to False (No) to make them read only.<br />

<br />
Thank you for the detailed help!<br />
<br />
I am working on implementing your instructions.&nbsp; But a lot went over my head.&nbsp; In an average day I go from building artwork in Adobe, to accounts payable, to doling out work to students, to building an Access database.&nbsp; (By the end of the day my head hurts)<br />
<br />
If I am understanding the concept correctly, I'm building the relationship up from the bottom? In your sample Db you built up from Parish to District to County.&nbsp; Correct?&nbsp; You did not have a query in the navigation pane.&nbsp; I'm assuming it's just a simple query
 connecting the four tables (If I build from bottom up I have to add one more layer).&nbsp; So - my form, with three drop downs will work exactly like your County/District/Parish form.<br />
<br />
Once I confirm the query supposition, I will attempt following the construction instructions.&nbsp; If you could "dumb it down" several levels - I might avoid draining a bottle of aspirin. :)<br />
<br />
Gracias.<br />
<br />

            You can see how the tables are related in my demo in the relationship window.&nbsp; The model is like this:<br />
<br />
Counties---&lt;Districts---&lt;Parishes---&lt;Locations<br />
<br />
where the &lt; character indicates the 'many' side of each one-to-many relationship type.<br />
<br />
As regards the lack of queries, bear in mind that a query need not be a saved querydef object, it can be an SQL statement.&nbsp; In my demo I've followed my usual practice of using SQL statements as the RecordSource properties of the forms.&nbsp; In the case of the continuous
 form for the simple two level hierarchy it's:<br />
<br />
SELECT Locations.*, Parishes.Parish, <br />
Districts.District, Districts.DistrictID <br />
FROM (Districts INNER JOIN Parishes <br />
ON Districts.DistrictID=Parishes.DistrictID) <br />
INNER JOIN Locations <br />
ON Parishes.ParishID=Locations.ParishID; <br />
<br />
whereas In the case of the continuous form with the hybrid controls for all three levels of the hierarchy it's:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
SELECT Locations.*, Parishes.Parish, <br />
Districts.DistrictID, Districts.District, <br />
Counties.CountyID, Counties.County <br />
FROM Counties INNER JOIN ((Districts <br />
INNER JOIN Parishes <br />
ON Districts.DistrictID=Parishes.DistrictID) <br />
INNER JOIN Locations <br />
ON Parishes.ParishID=Locations.ParishID) <br />
ON Counties.CountyID=Districts.CountyID; <br />
<br />
Note that in each case only the non-key Parish column from parishes is returned, not the ParishID key column, as this is a foreign key in Locations, but in the case of the higher levels of District and County both the key DistrictID and CountyID columns are
 returned as well as the non-key District and County columns.&nbsp; It's the non-key text columns to which the text boxes over the combo boxes are bound.&nbsp; Only the parish combo box is bound, however, to the ParishID column from locations, the district and county
 combo boxes are unbound. <br />

<br />
I don't know why that should be, but it is just a series of one-to-many relationship types as I showed in my last post.<br />
<br />
One point I would draw you attention to when modelling this type of linear hierarchy, however, is the need to cater for missing links in the chain.&nbsp; You might have noticed that the districts of Tamworth and Stoke on Trent both have a N/A parish.&nbsp; This is because
 neither of those authorities have a civil parish structure, Tamworth because it is too small (it's the smallest local authority in England in fact), Stoke because it is an urban area in which the local administrative structure is one of wards not civil parishes.&nbsp;
 So that locations in these two authorities can still map to a District and County each has a single parish record of N/A.<br />
<br />
BTW I've just noticed that the code for the frmLocations_Cont_MCB form's Current event procedure appears to be missing from my original, so I assume it is also from the online copy.&nbsp; It should be:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.cboCounty = Me.CountyID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.cboDistrict = Me.DistrictID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.cboDistrict.Requery<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.cboParish.Requery<br />
<br />
I've updated the online version and changed its name to ComboDemo.zip as I've included both .mdb and .accdb versions.<br />

<p>It isn't over your head rockydean, you're just not wanting to understand it as with most consumer users, so disabling CFA may be the only thing you can do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try once more by saying that if you know what a folder is, also known as a directory in the past, you can easily understand what Controlled Folder Access (CFA)&nbsp;does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since a folder is just a container for files, CFA is simply a group of settings that enable or disable the ability for programs to write into the "Protected folders" list which can be viewed using that hyperlink.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When CFA protection is turned On, the folders in the protected list can't be written into by programs by default, so you must add&nbsp;them to an exemption list using the&nbsp;"Allow an app through Controlled folder access" setting if they need to.&nbsp; This is done by
 clicking "Add an allowed app" and then simply browsing to the trusted&nbsp;program's executable that displayed the warning message in the popup notification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I stated earlier, if this is too much for you then all you typically need to do is just turn Off CFA as you already have while installing any new program you trust and then return to turn CFA On again once the installation is completed.&nbsp; Few programs
 are actually causing these warning messages to display while operating, though they do exist and would then either&nbsp;need to be added to the Allow an app through CFA setting I just described above or simply turn CFA completely Off at that point if you can't
 figure this out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you are opening your system up to attacks by ransomware that might otherwise be stopped by CFA if you turn it Off, so&nbsp;simply turning it&nbsp;Off before installing new&nbsp;programs and back On after is worth trying, since most people install new&nbsp;programs quite
 rarely.&nbsp; The other thing that will usually keep these messages from displaying is to uncheck the&nbsp;selection to "add a desktop icon" while installing, since this option is what most often causes these CFA&nbsp;messages to display.</p>

<h2>            E71&#58; How to turn off security lock code&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would anybody happen to know how to turn off the security lock code? I've set my own code and it works pretty much as expected, like prompts for it in addition to the PIN code at the startup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what about if I want to turn it off again? Like it was before. Do I change it to 12345 again and it somehow stops asking for it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked the manual and it only described a way to <strong>change</strong> the code. PIN code prompting can be disabled, but strangely there's no such option for the security code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>My <strong>"Security Menu</strong>" structure is as follows</u> (I'm translating it from Finnish)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prompt for PIN code: <strong>ENABLED</strong></p>
<p>PIN code: <strong>****</strong></p>
<p>PIN2 code: <strong>****</strong></p>
<p>Auto keypad lock delay:<strong> 2 min</strong></p>
<p>Auto lock: <strong>DISABLED</strong></p>
<p>Security lock code: <strong>****</strong></p>
<p>Allow remote lock: <strong>NO</strong></p>
<p>Restricted user group: <strong>DEFAULT</strong></p>
<p>Confirm SIM services:<strong> NO</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's it. So, what I'd like to find is something like "Prompt for security code:
<strong>NO</strong>" in there, but haven't seen such option. Am I looking for it in the wrong place?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: My phone is unlocked and unbranded, so the provider hasn't had the chance to fiddle with the phone.</p>

<p>My good friend's E71 with a Finnish firmware locks itself if you change to Offline Mode. This is partly unrelated to the original question though and I realize that. Sorry :) The part that does relate to this post will follow shortly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It might require you to change the Security Code to something else than the default 12345. If you leave the security code alone and never EVER change it, this problem might not exist</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>But. </strong>There isn't a way to revert back if you DO change (and at the same time enable) the security code and this is quite related to the original question. People have suggested doing the three-button hard reset, but I did it and nothing
 changed. It didn't revert the security code.Plus, let's face it, every hard reset is a pain in the butt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<font><font>A CHALLENGE TO YOU!</font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you dare, change your lock code to something else than the default, restart the phone, realize that it now asks for the PIN and the LOCK CODE, and then go to Offline Mode. Does the phone lock itself? Can you revert back to the point where you hadn't changed
 the lock code?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I received a response from the Finnish Nokia Care and they said:</strong></p>
<p><em>"We haven't had such a problem with the newest firmware. Are you sure you don't have somekind of software installed that requires additional security? Try restoring to factory default. If that doesn't work, please do a hard reset. Remember to back up
 your data first."</em></p>
