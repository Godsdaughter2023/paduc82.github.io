<h2>            Outlook 2016 freezing when replying to emails</h2>
                    <p>Hi-</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently updated outlook as it has asked, and since it has been freezing when replying to emails.</p>
<p>I am using outlook 2016 version on macbook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also gave me a dialogue box with exclamation point : to send this message, buy Office, or else sign in to activate Office if you've already bought it. then there is an activate button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure why this is coming up. My subscription to Office 365 is few months in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for a solution.</p>

    <title>Problem stopping insider builds, unable to reinstall Win 10 build - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem stopping insider builds, unable to reinstall Win 10 build 10240 &#40;i.e. RTM&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I would like to stop insider builds and return to Windows 10 RTM. I am running into the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I select "Stop Insider Builds" in Upgrade- Advanced Options, I get the pop-up telling me that I need to "do a few things to stop receiving insider builds", but I never progress to the screen where I am supposed to verify the opt-out. If I close the
 pop-up, I am simply back to the screen with the button that supposedly lets me stop insider builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I follow the following direction from Microsoft's site -"If you were unable to opt out, use one of the following recovery images:
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=616947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows&nbsp;7</a>, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=616948" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows&nbsp;8.1</a>, and <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=616949" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows&nbsp;10"</a>- using the downloaded Windows 10 image (whether burned to disk, on USB flash drive, or on the hard drive), my attempt to do the install is met by a message that the option of doing an upgrade is not available because "your current version of
 windows might be installed in an unsupported directory." I.e., my only option is to do a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows is installed in the same directory it's always been and Windows has been installing the preview builds w/o a problem (except for the fact that the build after the currently installed 10525 was "breaking" my AVG internet security, forcing me to use
 a backup to revert to 10525).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have way too many programs to do a clean install and need the upgrade option! Help, please.</p>

            <p>Do you have the option to restore the previous operating system in Settings - Update &amp; Security - Recovery?&nbsp; That is your best hope.&nbsp; You could see if you can run setup.exe from the official Windows 10 media to "upgrade" from 10525 to 10240, but it sounds
 like you tried that.&nbsp; Choose to Keep Windows settings.&nbsp; Use no product key at any time during the install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you moved any standard Windows folders, such as C:\Users ?&nbsp; That may be giving you the error about Windows being installed in an unsupported directory.&nbsp; Putting that back to normal might make it work.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response, Don. You are correct that trying to "upgrade" (downgrade?) from 10525 to 10240 using the official media from Microsoft is what I've tried but am unable to do unless I choose a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't moved any of the standard Windows folders. I am perplexed because I never received a message re: "your current version of windows might be installed in an unsupported directory" in the course of progressing through multiple pre-RTM insider builds,
 the upgrade to 10240, and the later post-10240 insider builds. And the location of my Windows folders has not changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would happily stay at the current 10525 and then do an upgrade to whatever post-RTM build is the next public release if I could opt-out of insider builds in the meantime, but I am unable to. Very curious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your thoughts.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Upon checking here, you have two subscriptions. United States unlimited mins mobiles and landlines and Skype Number, 3 month subscription and when you cancel the recurring payment, you only do it for one subscription and that is the Unlimited mins. This
 has been successful and the subscription is now expired on your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note your Skype number and subscription are different, therefore, the way to cancel the recurring payments are different as well. This is why your Skype number is still active and charged you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To cancel the <strong>recurring payment for your subscription</strong>, you must follow the steps on this link:

</p><p>You mentioned that the number successfully renewed on your account, unfortunately, I do not have an option to process any refund here. In this case, I highly suggest to contact our chat support. Please check the private message I sent you.</p>

<p>Karen:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure I am doing this correctly, but I have a problem with my Skype account. I thought I had done what needed to be done in order to not have my Skype number and unlimited calling account auto renew; however, it happened anyway (<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">Order
 number:</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;8067000004751662903).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After much surfing around, I came upon your answer about canceling the number and just did so. I can't tell if the Unlimited US ($2.99/month) subscription
 is still going or not. And I would like to know what I have to do to be refunded for the amount that I was charged for the Skype phone #?</span></p>

</p><p>Just a heads up, Skype number can no longer be refunded. &nbsp;As defined by Skype's refund policy, the nature of a Skype Number means that you can use it to receive calls from the moment it is purchased; therefore, no refunds can be made for Skype Numbers.</p>

    <title>How can I turn off two-page view&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tigbondck  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I turn off two-page view&#63;</h2>
                    I really hate reading in two-page view. I like to read from top to bottom and do not want to skip from the left to the right side of the screen.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Every time I select "one-page" but the program seems to think I want to return to two-page view every time I resize my zoom. One-page is too small to see, so I want to zoom in a bit and it automatically changes me back to two-page...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If there is no solution for this, I hope it will be in future release plans for the product. Thanks!</div>

<p>If your grandson chooses to broadcast his phone number in his account, it is similar to him posting his phone number publicly in a phone book. If he posts the wrong number, then that wrong number will be posted. He can either remove the number from his account
 profile or change it. He controls that public integration with his Skype account record. The same goes for any website, address, or birthday publicly shared in his account. This does not mean your hands are completely tied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Skype 8.x/12.x. You can still create you own phone contact entry for him and call him using that entry. This would be completely separate from his Skype contact record. The best way to do that is to call the new phone number at least once. After your
 call, edit the label of the call from the new phone number to something like "Grandson". The next time you need to phone call your grandson, you can simply search for grandson, click on that contact and click on the receiver to call him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In older versions of Skype and the current Skype for Windows 10 App (12.x), you can also add extra phone numbers to your grandson's Skype account contact entry. This will not delete the primary number attached to his account but it will allow you to append
 additional numbers. This will create a situation in which you will get a list of phones numbers to choose from when attempting to place a call using the phone receiver under his original Skype account. I assume this feature will be restored in later versions
 of Skype 8.x.<br />

            What a lot of nonsense from some people on this website.&nbsp; Either they don't read, or understand, the question and answer the wrong question, or they don't know what they are talking about and shouldn't answer the question at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
In the latest version of Skype 8, (8.32.0.53) there is no way of editing an existing contact apart from the display name, regardless of who created it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have just created a contact and land line number for my wife and cannot edit it.<br />
<br />
As far as I can see,<br />
<br />
1. It is not possible to add a second number to an existing contact<br />
<br />
2. It is not possible to edit a number for a contact you have created<br />
<br />
3. It is not possible to delete a number from a contact<br />
<br />
<br />
In other words, there no way of editing a contact apart from creating a new one and deleting the old one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Despite the claim made by Ruwin.B "This is how it works in ALL Skype versions", absolute nonsense.&nbsp; Classic Skype has always had these capabilities, which is why at least one of my computers still has the classic version.<br />
<br />
<br />
Computer companies in the 60's were notorious for creating programs they thought the customer wanted, without giving them, or investigating, what they actually wanted.&nbsp; In 2018, Microsoft is doing exactly that - ignoring all complaints and just producing what
 they, as non users, think we want.<br />
<br />
<br />
Microsoft appear to be reinventing the wheel, a square wheel, ignoring the fact a round wheel was invented many years ago.<br />

                    <p>I am trying to sort a column with unit numbers in them ( Example: 2-102, 2-307, 2-1010, 2-207, 3-104, 3-1002, 2-405). When I try to sork the list using filters it sorts the first number (building number) correctly but then it puts 2-1010 in front of 2-102&nbsp;and
 3-1002 in front of 3-104 when I need it to go at the end of the list for building 2.&nbsp; Is there a way to get it to sort this correctly?

            You want it sorted numerically, but with the hyphen it has to be treated as character.
<br />
<br />
You have 2 options I can think of. Pad the entries with zeros, ie 02-0102, 02-0001<br />
<br />
Or you could split the entries out into 2 help columns and sort on both columns.<br />

<h2>            Back-Up of Notes on the Nokia E71</h2>
                    Of the two applications Active notes and Notes, I prefer to use the latter. But when I want to transfer files to my PC using the Nokia PC Suite only notes from the former can be found. Is there a way around this?

<h2>            Outlook 2016 for Mac- Missing To Do Bar, Favorites and Unread Mail</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded Office on my Mac.&nbsp; I am now running Outlook version 15.18 (all updates applied).&nbsp; I seem to be missing several features that were available in Outlook 2011 for Mac and are still available on Outlook 2013 for Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The To Do Bar (panel to the right hand side of the screen that lists your calendar entries and tasks) seems to be missing and I cannot find any instructions to add it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Favorites and Unread Mail:&nbsp; In Outlook 2011 and 2013, I have the option for a Favorites section that appears above the Inbox in my list of folders on the left hand side.&nbsp; One of the options under favorites is Unread Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot find a means to add the Favorites option or to recreate the function that was provided by the Unread Mail selection.&nbsp; The Unread Mail selection under Favorites shows all Unread Mail in all of my folders and sub folders in one location.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have these features been discontinued in Outlook 2016?</p>

<p>
</p><p>If I type in F1 is Egg then G1 will be the sum of the range B1:D5's all eggs which will be 50 here.</p>
<p>If type Apple then 2</p>
<p>If type Fruitee then 75.</p>

 for this problem through the Internet and discovered in earlier version like IE10, Microsoft had just forgotten to had that font at that time. I really hope this can be added in a very near futur....</p>

 even worse it just starts deleting my message letter by letter?&nbsp; :smileymad:</p>

<p>When I had an X6 this happened to me a few times. On all occasions my screen was quite dirty/greasy and cleaning it made the issue go away. I did not use a screen protector.<br />
<br />
I have since passed the phone on to my wife and she uses it with a screen protector and the problem hasn't happened once for her.<br />
<br />
So the best option for you is to thoroughly clean your screen and use a good quality screen protector with it. Low quality protectors can make the issue worse or cause other problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had this issue on all firmware versions so updating the firmware or resetting the phone will not help in this case.</p>

<p>Hi Becca</p>
<p>I am trying to sort out the same problem.&nbsp; Having looked at the Europe support discussions, it is very common.&nbsp; Apparently turning thephone on its side will help, although a number of people were saying - take it back - its a fault.&nbsp; I am having trouble
 downloading firmware and software on mine.&nbsp; Such a disappointment after such anticipation.&nbsp; I will definitely send mine back if these problems cannot be solved.&nbsp; Di</p>

            Its a software fault i think. It came to the n5800 users with v50, and it came to x6 users with i think v20.

            Another texting problem. On my phone I can change the font size when viewing text messages but whenever I use the text editor in landscape mode, the text is always large. This is annoying because you can only see about 5 words of your message while you
 are typing.<br />
MY brother has the 5800 and there is an option to make the text smaller in the text editor window. How can I do this with the x6. Currently it is really annoying to type!

<h2>            Inserting .docx Word document into another Word 2003 document</h2>
                    I am using Insert, Object, Create from File to insert a .docx word document into another Word 2003 document. &nbsp;It appears as an embedded object but just showing the filename rather than the document contents.

            Press Alt+F9 to hide the field codes and show the content of the object instead. But note that you'll only see the first page of an inserted document object. You will probably find Insert | File more useful. If you want to link the content, you can click
 the arrow on the Insert button (in the Insert File dialog box) and choose Insert as Link (this actually inserts an INCLUDETEXT field, which does not make use of OLE).

<p>
</p><p>In the new Skype 8.18, there's no option to change the profile info of your contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you can install the 7.41 classic Skype to edit or add a new number on your contact's profile. To download the classic Skype, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to this link: <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a>
</li><li>Click the <strong>v</strong> button and select <strong>Get classic Skype.</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once the classic Skype is installed, sign in to your account and look for the contact in question &gt; right-click and select
<strong>view profile</strong>&nbsp; then edit or add the number.</p>

            <p>Method 1: That window is the ordinary video window you get from using <strong>
Insert&gt;Video&gt;Video on my PC</strong>. Please delete it and try the instructions again. The right-click menu will have a
<strong>Property Sheet</strong> option on it, that's what you're looking for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Are you able to play any video in PowerPoint? I was under the impression that it was this particular video that was causing a problem, but it sounds like you have a more general issue. If you can't play video in PowerPoint, please try an Office
 repair:</p>
<ol>
<li>Close PowerPoint.</li><li>In Windows, search for <strong>Control Panel</strong>, then open it.</li><li>Select <strong>Programs</strong>, then <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.</li><li>Right-click on <em>Microsoft Office 2013</em> and choose <strong>Change</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Online Repair</strong> option (it's more effective), then click on the

</p><p>Onedrive has been accessed and set itself up so its its not that. We have placed a notebook in Onedrive and this opens Onenote as a browser app with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have found that the user had a previous Microsoft account set with the Company credentials prior to our O365 setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could this have caused any issues? We have now cancelled the secondary account but its on 60 days cancellation.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi both,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully today for an update, I have been waiting for the user to come in to the office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did get him to log off all One Notes that he has in the hope that this may fix the error, it didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am aiming to get all screenshots and version numbers today for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Vlookup range between two columns&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jw aldridge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vlookup range between two columns&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've used something like this before, but its been quite a while and i'm thinking vlookup is the answer....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In column A:B, i have a series of 10 digit number codes. named range "listed"</p>
<p>Cant i use vlookup to search to see if that number exist between the two values on each row?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B</p>
<p>29&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 36</p>
<p>39&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 42</p>
<p>45&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 49</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>51&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 58</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<p>if the lookup value is 31, it should return "x"&nbsp;</p>
<p>if the lookup value is 50, it should return "x"&nbsp;</p>
<p>if the lookup value is 59, return ""&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>need to look up a string of numbers so if formula, that's fine or if code that can run checking a column, that'll work too.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanx!</p>

<h2>            Kin 1 review after 1 week use. From a WM6.x Poweruser</h2>
                    <br />
<p>I went and purchased a Kin One, I figured I would get a glimpse of where the mobile market was heading by Microsoft. I have to say that I had a few issues with it. But all in all I do enjoy the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me start with the Cons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This device is very connected to Windows Live, that is great as long has you have data connection. I was having issues with my device, so I did a hard reset, after I did that, I lost all data connection. It was to a point that I spent 1 hour at a Retail
 store. Finally they gave up, and gave me tech support number. After 1 hour on phone with Tech Support. They finally filled out a trouble ticket, and told me to switch phones until they could get that fixed. This really was a HUGE negative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The highlight of this device that I enjoy was the Email. The email was great, however it did have a few negatives. Only 1 exchange account at a time, not the end of the world, but I would like to see more. Hotmail does not sync correct. If I view an email
 on my PC, and then view it on device, it still shows as being unread, even after I do another sync. This would be nice to see the mobile device, communicate with Hotmail servers a little better. The other thing with email, is you do not have true HTML emails
 in the viewer. Not the end of the world, but for a device centered around emails I think it is needed. There is also no spell check for email. This might not be that big of an issue because of the target market, but for anyone wanting to do any typing, it
 is nice to have. Spelling errors do happen. The other biggest issue I found on this device was when typing, it would not auto capitalize the letters at the beginning of a sentence or after a period. So for example. this is how it would be. That does not look
 right at all. That needs to be fixed. Teens might not have good grammar. But this is now helping it get any better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Facebook integration.<span>&nbsp; </span>Facebook is doing very decent on the device like it is now. There are a few things that could be better though.<span>&nbsp;</span> You can only view Wall post, and comments on Facebook. There needs to be a way to view a contacts
 photo albums. Once you are able to view the albums, if there are 2-3 pictures you would like to save to device. This needs to be possible. The amount of time that it takes a new Facebook Contact to be added to device needs to be better. I tried doing a manual
 refresh, and it did not work. I ended up waiting over 11 hours for the contact to finally appear. This does not seem like it is right. Something about that needs to be addressed. The other thing that needs to be done, is a way to override the Facebook photo
 on the device. Just something that will now have the Facebook Contact has the Favorite Image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twitter Integration. This one is a little more issues. First thing you notice right away is that all other social networks allow you to link contacts together. Twitter is clearly missing from this. This is a real shame. You are not able to view your own
 twitter account, outside of the loop. I am not really sure why this is. You are unable to retweet a twitter contact at this time. You cannot reply in twitter. You cannot look @ mentions in twitter. You cannot send location in twitter. Your twitter picture
 is your contact photo? So much twitter is missing, but yet, this is how that is set up? You are unable to view Twitter Contact profile on twitter. I find this to be a disappointment also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feeds, This isn’t too bad. But needs to be working better with the Loop, If I view something in the Loop, why does it not show as read in Feeds? Also if I view a feeds channel that is set also in favorite feeds. Why does it now show being read in favorites?
 You have to view this twice, to mark it read. This is a flaw that should be addressed. There is no way to mark all has read, for both Feeds, and for Favorites. This helps so you don’t have to view them all. Also, why isn’t there a way, to slide to view next,
 instead of having to go back, then select another one, then go back and repeat. This is cumbersome, that could be working better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SMS is a little funky. There is no SMS time half the time. It seems to be very random. You can get SMS time sometimes, but then you reply, and you have no SMS time. If I am doing SMS, I want to know what time I am sending and receiving everything. This is
 not possible on the current setup, I am not sure if it's not set up right. Or if it's just buggy. But whatever the reason, it needs to be looked at. The other issue is there is no SMS character limit. This is a real pain, when you are sending a 165 character
 SMS, and it ends up sending 2 SMS. This is a real hassle, and the Character limit is very nice to be able to see on the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Search. This really is nice, when it works right. I found that I had some big issues with m.bing.com. Bing by itself, is not the best search engine. Some enjoy it, I am not one of them. It felt like it was missing a lot of places when searching. This was
 not good. When I would get something to search, and I would try and view the next page. I would end up reloading the same page, over and over again, even after I was going to page 2, page 3, page 4. It was all the page 1 results. This was a complete failure
 for Bing Search, that really showed to me it is unreliable and I am not sure if I will use it much in future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Browser is decent. But not the best. It really was more of a hassle to use then what I was looking for. The multi-touch zoom was more of a hassle to use than anything else. Mainly because of the screen size. It did not allow for enough space to pinch and
 zoom. I found the easier thing to do was to use 2 hands, and spread them apart that way. If they could do something like an option that was inside PIE6.5 it would be a lot easier to use, and more functional.<span>&nbsp;</span> The other issue is that the browser
 needs to be able to reflow better once you do zoom in. This will allow you to see more of the screen without having to scroll left to right. The other issue I saw was the focus on the browser after you zoom in,<span>&nbsp;</span> took quite a bit longer then I
 wanted to wait. If I have this fast 3G network, why can it not focus in faster?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no Copy and Paste. It is not really utilized, but it is still nice to have when you to copy something real fast. There is no calendar, this was really missed in the time I was using it. I really missed the Google Exchange also. I already have everything
 set up on Google Exchange, so I did miss this. It really would be nice to be able to select what default contact to use. If I wanted to use Exchange contacts, then I would think they would take presence over the other contacts. However this is not the case.
 There was no real way to Align the screen. So if the touch was off, you have to get use to where it is off at, and adjust that way. Real same I thought. The Alarm sounds need to be more aggressive. I want an alarm that is going to wake me up, not one that
 will put me at peace and make me sleep longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a large security issue that I found. When typing in a password, the last character you type in still shows until you type in the next one. So if my password is "apple123" it will "a" and then "*p" and so on, if I am on public transportation, and
 I have someone looking over my shoulder. I would not feel comfortable<span>&nbsp;</span> doing much that I had to sign into. This is a big issue that needs to be fixed soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advantages</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now we get to what is good about the Kin devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Studio really is nice to have. It really made everything easy to use, and I was so happy to see it working like it was. Made setting everything up easy. I was not able to test setting everything back up after a reset, because I lost all data connection.
 But having everything uploaded really is a nice treat. And something that every device should be doing. Sure there is My Phone by Microsoft. But it really isn’t working on the same level. It would be nice if it could go in a little more in depth, and backup
 your settings also. That way when you reset device or do a software reset, or reinstall. You can have everything set up, down the same settings very easy. Otherwise I am going to have to go and reset up these. This is more or less a wish list feature though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The size of the Kin One is perfect. I like a device that I can fit in my pocket and not have to worry about this, this is one reason why I have shy away from Touch Pro 2, because I did not want the extra room that was needed for the keyboard. The Kin is
 a nice step though. It isn’t too big, but it isn’t too small.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Keyboard was an issue initially, because of its size, but you quickly learn about it, and soon after it is a pleasure to type on. It made me think of the Motorola Q keyboard. That keyboard was still the best keyboard I have ever used on a device. Something
 I still miss and wish they would make the same quality keyboard, on a touch screen device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The loop really is nice. All of the updates are right there on the main screen. This is really a nice feature, that I have found to miss since going back to my HTC Imagio 12 hours ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other nice feature is being able to link your contacts for 4 different places into the same contact. This was a real nice feature. However there is one, I have a contact for myself. I have email address and other things, in case I need to send vcard
 to others. It's nice to have a contact for yourself. However you cannot link your own contact. I am not sure why this is. But It just will not let you. I was really disappointed by this. I thought it would be something that I should be able to do quite easy.
 But ended up I had 2 contacts for myself. Not something that I wanted to have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall the software is very fast, and straight forth. Very easy to understand. I did have a few crashes though, I was trying to reorganize the Apps, and it shut off on me. It tried to start back up, and got stalled on startup, I ended up having to take
 the battery out for 30 seconds. After that it loaded up fine. That was about the only big crash I had.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is it missing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did really<span>&nbsp; </span>miss a GPS application. However if there was a dedicated Bing Seach application that was built in, that functioned better. I am sure I could live without it. This was one of the bigger things that I found was missing. The<span>&nbsp;</span>
 IM would be nice to have, but not really needed. The one way it would be nice is if MSN did not log me out of my Home PC connection when I log into a mobile client, If it could keep both open, this would make it so much better. The other thing with IM, is
 it is needed to upload the logs to Studio. This is just how is has to work. To be able to access IM chats from Gmail, is one of the best features I find part of Google Talk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Kin is missing some features, but overall it really isn’t a device. Being a diehard WM6.X fan. I found the device is quite livable and actually missed after 1 week of use. There are a few features that could be better. But overall the device isn’t too
 bad. Others will not like it because it brings a change of how everything works. But when everything is all said and done. If the following update features that I have listed can be fixed. Then I think this would be a great device for about anyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The email I was really surprised with, email on the Kin works better than it does WM6.5.<span>&nbsp;</span> The way Hotmail will push the email is a nice treat. However Hotmail not syncing with desktop is a letdown.<span>&nbsp;</span> It would also be nice to see
 updates pushed OTA to the device very soon. It has been 1.5 months, with some pressing issues that needed to be fixed. So curious about when those will take place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am missing having the Kin after being without it for 12 hours. Even with the shortcoming it has presented already. So I will be going back to the Kin has soon as I can.</p>

            Sounds fair enough. Most of what I had experienced was software related. But overall the experience was very good. I am looking forward to getting device and active again tomorrow.

            Turns out the reason why you couldnt reconnect was due to Verizon/Alltel network side, not KIN device or service.

your computers monitors screens refresh rate is too low, outdated\corrupt graphics card driver, add on installed on the computer, malware attack etc. Since the issue is occurring only with Internet explorer and you have already tried to adjust the refresh rate

            Nothing I have tried has stopped IE11 from **** out and showing a blank white screen or flickering constantly.&nbsp; I am just going to use Mozilla instead.&nbsp; If the problem was hardware related, it would affect Mozilla as well (which it doesn't.)

            <p>I have had the same problem for months on Win 8.1 IE11, I am pretty sure I had this problem on Win 8 and was hoping 8.1 would solve it.&nbsp; I think I am going to install chrome, the one common thread in all the complaints like this is that other browsers work,
 only IE exhibits this behavior.&nbsp; I was giving MS time to respond to the complaints and I think enough time has passed since these problems have been reported.&nbsp;I have searched and searched and have not found any answers, just exchanges like the above with no
 definite "yes that is the specific problem and here is the fix!" results.&nbsp; I mean an&nbsp;occasional person might get some result (and who knows if it lasted more than that hour) when they clear their cookies, but I am not going to keep clearing cookies and losing
 the settings&nbsp;over and over that is not acceptable, the browser should not lose function because of cookies, one site ok that is the site's fault but this problem clearly is cross tab and multi site, once it kicks in any site will come up blank.&nbsp; If it affects
 all tabs and any site, and all kinds of different hardware and drivers,&nbsp;and all the other browsers still work&nbsp;it&nbsp;sounds like an&nbsp;MS IE problem that just hasn't been taken seriously enough to find the problem and fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am using an msi laptop and most of the time I am on a vizio tv via hdmi.&nbsp;&nbsp; The common symptoms for me is usually a period of proper behavior but after some period of time I double touch the touch pad to scroll the web page down and it starts flickering
 on and off, sometimes stays flickering for a little while then goes blank, sometimes quickly flickers and goes blank from below the toolbar down.&nbsp; Sometimes other tabs still have normal content display, sometimes all the tabs end up going blank.&nbsp; Once the
 problem occurs, sometimes a new tab will work, sometimes even new tabs come up blank.&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually closing the browser and reopening fixes it (but pain in the rear to lose all the places I had in the tabs, especially if I was in a video and have to try to find
 the same spot, and especially when some videos make you watch all the commercials again to get to the same spot!)&nbsp; I doubt it is a display driver issue because the url bar, the tab titles the menu bar and the favorites bar function and display perfectly, only
 the area where the tab's page content is blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any of this info helps you and you eventually find a fix I will have the notification on to receive your reply.&nbsp; I would really rather be using IE and not have to have another browser installed.</p>

            <p>Everything you have described is exactly what is happening to me.&nbsp; Ironically, I also am hooked up to a Vizio TV via HDMI.&nbsp; I have since switched to using Firefox as my default browser and have had zero issues.&nbsp; Microsoft likes to pawn problems off on your
 drivers, settings, hardware, etc. instead of taking responsibility for a flaw in IE and fixing it.</p>
