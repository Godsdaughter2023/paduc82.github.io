<h2>            Windows 7&#58; Keyboard hangs up and &#39;sticks&#39; at random intervals</h2>
                    I'm currently at a loss to figure this irritating little problem out. <br />
<br />
<u><b>Problem</b></u><br />
<br />
Every now and again my computer will hiccup or hang up for a half second or so, and then I will lose all contact with my keyboard for roughly two to five full seconds. Sometimes the lights remain steady on both keyboards and sometimes they seem to go out and
 I can clearly hear the sound of the devices disconnecting without a reconnect sound. (I do not check every time as usually I'm playing a video game and admittedly attempting to minimize impending failure.) However, before long the keyboards will once again
 resume functioning, though with with the keys pressed at the time of the failure being 'stuck' pressing the key in question resumes it's normal function and is no longer 'stuck.'<br />
<br />
Given that it seems to happen more often in video games and other memory and graphic intensive tasks, it will happen when the PC in question is "idle." I'm pretty sure that it isn't a specific active program that is causing a conflict of some sort and if it
 is, it may be one of the passive ones. (I use the term loosely because of the various tasks that usually run in the background, but for the most part it isn't actively downloading or performing tasks that require my input.)
<br />
<br />
<u><b>Details<br />
<br />
<i><br />
</i></b></u>I'm currently using<br />
<br />
Processor: AMD Phenom(tm) II X4 965 Processor 3.40 GHz<br />
Installed Memory (RAM): 16.0 GB<br />
Video Card: GeForce GTX 260<br />
Motherboard: BIOSTAR Group TA870U3+ (I think...)<br />
Network Adapter: Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller<br />
System Type: 64-bit Operating System (Windows 7)<br />
<br />
Mouse: OCZ Equalizer Model (OCZMSEQRD)<br />
Keyboard 1: Generic (MI "Micro Innovation" KB565BL)<br />
Keyboard 2: Wolf King Model (DK2388U)<br />
<br />
I also have a Cintiq DTZ-1200W which is connected, but is not powered and was not powered when the problem occurred or after.
<br />
<br />
The problem in question began roughly two days ago after roughly an hour of play in Natural Selection 2 (Purchased from Steam) and at first I thought that it was home to that game, though since them of course it can and has occurred several times even while
 I'm typing this. I am currently typing this on a secondary computer rather than the affected one though I can still hear it disconnect the devices randomly in the background.
<br />
<br />
I have used the trouble shooter for the devices in question, and I have also checked the event log. Apart from a few unrelated errors (Hl2 engine failures, Nvidia updater problems due to an "expired password") there seems to be no reference to the devices being
 repeatedly disconnected. <br />
<br />
Aside from that is the frequency that this issue occurs, it seems to be entirely random. It will occur once roughly half hour, or sometimes several times in the span of a minute.<br />
<br />
<u><b>Summary<br />
<br />
</b></u>Also I have not installed anything beyond Natural Selection 2 at the time the issue came into being. I'm currently unsure of updates, most things are set to ask me before installing updates (Excluding Windows 7) however, I'm no expert and there could
 be a number of things that may have done so in the background since then. <br />
<u><b><br />
</b></u>I'm a little at wit's end, it seems to affect both keyboards, and regardless of input from them the problem persists. It makes playing any sort of even mildly fast paced game a hassle as losing a few seconds in a reaction and having keys becoming stuck
 for a moment will impair performance making most things frustrating at best. (Like attempting a race and finding your turning no longer works, and you end up plowing into the side railing, then you hear the distinctive USB disconnection sound. All the while
 being unable to pause the game to wait the issue out.) <br />
<br />
So, if there is a simple fix that I'm missing, I'd very much like to know how to fix it. I hope I was informative enough, I don't have much in the way with experience in all of this.

            I have found something upsetting, but promising so far. I have tried unplugging my full sized keyboard and the issue seemed to persist, however, I removed the "Wolf King" keyboard (It's a funky circular one) and the issue has completely vanished. Likely
 meaning that the keyboard (That I have likely had for several years.) was going out in someway and causing conflicts of some sort.
<br />
<br />
I have let it idle as well as played games for good durations and have not had the issue at all. (Only an unprecedented long load time for a game, after reloading that particular hiccup seems to have resolved as well.)
<br />
<br />
I'll keep tabs on this and I will see about reinstalling the drivers just in case the issue has merely gone dormant in one fashion or another.
<br />
<br />
Though, it makes sense that it was a fault in the keyboard as there was no error on the software side logged in my computer, (Well... to me, who isn't the most versed in PC interaction by a long shot.)<br />
<br />
That all aside, thank you for your suggestions, I'll experiment a bit and hopefully the problems has been resolved.

<h2>            Why is my Minecraft screen darkening and not allowing pointer movement&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My kids are playing minecraft and the pointer is not showing on the lower screen.</p>
<p>The screen is not allowing sideways looking.</p>
<p>It goes dark on the profile when "play game" is selected.</p>
<p>The inventory on lower screen does not allow pointer movement.</p>
<p>We cannot use weapons on lower screen.</p>
<p>We tried to see if there was an update but don't know where to find it on the screen.</p>

<p>HELLLLLLLLP!</p>

    <title>Communication Suspension - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sddynasty07  say:</h3>
<h2>            Communication Suspension</h2>
                    
<p>I recently signed into my Xbox Live account to play a few games and when signed in I learned that my communications had been suspended for a day. I don't understand how Xbox Live can suspend my communications for nothing. &nbsp;I hardly ever use my mic and when
 I do it's while I'm in a party with people I know. I get reported all the time falsely for trash talking when I hardly e leave the party to do it.</p>

<p>I got the same thing bro, I am always in party chat and never sent out messages but yet I get banned with no proof?? Xbox should get their laggy system fixed instead of banning people from hearsay.. Seriously thinking about switching to ps4 as most of my
 friends are also sick of this stuff.. By the way why not crackdown on the 12 year olds playing cod? &nbsp;I thought this was a 18+ game?? &nbsp;Xbox is becoming a joke.</p>

<p>You do not get suspended for no reason or from "hearsay".</p>
<p>You can see why you were suspended by logging in here <a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
enforcement.xbox.com/Home</a> &nbsp;or by reading the email sent to the address linked to your account.</p>
<p>You can ask for a case review via the enforcement site as well if the suspension is more than 24 hours &amp; it also explains some enforcement myths.</p>

<p>Yes I did 'read' the vague email sent to me.. And yes it is 'Hearsay' as I have seen no proof of what I have been accused of.. I guess xbox can just do whatever they want because I can guarantee there is zero proof. I am an adult not a child.

<p>There is proof.The enforcement team are under no obligation to share any evidence with you though which is something you agreed to when you started your account.</p>

<p>I just think it's funny the Xbox live enforcement team can't tell me what I *** did wrong instead they have to say that they have proof even though I haven't sent messages out to anybody and hardly leave party chat and yet I still get *** banned for no reason.
 &nbsp;Meanwhile there's 12 and 13-year-olds running around in a call of duty lobby saying cuss words and not getting suspended. &nbsp;It's funny how the innocent people on Xbox live get suspended while the hackers and little kids are running around saying cursewords
 and don't get in trouble at all. </p>

 have a policy of only allowing adults to purchase mature game. </p>

    <title>help with activation after reinstalling win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> annagazo  say:</h3>
<h2>            help with activation after reinstalling win 10</h2>
                    <p>I bought my laptop with a 64bit Windows 10 pro os already installed on it about a year ago from an indoor swap meet. I haven't had any issues until I recently turned it on and it went to the "diagnosing" . . . "repairing" page and it couldn't repair it.
 So I reinstalled it keeping my files. The only way I could get my old product key was from windows.old. The product key wouldn't work. After calling the Microsoft number I was that my product key is a "one-time activation" key and I need to go to the place
 where I purchased my laptop to resolve my issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Well the little shop where I bought it is no longer there. Also, I don't understand why I can't use the same product key. There must be a way for me to activate Windows without having to buy another product key when this operating system was already installed
 and valid on this laptop and there haven't been any hardware changes. What can I do?</p>

<p>Well, you got some bad information. Because if the computer had Windows 10 Pro already installed and activated, then you wouldn't need a new key. You probably just need to give it some time to activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be
 stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.&nbsp;</span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through
 the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>you
 already own&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, give it a few days and it might reactivate automatically.</p>

<p>Hi Anna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be helpful for us to be able to help you better if you could give us some more precise background information pertaining to the history of the statement "with a
<span>64bit Windows 10 pro OS already installed on it about a year ago from an indoor swap meet. I haven't had any issues until I recently"..."</span><span>it couldn't repair it</span><span>". As to what issues exactly (please be specific in your description(s),
 what were the "issues" (exactly) that brought you to this attempt towards resolution through the reinstallation of the OS in the first place, and, what exactly were the end results thereof, to the best of your knowledge, and/or, recollection)?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Were there any error codes involved with the results of the attempted repair procedures? If so, can you relate, or reproduce, the results of for the purpose of this Q thread?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>That being queried/said, Andre Da Costa's reply (above) to you is relevant as posted, if the resolution to becomes yet unresolved let us know (either way) with as much information concerning from your end as possible, we can then continue on from there,
 if/as need be.</span></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One little problem, the list of recipients are pulled from a column in a spreadsheet - Windows Live Mail wont send to the address if it doesnt already have a contact with that address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone know how to get around this?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 - I create my Excel 2010 spreadsheet of email addresses.&nbsp; </p>
<p>2 - I create my Word 2010 document that will become the attachment.&nbsp; </p>
<p>3 - I run the mail merge wizard selecting the Excel file as the recipients list.</p>
<p>4 - I finish and merge to email.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The email merge sends correctly to any&nbsp;recipient already saved in WLM contacts but does not send to those not already saved in WLM contacts.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that this is not the normal behavior when sending emails on&nbsp;Windows Live Mail. You would still be able to send messages to contacts that is not on your contact list. If I may ask, how did you actually added the email address/es on the
 To field when you compose the email message? Did you encounter any error message? If yes, kindly provide us the exact error message that you are getting so that we can determine the root cause of your issue.

<p>
</p><p>I understand that you want to make your Skype application work on your S4, but what kind of error message are you getting, when you tried to launch the application?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me also set your expectation. Currently, we are encountering some issues when it comes to signing in to Skype and sending instant messages. But do not worry and our developers are now fixing this issue.

<h2>            Can&#39;t delete a duplicate account that has appeared on my log in screen</h2>
                    <p>Usually my computer will start up and log straight into my account.</p>
<p>Earlier today a second account has appeared with the exact same name as my main account, although I don't think it has an email attached to it. (my main account is a Microsoft account, not a Local account)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer always tries to log into this duplicate account first, giving me an error message saying my password is wrong. I've tried every password I can think of for this 2nd account but I can't log into it. My normal account works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, I can't delete this account. It doesn't show up when I look in the User Accounts section in Windows. Everything points to my only having the 1 account, yet this 2nd one is there on the login screen. I've tried Googling and following other
 peoples advice, going through the netplwiz screen, but nothing has worked. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How the **** do I remove this account?</p>

<p>Hi, after an update to Windows 10 last week my pc won't start and tells me that the kernel is missing or contains errors:</p>
<p>windows/system32/Ntoskrnl.exe and error code 0xc0000098.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to repair using the process described in another post by creating and using a repair tool, but it hasn't worked. I saved the repair tool on an external drive connected to my pc via usb. Would that have anything to do with it? If not , can you
 suggest something i should try please?</p>

<p>Hi Kristi,<br />
<br />
Corrupted system files is one of the possible reasons why you are unable to boot on your Windows 10 computer. We recommend that you create a Windows 10 installation media on a USB device using a different computer, and use it to perform an automatic repair.
 You can use this <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to download the latest ISO of Windows 10. <br />
<br />
Listed below are the steps to perform an automatic repair in Windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Insert the<strong> installation media (USB )</strong>and boot Windows 10 from it.</li><li>In the <strong>Windows </strong><strong>setup</strong> page select the language to
<strong>install</strong>, <strong>Time</strong> <strong>and </strong><strong>currency
</strong><strong>format </strong>and the <strong>keyboard </strong>or <strong>input
</strong><strong>method </strong>and click on <strong>next</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Repair </strong><strong>your </strong><strong>computer</strong> and select
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Advanced </strong><strong>options</strong> and select <strong>
Automatic </strong><strong>Repair</strong> and select the operating system.</li></ol>

 exactly it is that needs to be reinstalled, I'm guessing that it's the OS that needs to reinstalled but I don't know for sure. When I go to the Device Manager, I can see under VSO devices that it has an exclamation mark next to Patin Couffin engine for 64
 bits system (AMD) but I don't know what that means.</p>

&nbsp; It worked! Thanks for the help and as far as the update for SQL Server 2005, I have a laptop and I don't need but I think I get because I installed Office 2007 Business on my computer. I think that the reason it trys to install but I will try to manually
 download it and see if that works. Thanks!

<p>Hi PSAV,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for Posting to Microsoft Answers.</p>
<p>Your Update issue appears to be with Update KB948109, which is a SQL 2005 Service Pack update.&nbsp; Please check your installed Updates and see if this Update is already on your system.&nbsp; If it is please uninstall it.&nbsp; If you need this update, please manually
 down/install it from the link provided:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=4c9851cc-2c4c-4190-872c-84993a7623b7&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=4c9851cc-2c4c-4190-872c-84993a7623b7&amp;displaylang=en</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your second issue, what is the make/model of your computer?&nbsp; Is the Capabilities manager a program that came with your computer?&nbsp; Is it part of the manufacture loaded software?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lets perform a Selective Startup (Clean Boot) and see if we continue to get that error message.&nbsp; If we do not, then a Service or Startup Program is causing the issue.&nbsp; If it’s the Capabilities manager itself, you may need to reinstall it from the CDs provided
 by your computer manufacture.&nbsp; Below are the steps to perform a Selective Startup.</p>
<p>How-to run Windows in Selective Startup (Clean Boot)…<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, click Control Panel, click System and Maintenance, click Administrative Tools, and then double-click System Configuration.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Continue, or provide Administrator credentials if prompted.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the General tab, and click Selective startup.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Selective startup uncheck Load startup items.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Services tab, check the Hide all Microsoft services box, and then click Disable all.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Apply, then OK, and then Restart.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please Post back and let us know if this has helped to resolve the issue – thank you<br />

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884</span></a>.&nbsp; Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on
 the safe side.<br />
<br />
Good luck and I hope this step isn't necessary.

<p><span>Hi JP Woody,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Vista answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to ask you few questions in order to get a better understanding of this issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were you able to perform complete PC back up before?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent changes on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the error message or error code you get when you try to perform backup?</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you perform a System File Checker [SFC] scan on the computer, the scan replaces the corrupted system files with the original
 version of Windows Files on the computer, follow the steps below to perform scan:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to empty the temp folder and later follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click Start&gt;&gt;type %temp% in the search box&gt;&gt;press enter&gt;&gt;delete everything present in the temp folder.</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click Start, and then type cmd in the Start Search box. </span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator.
</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue
</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER: sfc /scannow</span></p>
<p><span>When the scan is complete, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved.</span></p>

    <title>How to prevent ODBC Driver login window to popup on wrong connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jqiu97  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to prevent ODBC Driver login window to popup on wrong connection string</h2>
                    Our C++ server program uses DSN-Less connection string to connect to SQLServer, Access, Oracle, DB2, Sybase through odbc drivers. The DSN-Less connection string is provided by client applications. If a user enters an invalid connection string, for example,
 missing database server attribute or wrong password, the odbc driver pops up a login dialog box on the server. That causes our server program hangs.
<br />
<br />
Is there any way to suppress the login dialog box popped up by the odbc driver?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot,<br />
<br />

    <title>Win10 clients will not connect to mapped network drives on Server2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> callumrowe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 clients will not connect to mapped network drives on Server2007 at startup</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, hope you can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a small office with 11 clients and 1 server, server is running 2007 SP2 and clients were all win7. I have upgraded 3 of the clients to win10 but are having issues with our mapped network drives on the server
<strong>not</strong> connecting automatically at startup. We have 4 mapped network drives on the server which all clients can access. These mapped network drives are setup in desktop shortcuts, program shortcuts, database paths etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The win10 clients will sometimes connect to these server mapped drives at startup and sometimes not so it is quite frustrating. I have removed drives, re-mapped them and it is still inconsistent. The clients are turned off every night so have a cold boot
 in the morning and this is when the issue occurs most, a client reboot will always re-connect to the mapped network drives so I am guessing the connection is stored or caches on the server for a unknown time period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No error messages come up on the win10 clients about "could not connect to mapped network drive", they just don't connect. The only way to make them connect is to open explorer and click on the 4 drives that have the red X next to them, they connect straight
 away but this manual connection is an issue. Could anyone shed some light on why this is a win10 issue only, none of the other win7 clients have the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to try and pinpoint why the win10 clients connect sometimes and not others, more often than not (90/10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help, guidance appreciated....</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            Stop my son from adding friends and sending messages.</h2>
                    
<p>Hey everyone.</p>

<p>My son has had a xbox for a while and hes been quite content with just playing it offline, untill he stopped at his grandparents where my nephew lives. Anyways after much pestering iv put him on xbox live but because my son is only young he doesnt unterstand
 how annoying it is to be sent lots of messages also iv noticed he has a "NEW" friend on his friends list. He is only 7 and he thinks everyone that hes played with before is&nbsp; his friend and in return should recieve a friends request and a message saying Hello.</p>
<p>But for love nor money can i figure out how to block him from sending or recieving friends requests or even if there is an option to block him from sending out messages. Iv spent the last two days trying to figure this out but everything i read tells me
 to adjust the settings in the family setting and change the option for the child account. I have no idea that this is refering too because i cant see some of the settings they mention.</p>
<p>For parents, determine if approval is required to accept or send friend requests. I cant see this option anywhere..</p>
<p>Any help would be awesome.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Look Jayant I don't need my question re-phrased thanks. &nbsp;I get a message "To continue type administer password..." etc. &nbsp;Although I type a password to access my account there is no place in this box to type a password so I am prevented from controlling my
 own computer. &nbsp;Just deal with the administrator issue. &nbsp;If I need to reload Win 8 I will but why? &nbsp;I am also prevented from creating a new account by that same message. &nbsp;Dónal</p>
