<h2>            Windows 8.1 Switch between apps problem</h2>
                    When my computer wanted to upgrade to Windows 8.1 yesterday, I let it. Now I have a problem. I have a desktop PC. I do not have a touchscreen. When I bring up the Control Panel, the image below appears on the left edge of my monitor, halfway down. It is
 on top of everything: desktop, software, etc., and it is in the way and cannot be removed. The only way to get rid of it is to Turn Off or Restart my computer. Since I don't have a touchscreen, it is completely inappropriate. How can I get rid of this permanently?<br />

            Thank you, this finally did it for me. I had just recently installed a graphics tablet and under human interface devices I found three entries for "HID compliant human control" and disabled them. So far, so good. It sickens me that Microsoft can't acknowledge
 a bug when stares them in the face. Like others have written, that tip should have had a checkoff for "don't show this darn thing again."<br />

<p>I was complaining of this in my office when a very young fellow canme over to&nbsp; my PC and completely embarrassed me.&nbsp; I am a Microsoft Certified System Administrator and I could not for the life of me 'swipe' that arrow to 'just follow it'.&nbsp; Nothing I did
 seemed to help, then this young fellow simply waved the mouse over the top of that arrow and 'poof' it was gone never to return.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It really isn't obvious, it's very annoying and poorly thought out, especially the strange way you have to move the mouse over it without even clicking it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just my 2 cents</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unbelievable! Just as stated above, I just shook the mouse over the top of the left arrow and then whenever the right arrow would show up I'd wave the mouse over the top and VOILÀ... fixed. But it's true that it only showed up recently when I re-installed
 my Wacom tablet + driver. Really glad I didn't have to remove any of my needed tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best 2 cents I ever spent!</p>

    <title>Xbox Controller Dashboard Button Broken, PLEASE RESPOND&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tbcmlwacki  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Controller Dashboard Button Broken, PLEASE RESPOND&#33;</h2>
                    
<p><b>Sorry if i post this in the wrong section, but i have no clue where the xbox controller support is, FORGIVE ME!</b></p>
<p>While playing Xbox, I noticed my Xbox Button to get to the dashboard is pushed in ... i can't seem to figure out on how to get it out, i tried Bing, but can't find any articles on what to do. so when push comes to shove i post on the Xbox official website
 forums. So if anyone could help me out here i would be highly appreciate of your concern for my controller :) ... also it still works fully, but the downside is that sometimes it will go the the "Turn off Xbox, Controller, etc" screen, so i have to jiggle
 the controller to make it stop. i have to take out the battery pack or else it will turn on the xbox at random times of the night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, if you can help me i would really appreciate it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>p.s. i don't think i have a warranty on it, also i don't want to spend money on another controller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>new controller is the better way. if controller's broken any attempts to fix it can destroy it completely. repair can be a half of original controller's price and no warranty of a properly work.</p>

I guess you can buy a pre owned controller from a game store or buy a new one. </em>

<h2>            Is there a Windows 10 Spell Checker&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 Home, ver 1803.&nbsp; I followed the instructions that I found at several sites on the internet to turn on Spell Checker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Typing&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turned on "Highlight Misspelled Words," and Spell Checker still doesn't work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there another setting that needs to be turned on or is there really no Spell Checker for Windows 10?</p>

            Hi Denise,
<br />
<br />Those are the settings for turning on spell-checking in Windows . . .
<br />
<br />It then depends on the application you are using whether that application then implements spellchecking
<br />
<br />What application are you not able to spell-check in?

<h2>            Intel HD Graphics and Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>Last week I updated my HP laptop to Windows 10 Home edition.</p>
<p>Since the update, the fan are always at top speed. Making a research I found I need to update my GPU card drivers.</p>
<p>The problem is that this graphic card is not supported by Windows 10 ( http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-034343.htm#core )</p>
<p>This means it will never be supported? Should I go back to Windows 7? The fan noise really upsets me.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro 64 bit anniversary update failure. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twotenths  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro 64 bit anniversary update failure.</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to update ever since the anniversary edition came out. My computer runs the entire update with no errors or issues. When the update has completed the computer reboots. Still no error messages. It gets to the windows 10 load screen and
 passes that as well but before the login splash screen can come up a command prompt window appears for just a fraction of a second. It does not look like a normal command prompt window. It has a white boarder around it which is completely different from the
 standard box. &nbsp;The boarder appears to be white around 1/2" wide all around the black window. No text shows up in the box because it is there for just half a second or so.The box takes up 2/3 of the screen starting from the top of the screen and is full width.
 It is only there for a very short time then the computer reboots and reverts back to version 1511. I have been all over the internet looking for a solution. It seems to be a common problem because the error code I received has pages and pages of links to almost
 every forum on the internet all touting a solution that never works. I have tried so many times with the exact same result that I have given up trying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had already done a complete reinstall of everything with the 1511 version that was the very last version in the last week before the free upgrade expired. I downloaded the program to a USB drive and never bothered to actually let the update run. I did
 go onto the USB drive and copied the file that creates a genuine ticket and ran it with elevated privileges. I copied the ticket to the flash drive and also to another storage drive in my system. I did a clean install. I deleted any existing partitions on
 the main drive and windows 10 created 3 new ones. A standard mbr and a 500 MB one if I remember correctly. The rest of the 512 GB SSD was the third partition. All of the other drives remained the way they were. I have spent the last 20 years building custom
 computers so there is not much that I don't know about them. Windows 10 is a different animal, one I had yet to learn about. I have been through my event viewer repeatedly sorting out the issues listed there. All my software is freshly installed and nothing
 is extremely old. I have the latest versions of all of my programs. Everything is up to date. Updates occurred as usual and installed with very little problems. If anything it would be a driver that needed updating. Then comes my biggest nightmare. An Anniversary
 update.... After all of that work the last thing I wanted to do is download a new Windows 10 program and start from scratch all over again. Now my computer doesn't even mention version 1607. Windows updates tells me I'm all up to date. System information tells
 me that I'm running version 10.0.10586. The internet tells me that it is the 1511 version. I have tried everything under the sun to install the anniversary edition but they all fail in the exact same way regardless of any fixes I have applied. Why can't I
 install it? I'm running an Asus ROG Rampage IV Extreme X79 system with the 3930k processor and 64 GB of G-Skill 2400 memory down clocked to 2133 because the Sandy Bridge processors won't run at 2400 when you have all the slots populated. I recently deleted
 all the entries in the event viewer so that I get a completely fresh view of any issues happening now after all the attempted fixes that I've done will get flushed away and I can see the present issues only. Anything that has come up since then are all driver
 related. I have taken care of most of them. Some of them Asus just hasn't bothered to update. I can get those directly from Intel. I run the update program and Windows tells me everything is up to date but I know different. If you can give me any information
 on how to overcome this issue I'm all ears. I really don't want to do a clean install again with a new downloaded version but if that's what it takes then I don't seem to have much choice. I'm just trying to avoid it because I have a lot of programs installed
 that I would need to reinstall all over again. It would take me weeks to get everything loaded again. That is why I'm really trying not to have to do that. The floor is yours. Tell me what you need and I'll provide it. Don't bother with sfc scannow common
 fixes. They don't work. It will fix files but it still won't allow the upgrade to 1607. I have 16TB of drive space 1/3 full. It's all data storage. My SSD is linked to one of the 3TB drives and Acronis is run daily. I am not using any form of Raid on any of
 the drives. (hardware or software) Fortunately I only need to restore the Main SSD drive when things go wrong. I've never needed to restore anything else. All user file folders reside on a different drive. AppData remains in its original location. I am the
 sole user of the system. I live alone. Nobody touches my machines except me. &nbsp;Personally I have given up trying but this is the first time I am asking for help rather than giving it.</p>

            That is what I'm trying to avoid doing. A clean install means weeks of work installing all my programs "again"... 137 programs to reinstall and configure their settings,.. Deactivating them so that I can reinstall them. It took me months to get it to where
 it is. The worst one is Windows Live Mail. Exporting and importing 5 email addresses. Setting up 18 Rules to direct specific traffic to specific folders. The blocked sender list is not exportable meaning that I'll be getting all new spam emails until I block
 them again. It's a monumental task that I'm trying to avoid at all costs. Many of the programs are customized to my preferences. These are also not export/import settings. I was kind of hoping that someone out there would be able to tell me what I need to
 change so that the update would complete. It gets so close to finishing only to revert back again as the login screen loads. If I knew which program or setting was causing it I would uninstall it and reinstall it after completing the upd

            <p>It looks like I will be the first one reporting this issue then. My install was the last free version before the cutoff date. If you are telling me that nobody has reported any issues installing the update from a clean install of the first version then let
 me be your first reported case. I will download the latest full install version (1607) and burn it to a USB drive. It may give me the update option and the custom (which is the full) option as per usual during the install procedure. If so then I will first
 try the update option from a bootable USB drive. If it doesn't work then I am looking at a clean install wiping out everything I have done to date anyways.
</p>
<p>I read the Refresh Windows option and it pretty well is as close to a clean install as possible causing me to reinstall all my programs again anyways. I might as well go all the way with a full clean install. I don't see any advantage to reinstalling 90%
 instead of 100% of my programs leaving the possibility that the 10% it doesn't change will give me problems later. I have current backups I can restore from given a worst case scenario.</p>

            I do have one question for you. When I upgraded the options were UK English or US English and nothing else. I chose the UK version as I am Canadian and the spelling is very similar. Later they came out with a Canadian language pack which I installed. What
 happens now is with Cortana the person speaking has a British accent. On this reinstall can I switch to the US version and then apply the Canadian language pack. At least then Cortana will speak the same English as I do. Some sites say I cannot do this. I'm
 not certain if I can or can't. I would like to if possible, but if not, letting me know before I start the clean install will certainly save me a lot of headaches if I am not allowed to change it.

            <p>This is not my first time at the circus. I know exactly what I need to do and my organizational skills are second to none. I went with the clean install method listed in the Wiki link. I don't erase the drive I delete all the partitions. It is a completely
 unallocated drive when I run the install. I have backups of everything on my system even the email accounts are exported account by account. In fact I run backups of my email accounts every two hours. It does not record blocked email addresses, rules I have
 created, and other things. My provider has all of my incoming emails on their server so once I set up the account it will download everything I ever received. That goes all the way back to 2002. What the server does not store are sent emails. I back them up
 separately. I have copies of every program or driver I've ever downloaded and know where to get the latest ones. I have repaired hundreds of systems over the years. They are the ones who don't know or care about organizing their user folders. Windows 1511
 installed just fine and I loaded the drivers that Windows doesn't have. I also check the date of Windows drivers. I'm surprised at how old some of them are. I have found 2009 drivers that Windows uses. I have updated all that I could. My computer was custom
 built by me. I have built over 100 custom systems as well. I did have several problems after the 1511 clean install. They were all driver related but I've had problems that appeared after a Windows update that didn't exist previously. That was more often a
 problem than any driver issues I had. Imagine suddenly having no sound at all. You uninstall the program and reinstall it with no success. Then you hit the internet looking for answers. There are endless pages of people on every kind of forum looking to solve
 the same issue that appeared right after the windows update. Eventually you find a fix or Windows update installs a new patch. That kind of problem has been quite prevalent. I have been tinkering and windows update tinkers as well. I'm sure that somewhere
 down the line they have corrupted certain aspects of Windows 10 pro. I've dealt with windows update failures where it no longer works. and too many others that I'm not going to get into. To say that people who did a clean install had no problems is probably
 the biggest understatement I have ever heard. There have been nothing but patches and updates constantly being installed as you locate and facilitate fixes with your OS. File corruption has been a big problem that has left me without internet access on a few
 occasions. These errors appear after the latest updates are installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My system runs 24/7. I don't watch cable TV period even though I pay for it. I would say that I'm online or doing something on my computer 14 to 16 hours a day. My hobby is science and technology. Research is the top activity of mine. I have never been tested
 but I would say that my IQ is very high. My career is all about making things do what is supposedly impossible. It is not related to computers but that was my after hours daily activity since my 486DX25 state of the art computer days. I have forgotten more
 than the majority of people will ever know when it comes to computers, troubleshooting, and repair. If it had been my career then I would probably have written books and manuals on the topic with many of the solutions to common and even uncommon problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you suggest that I may not have read the Wiki I'm thinking, "My God I could have written the wiki myself." I did go through it but there is nothing there that I don't already know. The few things that I don't know I find on the internet from reputable
 websites. I am a member of ROG, Overclockers.com, TweakTown and several other sites just like them. Call me a tekky as it does fit the bill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My OS knowledge did stop at the Windows 8 debacle. I do have 8.1 on my backup computer but I don't use it much as it is a backup and not my main system. How do you think I find the answers when an update screws up my connection or something else just as
 disruptive happens. Thank goodness I run constant backups or I would have had to fresh install at least 7 or 8 more times due to Microsoft's ineptitude with tinkering to solve problems. They fix one and it creates problems for more people than the fix worked
 for. I have seriously been considering changing to a Hackintosh build, Linux or Ubuntu OS. At least for another year until you have a SP1 and/or a SP2 in place in Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I'm at it why does Microsoft think they can own the creative rights to anything on my system. Forced ads, buying apps that previous versions of windows gave you for free and I'm sure that it won't be long before Windows becomes a subscription service
 rather than an OS that I own the rights to use by paying for it. I can see competition happening right around the corner and when that happens all your customers are going to jump ship. You don't own anything on my system. I have disabled every possible snoop
 program that Microsoft included monitoring my usage for advertising purposes. I'm sure you still have backdoors embedded into your software for people like me. I don't have a single pirated program on my system nor have I since the year 2000 when I decided
 to own every single program that I run. I am not worried if you are perusing my system but to say you own the copyrights to anything produced on Windows is a step too far. You think getting rid of XP was difficult. I think that if you ever pursue your licence
 ownership of content you'll never get rid of Windows 7 users or 8.1 users. You have done a good job of embedding permissions automatically into your system during the standard recommended install of windows 10. I on the other hand have gone out of my way to
 disable them. Maybe that is why 1607 won't install. It is trying to change those permission settings with an update. If it can't then the update fails.... I would not be surprised in the least if that were the case. Doing a clean install of the 1607 version
 will automatically change some permissions that we could block previously but after the new install it won't give me that option anymore.</p>

            <p>Let's just simplify things. I don't have the time to do it all over again. That was the main reason why I waited until the last moment to do a clean install. How was I to know that you had an anniversary update which is so radical that the majority of people
 have to do a clean install to get it to run. If I had known that I would have just run the Microsoft Genuine Ticket creator and then I would have&nbsp;just waited for the anniversary update. Then I would have done a clean install. Doing it twice in a matter of
 months is a lot of work. </p>
<p>I have 15TB of software which I load onto three SSDs, and 4 HDDs. One is my main drive and I have a 3TB drive connected to it where everything gets stored that I work on and create documents and simple files. All of my drivers and programs are stored on
 that 3TB drive. All of my games run on a second SSD I have installed. I created a Program Files folder on a different drive. I had to because my main drive was too full. &nbsp;One of my 4TB drives is dedicated to running backups of my other drives. The remaining
 drives store videos. The videos do not get backed up. There is too much to backup without installing more drives to do it. If Raid cards were inexpensive I would run some arrays but for now nothing runs in Raid period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Programs that I run are Adobe Master Collection CS6. Autocad Inventor series and several similar software packages just like those. In your add/remove programs section Adobe Master collection CS6 is only one entry yet there are at least a dozen programs
 within that package that aren't listed. I have other programs that install just like it. I have to customize each program "again". I'm sure that an SP1 is just around the corner. That would probably require me to do a clean install as well.
</p>
<p>For now everything works. The only problems I have are when windows runs updates. Something is always affected adversely by the updates and I spend far too much time trying to find solutions to them. When I am sure that you won't do any more major changes
 then I might hazard a clean install. I dread all of the work that I'll have to do again. Right now I'm just ignoring it. I have the download so I can run it at any time. The next time I have a few weeks to dedicate myself to rebuilding my system I'll consider
 it. For now it runs just fine. They say that if your bios works fine then you shouldn't flash it. I feel the same way about the windows 10 anniversary update.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Yes, it is very strange!&nbsp; I just got it this year when my 2nd HP no longer worked.&nbsp; I was trying to save money and saw this one on sale.&nbsp; It is a Toshiba Satellite&nbsp;&nbsp; C55-B5296.&nbsp; No only was it confusing trying to learn Windows 8 but also deal with all of
 the issues this one is giving me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, on Windows 10 is it possible to have toolbars other than the SmartBar?</p>

            Hi ****,
<br />can you tell us where you heard that.
<br />you can set windows to logo on automatically using the WINDOWS password but I have not heard of any way to embed the user password into the BIOS.
<br />
<br />to log on automatically 
<br />click start 
<br />type netplwiz and press enter 
<br />untick "users must enter a username and password..." 
<br />click apply 
<br />(if it is already unticked, tick the box and click apply then untick it again and click apply)
<br />you will be asked for a username and password (used to automatically log on). 
<br />if you are using a Microsoft account enter the FULL email address. 
<br />enter and verify your password and click ok 
<br />next time you boot the computer it will automatically log on. 
<br />
<br />NOTE - there is no need to switch to a local account, it WORKS perfectly well with a Microsoft account, as long as you enter the full email address in the username field. 
<br />blank passwords are NOT a good idea.
<br />do not forget the password.
<br />
<br />to prevent it asking for a password when waking from sleep, go to settings -&gt; accounts -&gt; sign-in options 
<br />under "require sign-in" select Never. 
<br />
<br />hope that helps please let us know if you experience any problems.

<p>I have heard "through the grapevine" that an OEM is doing this and allowing the option of using the BIOS boot password to be used to auto login the user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware of the common autologin where the user's credentials are stored in the registry and no password is required upon startup. This is not that. The intent here is to require the user to provide a password to boot but use that password to also login.

            sorry, for the misunderstanding.
<br />I haven't heard about it and a quick search has not revealed anything.
<br />(if were that easy you wouldn't have asked)
<br />
<br />I can think of a few pitfalls and windows is moving towards other methods of authentication to save the user entering passwords.
<br />
<br />sorry I can't help.

<h2>            Windows 10 Update KB4033637</h2>
                    What does Windows 10 update KB4033637 do? I've searched using Bing, the MS website, and other search engines, but only get articles of Windows failing to update this.

 &nbsp;He asks "Can you tell me where I am?" &nbsp;The man in the building replies "You're in a helicopter". &nbsp;The pilot thanks the man, and calmly finds the airport and lands. &nbsp;His passenger asks "How did you figure that out?"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The pilot replies <strong>
"Because the man gave me an answer that was technically correct, but otherwise completely useless, I knew I was next to the Microsoft building."</strong></span></p>

</p><p><em>Rather than ask why someone wants it, and provide a completely unhelpful answer, why not look up what the patch is actually supposed to accomplish, provide that information, and then send off a quick note to the documentation team that maybe they should
 update the Microsoft web page to provide information on the KB?&nbsp;</em><strong>That's what being helpful is all about.</strong></p>

<p>When I first asked what this KB4033637 update did, my system did its update, so
</p>
<p>AFTER&nbsp;running updates this is Windows 10 Version 1703 Build 15063.483.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the other reply person commented, your questions are really irrelevant to my question. Microsoft has NOT published a KB article explaining this update. Why? Is it some secret they don't want the unsuspecting public to know about? Is it because of all
 the Microsoft layoffs and not have insufficient staff to write an article?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions&nbsp;are simple: What does KB4033637 do? What does it fix? When will MS publish an explanation for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen "critical" updates that installed apps for upgrading Windows 7 to 10, which I think you'll agree were not very "critical". MS did this several times. Thankfully Windows 7 Update app allowed me to choose the updates. Win 10 isn't so friendly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate MS answering my questions above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>This update caused my computer to randomly freeze completely for up to 30-60 seconds at a time, making it practically useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried refreshing my windows installation which worked for a few days, until this update was installed again. Then I suspected it could have something to do with my graphics drivers, as it was more likely to happen when starting a 3d application or something
 that opened a new window or a browser tab. So I tried a clean reinstall of my graphics driver (which didn't help).</p>
<p>Then I tried various troubleshooting steps in some threads about windows 10 randomly hanging up (including adjusting PCIe power settings and some other things I can't remember, which of course didn't help either).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I decided to try removing a recently installed update (this one) and it worked - there has been no more freezing for at least a few days now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're not going to properly test the code you push, then at least publish an article in the KB warning people about the potential issues it can cause. If it wasn't for the proprietary Windows-only software that I'm currently forced to use for some projects,
 I'd have switched to Linux on this computer long ago - and **** like this makes it even harder to justify keeping it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some info about my setup, in case you want to try to recreate the issues:</p>
<p>OS Version: Windows 10 Pro 1607 (build 14393.1593)</p>
<p>CPU: Intel i5-4670K</p>
<p>RAM: 12GB</p>
<p>GPU: 2xAMD HD7970 (crossfire), Radeon software version 17.7.2</p>
<p>OS Drive: Crucial MX100 512GB SSD</p>
<p>Storage: 2x1.5T WD Green HDD (mirror)</p>
<p>Default 'Pictures', 'Music', 'Downloads' and 'Videos' folders moved to secondary drive (in case that can affect things, like someone mentioned in another thread once).</p>

<p>This thread has persuaded me definitively not to bu Microsoft products anymore. Now that I'm older I can afford the more expensive MACs than quibble over the subterfuge presented here.&nbsp; Since the exact nature and function of KB4033637 will not be disclosed
 I can only assume that it is either some form of spyware or patch to a SEVERE OS vulnerability of a catastrophic nature.

<h2>            how long can i use windows 10 home on mac without activation&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I have recently installed windows 10 home on my mac laptop through boot camp. I did not enter a product key when setting up windows, I clicked the "I do not have a product key" option.&nbsp;The set up was successful&nbsp;and everything seems to be working fine,
 I was&nbsp;never asked again to enter a product key.&nbsp;I am wondering how long can I use windows without activation? Thank you.

    <title>Windows Media Center on 8.1 with DTA box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rob de  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Center on 8.1 with DTA box</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I've been messing around with WMC (Windows Media Center) on 8.1 trying to figure out how to set up my DTA box. My devices:<br />
<br />
HP Omni 220-1180QD w/ built in tv tuner on Windows 8.1 w/ WMC <br />
SuddenLink DTA box Model DC732 <br />
<br />
Okay so my problem is that after setting up the tv tuner via WMC, all steps are gone through flawlessly except the part where I try to change the channel. The DTA box receives the input with no problems on the screen. The only thing is the picture is snowy.
 I have a feeling it has something to do with the DTA box having to be set to either channel 3/4 and WMC not keeping it that channel set as a priority channel and it is trying to broadcast through the channel 3 setup.
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if I am making sense or not, but how can I keep WMC on a proprietary channel (3) so that the channel I'm trying to watch is broadcasted through that channel?<br />
<br />

I changed the title of your question from Player to Center... </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Setting up a DTA "should" be just like setting up a set top box. Here is something I wrote up years ago

<p>My account was hacked the other day so I changed my password. Today I've been told that my account has been locked (good) and that I need a code to get back in (good) but the backup email address on file is old and no longer accesible (uh oh). Please tell
 me how to get in touch with an actual person so that I can reset and access my account. (I had to create a new account just to post this question!)</p>

<br />
Please follow the steps below to undergo customer support Windows Live account recovery:<br />
<br />
1. Go to: </span><a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://account.live.com/password/reset</span></a></p>

3. Click <strong><span>Reset your password.</span></strong><b><br />
</b>4. Enter your Windows Live ID password.<br />
5. Enter the characters you see in the picture.<br />
6. Click <strong><span>Next.</span></strong><b><br />
</b>7. Tick on <strong><span>Customer support.</span></strong><b><br />
</b>8. When Customer support appears, click on it<br />

<h3> stiner905  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tuner Not Available - WMC &#40;Vista&#41;</h2>
                    I have a ASUS PH3-100 TV tuner card. &nbsp;When I click "Live TV" in Windows Media Center, I get a disk error and the following message:
<div>"Tuner Not Available:&nbsp;The tuner is currently in use by another application or is not working. &nbsp;Please close all other applications, restart Windows Media Center, and then try again."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Restarting WMC does not fix the problem. &nbsp;After I reboot my computer, if I load WMC and click "Live TV", I get the normal signal. &nbsp;However, if I click the "stop" button and then click "Live TV" again, the same error reappears. &nbsp;The appearance of this error
 did not correspond to the installation of any hardware or software (at least any I installed). &nbsp;All the drivers for the tuner card are up-to-date. &nbsp;I know some antivirus programs have caused issues for some people; I am running Avast! with the P2P, Standard
 and Web shields activated.</div>

<p>Hi Stiner905,<br />
<br />
To resolve this issue, provide a temporary Internet connection to the computer. Then, run Windows Media Center Setup again. To run Setup again, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />
i.&nbsp;Start Windows Media Center. <br />
ii.&nbsp;Click Tasks, and then click Settings. <br />
iii.&nbsp;Click TV, and then click Set Up TV Signal.<br />
iv.&nbsp;When you are notified that changing TV signal settings will interrupt recording, click Yes.<br />
v.&nbsp;On the Set Up Your TV Signal screen, click Next.<br />
vi.&nbsp;Verify that the correct region is selected, click Yes, use this region to configure TV services, and then click Next.
<br />
vii.&nbsp;Click Configure my TV signal automatically, and then click Next. <br />
viii.&nbsp;Verify that the TV signal configuration settings are correct, click Yes, and then click Next.<br />
ix.&nbsp;Click Set Up Guide listings, and then click Next two times. <br />
x.&nbsp;On the Guide Privacy screen, click Yes, and then click Next. <br />
xi.&nbsp;If you agree to the Guide Terms of Service, click I agree, and then click Next.
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> To continue, you must click I agree to accept the Guide Terms of Service.
<br />
xii.&nbsp;Click Manual download, and then click Next two times. <br />
xiii.&nbsp;When you are prompted, type your ZIP Code or Postal Code, and then click Next.
<br />
xiv.&nbsp;If you are prompted, verify your signal provider, and then click Next. <br />
Note: After Windows Media Center has downloaded the Guide, the Internet connection is no longer required.
<br />
xv.&nbsp;Follow the remaining steps to complete Setup. You may have to restart Windows Media Center.</p>
<p>Refer to the article “Error message that you receive after you configure Windows Media Center without connecting to the Internet: "No Tuner Available"”

I tried the suggested solution and it failed.&nbsp; The cited support article is not relevant to my situation since the computer with the TV tuner is constantly connected to the internet.<br />

<p>Hello stiner905,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum. <br />
<br />
I would temporarily disable your antivirus and see if that is the problem.&nbsp; <br />
You can download the free&nbsp;Microsoft Security Essentials from the link <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here </a>if you need.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't help, then do a clean boot using MSConfig and see if that will help to identify what program or software is affecting Live TV.<br />
KB 929135 - How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>I would like to see if any startup items or third party services could be causing the issue.&nbsp; This is called a clean boot. You will Disable all startup items and third party services when booting. This method will help us determine if this issue is caused
 by a loading program or service.</p>
<p><br />
The steps below will place your computer into a “clean boot”, meaning using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that we can determine whether a background program is interfering.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start on your Desktop<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type msconfig in the Start Search box and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Once the computer is back to your Desktop, check to see if you are still having the problem.</p>
<p>If the issue is resolved by placing the machine in “clean boot” then we have some sort of third party application and or service running that is possibly interfering. To determine which program(s) and or service(s) that is causing this, we would need to
 go back into “msconfig” and start to enable programs and services and reboot until we see which one causes the problem.</p>
<p>If placing the computer in “clean boot” does not fix the issue or after the troubleshooting is done, follow the steps above “To return your computer back to normal boot”.</p>
<p>How to set your computer back, to boot normal: <br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Click the Start orb on your Desktop<br />
2. In the Start Search box. Type msconfig, and then press ENTER. <br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
<br />
Click the General tab. <br />
3. Click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.
<br />
4. When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.</p>
<p>Hope this helps to identify the issue. If not, then I suggest you post at the 
www.thegreenbutton.com\forums.<br />

            Thanks for your response Marilyn.&nbsp; I did as you described in your post (disabling antivirus, clean boot), but the problem persisted.&nbsp; I even uninstalled my antivirus, but this did not fix the problem either.&nbsp; I will do as you suggest and post at www.thegreenbutton.com/forums.<br />
<br />
Please let me know of other suggestions!&nbsp; Thank you.

Since the suggestions posted here didn't help, I suggest you post the

It is a Microsoft website and they deal only in Windows Media Center.<br />

            <p>I have an 8" Dragon Touch I8 purchased with Windows 8.1 that I wanted to upgrade to Windows 10..&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade to Windows 10&nbsp;option appeared on the screen and when I clicked on it, it said I needed either more drive C space or more storage memory.&nbsp; I added a 16GB Micro SD to the tablet and the install program was satisfied.&nbsp; However, the upgrade failed
 to complete and when it automatically went back to the original Windows 8.1, I lost some of the 3.96GB of empty space in the 16GB memory (with&nbsp;4.5GB in a hidden Recovery partition).&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;install error message gave me the option to try again and it&nbsp;also failed&nbsp;(now
 with even more of the memory taken up in more scrap left behind files).&nbsp; I then did a "Remove everything and reinstall Windows" and tried to upgrade again with another failure (but a different error code).&nbsp; &nbsp;so I kept trying (maybe 20 or 30 times with 8 different
 error messages) going back to reinstall Windows when necessary.&nbsp; I also had to occasionally re-format the 32GB Micro SD to empty it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the last attempt, the when the memory ran out, I could not reinstall windows, the access files were gone.&nbsp; So now, my&nbsp;16GB of storage has: 4.5GB in the Recovery Partition (that I can't use); 100MB in an unlabeled partition; and the remaining partition
 (9.95GB) full of Windows 8.1 and hidden files that occupy all of the&nbsp;rest.&nbsp; I have removed all Apps and Programs and Drive C is still too full to install anything.&nbsp; Now I'm stuck.&nbsp; I probably have to send my Dragon Touch I8 to the place where I bought it and
 have them re-flash the 16 GB storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm fairly savy around computers, and I still got into major trouble.&nbsp; My advice,&nbsp;let a professional do the upgrade to Windows 10 and make sure they garantee that if they can't do the upgrade, they will return the computer to original condition (in writing!).&nbsp;

            <p>There are forums all over the place regarding the Dragon Touch I8 8" Tablet PC.&nbsp; I've spent weeks off and on looking for a solution, and finally found my own.&nbsp; I used my desktop with Windows 10 Pro, to download Windows 10 so I could install windows 10 from
 a flash drive.&nbsp; When presented with a popup that recommends which version you should have, you should uncheck the box in the lower left hand corner and manually choose.&nbsp; I had to because my desktop is 64bit, and the I8 tablet is 64 bit, but because of the
 1gb of ram you need to install the 32bit version of Windows 10.&nbsp; you also need a 3 in 1 USB hub OTG Extension Adapter for cell phones and tablets.&nbsp; Got mine at Amazon for $6.&nbsp; You plug it in where you would normally charge the tablet, and make sure the Windows
 10 flash drive is plugged into one of the USB ports on the adapter.&nbsp; While you are in Windows 8.1 on the tablet, you need to go into settings and click on recovery.&nbsp; This gives you choices to recover different ways, but you need to choose advanced options.&nbsp;
 You going to choose an option to boot from flash drive, dvd, and so on...&nbsp; Choose flash drive and the tablet will restart and boot from flash drive, and windows 10 will start to load.&nbsp; You will have a blank screen for a bit, but you will see an indicator light
 on you flash drive lighting up letting you know the tablet is reading it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Important!!!&nbsp; There are options to change the way the tablet boots and so on....&nbsp; This is sort of a bios, but tablets don't have a bios setup like a pc.&nbsp; If you don't know what you're doing, don't select the option to mess with it.&nbsp; You WILL turn your tablet
 into a really nice paperweight!!!&nbsp; DO NOT setup Windows 10 on your flash drive as an upgrade!!!&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because the installation will not delete Windows 8.1, and you will have the same problem all over again.&nbsp; When choosing how to download Windows 10, you will
 choose to install from a device (flash drive) as said before.&nbsp; When Windows 10 installs you have the option of formatting or deleting drive partitions.&nbsp; This is great!!!&nbsp; You get your whole drive back, and Windows 10 gets installed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The CONS?&nbsp; You will need a USB keyboard and mouse.&nbsp; You will need to make sure your battery is fully charged because you can't charge it while the USB hub and flash drive are plugged in.&nbsp; After Windows installs, but before it restarts, remove the flash drive.&nbsp;
 Remove the flash drive!!!&nbsp; In case you didn't get it the first two times...&nbsp; Remove the flash drive!!!&nbsp; This the reason why....&nbsp; No bios to go into to turn off secure boot and then change the boot order.&nbsp; ( Actually there sort of is, and it worked for me on
 another tablet, but I know what I'm doing )&nbsp; If the tablet restarts and the flash drive is still plugged in, chances are it will start the Windows 10 installation all over again.&nbsp; If the freshly installed version of Windows 10 gets damaged because of this,
 you will have no way to boot up and reinstall windows again, because you will already have wiped out Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Sorry the directions and so on aren't a bit more clear,&nbsp; but it's really not that complicated.&nbsp; The Windows 10 installation will also leave out
 a couple drivers, but windows update along with device manager, will reinstall just about everything.&nbsp; My drivers saved from 8.1 wouldn't work on either I8, that's why I'm not telling you to save them to a flash drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are these tablets worth the work I put in?&nbsp; I think so.&nbsp; Both I8 8" tablets I own, run well are pretty quick.&nbsp; PRO...&nbsp; Windows 10 will use much less drive space, and you will have well over 6gb of drive space left after install.&nbsp; The 1gb of installed ram
 will suddenly be plenty to handle everything you install on the tablet, because it's using half as much as 8.1 did on the I8.&nbsp; While running micrsoft office, games and so on, I'm not seeing the ram max out any longer and there is no glitching, lagging, or
 freezing up. </p>

<p>Can you still&nbsp;use the tablet's touch screen? After, I updated to Windows 10 Pro, I no longer was able to use the touch screen. Nor, did I have audio. I was wondering if you had any of these issues.</p>

    <title>Monitor out of range while installing Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> naseem99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Monitor out of range while installing Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm migrating from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, whilst installing, my monitor suddenly blanked out and hand an "out of range" signal. Due to this error, I restarted my computer a few times to get to the advanced options where they was a "return to previous
 build option" and i'm back to Windows 8.1. I would really like to upgrade to Windows 10 but the 'out of range' error is holding me back from even knowing if it has installed.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have this problem in Win10. I can't use my monitor unless I have my tv hooked up as a second display, and can't go back to just the monitor (Viewsonic VG700). Monitor works on initial boot screen, and in safe mode. I tried low res option, and that didn't
 work. Tried resetting my monitor resolution and refresh rate while I have the tv up as an extended and also when it's a clone display, but regardless of the setting, as soon as the windows boot screen loads my monitor goes out of range. Tried uninstalling
 the monitor in device manager, tried updating the monitor driver too. Nothing has worked so far.</p>

            <p>Just don't download windows using media creation tool as during installation windows is setting resolution&nbsp; to higher frequency than your monitor.</p>
<p>Upgrade your windows using windows update by clicking on the small windows icon appearing on the bottom right of the task bar. If you are not getting the icon go to windows update and download update KB3035583 and restart your pc.</p>
<p>I was also facing same problem now I am using windows 10 without any further problem.</p>

            After windows update in Nov 2017 began to install, the monitor displayed a message "input signal out of range&nbsp; &nbsp;Change Settings to 1920 x 1080 - 60hz".&nbsp; &nbsp;I can't access the computer at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;So changing the settings is not an option.&nbsp; &nbsp;So far windows
 tech support has not been any help.&nbsp; &nbsp;The cable has been swapped out and is not the problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;Restarting has done nothing.&nbsp; &nbsp;Bootable media will not boot.&nbsp; &nbsp;The computer is a 3 month old HP that was working fine yesterday.&nbsp; &nbsp;Any ideas?

<p>BF3 is 10x more of a Battlefield game than BC2, so I think the proper question is "Can we call BC2 a Battlefield game?"</p>

<p>I like to ask your past Battlefield background/experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you know that the Bad Company series are just a shoot-off from the main Battlefield series?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you know that Battlefield 3 is a return to Battlefield 2 with some flair of Battlefield: Bad Company 2? So some of the "changes" that you may think of are not really changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you know that since since CoD: Mw2 and CoD: Black Ops, people that mainly play CoD are talking how Battlefield 3 will be better than Cod: MW3? Because of that, they bring their knowledge of Battlefield games (or lack thereof) to the game. They rant how
 everybody is cheating, there are lag switches and hacks all around when there is none.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I worry for the future Battlefield community here <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-6.gif" /></p>

<p>BF3 is not changing, its going back to its roots. Think of it as a updated version of one of the best&nbsp;ever FPS = Battlefield 2. (A remake almost if you like).<br />
<br />
Bad Company 1 &amp; 2 was made to bring BF to consoles to build a fan base on Xbox &amp; PS3. And to give the BF2 fan base something new to play until BF3 was ready for release .Yeah some of the idea's in Bad Company have been added to BF3 Like Rush &amp; Death-match.
<br />
<br />
However it will not become a COD clone, and&nbsp;in a way&nbsp;I kinda hope its not a COD killer, yeah it would be cool to see&nbsp;MW3 flop as a result of BF3 but I really don't what COD players switching over and &nbsp;trash talking &amp;&nbsp;lone wolfing it all over lobbys.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
(Don't mean to offend any&nbsp;COD players, but you guys know what some&nbsp;people who play COD&nbsp;are&nbsp;like).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

[/quote]I never played BF2 but I have seen gameplay and this game as far as what I seen in the trailer has more Bad Company elements. I know that BF2 had big maps, more veichles, players,&nbsp;squad functionality,&nbsp;etc. and they added these things back&nbsp;but it feels
 like a Bad Company 3 to me.

<p>You should start hoping that it is more like BF2 than BC2.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about you, but if BF3 is as fun as BF2, then I won't have to buy another FPS for a few years, saving some money right there...</p>
