<h2>            Windows 10 Licensing Fee</h2>
                    <p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>please let me know if the upgraded Windows 10 (Pro) is free for live. Do we need to pay annual subscription fee to continue using Windows 10 (Pro)? Similar to Office 365 where we need to pay licensing fee annually?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Yes, it’s free. This is a full free version of Windows, not a trial or introductory version. It is available for a limited time: you have until July 29, 2016 to take advantage of this offer. Once you upgrade, you’ll have Windows 10 for free
 on that device.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

                    Hi,<br />
&nbsp; I am having an issue with my webcam. I recently installed gesture control which darkened my camera so I uninstalled the driver now I can't revert it back. Even when I am installing any imaging driver it is not working and the usb2.0 video/camera driver doesn't
 even exist on the list. Please help me get the usb video/camera driver.<br />

<div><br />
<div>I would require more information to help understand the issue better. &nbsp;Please answer to these questions:</div>
<div>1. What is the make and model of the webcam?</div>
<div>2. Have you uninstalled the gesture software?</div>
<div>3. What is the make and model of the PC?</div>
<div>4. Do you get any error message when you try to install the webcam driver?</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I would suggest to install the chipset drivers from the computer manufacturer's website. &nbsp;Then, try installing the webcam driver and check.</div>

</div>
<div>A clean reinstall is often better than getting a new computer since most PC's come larded with sponsors' bloatware and duplicate utilities that interfere with much better versions built into Windows 7. For this reason most tech enthusiasts clean reinstall
 using the Product Key on the COA sticker affixed to machine. This guide compiles everything that works best in tens of thousands of installs we've directly helped with here.</div>

<p>Find the right Windows 7 .iso <br />
</p>
</div>
<p><span>Microsoft has taken down the Digital River ISO download servers and are only providing ISO's to retail customers. This leaves those who bought a PC with Win7 at the mercy of OEM Tech Support who except for Dell rarely will provide clean Reinstallation
 media, to borrow a retail copy, or search for a torrent download which can be risky if not checked for add-ins.
<br />
<br />
</span><span>If you have a retail copy of Windows 7, then you could try to download an ISO directly from Microsoft at the link below. The link is reported to only work in Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />

<span><br />
<span><br />
</span><span>If you have any doubt about the integrity of the ISO file or are forced to
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">download the ISO from a torrent</span> you can compare the SHA1 signature available freely on the
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/downloads/#searchTerm=windows%207&amp;ProductFamilyId=0&amp;Languages=en&amp;ProductFamilyIds=350&amp;FileExtensions=.iso&amp;PageSize=10&amp;PageIndex=0&amp;FileId=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MSDN Downloads page</a> searching Windows 7 ISO, click "Details" links on correct version. Use a checker like
</span><span><a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/mg/getmirror/hashtab,1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HashTab
</a>which adds a HASH calculator to the ISO file Properties tabs. Having these sums match assures ISO integrity and that nothing was added to the file.<br />
<br />
</span><span>If your licensed version is unavailable you can unlock all versions in any ISO by running

</span><br />
<span><br />
<span><br />
</span><span>I would use 64-bit for 4gb or more RAM, 32-bit (x86) for 3gb or less RAM.

You can slipstream the latest Updates into the installer ISO to save at least an hour's Updating after install using

<h2>            Xbox offline games- games for gold problems</h2>
                    
<p>ok. First and for most I have one Xbox one with one account on it. Not multiple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a trucker. My Xbox is connected about 10% of the time when I am at home. The rest is offline(witch is a minority of Xbox gamers that are being ignored in these updates) and last night I downloaded child of light and the pool game and I started them
 both so my license could be verified on my Xbox. And today none of my games for gold titles will work at all. They tell me to connect to Xbox live to play them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to power cycle the console. And sign out and back in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have other games downloaded to my Xbox and those work.&nbsp;</p>

support.xbox.com/.../my-home-xbox</a> </p>
<p>Sounds weird that it only affects the GwG, when you disconnect the console from the internet to play, do you enable the offline setting? Maybe this will have some effect on how the console searches for the license:

<p>So am I! I can only think because they are GwG it requires the interest connection, but then I would assume more people would have brought this issue up in the support forums. I'm sure someone else can confirm this for us as I haven't tried to play offline
 myself.</p>

<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p>Yeah, I would say it is because you require a Gold account to use the games, and when playing offline it can't register what level your account is.
</p>
<p>For example, if I am currently gold and it was due to expire tomorrow, I could just download them all today, switch it to offline and the xbox wouldn't be able to stop me from playing them.</p>
<p>Every other game should be fine, its just the Games with Gold that will be affected</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

            <p>What was the workaround? I'm curious because I saw this thread earlier and tried to recreate the problem - I took my console offline and started several games I acquired through Games with Gold. However, they all played fine.</p>

<p>If you take it offline then unplug it and plug it back in and start it up with out letting it sign in to Xbox live it won't play games with gold title. At least on mine it won't. I played child of light and was online then went and then went offline while
 playing and drove for a while with it still running and then unplugged it and restarted it with no wifi and it works no matter what. But the other titles won't work at all.

<p>Cool dude, glad to hear you found a work around :)</p>
<p>What I said was just a guess based on what I know of the deal, I've had a look through the T&amp;C's and can't see anywhere that you need to be online, only that you need an active Gold account</p>

    <title>windows 10 create system image using usb stick - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vogleruk  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 create system image using usb stick</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm unable to create a System Image to a USB stick (as a network location). I've set this up using instructions I found
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update-winpc/how-to-create-windows-10-system-image-on-a-usb/24e84aff-3916-4661-894b-f140005d3b9e">
here</a> (formatting USB stick to NTFS, changing permissions etc) and the backup wizard finds the path for the drive successfully. However when I enter 'network credentials' (variations of this, eg using the PC name in the path) I get an error message 'The
 specific network location cannot be used' with an error code 0x80070544.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is there a trick I'm missing here? Do the network credentials I'm being prompted for relate to the PC (I'm using my username and login) or the USB stick (there are no network credentials here).</span></p>
<p>Is there anything else I can try to make this work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas appreciated!</p>

            <pre>First of all, I would never use a USB stick to create a system image, the failure rate is too high. You should use a mechanical external USB drive that is more stable.

File History, System Image, Backup and Restore in Windows 10 are partially broken and they are not being actively maintained or developed. Microsoft is planning to remove them in a future release. You are seeing the effects of this. You should switch to a third party solution such as Macrium Reflect (Free).

Macrium provides a small click to run the installer, but I chose the offline installer, which required finding the download agent (http://updates.macrium.com/reflect/v5.0/reflectdl.exe); this downloads the full installer at around 800 MBs. Included are a collection of preinstallation environment tools based on Microsoft’s Windows Image deployment solutions.
Setup was quick and easy but needed a restart to complete changes made to the system.
The Macrium Reflect interface is a bit more jam-packed than what you would normally find in Windows 10. But this a powerful alternative offering a range of options for creating and managing backups. Macrium integrates heavily with Windows—examples include support for attaching and browsing backups; boot image backups in Hyper-V; generating PowerShell scripts to automate backups; creating batch files and of course, scheduling backups. You can also find handy options such as cloning and standard file and folder backup.
For these instructions, we are going to focus on image backups. Similar to the System Image backup (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-windows-10-system-image-backup/) feature in Windows 10 and previous versions, this lets you create a replica of your current installation state. You can be granular with your backups by choosing only the partitions you want to save as part of your image.
To create your first image, click the menu Create an image of the partition(s) required to backup and restore Windows.
Under Destination, click the Browse button, then point to your external drive where you want to store the backup, create a new folder, select it then click OK. Click Next to Continue.
 
This phase of the wizard lets you create a Backup plan if you want. It’s optional, but lets you choose different methods of backups which include full, incremental and differential. For now, I am going to choose a schedule just to make things simple. I recommend you review the retention rules to save on disk space. Users can retain a number of backups using any method; this can quickly eat up disk space over time, so I will reduce the amount for each to about two. Click Next to Continue.
What are Incremental and Differential Backups and which should you choose?
A full backup gives you one backup file that restores your entire system up to that point. Full backups are a comprehensive way to go, but they take a long time to create and if you have multiple backup images, you end up duplicating a lot of the same data. Incremental and differential backups are two ways to address this inefficiency.
Incremental Backup – This maintains a regular backup in addition to changes that have been made since the last full or incremental backup. Incremental backups are often preferred because they use less disk space; not to mention, they are faster, too. So, if you created new Word documents since your last backup, those are added to the backup.
So, let’s say Backup A is a full backup you made on Monday. On Wednesday, you can make an incremental Backup B which only includes the new data since Backup A. On Friday, you can make Backup C, which only includes the new data since Backup B. In this way, you are storing no duplicate data. The downside is that if you want to restore your image, you have to use all three backup files: Backup A, Backup B, and Backup C.
Differential Backup – This creates a backup of the differences made since the last full backup. So, if you made changes to a few Microsoft Word documents, those changes are applied to the backup. A disadvantage is that differential backups use more space, since you need to maintain a full backup in addition to changes since you created your last backup.
How is that different than an incremental backup? Let’s say you make a full Backup A on Monday. On Wednesday, Backup B contains the differences since Backup A was made. On Friday, Backup C contains the differences since Backup A.  In this way, if you want to do a restoration, you just need two files: the last full backup and the last differential backup. This means you only ever need two files, compared to the incremental backup method. The downside is that, as you can imagine, your differential backup image file gets bigger and bigger as the time since your last full backup increases. And after awhile, you end up with a quite a bit of duplicated data across your various differential backups.
So, which should you use? Either one is fine. It all depends on how much storage space and time you have. Incremental backups are faster and take less space during the backup phase. Differential backups take more time and space during the backup phase but are easier during the restoration phase.
Review the image summary to ensure you chose the right options. If you maintain a dual boot configuration, make sure each partition is checked as part of your backup. Click Finish to begin the backup.
Click OK to start the backup immediately.
As with all image backups, it will take some time, so, sit back and relax as your image is saved. Click Close after your image is created.
Restoring Your Macrium Image
There are multiple ways to restore a backup. You can start the restore process from within a running installation of Windows 10 with Macrium already installed. But in most cases, restoring an image would take place after booting into a recovery environment similar to System Image in Windows 10.
Create Rescue Media
One important task you should complete after creating your image is to create rescue media, which will facilitate restoration of the image. This is perfect for scenarios where your computer won’t boot or you installed a new empty hard disk. Click the Other Tasks menu then click Create Rescue Media.
This will start the create bootable rescue media wizard. Remember, as we mentioned earlier, Macrium downloads a full installer at around 800 MBs. This is where the preinstallation environment tools based on Microsoft’s Windows Image deployment solutions are used. Macrium adds its own recovery tools to facilitate restoration of the image when you boot from it. Click Next.
You can add drivers in advance for hardware that might not be supported by the restored image. Click the Update Driver button to do so then point to the source. This can minimize the chances of Windows 10 not booting on new hardware; especially if you are changing motherboards.
Depending on the architecture of your Windows 10 image, you can choose either a 32 or 64-bit (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/windows-10-edition-architecture-build-your-install/) recovery image. For this particular case, I am restoring a 64 bit Windows 10 installation, so I will choose that. Click Next to begin the creation.
Bootable media can be prepared using a blank DVD or USB drive or you can create a bootable ISO image instead. Choose your desired method, then click Finish.
Restore Image – Macrium Reflect
Configure your computer to boot from the installation media (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/) on the target computer. Attach your external drive where the image is stored, then power it on.
Under the Restore tab in Macrium, click the menu, Browse for an image or backup file to restore.
Browse to the image file, select it then click Open.
Click Select a disk to restore to… then click the selected image that appears. Click Next to begin the restoration.
After the image is successfully restored, click File &gt; Exit to reboot.
That’s pretty much all that’s involved in preparing a system image of your Windows 10 installation using Macrium Reflect. Macrium feels a little complex and overwhelming at first, but once you familiarize yourself with it, you should feel comfortable using it in no time.

            Firstly i appreciate your reply Justine wasnt expecting it so fast and sorry for my late reply..After this post i had a "dead" pc for the next 3 days being able to be used only for the first 10 minutes and then boom..BSOD..i realised that i was getting
 ntoskrnl.exe in all my bsod..3 days had more than 20 bsod and i was confused..i done couple of test/checks nothing worked but at the end i realised that the problem was hardware and i opened the case took out the rams and cleaned them with a white eraser/rubber
 and popped them back in and from then..0 BSOD..the fact that surprised me is that in less than 10 days before that i opened my pc and cleaned every corner and made a full cable management etc etc..i made it into pieces and back in u know? and when i cleaned
 the rams with the eraser i found out that they were kinda dirty the pins which made be like..HOW? because i had already cleaned them good few days before...<br />
Anyways...so my problem is solved for now and thank u for the response ;)&nbsp;<br />
U can flag the post as solved&nbsp;<br />
Thanks for your time :)

<h2>            External monitor not recognized at power up or waking from sleep</h2>
                    I have a Lenovo Yoga 720 laptop that does not recognize the presence of an external monitor unless I disconnect/reconnect the cable between the laptop and the monitor. Yoga 720 has USB-C port for external monitor. I use a Lenovo USB-C/HDMI adapter + HDMI
 cable to external monitor. The laptop will not recognize the presence of an external monitor after power up or after waking up from sleep. The monitor status screen reports it is not receiving any signal. Problem occurs with HP and Philips external monitors.
 After disconnecting/reconnecting the HDMI cable, the laptop recognizes the presence of the external monitor and automatically switches to dual monitor operation. Windows 10 + drivers are all up to date. &nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We are going to need more details to get to the bottom of your display issue. Has it always been like this before? If not, when did the issue start happening? What changes have been made to your device since then? Does it affect both monitors?
</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Nessusus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and we regret for the inconvenience.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue you have mentioned&nbsp;is neither system nor operating system specific, so I suggest you to check if the Windows Media Center program is able to download the requisites at some point of time. Because, I suspect that the servers might be busy
 at this point of time to connect for up dation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Things seemed fine for about 4 days after the DST problem was corrected then ... Now WMC EPG data seems stuck with an end date of 4/3. It has been stuck there since 3/22. Manual downloading says the update is successful and next update is 4/1 but no new
 for 10 days? Not sure if it makes any difference but I'm using Salt Lake City Comcast Digital Cable and Zip Code 84403. I don't see any others with this problem so maybe it is unique to my area? I have tried switching to other zip codes with the same result.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guide began updating again on 3/29 updated successfully several times and has now stopped at 4/13. Has not updated since 4/1. This is becoming intolerable.</p>

            <p>I think Microsoft sent some sort of update that altered settings. Check the WMC notification icon (right click on it). At the bottom of the popup there should be a check mark next to "Enable Automatic Updates". If not click that setting to produce the check
 mark. After doing that I was able to open WMC go to Tasks, Settings, General, Automatic Download Options, Download Now. Note there is also an automatic update checkbox on the automatic download options page (Make sure it is checked. Checking that box should
 produce the check mark in the WMC notification icon window too.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update took about 10 minutes and produced errors but eventually the guide updated to 4/20. and seems to be automatically updating nightly again. You can watch the update process by hovering your mouse cursor over the WMC notification icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see the error notice by hovering the mouse cursor over the WMC notification icon after the update is complete. WMC seems to have those errors on every update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can live with the errors as long as the guide updates but I suspect the errors means the EPG is likely to die again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It s possible that an update would have occurred automatically without any action (assuming automatic updates had not been turned off).</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get Yahoo account to sync, yet Gmail does so...</h2>
                    <p>Pretty much as per the title. I upgraded to Windows 10 last night, an added my Gmail account to the mail app which synced up with no issues. I then added my Yahoo account as a second account and it refuses to sync at all. When trying to sync, the five little
 "loading blobs" do their thing near the top and it just says "still working on it" in the middle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried whatever I can think of by way of checking rules and exceptions in both my anti-virus suite (Webroot Secure Anywhere) and Windows Defender. With no options within the app to tweak, I've become stuck.</p>

    <title>Turning off Cortana should get rid of the &#34;Search tab on the Task - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pioneer52  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turning off Cortana should get rid of the &#34;Search tab on the Task bar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Cortana turned off&nbsp;and I know I can delete all the Info gathered if I want. My question is; Do&nbsp;we have a way to "remove the Search bar" completely from the Task bar or at the very least shut it off so it does not load every time you open "Start Menu"
 and use resources for no reason. I understand the purpose for it "if your using Cortana"....To gather your data, actions and habits so it will be more productive for "those who use it". I do care to use speech recognition and do not need the search bar&nbsp;to
 engage when opening the Start menu with&nbsp;Cortana offline.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Task View is a prime example and now has that on/off option.

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community Forums.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may boot the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue persists. When you start Microsoft Windows, typically there are several
 programs that start automatically and run in the background that may interfere with the program. These programs may include antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform a clean startup procedure, you prevent these programs from starting automatically.</span></p>

<p><span><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow steps under “<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>” in the article to boot to normal startup.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Further, you may also disable the search service from the services.msc window to check if this helps.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>1. Are you receiving both of these errors while trying to open iTunes?</span></p>
<p><span>2. What is the complete WerFault.exe and Window 1114 error messages you are receiving?<br />
3. Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue may occur due to any recent changes on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">WerFault.exe process is a part of Windows error reporting system and helps sending errors logs from your computer. The error you are getting may be caused if the WerFault process is overloaded because of errors caused
 by another program or the Werfault process itself is corrupted due to a security threat. Let’s try these steps and check what is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are receiving the WerFault.exe error while performing other tasks also, then you may try performing a SFC scan on the computer
 which would scan for corrupt system files on the computer and replace them.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted

<h2>            Windows 10 is the biggest mistake of my life</h2>
                    I paid good money for my computer and it had everything I was looking for,but since upgrading to windows 10 nothing is working right! Microsoft wants me to pay for an app to watch my dvd's and I feel like I am being ripped off because I already had this
 option for free. Upgrading to Windows 10 was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life. I would love to be able to go back to Windows 7, but it is too late! I will never trust Microsoft again!

<br />Let's check if somehow Photos app got the .pdf file association for other types of files it opens.  Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps to check that Photo Viewer is set to Photos app.  Then go to Set Default by Apps to confirm Photos app is set as Default there, too.  Finally under Set Default by File Type choose any file types that are wrongly opening to open from the Photos app or Explorer.  
<br />
<br />If this doesn't help was there anything else that was done before this problem arose?  If so I would reverse it.  You can also try to  System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If those don't fix it then go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Photos app &gt; Advanced Options  and choose Reset to reset the App.
<br />
<br />If that fails reinstall the app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            OK, that is the old WIndows 7 photo viewer that is hidden in Windows 10, not the Photos app.  Is your Photos app fixed yet?  Did you try the re-register from option two here?  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>

<p>Hi KJ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to narrow it down and provide you the proper resolution, may we know if you have installed any software applications or changed any hardware devices to your device prior to the concern?<br />
<br />
When did you start encountering the issue? <br />
Any changes made on your computer prior to the issue?<br />
Have you tried any possible troubleshooting steps? If yes, what are those steps and did you get any error messages?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>I am having a similar issue.&nbsp; Started today, 23 August.&nbsp; In my pictures folder I cannot double click on a photo and have it open up.&nbsp; I can click on "run a program" and it works with the different programs. I just like being bale to double click and it opens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error states that it cannot locate the jpeg file.&nbsp; Roughly, Windows cannot find C:\Users (path) (Folder) (name.jpeg).&nbsp; Make sure you typed the name correctly and try again.&nbsp;

<p>

<h2>            error 0xc000021a</h2>
                    Hello, I have had an Acer Aspire E1 Windows 8 for a little over a month now, and recently it performed an automatic Windows Update. After the computer started, it would not work, and said my PC had a problem along with showing this error code: 0xc000021a.
 I have tried restarting it multiple times, and have even tried refreshing my PC. None of these methods have seemed to work. I have looked at other posts, and people keep saying to using some sort of repair DVD, however, this version of my laptop does not have
 a DVD/optic drive. I would like help immediately and am very upset that this problem has occured when it was an automatic update that I had no control over. Thank you.

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with Acer Support, their on-line documentation, diagnostics, and ask in their
</p>
<p>forums about any known issues. This&nbsp;can be&nbsp;a hardware issue -&nbsp;involving the hard
<br />
drive or its cabling - though it can be the motherboard or other hardware. <strong>
As OEM</strong><br />
<strong>Acer is responsible for both the hardware and Windows so regardless of CAUSE<br />
it is theirs to fix.</strong> Especially true on a month old computer.<br />

<strong>STOP: 0xC000021A<br />
<br />
Bug Check 0xC000021A: STATUS_SYSTEM_PROCESS_TERMINATED<br />
<br />
</strong>The STATUS_SYSTEM_PROCESS_TERMINATED bug check has a value of 0xC000021A. This means that an error has occurred in a crucial user-mode subsystem.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code</strong> <br />
<br />
If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call the
 manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">Contact Support</font></a>.<br />
<br />
If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article

<br />
These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>

<p><strong>Cause</strong> <br />
<br />
This error occurs when a user-mode subsystem, such as WinLogon or the Client Server Run-Time Subsystem (CSRSS), has been fatally compromised and security can no longer be guaranteed. In response, the operating system switches to kernel mode. Microsoft Windows
 cannot run without WinLogon or CSRSS. Therefore, this is one of the few cases where the failure of a user-mode service can shut down the system.<br />
<br />
Mismatched system files can also cause this error. This can occur if you have restored your hard disk from a backup. Some backup programs might skip restoring system files that they determine are in use.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution <br />
<br />
</strong>Running the kernel debugger is not useful in this situation because the actual error occurred in a user-mode process.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving an error in a user-mode device driver, system service, or third-party application:</strong> Because bug check 0xC000021A occurs in a user-mode process, the most common culprits are third-party applications. If the error occurred after the
 installation of a new or updated device driver, system service, or third-party application, the new software should be removed or disabled. Contact the manufacturer of the software about a possible update.
<br />
<br />
If the error occurs during system startup, restart your computer, and press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices. At the resulting Windows
<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu, choose the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time. If this does not resolve the error, try manually removing the offending
 software. If the system partition is formatted with file allocation table (FAT), use an MS-DOS startup disk to gain access to the computer's hard disk. If the system partition is formatted with NTFS file system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename
 or delete the faulty software. If the faulty software is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you need to start the computer using the Recovery Console in order to access the file. If a newly installed piece if hardware is suspected, remove
 it to see if this resolves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try running the Emergency Recovery Disk (ERD) and allow the system to repair any errors that it detects.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving a mismatched system file problem:</strong> If you have recently restored your hard disk from a backup, check if there is an updated version of the Backup/Restore program available from the manufacturer. Make sure the latest Windows Service
 Pack is installed. <br />

<p>The layout is fine. The problem is the forum has now become a shadow of its former self. Navigation is dreadful. I have to click on loads of numbers to get to the last page of a thread. Quoting has been made more complicated, new posters wont even know it
 exists. I used to be able to discuss and debate all sorts, now its just dead. Regression and change for changes sake is not a good move. I suspect many will go to the unofficial forums for some good debate, active community and basic forum functions that make
 sense.</p>

<p>If they had ONLY changed the laiout but left all the old features like "My forums" (Not the new useless one mind you) and standard buttons for quote and edit, I'd have actually liked the change.</p>
