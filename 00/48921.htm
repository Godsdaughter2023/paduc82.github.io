<h2>            Internet stops working, task manager crashes</h2>
                    My laptop which I bought last Christmas has been acting up, every week or two the internet driver stops working then when I open task manager it gets stuck and freezes. I tried disabling the wireless driver but that didn't work and network troubleshooter
 doesn't work. I have to shut it down but then while shutting down it must freeze after the screen goes blank and that makes me force shut it down. By the way I'm on windows 10 but this also occurred on windows 8, any ideas? And id rather not restore my computer.

            Its a hp 15 r011na and I'm just using windows defender as an antivirus because my other one kept blocking a program I needed to use. And this has been happening for months now and as far as I'm aware no software changes have been made.

            The problem has kind of escalated now... It now automatic repairs diagnoses and says your pc did not start correctly. Now I've been looking for ways to fix this and I cant use my bios due to a broken down key.

            Hi Jimmy, please try this:
<br />
<br />1.
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />If you need to create a Recovery USB:
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool

            Hello,
<br />
<br />If Automatic repair fails, use Advanced options &gt; Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />Try repairing boot records:

    <title>Screen lock time - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Screen lock time</h2>
                    <p><strong>Scope</strong></p>
<p>I have searched and searched for a solution on this issue and have found one that works but the settings do not stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Description and research</strong></p>
<p>I have 2 Windows 10 upgraded computers that the accounts lock out after only one minute. This is a domain environment with a 30 minute lockout time. The settings on the local systems reflect this except in registry under:
<span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\InactivityTimeoutSecs it goes back to 708 sec. This registry setting is the one that, if I change to 0 sec, fixes the issue but it continues to return to 708
<span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System\InactivityTimeoutSecs it goes back to 708 sec. This registry setting is the one that, if I change to 0 sec, fixes the issue but it continues to return to 708
 sec.<br />
</span>Trust me, have changed all power settings, sleep settings, screen saver settings, and unattended sleep settings and this registry setting is the only one that returns results, for a day.... then it returns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know why this setting changes back to 708 sec (11.8 minutes) even though the domain is set to 30 minutes and I manually change it to 0 sec.</p>

<h2>            Why battlefield bad company 2 crash after intros on windows 10 after installed new copy of windows 10 &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I had windows 10 home for long time. And battlefield bad company was working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I decided to delete the windows 10 on C: and install a new clean windows 10 again.</p>
<p>I used the media tool file by microsoft and made a usb bootable.</p>
<p>Then installed the windows 10 home again from the usb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted the C:&nbsp;partition and created a new one.</p>
<p>The installation all went fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated the windows 10 with all the updates. I have the latest video drivers (Geforce gtx 770 nvidia).</p>
<p>But after installed battlefield bad company 2 with steam two problems happened:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When running the game it's running the intros videos in the start but before it's loading the main menu the game crash back to window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. There is no folder name BFBC2 inside documents and no settings.ini searched for it the entire pc it's not exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried everything I can think of. Re installed the directx over again and the visual++ thing</p>
<p>And updated the punkbuster and ested and everything is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changed the BFBC2Game.exe compatibility to run as windows 7 ad moded window as admin nothing helped so far.</p>
<p>Tried to search in google I saw many many others with the same problem. They tried&nbsp; re install windows and the game nothing helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a known issue why microsoft don't fix it or look over it ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is not with the game. The game was working fine yesterday and the last year.&nbsp; Thep roblem started after making new clean installation of the windows 10 home.</p>

<p><em>"It's a known issue why microsoft don't fix it or look over it ?"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>For several reasons. The main one being the issues in not due to Windows, and the game is not a MS product.</p>
<p>- Yes, the games issue is probably is well known, as are most problems, and it may have only started since you reinstalled Windows, but that
</p>
<p>problem is not caused by Windows directly, or everyone running Win10 would have problems with the game.</p>
<p>There must be something in your Windows setup or the game has corrupted files that has created the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- What prompted you to reformat and reinstall Win10 ? Were you having problems with Windows or games at the time ?</p>
<p>You mentioned all Windows updates ( Win10 v1809 ? ). This includes downloading and installing all motherboard drivers ?</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Also, the game is nine years old, so if there were still a bug in the game EA Dice would not bother fixing it either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"When running the game it's running the intros videos in the start but before it's loading the main menu the game crash back to window."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- I'm not clear if you are speaking of the splash screens or the intro video. On my game the setup screen comes up before the intro</p>
<p>video (landing on the beach). If the game is crashing before the setup menu's show I would think the games install is corrupt, as</p>
<p>your graphics card would not be doing any real work at this point.</p>
<p>- Have you used Steams <em>Verify Integrity of Game Files</em> tool ? Have you installed other games from Steam that are not having problems ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Did you download your Nvidia drivers from the Nvidia site, or use Windows updates or Device Manager to install them (not advisable) ?</p>
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NVIDIA Driver Downloads - Advanced Search</a>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"There is no folder name BFBC2 inside documents and no settings.ini searched for it the entire pc it's not exist."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Yes, my non-Steam version of the game should automatically create a BFBC2 sub-folder in your Documents folder when you launch it,</p>
<p>and I guess the Steam version does as well if this is where the folder was with your Steam version prior to reinstalling Win10.</p>
<p>However, most games downloaded from Steam keep these files in the <em>Steam\UserData</em> folder (the number for BFBC2 is 249260) .</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your previous install of the game was prior to a Win10 upgrade from Win7/8/8.1, I wonder if&nbsp; the location may have</p>
<p>changed to the&nbsp; Steam\UserData folder after reinstalling Win10 and Steam ?<br />
</p>
<p>btw - I'm not using any Compatibility options with this game ( very few games benefit from Compatibility with older versions of Windows</p>
<p>and those that do are the same games that did on Win7 ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>"<span>What prompted you to reformat and reinstall Win10 ? Were you having problems with Windows or games at the time ?</span>"</p>
<p>The reason is that I had too much stuff installed on the pc on C: everything was working fine I just wanted to make a clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When running winver I see: Version 1809 (OS Build 17763.292) Home</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>&nbsp;</span><span>This includes downloading and installing all motherboard drivers ?</span>"</p>
<p>I didn't download or installed motherboard drivers I only installed the window updates when installed and after it checked for updates untill there are any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>I'm not clear if you are speaking of the splash screens or the intro video</span>"</p>
<p>I'm talking about the splash screen.&nbsp; I'm not getting to the main menu the crash is right when the splash screen end and it should load the main menu. Then I hear some kind of a sound not a beep but a very short sound and it crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>Did you download your Nvidia drivers from the Nvidia site,</span>"</p>
<p>From the Nvidia site. THe US version for my card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>Steam\UserData</em><span>&nbsp;folder</span>"
</p>
<p>In my case it's 9046546 but nothing inside about bfbc2.&nbsp; And no settings.ini</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last time I re installed window over again was the same way I did it now if I remember it right:</p>
<p>I have a 32GB usb made it bootable downloaded the microsoft media creation tool and then installed it from the usb.</p>
<p>I deleted the C:&nbsp;partition and created a new one and windows installed fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last thing I tried few minutes ago was running window in safe mode without network drivers just safe mode and tried to run the game and the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to disable the windows defender firewall but it didn't solve it either.</p>

<p><em>"In my case it's 9046546 but nothing inside about bfbc2.&nbsp; And no settings.ini"</em></p>
<p>- That would be the main folder. The games are all in their own sub-folder with the Steam ID number for that game.</p>
<p>- However, if the game is not getting past the splash screens it may not be creating the folder whether that be in Documents or UserData.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Are other games working ?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I didn't download or installed motherboard drivers "</em></p>
<p>- You should always install the most recent available motherboard drivers from the mfg of the motherboard after doing a clean</p>
<p>install of Windows.</p>
<p>Don't rely on the generic drivers supplied by MS via Windows updates or Device Manager.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have not done a BIOS update that may also help (coincidently I had an GTX770 which failed, and when I got the RMA card</p>
<p>back from EVGA I had to reinstall my BIOS to get the new card to work. I expect the original BIOS got corrupted when the first</p>
<p>770 failed catastrophically. The second card was a dud too. Ran games well, but had a problem with the power regulator which</p>
<p>caused random crashing to different coloured screens when there was no load on the card. Finally died after a couple of years.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Last thing I tried few minutes ago was running window in safe mode without network drivers just safe mode and tried to</em>
</p>
<p><em>run the game and the same problem."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- If a game pops up a Window suggesting to run in 'Safe mode' it may be OK to try because it's not the 'real' Safe Mode,</p>
<p>but when you boot Windows into Safe Mode the graphics, and many other drivers are disabled so your graphics card will not function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- I know it's common to suggest that installing a 'clean' version of Windows is best practice, and that may be true if your Windows</p>
<p>is totally and irreparably borked, but if your Windows is running well... Don't.</p>
<p>It's a waste of time, and could lead to issues such as what you are facing now.It takes many hours to reinstall software/games and get your Windows settings back the way you had them, and for nothing, imo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you feel a need to 'refresh' Windows, just do a 'repair' reinstall. This will sort out most issues that may be difficult to troubleshoot.
</p>
<p>Thing is... MS does a huge version update of Win10 twice a year which overwrites much of Windows, and when that is done your 'clean' Windows is one of two things. It's either been cleaned up again by the update, or the update has made it clean no more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean install on a spare SSD as an experiment a few months ago and there was no performance gain vs my Win10 which was</p>
<p>upgraded from a Win7 I installed in Jan 2010. </p>
<p>Even though I spent half the day doing the install and getting the basic stuff setup, couldn't be bothered using</p>
<p>it because there would have been so much more stuffing around (I have about 200 games and a fair bit of other software).</p>

<h2>            Updates in Windows 10 Update download but don&#39;t install</h2>
                    My Windows 10 downloads the updates but when I go into Details in the Updates in Settings they are all sitting there as "Waiting to Install". I've tried Restart and also Shutdown and starting up but they never install. How do I get them to install?

    <title>xbox 360 bricked due to system update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sgtsativa73  say:</h3>
<h2>            xbox 360 bricked due to system update</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well folks, Microsoft is up to the same old tricks! 9/3/2014 I accepted a system update from Microsoft on my xbox360 s 4g&nbsp;console and it complete bricked the console. It turns on, but that's about it. Cannot log in. The console does not boot up.
 All I get is an error message telling me to reinstall my hard drive to complete the update.&nbsp;4174-417F-B780-0F00-C000-007B&nbsp;I have. It didn't work. I have removed the 320g hd and tried to start the console without the hd installed. Same&nbsp;error message.&nbsp;I have
 been on the phone with customer support for the last 3 days to find out,&nbsp;that yes my console&nbsp;does need repair and&nbsp;they want to charge me $79.99 or $99.99 to repair a problem that never existed before I accepted Microsoft's mandatory system update. To compound
 the problem, Microsoft's computer system they use for customer service has conveniently denied my repeated attempts to pay for said repair, saying I entered my information wrong. The card is good, I checked with the bank. There is money in the account, I checked
 with the bank. I was also informed&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;cannot use paypal to attempt this payment. I am being told&nbsp;by Microsoft that they&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;do anything if the system wont accept my card info. So to recap, I accepted a mandatory system update that complete bricked
 my previously flawlessly working xbox360 s console and Microsoft is saying there is nothing they can do. Anyone else having this problem? Please email me at

            This does not seem to be a Server 2003 problem but an XP problem. I can login to the domain from a good station with the same ID &amp; PW and I can login from the bad station with the network cable unplugged. What would this have to do spcifically with Server
 2003? It would seem any domain controller would exhibit the same issue if the cable is unplugged at the station.

            <p>Palcouk has made the preferred suggestions.&nbsp;An alternative&nbsp;way <span>to identify what loads when you boot use Autoruns (freeware from Microsoft).<br />
</span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>With Autoruns you can uncheck an item, which disables it from starting, or you can right click an item and then delete it. If you uncheck you can recheck to re-enable the item. It is a much safer approach than editing the Registry and better than using
 msconfig.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A useful feature of the programme is that you can right click an item and select Search Online to get information about the item selected.</span></p>

            That's a Fake Virus scam which can emanate from a mistyped URL it occupies.  If you have a shortcut for Favorite/Bookmark of the site be sure to delete it.  It may have also set itself as your Home page or be lodged in your Browser Add-Ons or Extensions so you'll want to check there and run the scanners I give below.
<br />
<br />Close the Browser window using whichever method is necessary, as it cannot escape the browser unless you download something from the page.  
<br />
<br />If you cannot close the browser window, right click the Task Bar or press Ctrl + Alt + Delete keys to open the Task Manager, choose Show Less Details, highlight the browser and choose End Task. 
<br />
<br />If this fails hold the power button to Shut Down.  If you do this Edge may reload the page when it starts back up, but it will also give you an option to Start Fresh to avoid opening the previous tabs.  
<br />
<br />Also in Edge, if you try to X out of the browser WIndow, it may present a dialogue box to end the session.  The webpage is allowed to put text in the box but cannot stop it from closing the Windows when you choose OK, so that is safe to do.  
<br />
<br />If you called the scammers and they installed anything on your PC, open Settings&gt;Apps &amp; Features, choose Sort by Date, uninstall anything on that date you didn't install yourself. Then run a full scan with Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner.   In MB settings tell it to search for rootkits. You can turn off the trial version later in it's Account Settings.
<br /><a href="http://filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti_malware/tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a>
<br />
<br />Clean up anything found.  If you are seriously infected with Trojans or Rootkits that show up again when you re-run the scan after cleaning, post back for further instructions.   
<br />
<br />If you paid them anything, notify your bank that you were scammed.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<p>Dirt Rally (digital) doesn't start (title splashes for two seconds then it goes back to dashboard's start page), so I tried to uninstall the game, but nothing happens. I press "Uninstall", but game can't be removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i've tried already to solve the problem:</p>
<p>1) removed and set my xbox account again;</p>
<p>2) removed local save game</p>

<p>Hello Gepards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your question. Being that the game wont uninstall even after some troubleshooting, you can try a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
full factory reset</a>. You will select remove everything, this will remove all installed games from the console. All save data is saved to the cloud so you will not lose any of that data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p><span>Hi Sankar,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums. We are here to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You have mentioned that you have received the error: “No Mapping between account names and Security Id was done” after you tried changing the administrative
 username and you would like to know why this has happened. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The reason you are getting the "No mapping between account names and security IDs was done" is either because you now have an orphaned user account.
 This occurred when you deleted or renamed your old user name which was still in use by the system as each user name has a unique SID or it may be due to a corrupted user profile.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve this you may need to fix the corrupted user profile. For this, you need to create a new admin account and copy all the data from the corrupted

            Thanks a lot Rajesh
<div>It really helps!</div>
<div>Unfortunately, the new account I have added on step 1, was not visible in File Explorer before restart and I've decided to copy the profile files after restart.</div>
<div>I successfully logged in with the new name. The problem is that the old account was only one with administrator permissions. So now I can't access the old account folder. Even more, I can't create an administrator account anymore. Is there any way to recover/create/add
 administrator permissions to this or any other account?&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have Microsoft Account, but it also mapped to the old (un-accessible) Windows account :(</div>
<div>Switching back to the old user account is not possible now</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your support</div>

            <p>Rajesh,&nbsp; hope you are receiving this as this is old posting.&nbsp; What would have been called for is an explanation of how entering your live account was going to be used tied to your O/S user profile during install and a clearer means to opt out! That not being
 the case, I was a good little user and provided Win10 what it asked for and later&nbsp; made the fatal mistake of changing the&nbsp;cryptic users folder name donri to match the user name driley matching my other windows7 based machines.&nbsp; Had I known all was needed was
 to unlink my Microsoft live account and how to do so prior to steps needed to migrate to a new user profile life would be good.
</p>
<p>Instead, I am trying your recommendation in this thread and at the point of copying old username directory contents and noticed the existence of additional and variations of&nbsp;files in the root directory to be exempted from the copy along with:</p>
<p><strong>•Ntuser.dat<br />
</strong><span><strong>•Ntuser.dat.log</strong></span><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><strong><span>•Ntuser.ini</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming that the Ntuser.dat.log1 and log2 variants would also be excluded from the copy (please confirm), and the additional files Ntuser,dat(*UUID?).TM.bif and Ntuser.dat*regtrans-ms created and used apparently when new user accounts or changes to
 the user specific registry hive are made to avoid registry corruption should be excluded as well to avoid copying over settings that potentially would cause corruption similar to problems that required the need to perform these steps in the first place. Thanks
 in advance for your response.</p>

<h2>            HP Laserjet 1000 with 64 bit version of Windows 7</h2>
                    I've searched both microsoft updates and the HP website for drivers to make this (hp laserjet 1000) printer work with Windows 7 but I've had no luck.&nbsp; Is there a way to make this work?&nbsp; Maybe some post script drivers or something?&nbsp; This printer works great
 but now my mom is stuck with buying a new printer because of her new OS.<br />
<br />
If you need more details please ask.&nbsp; Thanks Dan.
