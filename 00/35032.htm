<h2>            Several Assassin&#39;s Creed Brotherhood Story Acheivements Never Unlocked</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Playing Assassin's Creed The Ezio Collection - Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, and just completed the game and got the achievement&nbsp;ACB | Il Principe (Receive 100% synch in&nbsp;ACB&nbsp;and full synch in all missions of&nbsp;The Da Vinci Disappearance). I&nbsp;went through the achievement list for the game under my profile and noticed that several of the story related achievements never&nbsp;unlocked. Specifically,&nbsp;Vittoria Agli Assassini (Complete DNA Sequence 8),&nbsp;Requiescat In Pace (Complete DNA Sequence 9),&nbsp;A Knife to the Heart (Secure the&nbsp;Apple of Eden), and&nbsp;Boom! (Destroy the&nbsp;Bomber). I have tried replaying the levels and the achievements still have not unlocked.&nbsp;I have also done the troubleshooting steps listed here:&nbsp;<a href="https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/88E985A3-4139-430C-9400-93771D0C1004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/88E985A3-4139-430C-9400-93771D0C1004

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Non-responsive desktop shortcuts may be the result of several problems. Previous changes made on the PC may attribute to the issue at hand. Can you recall any changes made on the PC prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you check for corrupted Windows system files. System File Checker (SFC) is a utility in Windows that scans for corrupted Windows system files. If it finds a problem, it will try to replace the problematic system files from
 a cached version that’s on your PC. If SFC can’t replace the files, the Deployment Image Service and Management Tool (DISM) can check the corrupted files then download and replace the files through Windows Update.<br />
</p>
<br />
To run System File Checker (SFC), follow these steps:
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>command </strong><strong>prompt</strong>, press and hold (or right-click)
<strong>Command </strong><strong>Prompt</strong>, then select <strong>Run as administrator</strong> &gt;
<strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>At the command prompt, type <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> (note the space between sfc and the /). Scanning will take a few minutes.</li><li>Do one of the following, depending on the results of the scan:
<ul>
<li>If SFC finds corrupted files and replaces them, restart your PC and check if the issue persists.</li><li>If SFC doesn’t find corrupted files or finds corrupted files but can’t replace them, try using the Deployment Image Service and Management Tool (DISM).</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>For more info about System File Checker, see <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

To use the Deployment Image Service and Management Tool (DISM), follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>command prompt</strong>, press and hold (or right-click)
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then select <strong>Run as administrator</strong> &gt;
<strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>At the command prompt, type <strong>dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong> (note the space between dism.exe and / and each switch (/)).</li><li>If DISM finds corrupted files and replaces them, restart your PC and check if the issue persists.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You need to be connected to the Internet to use DISM, and it might take several minutes to finish.<br />

<h2>            HP support says update caused my printer to not work with Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; HP Support remotely looked through my computer&nbsp;settings and said that because my wifi enabled Samsung C410W color laser was firmware updated (with or without my knowledge), it will now not work with my win 7 computer.&nbsp; I
 have to either purchase Win 10 or buy a different printer as the firmware cannot be reversed to older firmware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not certain i believe HP support as they kept offering Windows 10 at different prices, even calling me back with a lower price!</p>
<p>&nbsp; If this is the case it is even far worse than what Apple and Samsung&nbsp;were just fined millions for in Europe, to do with the update to cause old phones to run slower.&nbsp;</p>
<p>he was correct about the date it stopped working when he said when the update was pushed, about 13 days ago. But it is also odd that it happened the same day I opened the cartridge&nbsp;side to give the black a shake as it was low and streaky. Even more odd is
 that the message it gives me is an incompatible&nbsp;cartridge, as they are all original from Samsung&nbsp;that came with the printer! And that its not for the black, started out the error was for the magenta and cyan, now also including yellow. But not the black.&nbsp;
 And yes I did try taking them all out and powering&nbsp;off multiple times and putting back in properly......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what the hell is with this issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>This wouldn't be the first time that an HP printer firmware update caused a major problem (more details below), but I think you're right to be skeptical of the statements you received from HP support.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>It's generally possible to install an older firmware version over a newer version.&nbsp; Unfortunately, however, Samsung doesn't seem inclined to help with this.&nbsp; See the last post in this thread:&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/forums/discussions/samsung-firmware-uninstall-327078/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.cnet.com/forums/discussions/samsung-firmware-uninstall-327078/</a>&nbsp; Of course, this was before HP bought Samsung's printer business, but still, it's not encouraging.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I assume that this is your printer:&nbsp; Samsung Xpress SL-C410W Color Laser Printer (<a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/swdetails/samsung-xpress-sl-c410-color-laser-printer-series/17157201/model/17157203/swItemId/fp-194897-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/swdetails/samsung-xpress-sl-c410-color-laser-printer-series/17157201/model/17157203/swItemId/fp-194897-2</a>).&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I downloaded the firmware package from that site and read the Release Notes. &nbsp; First of all, note that the website itself says that the firmware package is to be used with Windows XP through Windows 10, both 32- and 64-bit systems, as well as a slew of Mac
 OS versions.&nbsp; The notion that this update would cause the printer to not work with Windows 7 sounds like nonsense to me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>The firmware update package includes version 3.00.02.20.&nbsp; The first step in the Release Notes (which also don't say anything about not working with Windows 7) is to determine the firmware version actually installed.&nbsp; You should do this:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><ol>
<li>Make sure that the printer is connected to the PC with a USB cable</li><li>Press and hold 'Cancel' button for about 2seconds until the green LED blinks slowly, and then release it.</li></ol>
<p>This will print a Configuration Report that will indicate your firmware version.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>The Release Notes include these warnings: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The firmware update you are about to install has been tested for compatibility with Samsung toner cartridge products ONLY.<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Installing The upgrade may cause a non-Samsung toner cartridge to malfunction.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Passing all of the above, what are the specific symptoms you have that led you to conclude that the printer doesn't work with Windows 7?&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>If it's the "incompatible cartridge" message, that's exactly what I was referring to in the first sentence above.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>HP was forced to issue a firmware update that fixed the "non-HP cartridge" issue, but unfortunately for you, this was for certain HP printers only.&nbsp; See
<a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2017/09/14/hp-pushes-third-party-ink-blocking-printer-firmware-update-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.ghacks.net/2017/09/14/hp-pushes-third-party-ink-blocking-printer-firmware-update-again/</a> (read the comments, too) and
<a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/hp-officejet-pro-8610-e-all-in-one-printer-series/5367603/model/5367606/document/c05308850/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>If you still have the cartridges that came with the printer, perhaps they don't incorporate the chip that HP now checks to determine whether the cartridges are "genuine."&nbsp; It's possible that new genuine HP cartridges will solve the problem, but given the
 expense of laser color toner, I wouldn't go out and buy them until you get a definitive answer from HP.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>All I can suggest is the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><ul>
<li>call HP support and persist in escalating the issue until you get to the bottom of it.&nbsp; Point out that the firmware update on HP's own support site says that the firmware will work with Windows 7.&nbsp; If they finally admit that the firmware update is checking
 for non-HP cartridges, ask for the firmware fix corresponding to the one linked above.</li><li>you can also post in HP's own support forums <a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Samsung/bd-p/Samsung" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Changing the order in which pictures appear in a photo album in windows 10.</h2>
                    I am making an album of a holiday I went on and using my and my friends pictures.&nbsp; My have the correct date of 2017 but she forgot to change the date on her camera and her pictures say they were taken in 2016.&nbsp; When making the album, when I add a 2016
 picture of something and then want to add as my next photo a 2017 picture of the same something it will not let me put them side by side.&nbsp; It puts the 2017 picture below the 2016 one and it is like windows 10 is making two albums inside the one album.&nbsp; Can
 I change the date on the 2016 pictures? How can I get around this?

<p>Hi Debbie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Photos are sorted depending on when they were created. If a photo was taken in 2016, it will be put under 2016. You can check the photos' properties and try to edit the details of each photo but it is unlikely that you can. There is no way to edit the details
 on most files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you can try to do is to create a new copy of those photos so that the created date on the photos will be up-to-date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated.</p>

<p>Thanks.&nbsp; You told me what I suspected but I was looking for confirmation or hopefully an answer that showed me how to sort pictures differently. You said to try and create a new copy of these photos but when I click on the photo and copy I don't see anywhere
 in my collection where the copy has gone and there is not a copy and paste feature offered.&nbsp; So forgive my ignorance as I am not well versed in using a computer but how would I copy these photos and if successful would they not show the date I copied them
 and then I would be back to the same problem. Trying to put older date and newer date pictures together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have another question for a first timer.&nbsp; I want to put my photo album in windows 10 onto a USB stick.&nbsp; How do I do that? Would it be possible to change the order of the photos in the album when I go to put them on a USB stick?&nbsp; Thanks for all your
 help.</p>

<p>Are you using the Photos app in Windows 10? Because if you are, there is no other way to sort the photos but by date, although, in File Explorer, you have the option to sort your photos by
<strong>name</strong>, <strong>date</strong>, <strong>file type</strong>, <strong>
file size</strong>, and <strong>tags</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>File Explorer</strong> is where you can access all of the documents on your PC and this is where you can create copies of your photos as well. On the taskbar, click on the folder icon, and then under
<strong>Quick access</strong>, select <strong>Pictures</strong>. This is where you'll find photos that show up in the Photos app unless you have selected a different source folder which you can verify by going into the
<strong>Photos </strong>app, and then selecting <strong>Folders</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the workaround that we suggested in the previous reply, here's what you need to do:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>File Explorer</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Pictures</strong>.</li><li>Create a folder specifically for your holiday pictures.</li><li>Go back to the <strong>Pictures </strong>folder where your 2016 holiday pictures are located,

copy</strong>.</li><li>Now go back to the folder you created in step 3, <strong>right-click </strong>
on the empty space, and then select <strong>Paste</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The steps above copies the photos and will be dated November 2017, however, please do note that this is only a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to address your question regarding the backup, yes you can put your photos onto a USB stick, however, as mentioned above, there is a limitation on how your photos will be sorted. What you can do instead is to create folders for every event or date of

<p>Yes I am using the Photo apps in Windows 10.&nbsp; I did what you suggested above but the same problem exists because the copied 2016 pictures are now dated November 2017 and my copied 2017 pictures are still being shown as September and October 2017 and&nbsp; therefore
 my pictures are being shown before the newly dated November 2017 pictures and for some reason they cannot be sorted side by side to get a continuous album of the entire holiday. It still wants to do two different albums according to date.&nbsp; Extremely frustrating
 as I thought Windows 10 Photo app would have had this capability.&nbsp; Surely I am not the only one with this problem.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I also have a second question - how do I download
 this album that I made from windows 10 photo app onto a USB stick so I can give the other person a copy of the album?</p>

<p>As we have mentioned in our previous reply, sorting photos in the Photos app is limited to being sorted by date. If the timestamp on the photos vary, then they cannot be sorted side-by-side. The only workaround we can provide is to create copies of the photos
 to somehow manipulate the date on the photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Copying the photos onto a USB needs to be done manually. Because you are using a storage device, you need to create a specific folder to organize the photos. Once you are able to open the USB on your computer,
<strong>right-click</strong> on an empty space, select <strong>New</strong>, and then name the folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have the folder ready, follow the steps below on how to copy the photos:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Photos </strong>app.</li><li>Go to the album that you want to copy.</li><li>Click on <strong>Select </strong>to select all photos in the album.<br />

<br />
</li><li>Click on the <strong>Copy </strong>icon on the top-right of the window, or press
<strong>Ctrl + C</strong>.<br />

</li><li>Open the folder you created in the USB.</li><li><strong>Right-click</strong> on an empty space, and then select <strong>Paste</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Transferring files can be done either by copying them or dragging them to a new location.</p>

<div>I need a replacement COA, mine has peeled up.&nbsp; I have a laptop and the COA on the bottom is unreadable.&nbsp; The system has NO problems and I know that as a OEM version it doesn't require activation but the problem is that I can't prove my Windows legitimacy.
 Just trying to fix the problem before it is one.&nbsp; I contacted ACER and they don't replace the key labels.&nbsp; I saw somewhere that I could do the phone maze and get a replacement label from MS if I give them 10.00 an the key from my windows installation but does
 anyone know if this is true?&nbsp; <br />
Again, I'm not seeking a NEW PRODUCT KEY.&nbsp; I'm just trying to have the LABEL. <br />

<p>That does not fix the problem. &nbsp;Obviously, something is broken, but support refuses to help. &nbsp;

<h2>            Cursor gestures with trackpad locks screen</h2>
                    <p>We have a couple of Surfaces running Windows 8 in our organization, on our domain. When the systems were added to the domain, I had to go into the registry to turn on the Precision Touchpad on the detachable keyboard that came with the device, as our domain's
 policies (set up for Windows 7 machines) had overridden its use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of our users has come to me complaining that the her screen is locking seemingly randomly when she is using the Surface. I've narrowed the problem down to the track pad. Nearly every other re-positioning of the cursor by means of the track pad causes
 Windows to lock and the user will need to unlock the computer to continue working. This often happens several times in succession.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keyboard and touchscreen navigation appear to work normally and without issue. I've disabled the trackpad temporarily, but this does not provide a viable longterm solution. Does anyone have a suggestion as to how to fix this?</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here's my standard message on this subject:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>First, note that you should be concerned with *all* programs that</div>
<div>start automatically, not just with those that go into the system tray.</div>
<div>Not all autostarting programs manifest themselves by an icon in the</div>
<div>tray.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>On each program you don't want to start automatically, check its</div>
<div>Options to see if it has the choice not to start (make sure you</div>
<div>actually choose the option not to run it, not just a "don't show icon"</div>
<div>option). Many can easily and best be stopped that way. If that doesn't</div>
<div>work, run MSCONFIG from the Start | Run line, and on the Startup tab,</div>
<div>uncheck the programs you don't want to start automatically.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, if I were you, I wouldn't do this just for the purpose of</div>
<div>running the minimum number of programs. Despite what many people tell</div>
<div>you, you should be concerned, not with how *many* of these programs</div>
<div>you run, but *which*. Some of them can hurt performance severely, but</div>
<div>others have no effect on performance.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Don't just stop programs from running willy-nilly. What you should do</div>
<div>is determine what each program is, what its value is to you, and what</div>
<div>the cost in performance is of its running all the time. You can try</div>
<div>google searches and ask about specifics here.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Once you have that information, you can make an intelligent informed</div>
<div>decision about what you want to keep and what you want to get rid of.</div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            When you try to open a Control Panel applet you see a message like this:<br />
<br />
Control Panel<br />
Windows cannot find 'C:\WINDOWS\system32\rundll32.exe'.&nbsp; Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again.&nbsp; To search for a file, click the Start button, and then click Search.<br />
<br />
Since the rundll32.exe file is one of the 3498 files that Windows File Protection looks after, it should never be missing.<br />
<br />
If the file is really missing, it was probably quarantined (effectively deleted) by your unspecified antivirus or antimalware program you are using on your system of unspecified make and model with unspecified operating system and Service Pack (thank MS Answers
 for that).<br />
<br />
You might want to reconsider whatever antivirus or antimalware programs you are using and whether or not they are effective for protecting your system.<br />
<br />
You can look in the c:\windows\system32 folder and see if the file is really missing or not, and if you find that it is missing, you must replace it somehow.<br />
<br />
It is a proven fact that running sfc /scannow will not help you and it will not replace the missing file.&nbsp; That is not what sfc /scannow does, that is not how it works and that is not what it is for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is too bad the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer
 "experts" do not know how SFC works.<br />
<br />
Since the file is one of the 3498 protected files that XP cares about, there should be a backup copy of the file on your system in some other folders.&nbsp; You should do what the message says and search for the file, but often the backup copy has been deleted too.<br />
<br />
Click the Start button, Search, For Files and Folders... and in the search box enter:<br />
<br />
rundll32.exe<br />
<br />
The click the Search button to search you hard drive(s) for a copy of the missing file.<br />
<br />
If you search your system and find another copy, it may not be the correct version, so only use the copies (if you find one) from either of these folders.<br />
<br />
You can manually look and see if there is a copy of the missing file in these folders:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache<br />
c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386<br />
<br />
If you find a copy someplace else, <i>don't use it</i> - they could be old copies that were made from an XP update.<br />
<br />
If you do find a copy of the file in one of those two folders (only those two), copy and paste it into the c:\windows\system32 folder where it belongs.<br />
<br />
Respond in the affirmative if asked to overwrite the existing file.<br />
<br />
Test your Control Panel options now and be sure they work, then reboot your system and make sure the Control Panel options still work.<br />
<br />
If you can't find a copy of the file on your system, you can download one from my SkyDrive and replace the missing file.<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
<br />
I uploaded a copy of the XP Pro SP3 file you need to my SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing files).<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my SkyDrive and you can look for the file you need there:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311</a><br />
<br />
You can download it and when you do, put a copy of the file in these folders (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (that is where XP keeps backup copies of important files).<br />
<br />
When you see the files available for download, you may not see the file extension (.exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.), but when you download them they will have the correct extension.<br />
<br />
When you download the file (especially if you use Internet Explorer), when you get a chance to save the file, your browser may not save the file with an extension (like .exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.) so you will have to manually add the proper extension
 to the file when you download the file before you save it.<br />
<br />
You can download the file with no extension and then rename the file to add the proper extension.&nbsp; You don't want to try to use a file called
<b>rundll32 </b>when the file name really needs to be called <b>rundll32.exe</b> (if the downloaded file has no extension you will have to change the name of the file to add the proper extension to get it to work.<br />
<br />
You then need to copy/paste the downloaded file in the correct folders on your system.<br />
<br />

            Hi Stephen,<br />
<br />
<p><b>Method 1: </b>Follow the steps provided below to reinstall <b>‘rundll.exe’.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Put the Windows XP CD ROM disk in the CD ROM drive.
</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on <b>‘Start’</b>, and then click
<b>‘Run’</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Type expand <b>‘X:\i386\rundll32.ex_ c:\windows\system32\rundll32.exe’</b> in the Open box, where
<b>‘X’</b> is the letter of your CD ROM Drive. </p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Restart the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2: </b><span>Perform SFC scan and check if that helps. The SFC /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.

<p>Could you add the Hotwheels expansion to Forza Horizon 4 with a pack? This could change everybody's option to play and have a great time with Horizon 4. I'm a big fan of Hotwheels racing like the movies from TV and I want that TV on the Xbox in Forza Horizon
 4. The main movie that was on the TV show was Hotwheels Acceleracers, and your workers can help the community to have a blast. For example, Jackultramotive from his own youtube channel and his friends to recreate the Acceleracers movie on Horizon 4. This is
 your opinion on whether you want to do this or not. The teams in the Movie are Teku, Metal Maniacs, Silencers, and Racing drones. This is your decision. The following cars I listed are below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><p>Teku Car Names: Chicane, Baseline(favorite), Synkro, Power Rage.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade&#58; Screen Flicker and Mouse&#47;Keyboard Stops Working Temporarily</h2>
                    <p>First of all i start by saying i am having the same issues as others with my Settings menu crashing any time i attempt to open it.&nbsp;But I have found other possible fixes for this that i plan on trying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that started (and not even immediately) after the 5th or 6th time I booted and used Windows 10.. is that once i loaded up the desktop it seemed as if it were flickering black for a split second. Similar to the way when Windows Explorer crashes
 in previous version of windows, however it does not report an error message and/or correct itself (though the desktop icons DO stay visible&nbsp; on the screen in this case). When the flash happens, immediately the ability to click with the mouse and type with
 the key board is taken away. You can move the mouse, but not select anything. This last for a 5-10 seconds then i am able to click, type for a second or two, then the screen flickers again and i cannot do anything. In fact the only thing i can do in that small
 amount of time between flashes is hit CTR-ALT-DEL and go to the task manager. I would like to note that this screen that loads the task manager does not flicker at all. I typically will restart or shutdown from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon further testing I noticed that if i were quick, IMMEDIATELY, after windows launches i can use windows like normal... momentarily that is. Then i hear a weird bell sound effect... and immediately after that sound the flickering starts and my PC is essentially
 rendered useless. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise if there is a fix for this as i cannot even get into Windows Update to see if a corrective one was released because i do not have the ability to launch Settings menu. Thanks</p>

<p>Hello Rohit,</p>
<p>Thanks for the help with this. Unfortunately the flickering persisted even when launching Task Manager. HOWEVER task manager was still the only application that the flickering would allow to be open after the "flicker" happened... if that makes any sense
 to you. If I had time to launch any other program, the 'next flicker' 10 seconds or so later would then in fact crash it. (ie: File Explorer, Edge Browser, Firefox, Searching from Taskbar, etc, etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did further troubleshoot myself though as I discovered that I could access the Process Manager within the same console as the Task Manager. I started by sorting the running processes by Memory Usage, trying to identify and disable the most active process
 trees one by one, figuring one of the active ones was the culprit.... and it turned out to be my Apple iCloud software. Then I realized something I hadn't taken too much notice to prior; because it "seemed to be" an unimportant message from the iCloud photoshare
 feature within that software indicating that it did not have permission to access what I am presuming is the My Pictures folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first tried to repair the installation, before uninstalling, did a reboot and the flickering still occurred. Then I killed the process again, went in and uninstalled and upon reboot Windows 10 was running properly. Voila!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also on a completely unrelated issue, i did try a posed fix on this forum for my Settings menu crashing which also took care of that problem for me. Now to wait for Apple to release a compliant version of iCloud and I will be back to having a comparable
 functioning Windows machine as I did before the free upgrade to Windows 10.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I had the similar issue with Microsoft Edge.&nbsp; Edge was flickering and randomly scrolling up and down.&nbsp;I was not able to click "settings" option as it was flickering continuously and was not able to use YouTube to watch videos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve this issue, I decided to uninstall or stop&nbsp;the recently installed software. I had recently downloaded the flash player for Mozilla firefox. So I looked in the list of&nbsp;processes in&nbsp;Task Manager and decided to kill the 'flashplayer.exe'. Immediately
 after that Edge resumed functioning properly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I think flashplayer, which I downloaded for the Mozilla firefox is the reason for flickering. This bug needs to be fixed. Please look into this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks &amp; Regards,</p>
<p>Radheesh</p>

            <p>Seems unrelated to my issue Radheesh... short of Windows 10 not really being able to deal with programs that create conditions that make them crash and W10 not being able to "handle that crash properly". It's a classic case of windows releasing under engineered
 software. Buy an Apple, these type of problems don't exist there! lol</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe my problem was caused by Windows 10 doing away with the traditional My Pictures folder that contains a default place for Windows to store images. They seem to have converted over to an "app-style"&nbsp; version of "Pictures" that searches and indexes
 any images that show up on your PC kinda like accessing images on your mobile phone/tablet. So when iCloud went to run upon boot it could no longer access the non-existent My Pictures folder and Windows went into a state of disarray and was behaving the way
 i described above. </p>

            I posted what had worked for me above. If you are using Apple iCloud software this is what caused the issue for me. I removed it and my computer functioned fine. However I would think that Microsoft and/or Apple would have corrected there software by now
 being its over a year later. <br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have known of a way to sign on to xbox live at a hotel, but it does not allow to play multiplayer games.</p>
<p>This is, of course, if the hotel has a webpage authorization, as most do. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to play online multiplayer if you have are traveling?</p>

<p>If you have a laptop or a smartphone on you, you could make it work. However since hotel internet is usually pretty slow it's not adviced to game on it since you can't forward ports and will most likely lag or be unable to find a game.</p>
<p>Anyway... If you have a laptop you can sign into the webpage authorization and connect an ethernet cable from your laptop into your Xbox.</p>
<p>Then you go to Controlpanel-&gt;Network &amp; sharing-&gt; change adapter settings</p>
<p>In there you will see your WIFI and your LAN connection, select both of them, right click , create bridge connection.</p>
<p>This should make the wifi flow through to the Xbox One.</p>
<p>When you're done with gaming you can just right click it again and unlink</p>
<p>If you have a smartphone you can create a wifi hotspot but you'll have to check the manual if it has that option. If you use that option just make sure you have it plugged into the charger as it drains battery.</p>

            <p>In answer to both your e mails it would perhaps be best to start at the beginning ie on the project I was working on I was running out of disc space and decided to remove unwanted programmes and I must have mistakenly removed the programme affecting the
 sound . I tried to download the Multimedia Audio controller with no success .When clicking on this it states "this devise is not configured correctly " ,.If I click on Device Manager and then Multimedia Audio controller and then reinstall driver it comes up
 with "the hardware is not installed because it cannot find the necessary software " I also have looked through the cd,s I have and there is one which is labeled Super Voice which states " modem drivers included "&nbsp;&nbsp; , this I tried to install typing in the necessary
 statement ie D:\sv\picshell.exe.It also states if this did not work then replace the D with the drive letter of your CD-ROM , Which&nbsp;I do not know how to find .</p>
<p>With regard to to the make of computer it is labeled as Silver Optrornix (custom build) the processor No is ADA3000AEP4AX and the Sound component&nbsp; (AGP,PCI) No is WYW650I00307 Hope this is of assistance .</p>

<span>Runtime Broker is a Windows&nbsp;process in Task Manager that&nbsp;helps manage permissions on your PC for apps from Windows Store. It should only use a few megabytes of memory, but in some cases, a faulty app might cause&nbsp;Runtime
 Broker&nbsp;to use up to a gigabyte of RAM or more.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If&nbsp;your RAM use is high and your PC is running slowly, an app may be the cause of the problem. Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to&nbsp;open Task Manager and then, on the
<strong>Processes</strong> tab,&nbsp;check to see how much memory Runtime Broker is using. If it’s using more than 15% of your memory, you probably have an issue with an app on your PC. To stop Runtime Broker from using so much memory, select
<strong>Runtime Broker</strong> in the list, select <strong>End task</strong> to close Runtime Broker, and then restart your computer.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hello Jesus,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
As per the description it seems the emails do not open in full size window. Let me help you with the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Before we proceed with any troubleshooting steps we need to know:</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>How are you accessing your email account?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Is it through a web browser, mail app or email client?
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you are accessing your account via Windows Live Mail please specify what is the exact version of the application?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Any window you want to resize permanently must be the last window closed.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Grab the corners of the window and drag it to full screen size. Do not use Maximize. Close all other windows first via the Taskbar and this one last. Windows will remember the size used of the last window closed the next time you open the program.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</span></p>
