            Hi, Bettycsmith
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor. I would love to help you today.
<br />
<br />1.- Run System File Checker (<a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-run-system-file-checker-analyze-its-logs-in-windows-7-vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-run-syste...</a>) or SFC to fix any system file corruption from the resident component store.
<br />
<br />In an elevated CMD (<a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-run-command-prompt-as-an-administrator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-run-comma...</a>)  execute the following command:
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />This does not require Internet access.
<br />If this not help, you may need to repair the Windows Component Store itself.
<br />2.-  To do this, you need to Run DISM. (<a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/component-store-corruption-repair-windows-image" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/component-store-...</a>)
<br />
<br />In an elevated CMD execute the following command:
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />This will fix any system image corruption from a Windows Update source. This may require internet access.
<br />This should resolve all issues.
<br />3.-  Additionally if you feel, you may run SFC again.
<br />This will fix potential system file corruption from the new repaired component store and verify that DISM was successful in repairing the errors.

            <p>Hello Sugram,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, Windows creates an associated "Rundll32" file with a program. However, sometimes, these files may be detected as an infection like a spyware.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to run Microsoft safety scanner to check for any infections like viruses or malwares.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Microsoft safety scanner</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            Hi Francine,<br />
<br />
This might happen because of virus and third party applications. <br />
<br />
<p>Have you made any recent changes to your computer?</p>
<br />
Let's try the following suggestions and check if it fixes your issue.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1: <br />
</b>
<div><strong>Step 1: </strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></a> and check if you still get the error message. If it boots properly may be
 a third party application or a service is causing the issue. Let's perform<span> clean boot. That will help us identify if any third party applications or start up items are causing the issue.<br />
&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><b>Step 2: </b>Refer to the article below for steps about how to start your computer in clean boot state.<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<br />
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>After checking the functionality in clean boot, follow the suggestions under
</span><span>“How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot”.
</span></p>
<br />
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong> Let's disable the Automatic Restart to prevent the restarts on system failure.
<div><br />
a. When your computer starts keep pressing F8 on your keyboard till you get the Advanced Boot Options screen.<br />
b. Now,&nbsp;use&nbsp;arrow keys, select <b>Disable automatic restart</b> on system failure and press Enter.<br />
<br />
After disabling the automatic restart, if you get any error message, reply us with the error message.&nbsp;
<br />
<p><br />
</p>
<span>Method 3: Let’s disable antivirus software and check if the issue persists.</span>
<span>Refer to this link:</span>
<p>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>When you disable Antivirus:
</span></b><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.
</span></p>
<br />
<p><b><span>Method 4: <span>Perform a full scan using </span>Microsoft Safety Scanner.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Refer to this link:</span></b></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<br />
Hope the information above is useful.<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> If you have any further queries, or if this issue persists, reply here and we will be glad to help you.</span>

No changes where made purchased it in 2010 and i notice the problem last december. thought i'd &nbsp;fix it, &nbsp;worked for a while. &nbsp;It seems to only happen at night. could it be the wake up timer i disable the wake up time. &nbsp;BUT for some reason something is disabling
 it and it starts again. I really don't think it's a virus. I think it has to do with the wake up setting in BIOS. someone suggest to set the BIOS setting back to its default setting. Running out of option i even tried system restore to the time i first bought
 it.

    <title>How to Delete Trial Version of Textural Packs&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dawn of autumn  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Delete Trial Version of Textural Packs&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Minecraft won't let me save my game on Natural Textured setting. It keeps saying that I only have the trial version, even though I bought the Natural Textured pack.&nbsp; How do I fix this?&nbsp; I already tried downloading the Natural Textured pack like 8 times.&nbsp;
 Every one of those time it said that I completed the download.&nbsp; But, I still have the same issue.&nbsp; Do I have to delete the game and re-download the whole game?&nbsp; If so, will I lose my saved data?</p>

<p>Hey guys! I just had the same problem, I bought 1 texture pack and 1 skin pack, and when I launched the game it said I only had the trial pack, but I managed to fix it myself.</p>
<p>I went to the the system section of my Xbox 360 Home (Dashboard or whatever you call it) and went to storage. I clicked on the Minecraft storage button and it came up with all my game data and downloads. I scrolled through and found the previous trial packs
 (they are not labelled trials), and looked for the ones with the older dates (because I downloaded the trials before actually buying them) and I deleted them, keeping the most recent ones.</p>
<p>Once I did that, I went back onto Minecraft and launched the skin pack and chose the texture pack. It worked! And I didn't need to 'download full version to save game'. If it doesn't work try re-downloading the packs and try again.</p>
<p>Hope this helps! :D (Sorry if I didn't explain it properly or if it sounds too complicated!)</p>

<h3> sandiilove  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Regsvr32 running on High CPU due to a unknown file</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I am using Windows 10 and I'm worried about my computer that had been running with a 40~100% CPU because of regsvr32 aka Microsoft(C) Register Server (32-bit) for the past week. I have done some research about using Process Explorer to locate why my regsvr32
 was running on such a high CPU but I still don't know how to remove or fix this particular file which regsvr32 is using. I have McAfee Anti-Virus and my Microsoft Defender is up-to-date. I'm not tech savy, so please excuse me if I use the wrong term while
 I am explaining the situation below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>( As you can see here, I opened my Task Manager and my "</strong><strong>Microsoft(C) Register Server" is shown to have taken almost half of my pc's CPU. The rest of my other programs are running little to no CPU%.)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a55dafbb-92e5-4732-86ca-bf3e821d64fb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a55dafbb-92e5-4732-86ca-bf3e821d64fb?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><strong>( In the screenshot below when I locate my regsvr32.exe in Process Explorer, it shows that it was running some sort of file with random numbers and letters in the Command Line.)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae276f73-35c7-4fad-a20b-87618e04905f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae276f73-35c7-4fad-a20b-87618e04905f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
<strong>( I checked the Threads of the regsvr32.exe with Process Explorer, and something in that file is cycling non-stop.)</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0466778d-aea5-4c3d-bc3d-4d5b1548bf07?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0466778d-aea5-4c3d-bc3d-4d5b1548bf07?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><strong>( Upon further inspection by looking into the file property of {214E3069--174}, it shows little to no info about what it is and it was built on August 25, 2018. Coincidentally, the same time when my PC started to heat up due to high CPU usage.)</strong><br />

 this file without any issues to prevent regsvr32 from looping with this file whenever I start up my computer? If it's fine to remove this file, how do you delete this folder/file using Process Explorer? Will that affect my computer in anyway or mess up my

            I&nbsp;believe it had to be&nbsp;a windows restore since it gave me a choice of restore points. I picked the&nbsp;latest &nbsp;date, which was april3. I also have noticed that all my saved favorites places are also gone. All my music files are gone, my photos and videos are
 also gone.&nbsp;All the programs that I have added in the last 3 years are still working. The unwanted program that i could not get rid of told me i had a hard disc failure and needed to run a windows recovery tool. Unfortunately, after clicking on their tool,
 it&nbsp;scanned my hard disc and then asked me for a fee to fix the failure. That's when i realized it was a scam. I could not get their request to go away, so i did the system restore.&nbsp;

<p><span>In Windows 7 use Ctrl+Shift+Esc rather than Ctrl+Alt+Del. It gets you to Task Manager quicker. When the computer locks select Task Manager, the Performance tab, Resource Monitor, and Memory tab. What are the figures for Hardware Reserved, In Use, Modified,

            Hello,
<br />
<br />DriverUpdatePlus seems like third-party software. Microsoft do not releases such kind of software. 
<br />
<br />If you can't login, suggest you to make clean install.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

            Hi Carolyn,
<br />
<br />Microsoft would never support DriverUpdatePlus . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

<span>First, I would suggest you to go to the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/open-device-manager#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
device manager</a> and check if USB LG GE24NU40 External DVD drive is listed under DVD/CD Rom drives. If the drive is listed there, then right click on the DVD drive and click on
<strong>update drivers</strong>. If the drive is not listed, then click on the <strong>
Action</strong> and click on <strong>scan for Hardware changes</strong>. <br />
<br />
I would also suggest you to run hardware and devices troubleshooter and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
</span></span><span>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter<br />

<p>It wants to keep putting some DT soft virtual DVD driver as the default.&nbsp; I have the disk from LG, but it is not recognizing the drive to load it.&nbsp; LG does not put drivers online for this, so I copied it to a stick and tried loading it.&nbsp; It gets to part

<h2>            Norton Security Suite defrags my C drive</h2>
                    Norton Security Suite which comes with my Comcast cable/phone/internet package defrags my C drive as part of the scan and tuneup process. Does defragmenting my SSD C drive cause a problem on my Surface Pro? &nbsp;I was told never defrag SSD drives.

<p>It is not necessary to defrag windows 8. Old advice to defrag doesn't apply to windows 8. Win 8 takes care of defrag. Do not use any of those utilities.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On SSD the need is even less and if you defrag to much will lead to premature demise of your drive.

    <title>Sound Problems on Acer Aspire X1200 desktop computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> berry5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound Problems on Acer Aspire X1200 desktop computer</h2>
                    &nbsp; I've been having strange technical problems with the sound.&nbsp; Sometimes it turns itself off by mysteriously switching the sound setting to Windows Default (Modified) in the sound control panel.&nbsp; I learned to fix this by simply switching it back to Windows
 Default.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; I'm also unable to run an Nvidia audio update.&nbsp; Every time I do it wipes out the sound.&nbsp; I fixed this by doing a system restore.<br />
&nbsp; Finally, the most irritating problem.&nbsp; A strange, loud, high pitched buzzing noise began occurring sometimes when I play a game or go online.&nbsp; It's the same sound which is sometimes heard when too many applications are running at once on the desktop, and
 also kind of sounds like a high speed, high pitched busy signal but is more choppy sounding.<br />
&nbsp; I looked through sound topics on many online support forums but found no one with this exact problem.&nbsp; I have Realtek High Definition audio also on this computer.<br />
&nbsp; If anyone knows what may be wrong and/or have solutions please let me know!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Thanks for the suggestions.&nbsp; No, I have no audio enhancer software on my computer.&nbsp; However, I strongly suspect a Registry Cleaner I have installed called Registry Easy is what sometimes changes the sound on my computer from Windows Default to Windows Default
 (Modified) because it has a series of pro- grams designed to improve computer features, and the one called "System Optimizer" is the one sometimes modifying the sound.&nbsp; I know this because when I tried "System Optimizer" a few times it changed my computer
 style from Windows Default to Office Model which also is when the sound first got modified (wiped out).&nbsp; I simply reversed it back to Windows Default.&nbsp; I believe there's a glitch in this program which sometimes modifies the sound.&nbsp; It's not a major problem
 and easy to fix so I'm not too concerned about it at this point.<br />
&nbsp; I found out from someone else on this website who had the same problem as me why the Nvidia audio update wiped out the sound.&nbsp; I had a similar problem
<br />
with an Nvidia graphics card update which was about 80 MB and took 7 hours to download.&nbsp; It made my monitor go black and I had to do system restore to fix it. A Microsoft technician on this website said the problem was that these are both driver updates from
 Windows Updates and are often not the right update for your computer.&nbsp; It's best to download driver updates from the driver manufacturer and/or your computer manufacturer's website.<br />
&nbsp; I still don't know for sure what's causing the occasional buzzing noise.&nbsp; However, I have a suspicion it's from a program which came with a Bionicle Heroes game by Eidos I had called Game Shadow which was downloaded online from www.gameshadow.com.&nbsp; After
 Game Shadow was installed is when I first heard that strange buzzing noise I'm pretty sure.&nbsp; Game Shadow scans your computer for all games then goes online to find updates for them.&nbsp; I uninstalled Game Shadow because it did not work properly.&nbsp; When I ran some
 registry cleaners shortly after I noticed Game Shadow had messed up a lot of files in my registry and other places.<br />
&nbsp; None of the virus scan utilities will install on my computer.&nbsp; I think because they're all designed for Windows Vista Home Premium 64 bit edition and I have the 32 bit edition.&nbsp; My internet explorer (MIE 8) is compatible though.
<br />
&nbsp; I think this will help you understand and diagnose the problems I have going on better and the cause of them.&nbsp; I'm almost positive these programs men- tioned are the causes of these problems.<br />
&nbsp; Any further suggestions?&nbsp;

<p>No Command Prompt, no System Restore, nothing, just Startup Settings.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Eric.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Use the bootable Installation media:
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options to get a Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />But since you have the media now you might as well do the Clean Install which compiles the best install possible that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given:    <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot the media as above, choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Do you remember making any changes to your computer after which the issue started?<br />
<br />
Follow these steps and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd suggest you visit <a href="http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Acer website</a>, download and install the updated driver driver for your camera and check if that helps.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Uninstall and reinstall the webcam drivers and check if that helps.<br />
<br />
<strong>To uninstall the existing webcam drivers from Device Manager:</strong>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
a. Click "Start", type "Device Manager" in the "Start search box" and hit "Enter".</div>
<div>b. On the menu select "View&gt;&gt;Show Hidden Devices".</div>
<div>c. Under <strong>Imaging Devices</strong> you will find the "webcam".</div>
<div>d. Select your webcam, right-click and select "Uninstall".</div>
<div>e. Restart the computer, if prompted.<br />
<br />
<div>Drivers should get installed automatically after restarting the computer.</div>

 Update Error 800B0100. I have run the System Readiness tool and it re-installed KB947821 but again Service Pack 1 installation fails at 25% with a Windows Update Error 800B0100. Any Ideas?<br />

            <p>1. Do you have backups of ALL the changes CCleaner's Registry Cleaner has EVER made to your computer since you did the clean install of Win7 64-bit (on the computer where WinXP 32-bit had been installed)?</p>

                    <p>I&nbsp;have spoken with TESO&nbsp;support and they have stated that the cloud data stored on Xbox cloud servers is corrupted and is causing my game to freeze at the sync cloud data window when accessing the game. This issue only happens on this game and no other.</p><p>I have done the following.<br /></p><ul><li>Deleted XBL account</li><li>Deleted Local storage</li><li>Deleted persistent storage</li><li>Restarted Xbox</li><li>Reset Xbox</li><li>Reconfigured Xbox</li><li>Uninstalled entire game</li><li>Uninstalled any DLCs</li><li>Reinstalled the game</li><li>Factory reset delete all games/apps</li><li>Power-cycle console</li><li>Reset modem/router</li></ul><p>They said that Xbox would have to access the cloud server where my game data for The elder scrolls online is located and delete it all so they may push through the correct data saved on the account created with them. This is the only possible way and I have tried calling support/chatting online with everyone seeming very confused o

            <p>Fixed issue</p><p>So after continuously doing everything and wasting hours speaking to both ZOS and ESO support with receiving the run around I have finally been able to get back into the game.<br /><br />Here is my solution to this issue which requires you to be fast but you can do it pretty easily.<br />First let me explain the real issue and the issue actually is not the save game data but the saved preference data that is most likely apart of the save game data but is just a part of it. I know I just confused you here but this is what you need to do.</p><ul><li><b>First</b>&nbsp;press the xbox guide button and navigate to the settings icon.</li><li><b>Second</b>&nbsp;click settings and go to system and click storage.</li><li><b>Third</b>&nbsp;Click clear local saved games and wait for Xbox to reboot.</li><li><b>Fourth</b>&nbsp;load ESO up and immediately when the window pops up for syncing cloud data click cancel as fast as you can.</li><li>^Note: Sometimes the window does not come up and y
<p><b><br />After doing this I was able to gain access to the game with my player data intact but it did a 'New user' setup where it took you through screen adjustments/brightness adjustments but nonetheless both character data was in tact<br />^NOTE: I am currently having an issue after performing this with the third person view (no matter how far I go out it will still be way to close almost as if I were in first person).<br /><br />Disclaimer: This is what worked for me I cannot guarantee that it will work for all who face such a terrible glitch but hopefully this serves as a light at the end of the tunnel for all whom seek help with this issue.</b></p><p><br /></p>
