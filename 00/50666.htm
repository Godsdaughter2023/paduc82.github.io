<h2>            Stuck on please wait screen before logon screen.</h2>
                    Hello, my Asus S56CA-DH51 is currently stuck in the please wait screen before the login screen. This has been happening for about 2 weeks and i just can't get past it now. I usually held down the power button and then turned it back on and it wouldn't
 give me the screen. I've been turning it off and back on again for the last 2 hours and i can't get to the logon. Also once i get to the please wait screen my hard drive notification led turns off and doesn't go back on. If any of you can help me out then
 that would be greatly appreciated. I have some other problems that I'll post on later if i can figure this out.

            Thankyou for the reply, however i can't do any of that because I'm getting the please wait and loading icon screen before the screen where i type in my password. I've managed to turn my laptop off and on and it will work after nearly an hour of doing so
 and i can't put it into sleep mode to see what that would do since I've had problems with sleep mode.

<p>Hi Elaine,<br />
<br />
The option to display the calendar alongside with your inbox is not available in Windows Mail App. Windows Mail app is a built-in Windows app with minimal features. You'll need to click on the calendar icon to display the whole calendar.

    <title>Boot loop after Meltdown and Spectre patch installed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Boot loop after Meltdown and Spectre patch installed</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>Hi. </p>
<p>I have a problem with Win 10 boot after Meltdown and Spectre updates installed. I have Sandy Bridge-E CPU which is in danger group of those which have problems with that patch.</p>
<p>My solution while waiting for a working fix of Intel microcode was to restore from restore point but now it's helpless.
</p>
<p>Sympthom: endless boot loop -&gt; windows restore, and so on. All actual updates were installed before I've got bootloop on friday. First time I've faced it I've removed updates using cmd at the windows restore:</p>
<p>DISM /Image:D:\ /Get-Packages</p>
<p>found those which were installed on January (2) and february (1) and removed it.<br />
<br />
Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~16299.192.1.9<br />
Package_for_KB4058702~31bf3856ad364e35~~amd64~~16299.188.1.0<br />
Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~16299.98.1.20<br />
<br />
PC booted fine, I've applied two registry keys Microsoft advised to add to disable Spectre fix:
<br />
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management" /v FeatureSettingsOverride /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f<br />
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management" /v FeatureSettingsOverrideMask /t REG_DWORD /d 3 /f</p>
<p>
</p><p>But next morning I've got the same picture (Windows restore). It seemed that all of that updates were installed again.
</p>
<p>Tried to do the same (remove using DISM) but it no longer helps. <br />
<br />
Booted with DaRT USB and uninstalled those update (yes, all of them were installed again). Reboot - no result (loop). After several tries to uninstall updates it's only one left - KB4058702 (05.01.18) but it is undeletable now (error 0x8000ffff).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know what to do next and how to get my PC working. </p>
<p>CBS and DISM logs from system drive - I guess there is an opportunity to see what happened that night when updates came back. + DISM&nbsp; log from windows restore when I tried to uninstall that update. http://dropmefiles.com/xgmwo</p>
<p>Any help will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'd restore again but this time immediately run the Hide Updates tool to block the Updates.  If it won't find them then turn off Windows Updates and try again later.

            In order to prevent the updates from installing after uninstalling them, you should do the following:
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Set your Internet connection as metered:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-10-data-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Use Active Hours and Restart options:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windows-update-behavior-using-active-hours-and-restart-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 3: 
<br />
<br />Use Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update:
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />Option 4:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Update
<br />Select it then right click it
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, choose Startup type to DIsabled
<br />Click Stop
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Also, make sure you install the January 31, 2018—KB4058258 (OS Build 16299.214), which should include a fix for this update.

            Create the latest stable media from Media Creation tool to  Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem as long as they stick with the tools and methods given:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Install Now, then Custom install.  Then at drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup   to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-lis...</a>

            There is a step in the tutorial to rescue data first which is not backed up.<br /><br /> Your files should always be backed up if you value them at all because the hard drive can die at any time.  <br /><br />Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:<br /><br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  <br /><br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  <br /><br />Or you can drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.  <br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a><br /><br />You can also turn on File History to keep your files backed up incrementally to external hard drive.

            Glad to hear it.  A good Clean Install is always like getting a new PC - even better since most PC's come larded with bloatware that causes issues and slows performance.

<h2>            HDMI Connection Display to TV - Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I have been using HDMI connection to my Sony TV through my HP All-In-One-Pavillion PC (which has Windows 10 - Home) for the last couple of months, The sound and Display was working perfectly but suddenly since last month, the display on the TV through HDMI
 connection from my PC stopped working but currently the sound was working and then suddenly it stopped when I changed the display settings by mistake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My TV shows a description when I switch it to the HDMI Channel as "<strong>Unsupported Device; Check your Device Output</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to resolve this problem/Connection error by searching for a Solution on the net and I also searched for reviews from people who experienced this issue but as a result I got to know that they also did not have any other choice than to
<strong>give up</strong> resolving this connection error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking for a quick reply from you about resolving this issue regarding this HDMI connection error.</p>

<br />
Thanks for keeping this thread updated. The suggestion that Andre gave to us can actually meet the issue and resolve it. You also made a good one, which made the display flash for 2 minutes, and that means hope. Here what we can do now:<br />
<br />
First and most, please generate a restore point.<br />
<br />
Now, we need to stop the system from installing the recommended hardware driver, since must have been at fault the whole time. Please follow this:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Go to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>File Explorer</strong></li><li>Right-click on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>This PC</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and hit<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>On the left pane, click on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Advanced System Settings</strong>.</li><li>Go to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Hardware</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>tab, click on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Device Installation Settings</strong></li><li>A prompt will follow, asking "Do you want to automatically download manufacturers' app and custom icons available for your device?" - just click/select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>No</strong>.</li></ol>
<br />
After this, please redo the steps that you did on uninstalling the Display Driver.
<br />
<br />
Let us know what will be the results so we can continue when needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
All the best.

<p>Dear Marc,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for kind advise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accordingly I did the save changes as below screen shot.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately after we uninstall both the display adapters and restarted the PC. the final result ended up same as before like<em>" it just works for 2 minutes only, and then it just goes back to how it was before it was showing the error message working
 in TV, it just continues to display "<strong>Unsupported device; Check your output</strong>".</em></p>
<p><em>Therefore, I would request you to advice for any further solution towards this Issue.</em></p>

<p>Thanks for the update, Mohamed. We would want to know, is the HDMI that connects to the monitor is from the graphic card's HDMI port? We can see that you have 2 display adapters. If the connector is coming from the NVIDIA graphic
 card, there should be a way to restore default display settings from its own, respective
<em>control</em><em> panel</em>. You can usually access its <em>control panel</em>
<strong>via right-click on Desktop</strong>. <br />
<br />
If this would not work, aside from the display driver, you may need to uninstall and reinstall the graphic card
<em>control panel</em>, update to its latest installment and see if that would work.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tell us more about any results. <br />

            If you are like me and have a licence key , but you don't know what type it is (retail, OEM. Volume etc)<br />
<br />
Then i used this great app that can tell you what Type your licence key &nbsp;is and the vendor that issued it (Dell, samsung, HP etc)<br />
<br />
go here&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Ultimate PID Checker &nbsp;<br />
<br />
http://janek2012.eu/ultimate-pid-checker/<br />
<br />
Download ir (RAR)<br />
<br />
use 7zip (Free download to unpack it)<br />
<br />
<br />
It runs without Installing (portable)<br />
<br />
<br />
For me I confirmed it was an OEM licence -- Dell --- so run Any Dell OEM disk to repair (Same OS disk)<br />

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>I have recently purchased the new Surface Go along with the new Surface Pen.&nbsp; It seems to experience the same issues. Unable to drag a link (or any selected text) and drop it.</p>
<p>Another example: as I'm surfing the net, I tend to open up my favorite websites by dragging and dropping them from the bookmark bar to a new tab to instantly load the webpage in the next tab.
</p>
<p>I'm sure a ton of people do this, with the mouse it's easy. The thing is in Edge it works while in Opera or Chrome it doesn't work with pen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually, not a big issue but still quite annoying to find those obstacles with an expensive product like the Surface Pen. Especially if the problem is software based.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers<br />

                    <p>Original title : HP printer Status.msi problem after Windows Update</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a problem. I am receiving a message that my status.msi was missing. This started to occur after a Windows update. Anyhow, I'll geta box that states: C:\users\Ickabod\Appdata\Local\Temp\7zS4B6A\setup\status\. (Ickabod is the name of my computer)&nbsp;Plus,
 when I press the "ok" button, then I receive a message to "try installation again using aa valid copy of installation package 'status.msi". Also, when I would press cancel or ok, the box changes and what comes up next is a box named the Solution Center and
 the line graph will move quickly to the right or sometimes it moves and then stops and stays there. This happens alot these days. These boxes never disappears; always in the forfront of the sight I might be visitng. And now I have a box saying "Service 'hpqcxs08'
 could not be stopped. Verify that you have sufficient privileges to stop system services. And this is in the box "Solution Center". So, what should I do? Should I install my printer disk again or is there something else I should be doing? I read the last question
 that dealt with this, even tho his problem occured when starting up. So, what to do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>DE ThomasSr</p>

<p>The problem is perhaps with the Pandora software, its not getting the correct info from W7 or the internet.</p>
<p>Your best bet would be to go to their website and if there is a FAQ or Forum page consult or leave a message for them. You will need to give them complete details about your set up.</p>

    <title>why is file explorer so very, very slow&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            why is file explorer so very, very slow&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Every time I try to open or resort anything in file explorer, if there are any sizable number of files, it takes absolute ages for the green bar to crawl across the top. Often, it never even finishes.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous. Any other program I use to grab, sort, and organize these exact same folders can shuffle, handle, and sort them by any tab within seconds.</p>
<p>Why does windows 10, the premium PC operating system on planet earth, owned by probably the world's richest man, have such a hard time doing this most basic, easy, pathetically simple task?</p>
<p>I've turned everything relevant on and off, and done every tweak in the book and nothing fixes this.</p>
<p>W T F microsoft? This is utterly ridiculous.</p>

    <title>Tabs in Sticky Notes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andreas wallin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tabs in Sticky Notes</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I would really like to have a tabs-feature in Sticky Notes. I have a sticky note pinned to my desktop, I use it as a work to-do list and like that it is always there without having to open a task-app every time I need to see the list.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I would like to split my to-do list in sections/topics, one list for this and one list for that. I'm thinking something like in OneNote where I can add one or more tabs at the top. In that way I could easily toggle between the different lists in
 the different tabs in the same sticky note.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternative is to have more individual sticky notes on my desktop (takes a lot of space), or having a long list in the one sticky note with seperating headers in between the different sections/topics (which forces me to scroll up and down to see all the
 stuff). None of the alternatives are optimal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this is possible today, anyone know?</p>

<h2>            DNS server not responding</h2>
                    <p>Hey, first of all i wanna say I am fed up of using all possible(i think so) solutions, so let me know the PERMANENT solution regarding my problem.
<strong>Before saying anything please read what i've used/doing(a temporary solution). Thanks for reading..</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>I've used/using:&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">*I'm using tp link router and using cable/lan with my pc(sorry can't afford wifi dongle for my pc :( )</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">1. Tried on my earlier windows 8.1/10, now using freshly installed windows 10 on a brand new harddrive(using from dec 29,2017)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">2. Tried using troubleshooter and it showed the problem 'DNS server not responding' and then i did whatever it said(apply fix/shutdown/restarts later) but not fixed</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">3. Tried flashing dns through cmd but not worked</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">4. Tried changing dns server from both router and from pc(network and settings- manually) but not worked</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">5. Ethernet Driver is updated(after using old version, I just updated to latest one)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">6. Tried ccleaner software to flash/clean dns, not worked</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">7. Tried plugging the lan cable on the other ports of my router, still not worked</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>8. Resetted router but not worked</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">** The only way it fixes(but only for some time and then it goes back to the same problem- DNS server not responding) is when i turn my Router off and and turn it on. That means turning off the power(current) of Router
 and turning on again the problem goes away but later it shows again after sometimes.
</span><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">My wifi works normal if this happens on my desktop.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">**A ques arises in my mind that if i normally browse then the problem don't appears but if i try to download anything then it occurs.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;I asked my isp provider but they don't know the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>my setup:</strong></p>
<p>windows 10 pro - version 1709, build 16299.125</p>
<p>core i3 4150</p>
<p>msi h81v32 mobo</p>
<p>12gb ddr3 ram</p>
<p>msi gt 730 2gb ddr5 graphics</p>
<p>1tb wd blue harddrive</p>
<p>
</p><p>**I have read some questions and solutions from here but didn't see problem like me so I tried to describe what i'm facing. Hoping to get PERMANENT solutions. Please....</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Jubair</strong>,<br />
<br />
Based on the information that you've provided, there's a possibility that your <strong>
TCP/IP</strong> is broken or corrupted. <strong>Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol</strong> (TCP/IP) is the language that a computer uses to access the Internet.
<br />
<br />
To help you with this concern, we suggest resetting of your TCP/IP by using the <strong>
NetShell</strong> utility. You may reset TCP/IP automatically or manually. Please follow the methods below:
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Reset TCP/IP automatically</strong><br />
<br />
To reset TCP/IP automatically, download this <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9848640" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>file</strong></a>. In the <strong>File Download</strong> dialog box, click
<strong>Run</strong> or <strong>Open</strong>, and then follow the steps in the easy fix wizard.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: Manually reset TCP/IP including winsock </strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the <strong>Start</strong> screen, type <strong>CMD</strong>. In the search results, right-click
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then select <strong>Run as administrator</strong>. At the command prompt, enter the following command, and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>: <br />
<br />
<em><strong>netsh int ip reset c:\resetlog.txt </strong></em><br />
<em><strong>netsh winsock reset <br />
<br />
<br />
</strong>Note: If you don't want to specify a directory path for the log file, run the following command instead (please include
<strong>netsh winsock reset</strong> if you plan to use this method instead) : <strong>
<br />
<br />
netsh int ip reset <br />
</strong></em><br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>Restart</strong> the computer, then check if the issue was sorted out.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists after performing the suggested steps above, you may need to seek further assistance from your ISP. As you've mentioned in your post, the issue usually gets fixed when you turn your router off and turn it on. There's a chance that
 there are components of the router that triggers the issue, you may check with your ISP if a replacement of your router is applicable.
<br />
<br />
For any results, just send us a reply. </p>

<p>Hey Elieen Gal, thanks for answering to this issue. I tried to use method 1, it found that problem then followed the instructions (like ok/restart)</p>
<p>But the problem occured again just the way it did before. But i will go with your second option later after in a moments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't mind me asking i just want to know what could be the possible reason behind this? I'm not a hardware person nor a tech guy so i don't know whom to ask and get the answer, as you seems to know stuffs like this so i thought i should try to ask
 again :))&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>**The problem happens through lan port(not wifi) router which forces me to turn the power off and then again turning on to use internet through lan.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi <strong>Jubair</strong>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error that you’ve encountered is most likely an issue with the router. Since you’ve performed some troubleshooting steps and have the same result, we’d like to confirm if you’ve already reached out to your Internet Service Provider (<strong>ISP</strong>)
 to check it further. If you haven’t done it yet, we suggest that contacting them and have them check the connection, especially the router that you’re using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We’ll wait for your response.</p>

<p>Hey Louie, thank you for your response.</p>
<p>I asked them about the issue and they basically weren't aware of it. They're saying it might occur from my pc. And they don't know much of any networking or hardware related things i guess as they just buy bandwidth from isp's and sell them to customers
 like us. In short, all provider in my area is the same:(</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I rebooted/resetted my router and just browsing(not downloading cos i don't want to see the problem comes back again). And with that, in every bootup I'm flushing dns using cmd on my pc just for an extra precaution until i get a real solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>YOU WILL BE HAPPY TO KNOW THAT I CONTACTED WITH TPLINK FOR SUPPORT, SENT THIS QUESTIONS ON JANUARY 6TH AND THEY JUST REPLIED (JAN 10) TO ME.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Waiting to hear something from them too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Recovery</h2>
                    <p>I bought my Dell laptop from a company who installed Windows 7 Professional on it and an MS Office program. This laptop has become unstable, and I have spent a week, trying suggestions on this site to resolve issues, to no avail. Is there a way that I can
 restore it to the day I bought it, or will it recovery it to factory settings, without the additional changes the company I bought it from made?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I went to Restore, the only options are to restore it to a previous time, all of which are fairly recent...not to back to where I bought it.</p>

<p>When Dell sells a computer, it typically will include information saved on the hard drive that can be used to restore the computer to the state it was in when it left Dell's factory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The company from which you bought your computer may or may not have left the Dell "restore" information intact, but if it is there, it will only restore the computer to its original Dell state, which may or may not include Windows 7 Pro and most likely will
 not include Microsoft Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The company who sold you the computer should have provided you with some means to restore at least the Windows 7 Pro installation if not the Office application as well.&nbsp; Assuming that you didn't get any CDs or DVDs with the computer (I assume that you would
 have mentioned that), you should call the company and ask them how you can recover your computer to the state it was in when you bought it from them.&nbsp; If it's a legitimate company, it should be able to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the computer is operable, even if unstable, you may be able to recover the product keys for both Windows 7 Pro and Microsoft Office using one of the following free utilities.&nbsp; If you can do that, you may be able download files from which you can create
 installation media.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because Microsoft has been making it more difficult to find legitimate downloads however, I suggest that you start by asking your vendor.</p>

<p>Oh, I wish that the company that sold me the laptop (1-1/2 years ago) would return my calls! He won't! The Windows 7 Pro COA is on the laptop and the product key is on the battery. I do not have the COA and product key of&nbsp;MS Office, unfortunately.&nbsp;I cannot
 get IE 11 to work at all;&nbsp;as soon as I open it,&nbsp;the famous "stopped working" error message comes up, and I have to go to task manager to "end process." I've tried every single suggestion&nbsp;made, to no avail. Also, the computer has become SO slow, it's hard to
 even work on it. I have Avast Antivirus on the computer; it nor Malwarebytes finds any problems (virus or spyware).&nbsp;I'm at my wits end!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that I should be able to reinstall Windows (no DVD) through MS, shouldn't I, as long as I have my valid license? I do recall only one time, I received an error&nbsp;message while using Internet Explorer, but I can't recall what it is right now; it was
 ie(something).dll.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went ahead and removed MS Office 2013 from my computer, because a year after buying the laptop with it on it, it started saying that it was not activated and I needed to connect to the corporate network. I feel that was not a valid program, and it's probably
 why the seller would not answer my emails and phone calls. I now have a valid MS Office program on it, but it's old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I&nbsp;reinstall Windows from the MS website, and will that&nbsp;remove everything except for Windows? No biggie, if so, because I cannot use it like it is without a lot of frustration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

            Nice of Microsoft not to let us know the Windows 10 compatibility centre has been closed. There isn't even a message on the redirected page. No wonder my friends who changed to Macs are telling me I should do the same.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is moving towards Windows as a service model, i.e. there will be frequent OS releases. Therefore, compatibility is of utmost priority and keeping a compatibility site for each release of Windows&nbsp;moving ahead will be unnecessary. Therefore, any
 user coming to Windows compatibility site will be redirected to Windows 10 overview page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please respond if you have further related queries.</p>

<h2>            How to go from Windows 7 Home Premium 32bit to 64 bit version</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to an Intel D975XBX2 motherboard and Intel 965EE processor.&nbsp; My OS is Windows 7 Home Premium, 32 bit version.&nbsp;&nbsp; I purchased it almost 2 years ago and it came with both 32 and 64 bit versions.&nbsp;&nbsp; I understand the Intel D975XBX2&nbsp;motherboard
 and 965EE processor will operate the 64 bit Windows &amp; software.</p>
<p>Is there an advantage to the 64 bit version and what steps must I take to switch it from 32 bit to 64?</p>

            <p>Usually the deciding factor is the amount of RAM you have. A 32 bit Windows 7 can use at max 4 GB of RAM, normally
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/978610" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">somewhat less</a> (3.2 to 3.6 GB). A 64 bit Windows 7 can use more than 4 GB RAM, Home Basic up to 8 GB, Home Premium up to 16 GB and Professional, Ultimate and Enterprise up to 192 GB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have let's say 6 GB or more&nbsp;RAM you will benefit when replacing 32 bit Windows with a 64 bit version. If you decide to do it, the only possible way is to do a clean, fresh install; you cannot change the bit version once installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notice that you cannot even start the 64 bit Windows installation from desktop of a 32 bit Windows. You need to boot your PC with 64 bit install media, DVD or USB Flash memory in order to be able to install&nbsp;64 bit Windows 7.</p>

<p>Windows 7 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 7 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than
 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 7 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 7 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers. Also, if
 you decide to move to Windows 7 64 bit in the future, there is no upgrade path from 32 bit Windows, clean install only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>----------------------</p>
<p><strong>How to do the upgrade</strong></p>
<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.</p>
<p>Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.</p>
<p>Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you attempt to start the installation of a 64 bit version of Windows from within a 32 bit version of Windows, you will receive the following error message.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Which is understandable, since you are running a 32 bit version of Windows. To begin the installation, we will need to restart the computer and boot from the disc or USB thumbdrive which contains the installation files. So, click the close button.
</p>
<p>Restart your computer then load your BIOS and set it to boot from your DVD drive or USB thumb drive. You might need to consult your computer manual for instructions how to do this. See the following article for additional instructions.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To learn how to change your BIOS options to boot from the DVD drive, the following tutorial:<br />

<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
The Windows 7 logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as your see the indicator, everything should be ok.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should now arrive at this screen, select your time and currency format then click Next.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Click Install Now<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Wait while setup starts up<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Enter your product key when prompted<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accept the End User License agreement and click Next<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Click Custom install Windows only (advanced)<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Select the system drive where Windows 7 is installed.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
You will receive the following warning:<br />
The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
(At all cost, do NOT click anything named Format or Delete or Partition. So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. Click OK<br />
Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your computer, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and drivers.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers. Or you can use Windows Easy Transfer to restore your backup.<br />

<p><br />
You are now running 64 bit Windows 7. <br />

<h2>            Resident Evil 0 still shutting off Xbox One X, and S during cutscenes</h2>
                    I've done soft reset, hard reset, different X box, delete local saves etc.&nbsp; Pretty much I have done every trouble shooting thing the help desk tells you to do no matter what game it is and very rarely works in my experience.&nbsp; The problem is the game and
 there has been no update or fix since October and it happens during cutscenes and shuts off my entire Xbox One X, which you think would be a problem for Microsoft that they'd want to fix. Every other game in a library of 80 games works fine except this one.&nbsp;
 I can't return it even though its under 14 days so essentially Capcom with Microsoft's help has been profiting off of a broken game and they know it's broken.&nbsp; I would say it wasn't intentional but the fact that they close threads, don't offer any actual help,
 and haven't at least said they'd look into it makes me think it is.&nbsp; I wan't a ETA on a fix please or can you take the game off Xbox Marketplace and give us refunds.

            I had to uninstall the game entirely, Then clear local saved games and the MAC address before installing again to make it work. I had to do this 2-3 times though.

<p>Hello Cpl Baker,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not believe any further troubleshooting will resolve this issue. An update needs to be rolled out as a fix. This issue has already been acknowledged by Xbox in the article above,&nbsp;linked to you by Erick. I have found a more recent article that I would
 like to bring to your attention : <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2019/01/11/new-preview-delta-1902-build-1-11-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
New Preview Delta 1902 Build – 1/11/2019</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Fixes to various games (e.g. Resident Evil 0) in which cutscenes would fail and the game would lock.&nbsp; The cutscenes now play as designed."</em></p>
<p>This update is purely for preview members, and has not been rolled out to the public yet. The last public update was on 12/13/2018.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, the issue is in fact being looked into, and it looks like they were able to fix it in beta as of 1/11/2019. Now we need to wait it out until the update goes live. For updates on that, follow
<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">News.Xbox.com</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            What would help is if you took down the broken game. You agree that it exists as you've said but are selling it as defective. On top of that not giving refunds.&nbsp; How do we troubleshoot that?&nbsp;

<p>Hello again,</p>

</p><p>Unfortunately, what you are requesting is impossible for us to do. Xbox forums are supported by ambassadors and Microsoft support agents, that cannot take items off of the marketplace or approve refunds that have been denied. We try to give the best troubleshooting
 steps to resolve issues, or give helpful information for bigger issues such as this.

 are final. However, <a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/payment-and-purchases/request-refund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the refund form </a>is still there (in supported regions) so that you can request them and state your case. Otherwise, you would need to

<h2>            Others Cannot Hear Me on XBox One Headset</h2>
                    
<p>I just bought both a new headset and a headset adapter (for my good pair of headphones) and went to use them this afternoon, and I am having trouble chatting with others in parties online. &nbsp;I can hear the others in the party through my headset and also on
 my headphones when using them, but my microphone isn't picking anything up on my end. &nbsp;My green dot in the party never lights up to signify that I'm speaking. &nbsp;Party chat worked just fine for me as recently as Thursday evening.</p>

<p>I can chat with others through the Kinect mic just fine, but I don't want to have to use that all the time for chat purposes.</p>

<p>Any insight or help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Browse internet on Xbox 360 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Browse internet on Xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm trying to set up my xbox to browse the internet.</p>
<p>I have a PC running windows 7 home premium. I have set up media center and configured the Xbox as an extender - this part seems to be working as I can play my music on the xbox.</p>
<p>I have installed MCE browser on the PC, but can't get it to work. I understand the program should appear in 'Extras' but it doesn't. Interestingly, the extras folder on the xbox is emtpy but on the PC it contains the free games like chess.</p>

<p>Please help!</p>
<p>Thanks, Simon</p>

            I'd also change the Theme at Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Themes which has the effect of resetting the Graphics settings.  You can also choose from many more spectacular free slideshow Themes here to download and install to the Themes collection:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collections/windowsthemes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collectio...</a>
<br />
<br />Check also at Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Colors &gt; High Contrast settings that High Contrast is disabled.  A new Theme should reset this.
