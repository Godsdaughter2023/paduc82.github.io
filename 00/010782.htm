            Hi&nbsp;secondlife2,
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Just to state the obvious, you're going to need either a cellular data plan or WiFi to access web pages on your Lumia 710. With that said, can you connect to a WiFi hotspot and access any websites (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="http://m.bing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://m.bing.com</a>)?
 Insure your WiFi is on and connected to a hotspot by going to Settings =&gt; Wi-Fi. You can if it is on and if you're connected.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If yes, then let's try resetting your device by pressing and holding the power button for 10-12 seconds, until your phone reboots and you can see the first splash screen appear (usually your cellular service provider); now see if it works. By rebooting
 your device in this manner, you can sometimes re-align your device with a service provider's tower set by performing this procedure.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If yes, then let's check a few things on the cellular side:</div>
<div><br />
<div>On your Lumia 710, go to Settings ==&gt; cellular ==&gt; insure data is on. &nbsp;Also confirm that the network listed is your phone carrier.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Next, go to Airplane Mode and insure it is turned off.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You'll also need to confirm with your cellular service provider that data is working in your location. Sometimes carriers have service outages in areas for maintenance or due to lightning strikes or some other reason.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If all else fails, then I would try returning your device to either where you bought it or your carrier's service center to have it checked out.</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this helps!<br />
David</div>

            Exactly, it's available on the OVI store.<br />
<br />
However, it's pretty useless, to be honest. I don't bother with it. I find it much faster to point the browser at
<a href="http://m.facebook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://m.facebook.com</a> or, if you want to try the iPhone-specific portal you can try
<a href="http://iphone.facebook.com." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://iphone.facebook.com.</a><br />
<br />
You can then upload photos to your wall by e-mail and you can also use SMS for status updates (they come out of your bundle if you're on a contract with O2).

<p>That is pretty much the sum of it...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use the m.facebook.com with opera mini 5...works wonderfully. &nbsp;But the app is&nbsp;ridiculously useless. &nbsp;I also use HelloTXT in opera Widgets app to update my status. &nbsp;I use that so I can update more than one site at the same time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also tried Symabook...It's cute but it is extremely buggy; it is in it's alpha phase right now. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Blackjack II lost some talk button functionality</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
I have an ATT/Samsung BJII, until recently when I hit the talk button on my phone from the home screen it would bring up my call history. From that point I could select a number and hit the talk button again and it would dial that number. Now all of a sudden
 it no longer does that. I now literally have to press a number say like 3 and it will bring up all the 301 numbers, then select a number and press enter which brings up another screen at which point I have to move down to make a&nbsp;call and hit enter or the center
 button again. I don't know what happened or what changed but I really want my talk button functionality back.

            <p>Hi, Have tried Troubleshoot App without success, unable to do option 2 as Windows 8.1 was pre installed and no DVD was provided. There was not a problem until I upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; I now have the News App closing immediately on opening and Sleep does
 not work. The laptop seems to close down and I have to power off and on rebooting the system to bring up.&nbsp; I have an HP Pavilion Laptop which is less than twelve months old.&nbsp;Performance is also very poor&nbsp;&nbsp;since upgrading. Have checked the Power and&nbsp;keyboard
 &nbsp;settings.</p>

            <p>I have tried the trouble shooter and as I have seen documented by many users, it doesn't work at all. &nbsp;I have also tried, re-registering along with other several other methods I found on the internet (non--microsoft). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of them work. &nbsp;However, I did learn that the apps are failing because of an update from Microsoft which makes it appear that I am not registered for Windows 10 apps. &nbsp;This is a coding problem from Microsoft. &nbsp;I would expect much better customer support
 for an issue that was caused by Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If Microsoft is going to shut down the previous versions of Skype and not include the same features, especially of automatic answer, they have just made their new version of little value to my 101 year old mother who cannot operate her own computer. That
 cuts her off from her family. It requires everyone who otherwise would contact her to have the ability to operate her computer remotely. I don't know if MS really feels the significance of removing this automatic answer feature.
</p>
<p>I will attempt again to reinstall the previous version. It didn't work for me yesterday.
</p>
<p>What a waste of time this has become in accepting the threat that our previous version of Skype was going to be taken away from us if we didn't upgrade. Don't call it an upgrade when in reality it is a downgrade.</p>

<p>Thank you, Pedro M. The download for the previous version worked and is up and running. The automatic answer feature works in this version and must work in the next update if it is to have much of any value to our family and our mother who absolutely depends
 on the automatic answer feature. With the continuing threat that MS will update our Skype 7 automatically at some near date in the future, it will truly be a sad day if MS refusing to keep the automatic answer feature and the choice to only allow those on
 our contact list to call. Please, please hear us on this matter. It is very, very important.</p>

<h2>            Tethering with Windows Mobile Device &#40;WM 6.0&#41;</h2>
                    Ok, I have my Windows Mobile 6.0 device (Motorola Q9h/Global) set up to tether with my USB cable connected to my laptop - although I have had issues getting this to tether using Bluetooth.
<br />
<br />
I can use sync with WMDC just find using Bluetooth so I have a good connection established.<br />
<br />
Any resources you can recommend or tip to get this tethered (acting as a modem to get online with my laptop) using Bluetooth?<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />

 some point that the GSM service was on. To me, the sim card was the culprit or else the the OS would have produced an error if it was the software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glad that your issue is resolved.</p>

<h2>            Activation Problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have got a big problem. I just got a message from Windows, that I have to activate Windows 10.</p>
<p>Here is the full situation of the problem:</p>
<p>A year ago I had Windows 8.1 installed on my PC, I decided to join the Windows Insider Preview to have a look at Windows 10.&nbsp; I did like the new OS a lot and decided to remain on the Insider Preview builds. But this Monday, I had some issues with my PC.
 I couldn't start the Store app nor the Xbox app and a lot other apps. So I searched some information about it on the internet. I found a lot of 'fixes' but none of them actually worked. So I decided to reinstall Windows. (Not with an USB or installation disk,
 but through Settings &gt; Security &gt; Systemrecovery &gt; Reinstall this PC)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean install. But when it was on 71% with the installation progress, it gave an error; Something went wrong.</p>
<p>So I shut the PC down and started it back on. My motherboard said I had no bootable device installed. So I removed my SSD from my (desktop) computer and looked for some left over files on another PC. There only where two folders left; the&nbsp;'Windows' and the
 'Users' folder. Then I made a bootable USB device with the Windows tool to make that (found on the Microsoft page). Then I&nbsp;placed&nbsp;the SSD back in the PC and tried to install Windows on it with the USB. It gave an error; Couldn't make a partition, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to format the SSD and see if that worked, that worked&nbsp;but unfortunately, it did not solve the problem.</p>
<p>The next step I tried to do was; remove all the other USB devices that where plugged in, and that did work.</p>
<p>After like an hour Windows was successfully installed without any errors. But a few days later I got the message 'Activate Windows'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But don't have any (physical)&nbsp;key because I had my PC build&nbsp;by my own. (So there is no sticker on it)</p>
<p>I bought the Windows 8.1 version almost 2 years ago but I lost the mail where the product key was in.</p>
<p>Also when I upgraded Windows 10 it was said that I did not need to have a new product key. Even when you installed it with Windows Insider Preview. (Like I did)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&nbsp; Error code at the Windows activation menu: 0x803F7001</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked for help at the Microsoft Answer Tech online Chat.</p>
<p>He/she said she couldn't help me so I was directed to this page, (at the community, engineers). &gt; http://puu.sh/oj6vb/17a82fa1a6.png</p>
<p>
</p><p>So does an engineer have an explanation for this, and how can I properly activate Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reading,</p>

<p>Do you think you had Digital Entitlement on that PC.?&nbsp; From what you say, your W8.1 should have gone to W10 and the PC should have permanent activation based on the current motherboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; A hard drive swap should not knock out Digital Entitlement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it just possible that the activation servers are just slow?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All Insider builds are issued with an expiry date.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I run "winver" on my W10 Pro at 14316, it states that the 14316 built has activation till July 2016.&nbsp; However, under Settings and Activation, my PC shows as Digital Entitlement.&nbsp;

            <p>When I signed up for Windows Insider, it said that everyone that would have signed up for it they would get a free product key. So that means I got a new one, right? So maybe it did not activate because I have to use a Insider build instead of the main build...</p>

<p>Ok, it has been a while but I think it went like this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Those with a qualifying W7 or W8.1 license got to go to the matching edition in W10.&nbsp; You should have qualified with your W8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you had to install the 10240 edition even if you were on Insiders.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Insiders program was not a guarantee of a free license, the Insider folk just got to stay with their installed W10 Insider edition without having to go back to prior O/S, be
 it W7 or W8.1.&nbsp; Therefore, everyone had to start at 10240 whether they were coming from W7 or W8.1 to W10 public build or the Insiders could just stay on W10 and install 10240 to get Digital Activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm that my PCs have Digital Entitlement but both my Non-Insider PCs and my Insider PCs all started at 10240.&nbsp; It is clearly published that once a PC gets Digital Entitlement, then clean installs can be done as often as desired because the PC is
 activated for life with the current motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you trace your steps as to how you got past July 2015?&nbsp;&nbsp; It follows that an Insider build could just move from a build prior to July 2015 to a build past July 2015 and never have become activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your PC does not have Digital Entitlement, then this likely means that you currently hold&nbsp; a valid W8.1 license.&nbsp; Once you clarify these points, you then can take steps to get properly activated.&nbsp; You cannot have both, a W8.1 license and an activated
 W10 that should have consumed the W8.1 license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,</p>

            <p>Perhaps the easiest thing to do would be to clean install Windows 8.1 again and activate it with your 8.1 key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have done that and 8.1 is activated then you can upgrade to the release build of Windows 10 which should then activate with digital entitlement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From this point onwards you will be ok to stay with Windows 10 release or switch to insider builds.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you don't have that key then it looks like you'll have to purchase a Windows 10 license as you have neither the Windows 8.1 nor Windows 10 release keys.</p>

<p>Hi Remo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not take this personally but <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
what you did is <strong>NOT a Clean Install</strong></span>. If you initiate a Install/Repair process from within a running OS al manner of info is passed on from the old, broken, install into the new one. Info regarding your account, drivers, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI (and indeed all Insiders):</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1) A Clean Install must be initiated by booting from installable Media.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) A Clean Install can only be done unto a blank partition (formatting the partition during the install is OK)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The difference is crucial and, in your case, quite likely the cause of you not being able to fix the trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, don't take this as anything personal as many Insiders make the same mistake, so I thought it high time somebody clarified this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, back to your problem, if you had 'digital entitlement' then you should be ok. To find out whether you had it, why not simply try and doing a (true)
<strong>Clean Install</strong> using a bootable USB-stick created by the <strong>
Media Creation Tool. </strong>It really does not matter which version you install as long as it is W10. (W8.1 will not work unless you have the key). During the install you will be asked for a license key, simply select 'I do not have a key'. It will then ask
 whether you want to install the Pro or the Home version: select the one that you had installed before.
</p>
<p>Then sign in with your MSA and continue the install. When all is done and you did have DE then it will automatically restore it. If you did not, then, unfortunately, you are in trouble and will need to buy a new license. I know of nothing you can do about
 this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming (quite) a bit of knowledge of going about this on your side. If you have never done this and/or have questions, please do not hesitate to post. There are plenty out here willing to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>

<br />My name is Kyle and I am an Independent Advisor.
<br />I would like to help you.
<br />
<br />I suggest you take a look at the following link that deals with Data Model specification and limits to clarify your doubts regarding the file size limit for MS Excel.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/data-model-specification-and-limits-19aa79f8-e6e8-45a8-9be2-b58778fd68ef?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/data-m...</a>
<br />
<br />Maybe the problem is that you have little storage capacity on your mobile device.

                    Does anyone's GPS have a life of its own? I have a WM6.0 pocket PC which has built-in GPS. Most applications seem happy enough turning the GPS receiver on and off when needed. However, recently some of them seem to leave the GPS receiver on even after
 I've shut them down. At the moment the GPS receiver is always on and I can't see any way WM6.0 can switch it off.&nbsp; I've tried soft reset etc. This may well be a fault of the software concerned (in this case, Co-Pilot Live 8). But does anyone know how WM 6.0
 can force the GPS receiver off? It is a pity " comm manager" doesn't have a GPS control, that could force the GPS receiver to turn off if anything goes wrong!

How do you know the GPS is on after you shut down a program that was using it?&nbsp; Even if it was on then a soft reset should bring&nbsp;the device&nbsp;back to a "fresh" state.&nbsp; I would be surprised if it was on (but am not sure how you would know if it is or is not).

            As with most smart-phones, this one has LEDs that show when, for example, the GPS receiver is on, or Wi-Fi is being used. After a soft reset the GPS receiver isn't being used immediately, but once Co-Pilot Live 8 appears in the Today screen [as an option
 - not actually running as an application], the GPS LED turns on. I am 99% sure this is a bug with the very new Co-Pilot Live 8 software, and have reported it to the suppliers (ALK).<br />
<br />
I was just wondering if anyone knows, within WM6.0, how to forcibly turn the GPS receiver off? Clearly, being on all of the time is unnecessarily draining the battery.

That is not the case with ANY of my devices (but boy do I wish it was).<br />
<br />
Frankly I'm surprised that the GPS is on when the program is not running and would guess that it is not but that the LED light you reference is just not turning off&nbsp; (just a guess though...).

            On my HTC Diamond in the system settings, I have an icon for External GPS, this has all of the setting for the GPS. On the 3rd tab (Access), I have the option to turn the automatic GPS management off. Have you tried that at all?

            I have tried that, but to no avail. I still suspect it is a bug with third-party software, but haven't yet found a way of turning the GPS receiver off. The ultimate proof would be to uninstall the software I suspect is responsible, of course.

I might try that x2008 .... it certainly would help in bringing about some resolution.&nbsp; After doing that, try BING or Google Maps to see what happens.<br />

                    When I type in an email address in the "To" row in order to send that person an email message, is there any way I can configure Outlook so it keeps showing the full email address and doesn't change it to display the Contact name.

            This is actually more a security issue and shockingly not available. With email spoofing and other phishing issues it sure would be helpful to see the return domains on a list of to's and cc's.

    <title>N97 Mini Security Module Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ichwong  say:</h3>
<h2>            N97 Mini Security Module Error</h2>
                    
<p>After countless of trial and error with the "Security Module Error" I got with my new N97 mini,</p>
<p>I think I found the pattern that reproduce the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) The error seldom happens when the phone is fresh (without installing any application)</p>
<p>2) The phone still fine after installing my collection of applications (.sis, .sisx).</p>
<p>3) Still OK after installing the latest OVI client.</p>
<p>4) Still OK after installing the "Bright Light Torch".</p>
<p>5) Restart the phone and the nightmare starts.</p>
<p>6) Let it sits still for several minutes until the screen goes blank.</p>
<p>7) Unlock the screen and select the setup menu, "security module error" may&nbsp;occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the way to resolve this is to restart the phone and then fire up the setup menu</p>
<p>once the phone boots up. &nbsp;It seems this may interrupt the start up process and you may</p>
<p>able to bypass some security checking for a while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, uninstall the "Bright Light Torch" and the problem goes away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, base on a blind guess, it seems the problem related to how the software is delivered.</p>
<p>The said "Bright Light Torch" is delivered as ".dm" forward protected file which disallow you</p>
<p>from copying the file to another phone. &nbsp;I think it may be something wrong in N97 mini DRM</p>
<p>checking and result in the sad issue with the new N97 mini and also N97 2.0 software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you face similar problem, I hope my experience in this issue may be helpful to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, I have perform some further tests on the subject and observe a workaround for my configuration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I usually enable only "Shortcut 1" and "Calendar" application at the standby screen.</p>
<p>Since I easily got the "Security Module Error" after installing just a few of widgets and AppleDailiy application, I also observe other N97 mini users and see if they face the similar problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see that some users can set their N97 mini with background images and also used up all</p>
<p>the application on the standby screen.&nbsp; So, I also decide to try enabling more applications in</p>
<p>the standby screen to see if it made any difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I setup 3 applications at the standby screen including "Shortcut 1", "Calendar" and "Music Player".</p>
<p>After that, I don't experience any "Security Module Error" even after installing all the applications that failed in the original configuration including the "Bright Light Torch".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>I installed a 16gb memory card last week and since then I've had an intermittent 'Security Module Error'. I also get occasional random reboots and 'memory full, close some applications' errors (it isn't).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just wiped the phone but after installing OVI Store and OVI Maps the errors continue.</p>

<p>I've found more information on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems when the phone starts up there is a process scanning/using the memory card (I don't have a task manager installed so can't see which one). This blocks the system from using the memory card/viewing security modules/whatever it does.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This process can be easily killed by opening the file manager, select 'remove memory card' and then exit the file manager (but don't remove the memory card).</p>
<p>Should then work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a slightly messy workaround but it fixes the problem (until a restart).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However I still get 'memory full' messages intermittently. Rebooting still seems to be the best option :smileymad:.</p>

<p>I have already formatted the memory card, mass memory, done a hard reset and re-installed everything. And I have Music Player on the Shortcuts widget (but not the music player widget).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm thinking it could be the Music App or Search Indexer re-indexing the memory card.</p>
<p>Perhaps it'll fix itself in a couple of days as it indexes all the folders? Here's hoping :smileywink:.</p>

<p>I think the security module error may be caused by apps that are installed before the memory card is inserted. For some reason inserting the memory card messes up their installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My recommendation is put the memory card in before installing most apps, especially third party ones (especially Offscreen apps).</p>

            The only issue is if you actually rename your email address. Then you have to hard reset your phone.&nbsp;Otherwise, you can use Outlook.com today with your current address. If you want an Outlook.com address, I suggest you setup an alias rather than rename.

<p>How do I access files on my phone's memory (internal and SD-card)? The phone used to appear in My Computer, so I could access the files using explorer.exe, but now in my Windows XP I cannot find my phone even while the Nokia Suite works fine and synced my
 photos and address book. I need to access files in one of my own folders so the sync does not help me to access the files. Where did the phone disappear from my My Computer? Thanks in advance for any help, *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>

            have you checked in the phone that the connection mode is set to "Always ask every time", and that when you connect the phone, you select Mass Memory mode, not Nokia / Ovi / PC Suite mode.

            Hello Borut,
<br />
<br />my name is Manuel and I am an independent adivsor.
<br />The way Excel interprets date formats depends on your system settings.
<br />This article shows you how to change the date and time format on Windows:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-the-date-system-format-or-two-digit-year-interpretation-aaa2159b-4ae8-4651-8bce-d4707bc9fb9f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change...</a>
<br />
<br />Additionally you can specify custom date formats which apply to Excel only. 
<br />This article explains how it's done:

            Hi Borut
<br />
<br />Open the old Control Panel (click your Start Button, then just type control and hit Enter)
<br />
<br />Make sure view is set to icons at the top right of Control Panel
<br />
<br />Click Region, then click 'Additional Settings' on the resulting dialog
<br />
<br />Choose the Date Tab on the second dialog
<br />
<br />Is the correct date format set there?
<br />
<br />
<br />If the correct Date format is already set there:
<br />
<br />Open that file in Excel and select that whole column of data
<br />
<br />Right click and choose Format Cells
<br />
<br />What is the exact format are those cells set to?

<p>From your screenshots, it appears that your system regional settings is dd-mm-yyyy and that the csv has dates in mm/dd/yyyy format</p>
<p>
</p><p>so some dates like 10-09-18 would have got converted in excel&nbsp; as 10-sep-18 instead of 09-Oct-18.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the entire date column, Do Data&gt;"Text to column" &gt; Delimited &gt; Tab &gt; Text</p>
<p>&nbsp;- This would convert all dates to text</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then change your regional settings from control panel to&nbsp; English (United States)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next do Data&gt;"Text to column" &gt; Delimited &gt; Tab &gt; General </p>
<p>&nbsp;- This would convert all your dates to date format</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next change your regional settings from Control panel to English (UK) or whatever it was earlier for DD-MM-YYYY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should do it.</p>
