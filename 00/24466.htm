<h2>            Office XP Data Access Page crashes in XP&#47;IE8</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am trying to create a data access page based off a form I made that allows one to edit records by selecting a ID from a dropdown box which populates the other related fields in text boxes on the form and those fields can then be edited and saved
 by clicking a button on the form. Sounds pretty simple. Anyways, I'm running the latest version of Windows XP with Internet Explorer 8 and have found that Access crashes when creating the DAP with the error:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>EventType : BEX P1 : MSACCESS.EXE P2 : 10.0.6501.0 P3 : 3fcd98d4</p>
<p>P4 : mshtml.dll P5 : 8.0.6001.18783 P6 : 4a0a5789 P7 : 0008a2a3</p>
<p>P8 : c0000409 P9 : 00000000 </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I try opening the DAP after Access crashes IE8 will also crash with the error:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>AppName: iexplore.exe AppVer: 8.0.6001.18702 ModName: mshtml.dll</p>
<p>ModVer: 8.0.6001.18783 Offset: 000d69f2</p>
<p>Instruction at 0x051c0247 referenced memory at 0x051c0247. The memory could not be written.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a bug introduced by IE8/7? If so, is there a patch I can apply to resolve this issue? Thanks for any assistance that can be offered.</p>

            <p>Thanks, I'll try that. But I also realized that when trying to edit my code in Access XP it crashes with a oleaut32.dll error. As a little background, I did originally make this database in Access 2007, including the forms and associated VBA code, and then
 saved it as a 2002 compatible database from Office 2007. I'm currently also running both versions of Access side by side. Could any of these scenarios be a contributor to my troubles? If so, what's the best resolution? Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>I've got a nice, simple way of&nbsp; moving my PST to other PCs as needed, usually to my traveling laptop.<br />
</p>
<p>I'm setting up a new traveling lappie now, and would like to install either Office 2013 or 2016 on it (32-bit in either case).&nbsp; I haven't decided which, but want to make sure that moving the PST back and forth between them every so often won't cause issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts you have on this would be very much appreciated; thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmmm..........let me try a longer answer with an appropriate embedded "disclaimer" as it applies to my own experience along with suggestions that probably don't apply to the vast majority of people who may end up reading this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - I have a variety of test PST files that I move between various Outlook versions on a regular basis. None of the Outlook versions use any kind of 3rd party sync/anti-spam addins nor are any 3rd party apps in use that integrate themselves with Outlook
 - or to put this another way, chance of any kind of corruption resulting from 3rd party apps (addin or otherwise) is non-existent. This movement of files is not something I do on a daily (or otherwise frequent regular) basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Next item is that all PST files that get moved around are &lt;Unicode&gt; format files. I would never suggest anyone to move ANSI format PST files be moved back and forth or to put it even more directly, highly recommend that (1) scanpst file is run on any
 ANSI based PST file and then (2) get converted to UNICODE in whatever older OL version is being used BEFORE it's opened in OL'2013/'2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My experience over a lot of years is that I have never run across an issue moving a PST file between any Outlook versions nor have I run across any scenarios/docs that would contradict that experience. The critical caveat to all of this are the scenarios
 outlined in item #1. It is possible to have a 3rd party program cause a potential issue in a data file that may not be immediately (or ever) be noticed but get impacted when moved between old and new versions of Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To summarize, if it were me and I wanted/needed to do what you want to do with an already working procedure to move PST data files that has been working, introducing OL'2013/'2016 into the mix wouldn't deter me but to repeat, I don't move production PST
 files between systems on a day-to-day basis as part of any kind of standard operating procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those who may be reading this and not familiar with how to determine if a PST file is ANSI or UNICODE - the process is simply right-clicking on the root of the PST file in any version of Outlook --&gt; Data File Properties --&gt; Advanced --&gt; if the &lt;Format&gt;
 description includes "97-2002" then &nbsp;it's an ANSI file (something that may well be the case for those who have migrated a PST file created in OL'2002(XP) to succeeding new versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, would advise anyone following this practice to maintain multi-generational backup copies of the PST file(s) being moved (multi-generational = a fancy term for multiple copies that get rotated.</p>

<p><span>Hi Ayesha,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To access room mailbox, since my account is an online account, I often login Outlook Web App through my own account credential, click My accounts tile-&gt;Open another mailbox…-&gt;input room address-&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Whether you can delete it via OWA, and access room via OWA? If&nbsp; Outlook Web Version works fine, it most likely the client issue, you may try to create new Outlook Profile via Control Panel-&gt;Mail-&gt;Show Profile…-&gt;Add,
 and configure your account in this new test profile(don’t delete the old one) to see if issue persists, this way will re-sync mailboxes settings from server to local client:

</p><p>I tried to repro the issue and it said data not available. Possible reasons when you get Data not available while adding symbols are:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The company has merged with another company.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>The company had a name change.</span></p>
<p><span>The company has been delisted (indicated by symbols such as .PK, .OB or .OTCBB).</span></p>
<p><span>The company has filed financial statements late or even gone bankrupt.</span></p>

    <title>Vector graphics artefacts&#58; saving Powerpoint graphics to PDF - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Vector graphics artefacts&#58; saving Powerpoint graphics to PDF results in blurred pixels</h2>
                    <p>I have used Powerpoint 2016 to create a complex plot, based on an imported EMF graph saved from Matlab and some line drawings added in Powerpoint. I would like to save the entire contents of the Powerpoint slide as a PDF or EPS file, so as to have the figure
 as zoomable (as vector graphics).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Selecting the entire slide contents and right-clicking SavePictureAs only gives me EMF as the only vector graphics option, so instead I saved the entire presentation (consisting of a single slide) as a PDF. However, several parts of the image (those that
 were imported as a vector graphics EMF from Matlab) appear blurred in the saved PDF:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92547ba2-8776-4e96-a54a-2bec60aeddcd?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92547ba2-8776-4e96-a54a-2bec60aeddcd?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>.. even though they look fine when viewed in Powerpoint:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/959532fb-dcc7-4923-850d-317f637e7732?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/959532fb-dcc7-4923-850d-317f637e7732?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Here is another example of a figure that looks fine in Powerpoint but blurred when saved as PDF:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f23a0590-b13d-4b17-b113-0518abeec318?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f23a0590-b13d-4b17-b113-0518abeec318?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a2bb798-34e1-4e44-8a77-171b008cf90d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a2bb798-34e1-4e44-8a77-171b008cf90d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried some online converters to go from EMF (which Powerpoint can save into) to either PDF or EPS, but each of those produce its own type of artefact.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest a solution to save this Powerpoint content into an artefact-free PDF or EPS file?</p>

<p>First off, THANK YOU for providing the before/after screen shots of each problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not at all sure what's causing the wildly pixellated results in the second set of images, but the problem in the first set is something I've seen before in one form or another.&nbsp; A few things to try that'll help pinpoint the problem (I hope):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Make sure you're saving the PDF by choosing File | Save As | Save as type:&nbsp; and choosing PDF rather than File | Save As Adobe PDF</p>
<p>
</p><p>- When you create the PDF via File | Save As | Save as type:&nbsp; {choose PDF}, you have the option to save a PDF for Print or Online use (words to that effect).&nbsp; Try both to see if changing that setting has any effect.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- On a copy of your presentation, ungroup the chart (several times, until you can select the light-grey parallelogram and delete it; then replace it with an identical new shape set to grey fill and change the transparency to give the same effect as the original.&nbsp;
 Then make PDF again as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could provide screen shots of the results, that'd be great.&nbsp; And if you can, post a small presentation with just this slide (or better, one with both of the problem slides) on OneDrive/Dropbox/etc so we can have a go at them on our own PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Thanks Steve. Under SaveAs I only have 'PDF', which is what I've been choosing. Whether choosing&nbsp;Print or Online/minimal use, seems to make no difference in the blurring problem I have.&nbsp; I also played around with the few options at the bottom of the PDF
 options screen, but with no different end result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your third suggestion is not easy to implement, as I no longer have the original EMF with the 2D histogram which is the main part of the plot, and could not easily recreate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PPTX file, if anyone has time to try out some more things, is here:&nbsp;http://www.filedropper.com/test_71</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for your help!</p>

<p>Thanks for sharing the file.&nbsp; I get the same results here, so either neither of us is going mad or we're both in good company. ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I extracted the original EMF from the PPTX (made a copy of the PPTX, changed the extension to .ZIP, opened that, went into the \ppt\media folder and dragged the single EMF out onto the desktop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened that in CorelDraw, which is a bit more sophisticated than PPT about these things and picked it apart, found that the four pictures in the graph are 7x7 pixel images.&nbsp; Each of the little squares within them is literally one individual pixel.&nbsp; Blown
 WAY up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PowerPoint has always tried to help with images by antialiasing them; or in plain English, blurring and upsampling them to remove the jaggies.&nbsp; And there's no way to make it stop "helping".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what you have here is extremely small images, which provoked PPT into an utter frenzy of antialiasing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had the original images that made up the EMF, you could upsample them in an image editing program w/o antialiasing, but since you don't, about the best suggestion I have is to make a copy of the slide, ungroup the graphic until you can grab just the
 image with four little pictures and the gradient scale.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy that then use Paste Special to paste back a PNG.</p>
<p>Crop the pasted PNG back down to just one of the four pictures.</p>
<p>Copy and crop three more times until you've got four pictures.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Move them atop the original pictures in the EMF and NOW they should go to PDF as you expect them to.&nbsp; Tested and working as described here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WAY more work than you should reasonably have to do, so if anyone's got a better idea, please, let's hear it.</p>

<p>Thank you so much Steve for this detailed investigation and workaround, that's really useful, especially since I too doubt that there is any other easier solution. One such solution that I hoped would work (it didn't)&nbsp; is to save the PPT contents as EMF,
 import into Word, then save the Word document as PDF - however, the same anti-aliasing occurs, so it seems Word has the same algorithms for blurring edges that Powerpoint does, and they also cannot be turned off, at least not from the few options you are presented
 with in the SaveAs window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution with four resized PNGs would have normally been fine, however in my case I actually need the final PDF to contain no bitmap/raster elements, whereas I think if I go through PNG I lose the vector aspect of the 7x7 histograms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The EMF figure was generated with, and saved from Matlab, so I could potentially go in there, change a few parameters to the code, run and regenerate the figure. But I'm not sure that would help,&nbsp;unless I could upsample this original EMF - which with InkScape
 I wasn't sure how to do (CorelDraw I do not have).<br />

<p>&gt;&gt; The solution with four resized PNGs would have normally been fine, however in my case I actually need the final PDF to contain no bitmap/raster elements, whereas I think if I go through PNG I lose the vector aspect of the 7x7 histograms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm glad you mentioned that again.&nbsp; Even if the original EMF *had* printed correctly, wouldn't have fit the "all vector" requirement.&nbsp; See, EMF and WMF are both sort of "shells" that can (and usually do) contain vector graphics, but they can also include
 raster images, which is what the four individual images are, actually.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So another alternative, one that I like better than my first suggestion:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the same slide as the existing graph, draw a 7x7 grid of squares in PowerPoint.&nbsp; Select them all, then make three duplicates of the grid.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now use the eyedropper tool to pick up the color of each of the original squares and apply it to the corresponding square in the grid you just drew.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To use the eyedropper, select a shape, then on the formatting tab, click the triangle next to Shape Fill in the Shape Styles group to get the eyedropper cursor; use it to click the color you want to pick up and apply to the selected shape.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It'll save you loads of clickyclicky if you customize the eyedropper onto the QAT (Quick Access Toolbar)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And hold the presses:&nbsp; I got to wondering whether the slide size (huge) of your presentation had anything to do with this, so I created a new blank PPTX at the usual default size, then copy/pasted your graphic into it (chose to Paste as Picture, which won't
 be vector, mind you) and voila, it behaves when saved as PDF.&nbsp; Granted, it's not the size you intended, but if this is to become a poster, generally anyone who prints the PDF to a large format printer can opt to scale it to whatever size the printer supports
 and should be familiar with doing so.</p>

<p><span>True, but as I mentioned earlier, the images will NEVER be vector graphics because they're not vector graphics to start with.&nbsp; They're raster graphics within an EMF file.&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that you are having issues with JavaScript when using Internet Explorer. I will be happy to help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span> </span></span></span><span>Do you receive any pop-up or error message regarding JavaScript when trying to access website?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span> </span></span></span><span>Is the issue confined to a specific website?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span> </span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span> </span></span></span><span>Are you using Metro Internet Explorer or desktop Internet Explorer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>5)<span> </span></span></span><span>Have you checked in Compatibility mode?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> I would suggest you to v</span><span>erify that Active Scripting, ActiveX, and Java are not being blocked by Internet Explorer</span></p>
<p><span>a) Start Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>b) On the <b>Tools </b>menu, click <b>Internet Options</b>. If you can't see the
<b>Tools</b>menu, press Alt to display the menus.</span></p>
<p><span>c) In the <b>Internet Options</b> dialog box, click the <b>Security</b> tab.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click <b>Default Level</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>e) Click <b>OK</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span> ActiveX controls and Java programs are turned off in the High security level in Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Disable Script Debugging</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) On the <b>Tools </b>menu, click <b>Internet Options</b>. If you can't see the
<b>Tools</b>menu, press Alt to display the menus.</span></p>
<p><span>b) On the <b>Advanced </b>tab, click to clear the <b>Display a notification about every script error
</b>box, and then click <b>OK</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>Try to open a webpage on which you previously received a scripting error. If you do not receive the error, the problem is resolved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: </span></b><span>If you have not checked it in compatibility mode, then check in compatibility mode and check if it works.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 4: </span></b><span>Try updating the JavaScript from the following Java link and check.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Download Java:</span></b><span> <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

What does that have to do with anything? That's a Java download link. The problem is with JavaScript. They're two completely different products.<br />

<div><br />
<div>I found out that it was because my previous antivirus did not uninstall completely, hence I could not install the latest java. Thus my javascript wasn't working.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I performed a clean uninstall of the antivirus using a software I downloaded online and then installed java from the java website. Everything works fine now.</div>

<h2>            &#39;Reply All&#39; to meeting participants</h2>
                    <p>Why is it that sometimes "Reply to All with Email" is in the menu of an Outlook meeting and other times "Reply to All with IM" is available? I am the
 meeting organizer for both. I used Lync for both. This is very annoying because I want to send out meeting notes to all attendees with the meeting details in the body of my email. I have to re-create when I can't "Replay to All with Email".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I there was another question like this which I have been providing information on since Nov 2013, but I haven't received any reply on it. Perhaps you might be able to use some of this information to determine what could be the issue?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My post from Nov 2013:<br />
</p>
<p>I am having the same problem with MS outlook (Microsoft Office Standard 2010, version 14.0.6129.5000 64-bit). I have used the "reply to all with email" feature for months without problem (I am a PM have been sending out notes from my meetings to all the
 attendees via this feature).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However over the past few weeks I have on occasion the same problem - I have the option "New email to attendees"&nbsp;, but not "reply to all with email". I prefer Reply to All because it used to copy in all the meeting information (attendees, time, subject etc.)
 but now even when this option does appear (can't tell why is does and why it sometimes doesn't) it copies only the meeting details into the email, but NOT the subject, attendees list, time etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So something is now behaving differently. I never experienced either of these behaviors aside from the past few weeks/(possibly months - not sure when it started, but its happening all the time now instead of occasionally).</p>
<p>In terms of exact steps:</p>
<p>1. Go into Calendar</p>
<p>2. Find the relevant meeting (it always in the past, if that matters) and open it by double clicking</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; - it usually a recurring meeting, as I am wanting to send out the notes from weekly status updates or monthly steering committee meetings.</p>
<p>&nbsp; - it doesn't matter if I select "Open this occurrence" or "Open the series"</p>
<p>3. Click on "Contact Attendees"</p>
<p>4. The only option available is "New E-Mail to attendees". No longer see "Reply to all with email"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE!!!</p>
<p>In writing the above description, I tried to find a meeting in the recent past, which I created, which WASN'T recurring - and WHEN I CLICKED ON CONTACT ATTENDEES - I DID get the option "Reply to all with email". I have validated this with a couple of recent
 "non-recurring" meetings. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
So I may have just identified WHERE it is no longer working. HOWEVER - I have been using this feature on recurring meetings FOR MONTHS, when only recently it began this *new* behavior of no longer giving the "Reply to all with email" option for recurring meetings.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- I have just opened an old old recurring meeting from 6 months ago to see what the behavior is - and it SHOWS THE OPTION REPLY TO ALL WITH EMAIL, as it should. So let me try to identify at what point, for a recurring meeting which I have had in the calendar,
 and it isn't clear. A couple of examples:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- I have a recurring meeting which "occurs every Friday from 06/09/2013 until 1/11/2013 from 11:00 AM&nbsp;to 12:00 PM" and on this one, I can open any occurrence and have the&nbsp; "Reply to all with email" option under Contact Attendees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- I have another recurring meeting which "Occurs every Monday effective 09/09/2013 until 31/12/2013 from 1:00 PM to 1:30 PM" and it doesn't matter which occurrence of this meeting I open,&nbsp;I DO NOT have the option "Reply to all with email" under Contact
 Attendees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- As these two meeting series are overlapping (but the start dates of each of their series is only 3 days apart, note I have the dd/mm/yyyy date format setup), it seems that sometime between when the first series was setup and when the second series was
 setup, something changed in Outlook to make it behave differently when creating these meeting series. Or something else. I would like someone at Microsoft to tell me what it is, please because I have done my part as best I can.</p>

<h3> alexgbdu  say:</h3>
<h2>            MacBook Pro &#38; Outlook Office 365  Issue - certificate</h2>
                    <p>I purchased the new MacBook Pro (touch bar) late 2016 model&nbsp;&amp; bought the Office 365 Home (5 user).&nbsp; Everything works except Outlook!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook will not accept my SBS exchange details, yet Apple Mail does. Problem is that I have very limited functionality without Outlook and would prefer that it works!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error stated is the certificate, which reads that it is unable to establish the server with autodiscover, because its intermediate or root certificate cannot be found. SSL has to be used to access the exchange SBS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple &amp; Microsoft techs are unable to sort this out so far.&nbsp; I have had a Microsoft tech remotely access the laptop, but they were unable to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help as I really do need Outlook to work! If its a compatibility issue, then is it possible to downgrade to a earlier version of Outlook with my current subscription?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Alex<span>，</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you show some screenshots about this symptom? Based on your description, the error message looks like a certificate warning in Outlook 2016 for Mac. More information, please refer to his KB:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3066652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3066652</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have opened a ticket with Microsoft, to avoid duplicate troubleshooting steps and check the status for the issue, can you please send us the SR (Service Request) number? I have left a private message for you to collect the SR number and you may
 access it via this link: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, please try testing the <a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Autodiscover service in RCA</a> and share with us the entire test result via private message. Just click Exchange server &gt; Microsoft Office Outlook Connectivity Tests and select Outlook Autodiscover.</p>

            <p>The problem is still not resolved. We eventually got the certificate issue resolved with the help of Apple iStore, who then still could not get Outlook working &amp; advised that we do all the software updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We did all the updates that were available, which then no longer provided a certificate error but then advised that we needed to update the server software to SP2.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was subsequently done, yet still Outlook doesn't work at all.<br />
</p>
<p>However, Apple mail is working properly with the exact same settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other suggestions?</p>

            <p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After getting the certificate issue resolved, the Outlook doesn’t work. So, what’s the new problem with Outlook? Is there any Outlook functionality still not available? What’s the detailed version of your Outlook client (e.g.15.30 170107) and OS(e.g.10.12.2)?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick </p>

            <p>Good day Rick </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no Outlook functionality at all. When opening the app, the error is advising now of a bad password and when re-entering the password, this window just continually pops up. All settings are the same as with Apple Mail, which is working perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook version 15.30 170107</p>
<p>MacBook OS version 10.12.2</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise what other steps we can try to resolve this issue. The MacBook is pretty much useless to me at the moment due to Outlook not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            I am very frustrated too and glad to finally see I am not alone. I have concluded that the Outlook version in Office 365 is not compatible with MacBook Pro's latest edition which I purchased in April 2017. I need Outlook for work but may have to abandon
 it and use the Apple mail instead. &nbsp;I've already had one crash in which I had to spend a day at Apple getting all of my software re-installed. I do not recommend this Apple product and Microsoft Office 365's version of Outlook.

<p>Hi Ginnie，<br />
<br />
Based on your description, I understand that you're trying to install Office 2016 but it never completes installation.
</p>
<p>You can try the steps listed in the "<strong><em>Are you trying to install Office on a PC (desktop, laptop, or 2-in-1)?</em></strong>" section and the "<em><strong>Office hangs or freezes at 90%</strong></em>" section in this article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-is-taking-long-to-install-0f09f357-3fef-42a6-b8aa-cef4c6c44bdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office is taking long to install</a>.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, please provide a screenshot of the message "Microsoft Office was unable to complete installation".<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
James<br />
<br />

<p>Thanks James but these articles don't seem to address the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first, I attempted to load Office 2016 and the error message was about a "Office 16 click to run extensibility component" and had to delete that file, which I did.</p>
<p>When I attempted to run the install again, it got "further along" but when loading files, at about 10% of install, it stopped and the message: "Microsoft Office Standard 2016 encountered an error during setup" in a box and NO options to rectify the situation
 (just a "close" button).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kinda stuck now.........</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

            Hi Ginnie,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your update.<br />
<br />
Please understand that Office Standard 2016 is a provided through volume licensing, instead of Office 365 for Business subscription.
<br />
<br />
We suggest you post a new thread to the <strong>Office &gt; Install, upgrade and activate &gt; Windows 10 &gt; Office 2016</strong> category for further assistance.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, you can try deleting the Office folder in Task Scheduler. Here are the related threads for your reference:<br />

    <title>MS Excel App Crash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pieterneveling  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Excel App Crash</h2>
                    <div>Good morning, Please would appreciate if anybody can assist. I consistently get the error below.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Excel 2013 64 bit. I cannot indicate a clear action that initiates the error below. However, once this has happened on the spreadsheet, the spreadsheet is corrupt. Thereafter I will get constant errors.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disabled all the .Com add-Ins</div>
<div>Started in Safe mode and see no differences.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Problem Event Name:<span> </span>
APPCRASH</div>
<div>&nbsp; Application Name:<span> </span>
EXCEL.EXE</div>
<div>&nbsp; Application Version:<span>
</span>15.0.4535.1507</div>
<div>&nbsp; Application Timestamp:<span>
</span>52282d17</div>
<div>&nbsp; Fault Module Name:<span> </span>
VBE7.DLL</div>
<div>&nbsp; Fault Module Version:<span>
</span>7.1.10.38</div>
<div>&nbsp; Fault Module Timestamp:<span>
</span>4fea3eec</div>
<div>&nbsp; Exception Code:<span> </span>
c0000005</div>
<div>&nbsp; Exception Offset:<span> </span>
00000000000f3278</div>
<div>&nbsp; OS Version:<span> </span>
6.1.7601.2.1.0.256.4</div>
<div>&nbsp; Locale ID:<span> </span>7177</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Additional information about the problem:</div>
<div>&nbsp; LCID:<span> </span>1033</div>
<div>&nbsp; skulcid:<span> </span>7177</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The spreadsheets that I normally work with are between 30 and 40MB in size. They have quite a few macros that do various functions in the sheet.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The App crash has actually never happened when the Macros have been running.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Crashes happen on opening the document, copying data, editing current cells, etc. &nbsp;The document is normally stored on a network drive, but even after saving on my local drive, i also get the same errors</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried the following:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Run Memory tests to make sure the memory is not faulty. (12 GB)&nbsp;</li><li>Uninstalled "unnecessary" programs on my computer</li><li>Re installed windows &amp; office</li><li>Disabled all add-Ins</li><li>Previously I had Office 2010 installed (here i had the same issues). Then upgraded to 2013 (64bit) as I thought it might just be a case of my spreadsheet taking too much memory. The upgrade also did not solve the problem.&nbsp;</li><li>All MS updates have been installed</li><li>Here is where it gets weirder... If I do these operations on my Notebook (main workstation is a desktop), then I do not get these errors. This lets me further think the problem might be hardware / software related on my Desktop. How to find out what it
 may be, is a mystery to me</li></ul>
<div><br />
</div>
</div>
<div>Any help will be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you in advance</div>
<div><br />
</div>

            The notebook is running Office 2010 32bit.&nbsp;
<div>The Desktop had the same version before I upgraded about 6 months ago. The AppCrash already happened on the Desktop then. This is one of the reasons I upgraded. Hoped it would resolve the issue.</div>

            I have uninstalled quite a few programs and run a clean up (CCleaner). Although i did not do all the registry changes they suggested. So far my spreadsheet seems to be stable. But I have had this before as well, where it would work for a couple of days
 (no crashes) and then suddenly have endless issues. I will monitor, and try you suggestion the next time i have this issue.&nbsp;

<h3> daadaa---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help&#33; E75 new firmware doesn&#39;t work&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I upgraded to 201.12.01 firmaware.</p>
<p>Now I can't make any calls ("call forbidden") and I don't receive any calls.</p>
<p>Also the phone's menu is very buggy: when I choose smth in the menu I get in the wrong page!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I made a hard reset. The phone worked well for 2 hours. But when I finished installing all the software - it broke again the same way :(((</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's wrong?? Is there any chance to cancel that new "improving" firmaware?</p>
<p>How can I get that phone work well??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS. It was&nbsp;the last time I bought Nokia phone. I think Nokia can produce only "simple" phone models, but not a smartphone..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PPS. DO NOT UPGRADE A FIRMWARE IN YOUR PHONE!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>yep i gave the same advice to my&nbsp;friends: do not upgrade the phone. at least until the bugs are fixed.</p>
<p>We were promised by a new firmware update coming today, my main problem is with my GPS, it keeps hitting me with no connection,like the phone is totally&nbsp;separated&nbsp;from its GPS receiver, it worked just fine before with the v110 firmware, and Nokia &nbsp;totally
 removed the satellite status&nbsp;which&nbsp;i found really useful!!!</p>
<p>this firmware is a real screw up for NOKIA i always loved their phones and updates, hope they fix these issues soon, cause i really loved my e75&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don't want to buy another phone, but I can't work the way it goes now :(((</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certainly they should fire somebody for that new firmware problem</p>

<h2>            Outlook for mac 2011 - 14.3.5 Connecting &#8230; nothing happens</h2>
                    Hello, I have installed the latest update 14.3.5 yesterday, too late, my bad, should installed it sooner as it solves some security issues, but nowadays end users get flooded with updates and I need to work on my mac sometimes too :)&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyway: OS X 10.7.5&nbsp;</div>
<div>Details:&nbsp;</div>
<div>marduk:Vidalia nico$ uname -a Darwin marduk.local 11.4.2 Darwin Kernel Version 11.4.2: Thu Aug 23 16:25:48 PDT 2012; root:xnu-1699.32.7~1/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64&nbsp;</div>
<div>8 GB of RAM</div>
<div>2.9 Ghz Intel Core i7&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After installing the 14.3.5 update outlook mac refuses to connect to our Exchange 2010 mailserver, it first shows 'not connected', then tries to establish a connection, but I does not get any further then 'connecting', but the application does not seem
 to connect as the below netstat shows:&nbsp; </div>
<div><br />
</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>Outlook does not make any tcp/443 request to our mailserver, just nothing, a wireshark capture which I'm not going to post for obvious reasons, does not show anything happening towards our mailserver. I know that uninstalling - reboot - reinstalling will,
 most likely, fix this issue but I want to troubleshoot this, without going through the hassle (I have a 3 GB mailbox on our Exchange, I had to a complete resync multiple times (I'm not in the office much) so I wasted about 60 GB of data transfer meanwhile
 due to various problems with 14.3.2 where the only solution was when this 'connecting … and never connected' issue appears.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Luckily as I'm installing exchange mailserver as of NT4, I'm in the position to troubleshoot the windows 2008 R2 server, Exchange 2010 (all updates, service packs etc installed)&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have checked application and system log on the server, and nothing is pointing to the Exchange mailserver, nice and tidy logs, no issue whatsoever.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Back to the client side, in my /var/log/system.log I have one entry, that refers to Office Mac:&nbsp;</div>

<div>Jul 17 21:47:45 marduk [0x0-0x107107].com.microsoft.Outlook[5553]: objc[5553]: Class OnClickLinkAction is implemented in both /Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Microsoft Outlook.app/Contents/MacOS/../../../Office/OutlookLegacy.framework/Versions/14/OutlookLegacy
 and /Applications/Microsoft Office 2011/Microsoft Outlook.app/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft Outlook. One of the two will be used. Which one is undefined.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But I don't think it's related, correct me if I'm wrong.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Standard logging (Window - Error log) does not show anything, after activating debug logs, followed by restarting outlook to generate logs, but even then: nothing, no errors.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I think this is my first post on a public forum, I'm reluctant to open a PSS ticket for this (as most likely the result will be: reinstall) But I'm a bit fed up with the Microsoft triple R solution: Repair Reboot Reinstall, and the option Repair is not
 possible (manual download of this update shows that my current product is not fit for installation (most likely because the update is already installed)&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can produce about whatever sort of logs, up to to deep analysis to reverse engineering to identify whatever system call, memory region etc etc etc, but that's one **** of a job, I paid nicely for this license which isn't exactly cheap and feel victimized
 by this vendor lockin, there is no alternative client with the same functionality (webdav / caldav is not supported) so per monopoly/patent war, I have to use outlook.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So experts, give me you best shot. You guys have the source, I don't.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>You already lost me for the Windows client OS (gave up after Vista which costed me yet another 1500 Euro, the Vista capable story, replace laptop with a 'real' vista capable machine, sucked even more), bought my first macbook then, I like open source software
 but once again monopoly/patent war and business use, prevented me to continue using Debian as business environment.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As a company, we have spoonfed Microsoft with several hundreds of thousand Euros. Finally, Office 2011 on mac is a resource hog, I can see my battery capacity going downhill as soon as I use anything (40% cpu load for an email client, come on)&nbsp;</div>

<div>Edit 5 minutes after my post: &nbsp;I properly formatted the above, but for some reason (safari as browser) the wysiwig thrashed the format &nbsp;:( &nbsp;*sigh* and I had to reformat the above again.</div>

            This is more than puzzling.
<div>I don't remember reading many issues like your in the forum.</div>
<div>The net-sniffing clearly indicates it has not even attempted to connect and I see no "good" reason why.</div>
<div>I seriously doubt reinstalling the app will help. I would try two simple things:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Update to 14.3.6 (the update came out recently and targets Outlook mostly)</li><li>Remove the account, then readd it to Oulook.</li></ul>

            Hello Cortin,
<div><br />
<div>Downloading as I'm typing this (worth mentioning, the autoupdater told me that there were no updates, although I can download 14.3.6 and install manually (english version by the way)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Outlook web access is working fine, opening the same account via a Windows 7 VM, does not have any issues either.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So must be client related.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also forgot to mention; &nbsp;disk permissions check did not show any permission issues.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But I think that I have found a pointer:</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I open activity monitor (we use a hostname + proper SSL certificate from a CA), I noticed the following line:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>/Users/nico/Desktop/OfficeLogging/Microsoft Outlook_Troubleshooting_1.csv</div>
<div>count=0, state=0x2</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>/Users/xxx/Desktop/OfficeLogging/Microsoft Outlook_Troubleshooting_1.csv</div>
<div>192.168.98.103:49535-&gt;<b>2x7.x2-x8-194.adsl-static.isp.belgacom.be</b>:http</div>
<div>-&gt;0xffffff801340fe10</div>
<div><br />
<div>Which is our 'old' public ip (we migrated from there, one month ago), is office mac caching or hardcoding an ip address somewhere?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Because outlook is configured with a hostname, and dig/nslookup are working. &nbsp;No idea why this happens, does not make much sense (and again: no tcp/443) only this entry in the troubleshooting log.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Will update after I have installed the latest.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks!</div>

            I just finished installing 14.3.6 but same issue, outlook starts -&gt; not connected -&gt; connecting, but nothing happens.
<div><br />
<div>So continued troubleshooting and the above ip address is in the following file:</div>
<div><br />
<div>/Users/xxx/Library/Caches/com.microsoft.Outlook/Cache.db</div>
<div><br />
<div>I quit outlook, removed this file and Outlook is working again :-)</div>
<div><br />
<div>No idea whatsoever, but if anyone ever has this issue. &nbsp;Wipe the above file, will save you lots of remove/reboot</div>

            That's why I usggested removing the Exchange account and re-adding it. That should have properly eliminated the previous cache.

            Hi Corentin,
<div><br />
<div>That should have fixed this too, but I did not want to go down that route.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As mentioned in my first post, I already wasted about 30 GB of data transfer, due to issues with the previous versions (not connecting, downloading (and nothing happening), etc etc etc)</div>
<div><br />
<div>It's a computer not a dishwasher ;-) Proper troubleshooting upgrades technical skills but I guess I'm from another generation. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, last remark, as soon as it was connected again outlook was consuming 80% CPU for about half an hour, made my mac sound like a vacuum cleaner. &nbsp;It wasn't really doing anything but fetching some mails.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I like Exchange and I like outlook, feature set is very nice and Apple ain't all good, there 'server' products are ridiculous, but honestly Office for mac 2011 is a resource hog and I can't imagine why. &nbsp;It fetches some remote data, injects it in some
 propriertary database format, full stop. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So the code needs some optimization, so I'm going to give this a thorough analysis and if I find a solution, I'll post it here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the follow up</div>

<div><br />
I am not surprised at all. This is (unfortunately) fairly typical…
<div>It's not just getting e-mails though, it's also indexing, etc, but still…</div>
<div>And that seems to only happen with Exchange accounts. I've never seen that with IMAP for instance.</div>
<div><br />
<div>FYI, if you keep a large inbox under Exchange, you tend to see spinning beachballs mostly every time Outlook checks for e-mails. It's much safer to try and maintain the inbox itself at its bare minimum and more all the messages you can to other Exchange
 folders. The inbox gets special treatment when it comes to syncing and that seems to have a nasty impact on performances.</div>

            n1c0n1c0,
<div><br />
<div>exact behavior you described is often caused by certificate problems. You may wish to make sure that the certificate used by your Exchange server is trusted by Mac OS for the type of connection Outlook is using.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Open keychain, find the certificate, go to "trust" section, and set "always trust" where you do trust.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>best,</div>

            <p>Another cause for the same problematic behavior: Time zone issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason Outlook did not liked the new timezone I moved to, and after enabling the debugging logs, i saw this error message: "A time zone with the specified ID could not be found". So I reverted back to my previous timezone, restarted Outlook and
 it could connect again!</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Clifford NoelWeder, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer few questions to narrow down the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Which <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/internet-explorer/which-version-am-i-using#ie=ie-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
version</a> of Internet Explorer are you using? </p>
<p>2. Are you able to access the website? What exactly are you referring when you say 'Registration question'?
</p>
<p>3. Is this issue confined to this specific website? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes websites don't look like you expect them to–images might not appear, menus might be out of place, and text could be jumbled together. This might be caused by a compatibility problem between Internet&nbsp;Explorer and the site you're on. Sometimes this
 can be fixed by adding the site to your Compatibility View list. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Note: You can change the Internet Explorer version from the drop down on the top right corner of this article. To find out the version of Internet Explorer, refer to this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/internet-explorer/which-version-am-i-using#ie=ie-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi Clifford,&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for replying.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you are able to login to bank successfully using an alternate browser, ideally you should be able to work with Internet Explorer. Since the website that you are trying to view contains more security related queries, you may have to make sure that you
 are entering to the valid website page. There could be malicious&nbsp;activities&nbsp;which can cause the browser to redirect to a different website. I would appreciate if you can check if the website is opening in https format from the address bar.
<p>
</p><p>Also make sure that the Date and Time settings are correct&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Some secure sites require that the date and time match the date and time of the secure site. Make sure that the Date and Time settings are correct on the computer.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope this information helps.&nbsp;<br />

<p>You can get rid of the box lines so:</p>
<ol>
<li>click on the text box so it has focus, the&nbsp; Text Box Tools Format conditional tab will display</li><li>click on the Format conditional tab to activate it </li><li>click on Text Box Styles / Shape Outline drop down / No Outline option. </li></ol>
<p>If you look in Print Preview you will no longer see a box around the text</p>

<h2>            outlook 2010 how do i remove the square next to the contact name which shows my location&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using Office/outlook 2010 on WIndows 7.</p>

<p>I have noticed that an email contact on a new or incoming message has a square next to its name. When I hover over this it says presence unlnown, online, offline etc.</p>

<p>When I go to my contact list it has the same square next to each contact name indicating whether they are online. offline etc. this is new today and I have not set anything different.</p>

<p>It seems also to be linked to Skype as details there are coming up.</p>

<p>Please can someone tell me how to get rid of this - I don't do anything with outlook apart from send emails and feel my privacy is being compromised.&nbsp; Has this been a recent update - if so how can i disable this facility for good.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>

                    I purchased Office 365 Personal subscriptions for three separate computers one three separate dates using my personal MS login. Two are for 12 months, one was for 1 month. After the most recent purchase (today), they all somehow merged together, extending
 the expiration date and now showing only a single subscription. How do I resolve this and how do I prevent this from happening again?

<p>Correction: I realized that one of the installations was a purchase from Amazon (not a download), so it is really just two subscriptions in question - one annual, and one monthly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not that it should matter, but the reason I didn't purchase 365 Home was that I initially only needed to add 365 Personal to a single computer for short-term use. We purchased a new laptop that arrived this week. My intention was to install an annual subscription
 on the new laptop and uninstall the monthly version on the older laptop unless it was needed again in the future. I never had that option. The monthly 365 Personal was deactivated on the older laptop even though I had several weeks left on the subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What makes no sense is that I now have a single renewal date of December 16, 2019 on the new laptop. (Wouldn't it be March of 2019?) When I log in to my account, it only shows one active product, when there should have been two. I installed them each separately,
 on separate computers. Apparently the issue was that I used one Microsoft account for both purchases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate the information that you've provided. In order to be able to have your subscription cancelled, there are a few things that you can perform to be able to ensure that you'll be able to retain the subscription that you like to keep. One of those
 ways would be ensuring that the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027815/microsoft-account-cancel-a-microsoft-subscription" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">auto-renew is not enabled</a></strong> on the subscription that you wish to
 cancel. This way, if the subscription has reached it's 30th day, it should cancel automatically.</p>
<p>
