            Hi Tom.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />File History, Windows file and Image backup are dysfunctional and can lose files as I have seen repeatedly over 10 years in forums daily. I suggest the safest and most reliable method which is to sort your files into their User Folders (Documents, Desktop, Pictures, Downloads, etc) and periodically copy or drag them to external or another hard drive,  then have one other Cloud backup so your files are safe from fire and theft and easily accessible via the internet just like email.
<br />
<br />Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  In the latest version in OneDrive Settings' AutoSave tab you can sync Desktop, Documents and/or Pictures folders to OneDrive in real time.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br /> Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>.  Some like to move their User folders off of C to another partition to keep the image smaller.  If you image C with the files included then you can also mount the image and extract the files separately, so it serves as both a Windows and a file backup.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Windows backup &amp; maybe in the future file history are being deprecated &amp; will eventually be removed, what you’re experiencing may be related to that. 
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/w8cookbook/windows-7-backup-and-restore-deprecated" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deskto...</a>
<br />
<br />Microsoft recommend using third party software:
<br />“System Image Backup (SIB) Solution
<br />We recommend that users use full-disk backup solutions from other vendors.”
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4034825/features-that-are-removed-or-deprecated-in-windows-10-fall-creators-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/403482...</a>
<br />
<br />I recommend moving to third party imaging software now before it is removed permanently  if you prefer backing up your PC rather than using File history.
<br />Many users recommend Macrium Reflect free:

            My wireless controller won’t stay connected (“Please reconnect controller” error)
<p>Before troubleshooting, make sure any objects between the controller and console are removed, such as doors, shelves, or metal dividers. Also make sure that other wireless devices are kept clear of this are, including wireless routers, cordless phones, or
 microwave ovens. Sorry, you’ll have to make the walk to the kitchen to zap your ramen!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also check to make sure your batteries are fresh. If you use rechargeable AAs or Microsoft brand rechargeable battery packs, make sure they are fully charged. You can try using a different battery source to see if there might be an issue with your current
 batteries.&nbsp;If you are having trouble charging your Microsoft rechargeable battery pack, please check this support article, choosing “The rechargeable battery does not charge when you…” option.
</p>
<p>Still having issues with your controller?</p>
<p>If your controller still won’t work, try connecting it to a different console. If it works on this other console, there is probably an issue with your console. If the controller still doesn’t work on the new console, there is probably an issue with the controller
 itself. If it was recently purchased, try returning it to the retailer for a replacement. If you can’t take it back, but it’s still within the Accessory Warranty period (Bottom of this page), you can use the Xbox Online Service Center to order a new one. If
 it’s been longer than the Accessory Warranty period, then you would want to purchase a new controller at your retailer.</p>

<p>Thank you both for your generic support suggestions, but I'm still having the same problem. &nbsp;However, I tried connecting the controllers to a different console and had no problems. &nbsp;Could this be an issue with my 3rd party controllers or is my console just
 messed up?</p>

<p>Hey there Dizzle! Just so I'm on the same page, your controllers seem to die when using on your console, but they seem to work fine on other consoles, correct? Have you tried any new controllers on your console to see if they behave the same way as well?
 Let us know, thanks!</p>

<p>My third party wireless controller is doing the same thing! &nbsp;After 3 weeks of not being used, with fresh recharged batteries it will connect like normal, but only a second or less of "controller 2" being identified and connected, it will die. &nbsp;The light
 goes out on the controller. &nbsp;When I have the condole off, the controller doesn't stay lit up like my #1 controller does (came with the slim). &nbsp;I also had everything off, and started the console with the "bad" controller, which became #1, but then shut itself
 off, too! &nbsp;Any help yet? &nbsp;There is nothing like this problem in the forums.</p>

            <p>Using two CPU's and which version? You can try this not sure if it will work but worth a try. another issues with Dell's it is important when installing memory is to do it in pairs in the right slots not sure if your's has white and black slots but you could
 check online for the order to install</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>install back old memory (use just two sticks) and let the bios recognise it</li><li>reboot and turn off pc</li><li>install new memory (24GB)</li><li>after turning on you will see the message "memory size changed"</li><li>strike F1 to continue and just forget about BIOS existence, because as soon as you go there, the chances are your memory will be decreased</li></ol>
<div>Your computer requires DIMMs within a channel to be populated starting with the DIMMs farthest from the processor first. This</div>
<div>means the DIMM slots 1, 2 and 3 must be populated before DIMM slots 4, 5 and 6. In addition, when populating a Quad-rank DIMM</div>

<p>
</p><p>I have not installed any new memory. &nbsp;I am using the memory that was factory installed by Dell. 2-CPUs each with 6 cores and 12 2-GB DDR3 SDRAM memory sticks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not experience this problem until after I upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp;I did not suspect Windows 10, but now when I go to Dell to look for a solution to this ongoing problem I find their statement that they do not intend to support Windows 10 for the T7500.
 &nbsp;Unfortunately it has been well past the 31 day limit for rolling back to Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a serious problem. &nbsp;Many times I am able to strike the F1 key and get past the error message, but not always. &nbsp;And if I ever put the machine in sleep mode it goes completely dormant. &nbsp;I have to cold boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will Microsoft allow me to roll-back since the problem is incompatibility, not simply user preference?</p>

</p><p>Your frustrations are noted and understandable. Regarding your concern with the RAM not working properly with your Windows 10, please consider the bit version (x64 and x32) of your Windows 10.

 are the editions of Windows 10 available?</a></strong></span></em> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your concern if Microsoft will let you roll back to your previous Windows version, that will depend on how you were able to obtain your Windows 10 Installation. You can only perform a rollback if you obtained it via upgrade from your previous Windows
 version. In case that you performed a clean installation of Windows 10, then you will need a clean installation of the previous Windows version in order to enjoy them again.
<br />
<br />
We conducted a brief research of the unit that you have from Dell. Well, we can determine that you have a work-horse PC that can be used in any terrain. But since you mentioned that Dell already told you that it was not tested on their end to run Windows 10,
 then aside from the RAM concern, may you please let us know the other issues that you are having with Windows 10.

            <p>The information about rolling back to Windows 7 is only useful if it has been less than 30 days since I upgraded. &nbsp;I definitely have the correct Windows edition for the memory configuration I have. &nbsp;I don't know if my problem is a hardware problem of a problem
 with Windows 10 being incompatible with Dell's T7500. &nbsp;And since Windows 10 has not been tested with the Dell T7500 I cannot rely on Dell to help me trouble shoot the problem. &nbsp;I can roll back to the original factory settings, but that will require considerable
 effort and possible loss of data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am left with no good options.</p>

</p><p>With regard to your concern, we suggest that you contact the manufacturer for better assistance since you mentioned that they are still not able to test the compatibility of T7500 on Windows 10. And if you are already decided to do a factory reset you can
 backup all the important files on that you have on Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Skype on Windows 10, disable or remove</h2>
                    How can I disable/remove Skype from Windows 10?&nbsp; There is no camera or mic on this machine and it is used for managing contact data.&nbsp; Everytime I copy a phone number, Skype opens.&nbsp; I really need to stop this.&nbsp; Even disabling at startup does not prevent
 it from running and of course it is not found in Programs and Features.

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype can be installed either by store app or desktop app or if you have the office version of Lync installed.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>You may try to check for the Skype app in the Task Manger</li><li>Right click on it and select Open File Location to see where it is installed.</li><li>From there try to Uninstall or if it is installed through office 2013 you may have to uninstall from Office application.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>You may access the task manager by Pressing Ctrl+Shift+Esc
</p>
<p>

            <p>Immediately after updating to Windows 10 Skype was a real problem because it would launch when ever a&nbsp; phone number was point to.&nbsp; I was doing some major contact management and it started whether the phone number was in Excel, Work, Edge or even Filemaker.&nbsp;
 First attempt was to disable at start-up and restart.&nbsp; That did not work.&nbsp; After considerable effort&nbsp;I&nbsp;thought I found the path late yesterday.&nbsp; From the start screen select SETTINGS, then SYSTEM then APPS &amp; FEATURES.&nbsp; From there it can be found and uninstalled.&nbsp;&nbsp;It
 was not found in&nbsp;Programs and Features on Control Panel.&nbsp; Also, I was not able to find it through Task Manager, maybe I didn't look through all possibilities other than what Task Manager calls APPS and BACKGROUND PROCESSES.&nbsp; Based on your comments, I checked
 Task Manager again, and WOW, it is still in StartUp after the apparent APP uninstall.&nbsp; So I tried looking at Office 2013 through Start, right clicking and Uninstall.&nbsp; That took me to Programs and Features.&nbsp; Tried change Office, could not find Skype.&nbsp; Went
 back to Task Manager / StartUp, did a right click on Skype for Business and chose File Location to see if it was actually there.&nbsp; It was.&nbsp; A click and it started.&nbsp; I stopped it, changed the file name and hope it does not come back to bite me.&nbsp; Even tried CHAT
 twice and could not get more specific help that "it's in Programs and Features" or disabling in StartUp will work.&nbsp;

            Skype for business 2015 was added to Windows 10 as a preplacement for Lync 2013. It gave me fits always popping up on the taskbar each time I restarted the PC. It was very annoying. After numerous attempts at stopping it, I finally&nbsp;went to the file manager
 and&nbsp;went to C:\Porgram Data\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Microsoft Office 2013\ and delete the shortcut for Skype for Business 2015 shortcut. In the Microsoft office 2013 there is another folder called Microsoft Office 2013 tools. In that folder you
 will find a shortcut for Skype for Business Recording Manager. Delete that also and you should not see the slimy beast again. At least it solved my problem.

            Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I did similar.&nbsp; With Windows 10 it is easy because right clicking on the icon give the option to go to the file location so went there removed the short cut&nbsp;and changed the name of the Skype.exe.&nbsp; However, after a couple rounds of
 updates, Skype&nbsp;was back.&nbsp; Also tried disabling the startup via task manager.&nbsp; It&nbsp;again highlights phone numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Had hints&nbsp;that it actually uses the Lync.exe.&nbsp; So changed that name and that seems to have worked.&nbsp; A couple times I have been prompted to install
 Skype, but (fingers crossed) that has not happened yet.&nbsp; The unfortunate piece is I would actually use Skype but the highlighting of phone numbers messes with one of the primary tasks for this machine and according to Support, there is no was to disable that
 feature.

            <p>Just want to say that Skype has become nothing more than a new way to get spammed.</p>
<p>Every pc I have with Skype gets annoying spam from random Skype accounts even when I try to shut it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to make changes to how it defaults so that users can be free of junk calls or Skype will just be seen as garbage and another reason to get rid of windows.</p>

            <p>I went in through your method and deleted the first instance of it but when I looked farther down the list I found it attacked to Microsoft Messenger as well. Getting rid of both instances has eliminated it from my Task Manager list completely.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was crashing about every 30 minutes or so and causing major instability in my computer which was continuously trying to launch it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to realize that forcing applications down our throats without a simple easy way to turn them off or just to not install them is going to drive many of their customers to Linux. Now if we could just find a way to get rid of Cortana completely
 so our machines would be better secured.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you are using either Skype for Windows 10 (UWP) and new Skype there is no option to sort&nbsp;your contacts under Favorites. By default your contacts are arranged&nbsp;alphabetically. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you would like this functionality, you can utilize the classic Skype version of Skype.

</p><p>ROG Mobo, i7 7700k, MSI 1080, 16GB of Ballistix RAM, 2 standard 1TB HDD's and one Intel Optane 900p.</p>

</p><p>DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION + SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (Both of which BSOD) keep happening when I try to export video on Adobe, it never used to happen, but I use my PC for editing and this has ground everything to a halt.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help! I've tried chkdsk, I've try reinstalling drivers, updating drivers - I'm just going a bit mad with it. It seems to be an issue with my Optane 900p SSD - but I'm not sure what to do or how to find out.</p>

            Hi Basuru, Adobe Premier is extremely resource hungry when rendering, but your system is strong and should easily handle it . . .
<br />
<br />To diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Considering Adobe Premiere is a graphics related application, this likely has something to do with your display driver.
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel

<br />If you recently upgraded to Windows 10 1803:
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<h2>            Bluetooth pairing worked on Windows 7 but will not pair on Windows 8.1 using default inf.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Bluetooth device that I was able to pair on Windows 7 but on my PC where I have installed Windows 8.1 (upgrade from Win. 7) the device fails to pair properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 7 the device uses the hidbth.inf (found in the registry)&nbsp;and does not use any mfr. supplied drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 8/8.1, the device will go through the pairing process but the registry shows that it is installed with the bth.inf instead of the hidbth.inf.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What changed in Windows 8/8.1 that would cause this device not to be paired and installed with the proper .inf file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing has changed with the device itself. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 8.1 I have tried the same Bluetooth dongle that is used on the Windows 7 PC where the pairing completes. I have also tried a BT 4.0 dongle also but this did not change anything.</p>

<p>Dear Xbox Live,</p>
<p>I recently downloaded the batman beyond skin I was not able to select it. I downloaded it again and it still was unavailable. I even put in the code to unlock it. So when I log in to xbox dashboard and went to memory storage were it was stored. The batman
 skin was not in storage. I think there is something wrong with the file.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check your purchase history to see if the Batman Beyond skin (or the whole skins pack) is listed there. If not, there may have been an error when you tried to purchase it. If it is there, you may have had a download error or a corruption problem. Try clearing
 your cache, then download some arcade demo before redownloading the skin(s) so that if the corruption is on your hd the demo will be put in that part of the drive instead of the skin(s).</p>

    <title>Network adapter on motherboard offline after win7 reinstall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryanbeasleigh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network adapter on motherboard offline after win7 reinstall</h2>
                    <p>After experiencing a boot drive failure I reinstalled win 7 prof 64&nbsp;bit&nbsp;and then installed the driver disk supplied with my motherboard (Gigabyte GA-X58A-UD3R)</p>
<p>The realtek network adapter is showing that the device is not properly installed and I get a notice on the screen following startup that the driver couldn't be loaded. The device manager
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I rebooted from the basic install I loaded my drivers and the message from network adapter install was "Code 10 This device cannot start". I seem to recall when I built the sucker that there was an issue but unfortunately with 5 leg operations, 3 torn
 rotators, a sliced bicep and terminal arthitis the medications screw with my memory bank.<br />
I attempted to uninstall the driver that the gigabyte disks (or the win disks) through the device mgr dialog box. and I attempted to reload drivers from gigabytes site. I did notice the drivers were located in the prog files (X86) 32 bit directory. The realtek
 is a RTL8111E chipset and the driver version 7.6.820.2009 from aug 2009.<br />
</p>
<p>As it sits I have windows reinstalled but I can't get online. I even went as far as buying a PCIe NIC card and was met with the same issue.

            <p>It wasn't quite as cut and dried as just disabling the onboard LAN and bopping in the drivers. ...........&nbsp; The only time I've ever had this much heartache is from the 64bit install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The common problem would appear to be the auto loaders trying to insert the wrong driver for this particular matchup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had disabled the LAN in the bios when I first tried to install the external NIC. TP-Link 3468 last night.&nbsp; I had even searched for newer versions of the drivers.&nbsp; The out of the box drivers cd for gigabyte as well as the latest down load version from gigabyte
 and&nbsp; TP-Link kept loading drivers that didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This afternoon I wound up reinstalling windows so I knew I had a clean playing field&nbsp;(grasping at straws) and with the onboard LAN disabled had to manually load the driver. Auto kept loading the wrong driver for both network adapters. I can vaguely remember
 be talked through the same crisis when I loaded win 7 , 4 years ago.&nbsp; The last driver presented to me for install was the same one that didn't work before. When I selected the driver it was the only one marked for win7/64.</p>
<p>In fairness some of the wording in the manuals or instruction sheets is written by people whose first (and second) language isn't english.</p>

<p>I'm being asked to comment and mark this as an answer. It's a poor answer and assumes that I didn't&nbsp; do my due diligence. I did disable the onboard network adapter. I had tried two manufactrurs version of the drivers. I'm far from an expert in this area
 but it would seem the wrong driver was loaded and regardless of what I did I the sa,me version kept getting plugged in.</p>
<p>I managed to delete the driver that the gigabyte driver disk installed and I manually loaded the drivers from the TP Link CD. Don't ask me how, I'm still trying to figure that one out.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would like to know. When you say "I managed to delete the driver that the gigabyte driver disk installed and I manually loaded the drivers from the TP Link CD", have you managed to install the Network adapter onboard drivers successfully?

 This actually goes very well.&nbsp; Then, 7 crashes and will not repair itself.&nbsp; I try to reinstall after reformatting the partition, and I get nothing but trouble.</p>
<p>I decide to wait a few months until I can afford a new hard drive to try a clean install.&nbsp; Now, I'm doing a clean install and I cannot get past the point after the updates are installed.&nbsp; The computer restarts, the OS begins to load so installation can complete
 and I get a half-second flash of a blue screen (so I can't read what it says).</p>
<p>To top it off, I am able to restart into safe mode where I am given an error: "Windows cannot complete installation in Safe Mode.&nbsp; To continue installing Windows, restart the computer."&nbsp; And so it begins again, an infinite loop of incomplete installations.&nbsp;
 I've tried several things that have been recommended by others on this and other tech support sites (remove all unnecessary peripherals, connect only the hard drive you are installing to, etc).&nbsp; For clarity's sake, I have to use a USB mouse while installing,
 my keyboard is connected to the serial port, and I must keep my graphics card in in order to see the process.</p>
<p>The only answers I can conceive right now are these:&nbsp; 1) its a motherboard issue (because I've tried on two different hard drives and get the same results).&nbsp; This doesn't seem very likely, however, as I am still able to install linux distros.&nbsp; 2) It is an
 issue with the disc.&nbsp; There are minute scratches on it which may have corrupted a key piece of data.&nbsp; Since the OS installed correctly the first time several months ago, I'm at a loss and getting toward the end of my rope.&nbsp; Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi Zarathustra19,</p>
<p>If you're able to get into Safe Mode, it seems it might be either a hardware issue or possibly a driver issue.</p>
<p>Please see the following troubleshooting thanks to Syed Karim, Microsoft Support Moderator for a possible fix:</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try to boot the computer in safe mode and check if you get any message stating that windows cannot complete installation in safe mode.
 To boot to the computer in safe mode keep tapping F8 key during restart. Once you see the option to boot in safe mode with networking select it and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link to know more about how to boot the computer in safe mode:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
If you receive the message stating that installation cannot be completed in safe mode, don’t close the window, instead follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. &nbsp; Press Shift and F10 together. This should bring up command prompt.<br />
b. <span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;In the command prompt <span>&nbsp;</span>type devmgmt.msc and press enter.<br />
c. <span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;If it opens device manager window, expand display adapter.<br />
d. &nbsp; Right click on the display adapter installed and disable the device.<br />
e.&nbsp; <span>&nbsp;</span>Make sure the display adapter is disabled.<br />
f.&nbsp; <span>&nbsp;</span>Close all the windows and restart the computer.<br />
g. &nbsp; Check if the installation completes fine and if you can boot to the desktop.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If the installation completes fine, you may have to uninstall the drivers for the display adapter and download the latest windows 7 drivers from HP website and install it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the installation completes successfully after disabling the display drivers, you may try to update the drivers for your display
 card from device manager and check if it helps.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below and follow the steps to update drivers.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!</span></p>

<h3> envy123oa  say:</h3>
<h2>            MVP Carbon Headset detachable mic not working</h2>
                    <p>The headphones are over-the-ear headphones and it has a slot for a detachable microphone. The headphones themselves work fine but the mic doesn't. What I tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Putting the mic in the microphone slot on my desktop PC. Windows recognises the device but cannot detect the sound.</p>
<p>-Plugging the headphones in the microphone slot with the microphone attached to the slot. Same thing.</p>
<p>-Plugging the headphones in the audio slot with the microphone attached to the slot. Windows doesn't recognise anything but the headset itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking that maybe I'm doing something wrong but I can't find the instructions on how to properly set up the mic. Any help would be appreciated :)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here in this situation, I suggest you to contact the Headphone manufacturer for further assistance with this issue. As the headset is recognized by the computer, it seems to be an issue with the Headset not with Windows Operating System.</p>

            <p>You are using an HP ProBook, which is a laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptops are proprietary in design which makes it impossible to upgrade components such as processor and video card.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only likely component you can upgrade is the memory and likely the hard disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those are two things you can consider upgrading, you can likely switch the Hard disk for an SSD which will add significant performance boost to the system.</p>

<h2>            Logitech Keyboard Num Lock problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi I appreciate everyone taking the time to help me</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Logitech MK330 wireless keyboard + Mouse combo</p>
<p>When I type numbers with the number pad, it types numbers, but when I press the num lock and then attempt to use the arrow keys on the number pad, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is strange to me as the arrow keys on my previous keyboard would do what an arrow key would when the num lock was pressed.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if a new windows update changed this but I only noticed the problem recently.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            Hi Joseph, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />Firstly, I would see if the troubleshooter fixes the issue. Click Start and type "troubleshoot" then select the first result. Scroll down and choose Keyboard. See if the troubleshooter can resolve the issue.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, see if resetting your keyboard settings to default helps:

<br />Please let me know how you go! Thanks!

            Hi JosephLiu2
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Let's first rule out whether the keyboard hardware is an issue or not. Can you use Keyboard tester and press keys to see if the keys are working correctly or not? If keys work as intended, then problem is not the hardware of Keyboard.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html</a>
<br />
<br />If no hardware issue - Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Till your problem is resolved and you need to do urgent and limited typing, use Onscreen Keyboard - Type OSK in Windows Start Search Box (Cortana) &gt; Click On-Screen Keyboard
<br />
<br />2. Run Keyboard Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down and click Keyboard &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall &amp; reinstall Keyboard Driver
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Keyboards &gt; Right click on Standard PS/2 Keyboard &gt; Uninstall &gt; Reboot the computer to reinstall 
<br />
<br />4: Turn off filter keys in Ease of Access
<br />Type ease in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Ease of Access &gt; Click Make the Keyboard easier to use &gt; Ensure Turn on filter Keys is not checked  
<br />

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Please reply stating what steps you have done, what error messages you receive &amp; whether you have tried another keyboard.
<br />You may receive more dedicated help on the Logitech forums.
<br /><a href="https://community.logitech.com/s/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.logitech.com/s/</a>
<br />Logitech uses dedicated software to change button configuration &amp; to use their keyboards &amp; mice, hence why I told you to check the settings, if you do not have this software installed this may be why your keyboard is not working correctly.

<p>Digital codes are region locked to the region that it was created/sold in. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It would not be wise to change your region to Spain just to redeem this code, so please keep the region to the one where you live, Poland, and get another in a new game or buy gold. If you buy things with your region set to Spain and change back to Poland
 they will not work anymore, so best keep it as Poland.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox support can not change codes' regions.</p>
