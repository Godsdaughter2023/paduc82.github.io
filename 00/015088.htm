<h2>            &#47;golive dosnt work with over 100 users in the group</h2>
                    I have been keeping my call at under 100 users because /golive does not work, but I have seen other calls with far more than 100 users and they host calls. How is this possible?&nbsp;

<p>May we know what version of skype are you running? What operating system do you have on your device.</p>

            With more than 25 people in the group the call button does not work so we type /golive to start the call, but /golive will not work if there are more than 100 people in the group. Is there a way to host a call with more than 100 members?

<p>Hi Howard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no specific option to increase the icon size in the Wordpad. There are alternatives we can use, like the Magnifier to enlarge the view. Just type it on the search bar to activate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you find this helpful let us know, otherwise provide us more information like version of Windows you are using to know other options we can use. These workarounds may change affect the whole computer's display.</p>
<p>

            I don't believe that link will answer your question :-)<br />

Mac Excel doesn't have the same XML support as its Windows counterpart. Your only option is to use
Excel 2004 XML Spreadsheet (.xml)</span> from the list of <span style="font-weight: bold">

<br />
However, there is no availability for <span style="font-weight: bold">XML Data</span> file formats - either Import or Export - or support for

            <p>I followed the instructions given and then with to the card company and tried to log in with the same results. Last night I got out my laptop and went to the company and logged in and changed my pass word. I was able then to log in with my laptop. Today
 When I got an email from a friend I would click on it to go to his page and it would list Facebook in the address window and then show in the other window it was downloading but it would flash back to the address window and then to the loading window and never
 load the site. When this happens I lose control of my scroll wheel and if I want to type a search item into the address box&nbsp;it would allow one letter and then I would have to click to get the cursor back and if I was quick enough I could get a second letter
 in the search box. Restarting the computer would fix the problem.</p>

            I still was unable to get into my file on the credit card site. It kept telling me my user name and password was wrong. I knew my user name was right because the kept telling me what it was.&nbsp;I went to my laptop and tried to get in with the user name and
 password I had setup last week using the laptop. It told me my user name or password was incorrect. Tried it several time and finally went the forgotten password route I tried the password I had used last week as my new password but that didn't work. I then
 scrambled that password and it worked and I was on the secure site. So I came back to the desktop and used the new password and Bingo I was in. I have no clue what will happen tomorrow or the next day. Fingers crossed. Thanks for everyone's help.&nbsp; Now I have
 to figure out why clicking on a item in a Facebook email causes my computer to act up. Have a good day.

            <p>Up to several month ago I would get a notice from Facebook about friends having post and I would click on the picture and go view their post. Then that stopped and I would get emails about individual friends posting. Then about 11/2 months ago I received
 an email and when I went to click on it to see what was said but when it went to try to access the site it would open up a page and show the address and in the window showing it loading would start and then it would flashing back and forth between the two.
 Then I would find that my wheel on my mouse would not control the slider on my Inbox. Also I could not type into the search box/address box.. I would click on it and get a blinking cursor and if I was fast enough I cold get one letter in the box. I would then
 have to click again and get the cursor back and try to get the next letter in the box.&nbsp; I have no problems with any other email that has a site for me to click on and go too.. I had a pup.optional.sweetpacks on my system and&nbsp;my Malwarebytes found it and removed
 it. &nbsp;I run Microsoft Security Essentials after that and it found nothing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have thought about my problems with the card company and I think it was my not reading all the fine print&gt; I kept trying to us my old passwords and they had canceled they had canceled them. It gave a statement about not using any of the last five passwords.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What makes me upset is that my Internet provider's repair service said I should go to Friefox or Chrome and the person I worked with at the card company said the same thing.<em>&nbsp; go back to 3.0 and then the first Internet Explore. I have been on line since
 1995. They say Chrome is fast, I will be 76 next month I don't need to go any faster cause I am close to the end.</em></p>

<h2>            Taskbar Bug or Feature&#63; Build 14271</h2>
                    <p>So i upgraded to Build 14271 smoothly and quick but on boot, i notice my Taskbar is weird. At most only 3 icons can be displayed and if i wanted to see more, i'll need to click on the white bar to see more icons. Also, normally if i wanted to show desktop,
 i just need to push my mouse cursor to the top right corner and i'll see my desktop but now that feature is not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i made the taskbar larger, it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there somewhere i can change these settings or is this a bug? Attached picture for your understanding.</p>

    <title>Process for Company Domain Change &#40;Due to Re-branding&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melissahaber  say:</h3>
<h2>            Process for Company Domain Change &#40;Due to Re-branding&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My company is in the middle of re-branding and we need to switch the domain of our Office 365 account (eg. Old = CompanyA.com, New= CompanyB.com). I have started the process by buying the domain and verifying it in our 365 account. Now I am starting to migrate
 the email addresses over to the new&nbsp; @company.com account. However, as we have started the process, we have noticed a few issues:</p>
<p>1. The "shared with me" folder is no longer viewable for the people who have switched over to the new domain @companyB. I assume this is because the links were shared with the email associated with the old domain @companyA. How do I resolve this?</p>
<p>2. In new user accounts, I still see the old domain @companyA lingering in some places, for example my OneDrive account is still showing that I am linked to the old domain&nbsp;as opposed to my new domain. This is occurring in other places too.
</p>
<p>We still need to maintain receiving email for the old domain for at least several months. We also need to maintain all our current email inbox, our file documentation, and office 365 settings so we cannot make a complete "switch," if that make sense....</p>

<p>Hi Shirley- My shared with me folder suddenly appeared today. Odd that it wasn't there on Friday (several days after I made the domain switch), but it's there now. I'm checking with the other employee who was experiencing the problem to see what his status
 is.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I would still like to get a better understanding of how this process should work and how I should go about eventually eliminating the old domain from all aspects of our office 365 account. For example, even though I am signed in as a member
 of the new domain (@j***.com) I still see in my Office 365 OneDrive account that the domain URL is</p>
<p><a href="https://atsrvcs-my.sharepoint.com/..." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">a***-my.sharepoint.com/...</a>. &nbsp;(a***.com being the old domain).</p>
<p>Is the new domain solely acting as an alias that is pointing to the old domain? Short of opening up a new Office 365 account, is there any way to completely change over?</p>

<p>Hi Melissa,</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>OneDrive for Business site is&nbsp;a personal site&nbsp;in My Site. My Site settings are accessed from the User Profile page in the SharePoint admin center.&nbsp; Default user profile properties are fed into SharePoint Online from the Office 365 directory service. SharePoint
 Online receives profile information from the Office 365 directory service during regularly scheduled one-way synchronization—which should occur at least every 24 hours. For more information, please refer to:
<a href="https://support.office.microsoft.com/en-us/article/Manage-SharePoint-Online-user-profiles-from-the-SharePoint-admin-center-494bec9c-6654-41f0-920f-f7f937ea9723?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>If you still have the old domain in the URL of OneDrive for Business now, we will help you check the situation in the backend based on the information you provided.</p>

<p>Office 365 for small business does not have a sharepoint admin center. How do I access and change user profile properties in this case? How do I change my sharepoint site url to the new domain?</p>

<p>hi melissa,</p>
<p>since the shared folders/files are indexed by url, if you change domain name, the corresponding url will be changed as well. that may explain why shared with me folder disappear after changing the domain. after re-sharing file/folder, it will take some time
 to finish a reindexing process. this may cause the reappearance of shared with me folder.</p>
<p>about&nbsp;changing user profile information, could you check if you can go to delve page by clicking your account in the upper right corner &gt; about me? there is an option to edt profile there.</p>

<p>as to the onedrive for business url, normally, the url will be changed automatically after some time of changing domain. since this issue still persists, we would collect your tenant information in private message for investigation. here is the link to access

    <title>Why does the number of records in Access is not the same in the Form - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr_s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why  does the number of records in Access is not the same in the Form view and in the &#34;backend&#34; table &#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Every time i finish entering my data in the form and save it - the next time i open Access, the number of records that appear in the form view does not reflect the actual number of records from the table. When browsing in the form view, some records appear
 twice, with the exact same information, however there is no actual duplicate record in the table. It's almost as if every time a record is being edited, it creates a second record that only appears in the form view.<br />
<br />
Any help on this matter would be appreciated!<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

            What is the form's record source set to?&nbsp; Is it a query with more than one table in it?&nbsp; If so, it is likely you have a one-to-many situation and so it has to show you the multiple records in order to be able to display the many side.

            Wow, that was fast!! First time posting here and it's definitely not going to be the last!!<br />
<br />
The Access database is fairly 'basic'. It's being used internally for client consultation only by just one person. I built it really quickly with nothing "fancy" as she was still using Paradox (yeah, i know!). Therefore it is not using an SQL connection (or
 any OBDC) as everything is Internal on her PC and with a backup on the server. I'll be honest I don't often build databases in Access but I felt bad that she was using such an outdated system - so i created one in a hour. It mainly consist of about 9 or 10
 tables and one form. She uses the form to input her data.I've built the relationships between the tables in order to unify everything with drop down menus since most of the data she input (except the personal client information) is pretty much always from
 the same choices (reasons, number of visits, region, language, gender, etc) so it eliminate the typos when pulling out reports.
<br />
<br />
Everything works great, except for that! There are actually about 230 records in the tables (backend) but from the form, it shows about 300 records - the extra ones all being duplicates, which do not appear in the table.<br />
<br />
The error was probably made by myself when I built it - I may have forgot a step or something since this is not my area of expertise!! I hope this gives you a little more information, otherwise don't hesitate to ask me for more details and I'll be glad to provide
 it!<br />
Thanks!<br />

            You provided a lot of information but yet left out a key component that was asked for twice (once by me and once by Karl) - what is the actual record source of the form (is it a query or select statement and if either of those what is the SQL for it)?

            I apologize for that, it wasn't intentional! Being such a noob with Access I wasn't sure where to look for! I think this might be what you were requesting. Looking at the form Property sheet in the record source:<br />
SELECT [Client Information].*, [Referal Reasons].Value FROM [Client Information];
<br />
<br />
If not I'm really sorry. If you wouldn't mind pointing out where I would find that information, I'd appreciate it!<br />

<p><br />
It would look like you already have that and I apologize for not pointing out where to find it.&nbsp; It looks like you have a multivalued field (referal reasons) and that is why you are seeing the multiple records.&nbsp; As including [Referal Reasons].Value is going
 to output a duplicate record of everything except that the values that have been selected will determine the count of duplicates.&nbsp; So if 3 were selected, 3 duplicate records will show up.&nbsp; The unfortunate thing is, that if you include the referral reasons
 field, you have to use .Value instead of just including the field in the normal sense because it will not be updatable if you use it with just
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SELECT [Client Information].* FROM [Client Information]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try the above syntax but I'm pretty sure it will render your query non-updatable.&nbsp; So what should you do?&nbsp; Well, you could remove that field from the query completely (that would require you to not only remove it where it is shown as [Referal Reasons].Value
 but also just change the [Client Information].* to an individual listing of each field so you can bypass the referal reasons field.&nbsp; Then you would need to have the reasons updated in another way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Normally, we use a separate table for storing the multiple selections so we can use it as a subform on the main form.&nbsp; But using the built-in multi-valued field ends up doing the same behind the scenes but it is not so easy to get to the table it creates.</p>

            Thank you for following up! I'm not currently at the office but i will try your suggestion tomorrow and shall let you know how it went.
<br />
<br />
In the meantime here are some more information, taught maybe it could be useful: <br />
the form has about 20-25 fields. From those, there are about 10 that have their own table as the choices are limited to those in that table, and were reflected in drop down menus on the form. A few of them have the option of being able to choice more than one
 selection. i.e. The referal reasons table has about 20 choices and more than one can be selected for each record. I'm not exactly sure what you meant by the example of if 3 were selected, 3 duplicate records will show up. I tried to find some type of correlation
 as to why it was happening on some record and not in other instances. As some of them have almost all the same selections but one record would duplicate (only from the form view) while others won't. They usually make only 1 or 2 duplicates from what i've seen.<br />
<br />
There's also one table entitled Client information. All the fields that have predefined values (drop down menus on the forms) have their own table, which is linked by a relationship to that particular field reflected in the Client information Table.
<br />
<br />
Like I said I don't often create Access databases and this one was made in about 1 hour or so. Which is why i suspect the error is probably something I've done (or forgot to do)!!<br />
<br />
I hope I don't sound to vague!<br />
Thanks again!<br />

            Maybe some background will help you. An Access form is a view of your data. The data that can be viewed through a form is dependent on the Recordsource. A Recordsource is either a table, a query or an SQL Statement. However, it could be blank indicating
 an unbound form. <br />
<br />
If the Recordsource is NOT the table, then it probable the records displayed in the form are less than the records in the table as they are probably filtered in some way.

            Sorry for the delay ! I was really busy lately at work! Anyhow, I wanted to thank every one who sent suggestions! It's appreciated. I try a few but it doesn't seem to have solve the problem unfortunately.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I also asked a programmer who stopped by the office to take a look at it quickly, but he couldn't pinpoint exactly what was wrong. He tried a few options but in the end it remains the same!! hehe<br />
<br />
Anyhow, this database is a confidential client-based one, so at year's end after the annual report has been written, all the information is deleted. Which I'm currently in the process of doing so in the coming weeks.
<br />
<br />
Therefore, if anyone would have suggestions how should I rebuild it once the report is out since the database will be empty. I would appreciated any suggestions/solutions or even templates that I could simply personalize. As mentioned previously, the main thing
 i need would be :<br />
<ul>
<li>a form, which would be the only thing that my colleague would need to use to input her client's information</li><li>about 25 fields on the form<br />
</li><li>there are about 10 fields that would need to be drop down menus with predetermined choices (which could be easily modified or updated to add-remove choices)<br />
</li><li>secured and protected</li><li>the only unique key required is a year-#client format ( i.e. 2010/11-01) and being able to be sorted automatically by the client number (i.e. 2010/11-11 would appear before 2010/11-100)<br />
</li><li>and most important, to ensure that the number of records are the same in the form as in the "back-end" - no "duplicates" being created for some odd reason!<br />
</li></ul>
Thank you in advance and again, thank you everyone who replied! I'm glad I used this site and was pleasantly surprised with all the responses and who quick you guys are!! A1!!<br />
Have a great day.<br />
Cheers<br />

            FYI if this can be useful - while exporting the data, i've noticed that the duplication problem seems to only be occurring when a client file is opened to add an additional referal reason (i.e. when the consult more than once). That field is a predetermined
 list of choices. There is a drop menu with check boxes that you may choice as many as you want.<br />

    <title>Includetext field updating extremely slow since upgrade from Word 2003 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Includetext field updating extremely slow since upgrade from Word 2003 &#62; 2010</h2>
                    
<p><span><span>We are testing Office 2010 and have run into an issue with Word 2010 on documents that have an Includetext field.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Most of our word 2003 .doc files have includetext fields in the main document, as well as the footers, and we have a macro that updates them all when the document
 is printed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Since upgrading those documents to Word 2010 XML format, and using the same or a similar macro to update the fields before printing, the process takes an extremely
 long time.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>For instance, a 40 page document that has two sections, and two includetext fields in each footer, takes minutes to complete. Whereas the same document in .doc format
 is done in a few seconds.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Updating a single includetext field is fine, but as soon as those multiple fields span over multiple pages and sections, the update process begins to take too long.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Our 2010 setup is identical to our 2003 setup. Except for the conversion of the .doc files to .docx</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Here is the macro we are currently using. I’m wondering if it is<em>too</em> thorough, and causing word to update the same fields (especially the fields
 in the footers) needlessly.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Dim oField As Field</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Dim oSection As Section</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Dim oHeader As HeaderFooter</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Dim oFooter As HeaderFooter</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>On Error GoTo ErrorHandler</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For Each oSection In ActiveDocument.Sections</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For Each oHeader In oSection.Headers</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If oHeader.Exists Then</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Tommy,</p>
<p>You really don't need the ' If oHeader.Exists Then' or ' If oFooter.Exists Then' tests, since the respective For Each loops&nbsp; already take care of that. Even so, deleting those tests would have little impact on the performance. Of more importance, you shouldn't
 need a macro to update the fields one by one at print time - at most, you might want a macro that ensures the 'Update fields before printing' option is checked, under Word Options|Display (or, with Word 2010, 'update linked data before printing' under File|Options|Display).
 As it is, having a macro to update the fields as you have now may only mean that installations of Office with the 'Update fields before printing' option set are actually updating the fields *twice* at print time.</p>
<p>I also note that, although you say the only thing that has changed is an upgrade from Office 2003 to Office 2010, you're also now running Windows 7. If the INCLUDETEXT links are over a network drive, it may be that the network isn't configured correctly
 and that could explain the performance hit. plus, you'd need to make sure the INCLUDETEXT links are pointing to the corrrect versions of the files (ie change the field's file reference from .doc to .docx if they're now meant to point to a docx file).</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>It was my understanding that includetext fields are not updated at print, even with the 'update fields' checkbox is ticked. Hence the need for a macro to do it manually at print.</p>
<p>The linked documents are indeed over a network drive, however in my testing I remapped that drive to point to my local disk, and then changed the fields themselves to point to C:\ on my testing machine, but both had no effect.</p>

            <p>Hope you are still monitoring this after all this time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you explain why the updating of links is slow? I use a mailmerge to print from a database. each page has a different illustration. the illustrations are stored as word.doc files and linked in using the old {<span>LINK
 Word.Document.8</span>.filename.doc} method with the document name passed from Access. The document is created&nbsp;very quickly including&nbsp;filling in the file names for the&nbsp;image links. That is much faster than before, but then it is very,&nbsp;very&nbsp;slow to update the
 linked in images.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;A&nbsp;100 pages of text merged with multiple images per page used to take 1-2 mins in 2003. (I avoided 2007 because it did not work at all.)&nbsp;Now in 2010 it takes&nbsp;upwards of 10 mins per 100 pages&nbsp;on a much faster server. Updating a single highlighted field using
 F9 can take&nbsp;30 seconds(all images are under 50K). Neither the database, code, mailmerge.doc, nor the image.doc files have been converted or changed in any way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you think that it is a&nbsp;compatibility mode issue&nbsp;as you hinted at above? or a systematic problem after they&nbsp;revamped mailmerge. or perhaps they don't support the old command set well. Your thoughts please.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, do you believe that 2010 mailmerge will support different images on each page, and how would they best be linked?</p>

            <p>Since you can't vary the content in LINK fields, the question arieses as to why you're using them at all. Why not simply embed the content in the mailmerge main document?</p>
<p>As for&nbsp;merging images, you should use image files, not documents. If the path is included in the image field in the source file, you can use a field coded as:<br />
{IF {INCLUDEPICTURE {IF TRUE «Image»} \d} {INCLUDEPICTURE {IF TRUE «Image»} \d}}<br />
or:<br />
{IF {INCLUDEPICTURE {IF TRUE {MERGEFIELD Image}} \d} {INCLUDEPICTURE {IF TRUE {MERGEFIELD Image}} \d}}</p>
<p>The above field constructions insert the images and breaks the links to them as the merge executes. That should minimize/eliminate any delays. It also means you don't need to keep the images afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The field brace pairs (ie '{ }') for the above examples are created in the body of the document via Ctrl-F9 (Cmd-F9 on a Mac) - you can't simply type them or copy &amp; paste them from this message. Likewise, you can't type or copy &amp; paste
 the chevrons (ie '« »') - they're part of the actual mergefields, which you can insert from the mailmerge toolbar.</p>

            I never solved this issue, I worked around it instead.
<div><br />
<div>From what i observed, Word 2010 takes ages to open the .doc that contains the field data, in your case the illustrations. Rather than keeping the .doc file open, it closed it straight away, meaning Word2010 would have to reopen the .doc again if it needed
 to update another field. This caused the mammoth updating times.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I found it was also the case if I tried to update from a file that was a .docx (taking&nbsp;compatibility&nbsp;mode out of the equation)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I dont know why this is so much slower than in 2003, but I think you might be right when you say<i>&nbsp;"<span>they don't support the old command set well."</span></i></div>
<div><i><span><br />
</span></i></div>
<div><br />
<div>To work around it, I had to ensure the file needed to update from was always loaded with Word2010. I did this by putting the file in the Startup directory.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The file is now always loaded with Word, so when updating fields there is no need for Word to open the document for each field.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Note that only .dotx\docx files can be loaded as templates via the startup directory. &nbsp;As your file is a .doc, this means you'll need to convert it to docx, and then rename your fields to&nbsp;<span>{</span><span>LINK Word.Document.8</span><span>.filename.<b>docx</b>}</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps you some. </div>

            <p>Hi Tommy,</p>
<p>As indicated in my last reply to you, at least half your timing issue could have been due to the fact that you were using a macro for updating fields, when the same is done by simply setting Word's 'update links before printing'&nbsp;option. If that was set
<em>and</em> you were running the macro, you're more than doubling the time taken for the process.</p>
<p>Another, much simpler, approach for programmatically updating fields is to simply switch to Print Preview and back.</p>

            Its not very well highlighted in my original post, but the reason for the macro is the INCLUDETEXT fields, which are not updated at print-time like all the others.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>
<div><br />
<div>I assumed the same was true of the {link} fields that DB_Cooper posted about, but I may be wrong, and perhaps my solution&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;apply to him as much as I thought.</div>

<br />
Sorry, but that's not right - unless you've locked them, INCLUDETEXT fields <em>are</em> updated, just like any other fields you might have, if the 'update linked data before printing' option is checked under File|Options|Display. That's the whole point of
 having that option. Likewise, all other fields are updated if you check the 'update fields before printing' on the same screen. Furthermore, if you check the 'update automatic links at open' option under File|Options|Advanced&gt;General, you can ensure they'll
 update then too - unless you set a given field to manual update.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry I should have been more specific with the link structure:</p>
<p>{LINK Word.Document.8 {MERGEFIELD "Illustration1"} \p}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>where Illustration1 is the variable image document path.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason for using document format was to preserve the formatting and to avoid any problems with images created in applications not available on any given user's computer.
 Having the image imbedded in a doc insured compatibility across platforms. The database is&nbsp;a compliation of many author's work. Only the creator of the image needed to have the application available to open and format the original image when it was imbedded
 in the doc file. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize that this makes updating the fields a two part process. The first link update, inserting the path is very fast. It is the second update that is slow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The code to execute the second update is simply:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set objMerge = ActiveDocument</p>
<p>'THIS TEST UPDATES THE FIELDS AND RETURNS 0 IF SUCCESSFUL AFTER WHICH THEY ARE UNLINKED.</p>
<p>If ActiveDocument.Fields.Update = 0 Then</p>
<p>objMerge.Fields.Unlink</p>
<p>End If</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a routine in my original code to close all those extra open files after the update was complete. i will try to comment out that code and see what happens. if the files are gone then perhaps that is my problem. I was not aware that 2010 did not preserve
 the files open until you were finished. That could be why it slows down. Very interesting. If that is the culprit, then i can open the illustration files as i go&nbsp;(thereby keeping them open)&nbsp;and then clean them up as i did in the past after unlinking them.

<h2>            Unable to Install Build 17133.1</h2>
                    I have been trying for at least a week or so to install Windows 10 Home Insider Build number: 17133.1.&nbsp; The update does completely download.&nbsp; Windows 10 Home installs it, my computer automatically shuts off as normal during a regular update.&nbsp; Then when
 I turn the computer back on manually (pressing the power switch) I get a dialog box saying that the update had failed to install completely.&nbsp; The Windows Update re-downloads the same update and turns off my computer.&nbsp; Then I power my computer back on and get
 the same message.&nbsp; How can I fix this issue?&nbsp; I am currently there might be multiple copies of this update that might be causing this issue.&nbsp; Where on my system can I find where these updates are being downloaded to?

<p>You wrote that&nbsp;<span> "... my computer automatically shuts off as normal during a regular update.&nbsp; Then when I
<strong>turn the computer back on manuall</strong><strong>y</strong> (pressing the power switch).</span></p>
<p>As I ask you already why you had to press power switch manually? is should be automatic reboot when installation is finished? Sometimes it can take time to boot and you mast wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your another mail I see that update to 17127.1 3/21/2018 was performed ok. Have you install any programs or make some changes to system after that update?</p>
<p>

    <title>Bing Ads UET Tracking Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christinegray  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bing Ads UET Tracking Issues</h2>
                    <p>We have been experiencing issues tracking conversions. &nbsp;Bing Support has repeatedly checked out set up and says there is nothing wrong. &nbsp;Only conversions that we initiate are being tracked within the Bing UI. &nbsp;Bing keeps closing the ticket once we see their
 "test" conversion come through; I'm seeing different data in Google Analytics. Every time we say another conversion didn't register, we have to go through the same process and waste time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a fix? I don't see how we can keep using Bing as an agency without any conversions to report/optimize.</p>

            <p>Greetings Christine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My apologies, I was not aware that you&nbsp;were not using Google AdWords.&nbsp; Thank you for providing us with that information.&nbsp; I have removed the ticket number from your post to keep your information private within the public forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third party tracking tools, such as Google Analytics, are not able to identify low quality clicks that&nbsp;Bing Ads filters automatically from your performance data.&nbsp; Bing Ads will remove low quality clicks and the conversions associated with them.&nbsp; In running
 this report you can correlate this&nbsp;data with the reporting that Google Analytics is recording for Bing Ads conversions.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Dany,</p>
<p>Have the issue occurs only on one computer?<br />
If yes, confirm whether other users can access their OneDrive for Business libraries via their accounts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can confirm and try the suggestions below to see the outcome.<br />
1. Do you have third-party Anti-virus software installed? If yes, then I suggest you to disable the program and check if the issue persists.<br />
2. Place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps.<br />
To set the computer in clean boot, follow the steps from the link:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform a clean boot in Windows<br />
</a>3. Check if there is any local IE proxy by running the following windows command(Run
<b>Command Prompt</b> as administrator-&gt;Type the following command to check it).<br />
<b>Netsh winhttp show proxy</b></p>
<p>Please let me know your updates at your convenience.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Cliff</p>

            <p><span><span>Hello Julie,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Are you trying to redeem your Office 365 Personal Product Key with your Microsoft Account and encountering this issue?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, then to resolve the issue follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>To resolve this issue you will have to try redeeming Office 365 in the InPrivate browsing mode on Internet Explorer (IE).
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">W</span><span>e will have to try redeeming Office 365 using the InPrivate browsing mode from IE.
</span>try the section ‘Start an InPrivate browser session’ from the following article.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2811180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2811180</span></span></a></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Try redeeming Office 365 once you have launched IE in InPrivate browsing mode. The URL to redeem Office 365 would be:
</span><a href="http://office.com/setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://office.com/setup</span></span></a><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">and
 follow the steps to redeem with your Microsoft Account. Check if you were able to redeem Office 365 successfully.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In case you still have the same issue, then we will have to reset the IE browser. Follow the steps from the following Microsoft article to reset IE on your computer.
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After resetting the browser restart the computer</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings
 that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if you are now able to redeem Office 365.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try the above steps and let us know the result.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Thank you.</span>

It's perhaps the least serious of a number of profound shortcomings in MS Word's citation handling, and there seems precious little interest by MS to fix them.

            <p>As it happens, I can answer that because I recently downloaded and installed Open Sans Condensed and Open Sans Condensed Light (these fonts are specified by Rotary International for Rotary websites, and I'm our club's webmaster, trying to update our site).
 They seem to display and print correctly in both Word 2003 and Word 2013, so they should be okay in Word 2007 and 2010 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a PC, fonts are not imported into Word but installed in&nbsp;Windows. Word then has access to all fonts installed in Windows. As described in
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Cc958234.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this TechNet article</a>, font licenses include varying levels of "embeddability": Installable, Editable, Print &amp; Preview, and Restricted. There was a time when an Installable font would be installed automatically when a document using it was opened. This no
 longer happens (I guess it was a privacy/security issue that users objected to), but in any case the Open Sans font family have Editable embedding, which means that a document containing these fonts can be opened on a system on which the fonts are not installed
 and edited using the font. To have the font available for other documents, however, it would have to be installed in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of which is to say that you can provide a template that uses Open Sans, and you can provide instructions for downloading and installing the fonts, but it would probably be simpler to supply the fonts with the template. In Windows 7 and 8, the fonts can
 be saved anywhere; installing them just requires that you right-click the font file and choose
<strong>Install</strong> from the context menu or preview the file and click the <strong>
Install</strong> button.</p>

                    So at my&nbsp;work I am trying to make a mailmerge more simple.. There is one main excel Data sheet with info like name, address, amount paid/ amount owed, etc. There are 7 different kinds of skeleton&nbsp;letters to be used with this one Excel Sheet, and the excel
 sheet specifies what letter to use, but They want none of this to be manually done, they want the computer to do all of the work. I am using INCLUDETEXT to plug text from other word documents (about 20 in total), into the 7 kinds of letters which is working
 fine. I guess my main issue is trying to have the computer know when and what letter to use, and how to get the (50) letters printed at one time without any problems.&nbsp;Another&nbsp;problem is trying to shorten the path if the INCLUDETEXT. I know there is something&nbsp;I
 can do to go from {IF {MERGEFIELD code} = A {INCLUDETEXT "C:\\Folder1\\Folder2\\Folder3\\Folder4\\File1.docx" }&nbsp; } ...&nbsp;to a shortened version.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't have much experience with thi

            Your highlighted code is correct, but since I dont know how you define your variables, and you didnt say what kind of error you receive, I can only guess if something goes wrong , it is not about that line of code but because of the defining variables
 part.

            the variable values are set by input box prompts at the start of the whole macro code. The "increment" covers the amount of data (i.e. number of rows) that are in relation to one slice of a cylindrical tank. Each slice has the same amount of points (i.e.
 increments) as each other hence this variable can be given a single value. It is a variable in the sense that different tanks' data never have the same amount of points per slice.

            I assume that the input vales are valid, then what kind of error did you encounter when you run the code?<br />

</p><p>Please be informed that Skype premium is no longer available since 2014&nbsp;and we sent out an email notification regarding this. If you can no longer see the Skype premium on your account, it's possible that it is already expired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype premium's main feature is group video calling and we do understand the importance to use it anytime, anywhere and free of charge. This is why, we decided to change the Skype premium and made group video calling for free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you have an active calling subscription and wants to check it, you need to sign in to Skype website. You will not be able to see your subscription if you will sign in to Skype application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have questions and clarifications.</p>
