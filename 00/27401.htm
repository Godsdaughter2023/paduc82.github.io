<h2>            remove pc mightyMax</h2>
                    <p>I have picked up the PC MightyMax 2012 malware on my laptop. I am running Windows XP with the latest updates. My antivirus program is Microsoft Essentials. I have run a quick scan with no results. I have also run Microsoft Malware Removal tool with no results.
 PC MightyMax program does not show up on the installed list when I check the ADD/Removal programs. There is a pop-up that appears at times on the computer that says I have 856 problems on the laptop.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am currently running a full scan with Microsoft Essentials so far nothing has shown up.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also run&nbsp; MALWAREBytes - Anti Malware. PC MightyMax 2012 still has not been removed from the system.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any Suggestions? </p>

            PC MightyMax is a questionable registry cleaner. This means, that some security programs list it (often as PUP aka lowest danger level), others do not.&nbsp;
<div>In general, such program SHOULD uninstall itself (have seen Pup's that fail to do so).&nbsp;
<div>In other cases they can be cleaned by RevoUninstaller, or anti-malware programs (Spybot and Superantispyware would be good bets ).&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, if you do not know how such program got installed, scan with Hitman Pro to make sure you got no trojan downloader. Some of programs are installed by trojans because of affiliate programs or other reasons.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Connecting to EAS via Outlook 2016 - emails downloading then disappearing</h2>
                    <p>This is driving me bananas</p>
<p>
</p><p>My email is with www.ZOHO.com ... I have multiple domains / email addresses and the behaviour is exactly the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I connect my Outlook 2016 to Zoho EAS mail server. &nbsp;All the emails download, then magically disappear when the downloads are finished.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>repairing Outlook</li><li>deleting and rebuilding profiles</li><li>scanning pst / ost</li><li>cleaning and re-installing Office 2016 ground up</li><li>I have tried changing the cache time from 1 month to forever and back again - that just seems to screw things up</li><li>Same for Outlook and Mail ... not surprisingly.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>After having tried the above, the new emails start to come through randomly, but the old ones never re-appear. &nbsp;The response is identical every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMAP works for syncing emails ... but it's slow and doesn't do the Calendars or Contacts which I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My iPhone works PERFECTLY!!!! &nbsp; I'm running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously Microsoft ... this is YOUR backend Exchange server and software, and it works with iOS, but fails on MAIL and OUTLOOK 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone, please help if you have solved this. &nbsp;It's driving me friggin bananas.</p>
<p>

<p>From the help pages, it doesn't look like ZOHO actually support Outlook as an EAS client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ZOHO doesn't use an actual Exchange server but uses a custom mail server with an EAS implementation for which I can't determine&nbsp;its version. Outlook 2013 and Outlook 2016 require the EAS 14.1 implementation and was actually only intended to be used with
 Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, it is best to contact ZOHO and ask them whether they support Outlook 2016 as an EAS client. If they do, they might be able to see something useful in their connection logs and can reset the EAS partnership at server level.</p>

            <p>I too have this exact problem, but syncing with outlook.com. I assume outlook.com is running a sufficient EAS server to perform with Outlook 2016 requirements?<br />
</p>
<p>I can't tell you how excruciating this is when you're paying money for these Microsoft products that do not work correctly, while the stock email application on my iPhone works perfectly with outlook.com!</p>

    <title>My outlook.com mail is not updating and receiving mail... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john_r_g  say:</h3>
<h2>            My outlook.com mail is not updating and receiving mail...</h2>
                    <p>I was wondering the last few days why I have not received much and it seems outlook.com is messed up as of September 24, 2016. I can send emails through Outlook but nothing has been coming in. I have checked my host and my email at my domain and much email
 has come in but it is not reflected in my Outlook and not in my devices that use Outlook.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone into my account setting in Outlook and through Mail on my Surface 4 and noted an error. I opened the account and added the port numbers. Strangely it asked for imap when this had and is a Pop account. One Pop account is there and works. Another
 does not. This error is strange because I have not changed a thing, it still sent my email though, so it appears Outlook is currently having issues with account setup and servers. I updated my account with pop settings though the text boxes said imap. It accepted
 the data but is stuck saying "update in progress" in my connected accounts page. It has been stuck with "update in progress" for over an hour. I have had my mail service through GoDaddy and linked to Outlook.com for years without issue. All of a sudden&nbsp; it
 has become an issue. Is MS fixing something or are we just to guess what is happening here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the **** is going on? Thanks for any help... </p>
<p>

            <p>This is an update after trying to see if GoDaddy knew of the issue. They did say specifically their server is a pop server. The new Outlook.com front end won't let me name a pop server, only an imap. Now if I try and add a new account/email and select on
 the next screen "add to existing folders, I then get a choice to add a pop server. So I fill in all the details but in the end outlook won't accept it because the account already exists. So I delete the account and start again. If I select add to exisiting
 folders and then address and password it then says the account is connected... Once again to the imap and no option to add the pop connection. It is a vicious circle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So apparently Microsoft has fu&amp;^ed us over with their update and locked us out. For almost 7 years this&nbsp; has been a non problem with 3 generations of Lumia phones a Surface 4 and even hotmail connector on a workstation using outlook 2010. My godaddy account
 has not changed so I blame MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I have my Lumia Icon on Win 10 set up using it's mail app and connected to the outlook.com acct and my outside pops. It works. My Surface 4 on Win 10/latest updates last week won't sync any account and Outlook.com works but only with one of two
 accounts and is painfully slow. I reset the Mail app to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. I have done nothing but all has stopped functioning normally since 9/24/16..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit* This morning I went into Outlook.com and deleted my main account and was able to add a new account by entering an invalid password. By doing so it allowed me to enter a pop server and all server information but... As I stepped through the pop server
 dialog,&nbsp; upon activating it received an error: "TLS Failure Encountered". Invalid Token. I went back and tried changing to secondary listed ports and 995 for incoming and then received the following error: "The Pop Server doesn't supports features needed to
 download email." So nothing has changed at GoDaddy. All works fine outside of Windows 10 Mail and Outlook.com. I can use webmail at GoDaddy and add it to my phone using Advanced mode just fine. So about all I can think of doing to get this working.</p>

            <p>I just noted in the Store "Mail and Calendar" had an update. Did the update and I was able to directly get mail from my pop server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My outlook.com account in Mail is finally updating but very delayed like 3+ hours. Still one of my pop accounts has pop issues. I can force it to let me into the pop server dialog but continues to have errors and when I back out defaults to imap.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried setting the Pop and Imap menu to allow devices and apps to use pop but no help and not sure if that setting has anything to do with the account and connecting to a pop server.</p>

            And That's Not All.... Today I found that Mails latest update won't synch on my machine with the People App. Eneter a name in Mail and nothing. Only manually addressed emails. I can go into people and click through and get to email but I cannot start but
 using Mail. I had in the past and all my contacts are in people and on Outlook.com. I tried re-setting to logging in with my windows account thinking maybe I needed to do that but nothing changed. So Mail is still crippled and so is Outlook.com. Outlook.com
 takes hours to pass email still.<br />

            <p>Again I have confirmed that everyone else in the world can work with the GoDaddy POP based email servers except the Outlook.com team. &nbsp;Gmail, Apple Mail, Outlook Desktop 2010, the Old Outlook (Live, Hotmail), and even a simple VB6 app I pulled down from
 Plant Source Code I think it as I compiled up in a few minutes and was downloading my messages.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the update and bad news for everyone as of 10/14/2016 who get the error message when trying to add a connected account in Outlook.com that reads "The POP server doesn't support features needed to download email". &nbsp;Also for users who their accounts
 just never update because you added a connected account and Outlook.com configured it as an IMAP account instead of a POP one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is from the Microsoft Global Escalation Services support tech I've been working with for months.<br />
</p>

<p>
 We are currently in work to implement the fix and there is no ETA for same.</span></p>

</p><p>Now even worse is that they are archiving the service request even though it is not resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What he told me over the phone is that it's both a problem on GoDaddy's end and on Microsoft's. &nbsp;They are saying that GoDaddy does not support the full POP RFC Specifications so they are working to implement a workaround. &nbsp;But once it is implemented it gets
 pushed out in multiple "Forests" so my guess is 6 months after the first implementation all users might get it by how long it has taken to migrate all the existing users over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But how come everyone else including Microsoft's own Desktop Outlook 2010 can do it? &nbsp;Because I'll be honest here in that the Outlook.com team is horrible to say the least. &nbsp;With the number of bugs I've come across and them not being able to resolves something
 the rest of the world and Microsoft themselves has been able to do for decades proves how incompetent this team is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For them to blame even part of it on GoDaddy is ridiculous. &nbsp;For Microsoft's Outlook.com lead programmer to not contact GoDaddy with the specifications of what they need supported to make Microsoft's (and only Microsoft's) products work with it goes to show
 how little they actually care about their Outlook.com product. &nbsp;Let alone all of the other email systems it is also not working with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Way to keep long term users on your ecosystem. &nbsp;How I wish I was programming for Apple users instead of Windows users these days.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. One thing of interest.... My Outlook 2010 using Outlook Connector, on a workstation had stopped synching days ago to outlook.com. I have 2 POP mail accounts setup and functioning as additional accounts, but any synching of outlook products
 is a 100% fail except for Windows 10" Mail app which will synch to outlook.com. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case that this has been "archived" is shameful. As a stockholder and user of Windows since it's infancy and never ever buying an apple product, I am stunned. MS needs to man up and fast.</p>

            <p>**UPDATE**</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears Microsoft or GoDaddy has resolved most of this issue. I am now able to connect my GoDaddy POP account to Outlook once again. I cannot using Outlook Connector In Office 10 but at least Outlook.com and the Mail App in Windows 10 now connects and
 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past one could not delete or update the pop account in outlook.com, where managing connected accounts for the mail app is done. It would simply cause an error. So this morning I deleted my pop account on outlook.com.&nbsp; I then was able to add back the
 account and checked manually to set it up as a pop account. Good news. Before I could not even get a pop option. So I got a couple of errors which related to the port. GoDaddy wanted I believe port 80 or 110 to be defined but they caused errors. I ended up
 putting 995 which was Outlooks default and it logged in and accepted the pop account. To find the account I had to click "more" and then the email address I desired was evident. I really dislike the mail apps tendency to bury standard inboxes and outboxes
 under "more" Just have the separate accounts listed with boxes listed below like they always have. Saves keystrokes and hunting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So It appears functionality has finally returned with no notice from MS or GoDaddy. Hmmm.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the last few months I set up independent accounts outside of outlook to access my mail as well as using browser based web mail since any&nbsp; time I opened the Mail app, it would sync my main servers email to the device, whether Surface or Nokia Icon w/
 W10 mobile, and delete what I normally wanted to keep on the server. So I never would dare open the mail app fearing losing something. I noted an option in resetting my pop account in Outlook to leave messages on the server. I am hopeful things are back to
 normal regarding functionality of a GoDaddy POP Account and Outlook.com and Windows 10 Mail.</p>

            <p>It was back in November right around Thanksgiving that my GoDaddy started working again. &nbsp;My guess is GoDaddy made some changes on their end because Microsoft hasn't fixed much at all with Outlook.com in over 9 months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it still can't delete your messages from the GoDaddy server from what I have been able to see. &nbsp;So I still need to log into my GoDaddy account and delete them from there. &nbsp;Google, Yahoo, and everyone else including the old Hotmail/Live/Outlook could
 all delete the messages also from GoDaddy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if they could just get it to where Outlook.com could view things like PDF and image files and get the rules working it might start getting close to as great of a program as the old version they took away from us.</p>

            <p>I normally leave all on the server and delete them from my workstation. If I did so on my phone or surface I may inadvertently lose something while traveling.&nbsp; Before the update by whomever, Mail would delete all files on the GoDaddy server when syncing,
 blowing away an email I may have been hoping to save, so I stopped using Mail at all. One thing I did note is the sending server dialog and chekbox on setup won't accept any of the ports on GoDaddy so it won't send mail form smtp.secureserver.net. Before it
 didn't seem to have that option, but sending from outlook with my normal email isn't an issue. Mostly was receiving email a few months ago was painful since it could be 10 minutes delay or at times half a day, so I always had Workspace Email ready in a browser
 to receive it right away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad to have most functionality back in any case so I could delete a few redundant accounts in the Mail app. Took much too long and both MS and GD seemed oblivious to the issue forcing some to pay for imap accounts.

<h2>            MS Excel 2016 - format legend in charts with subscripts</h2>
                    <p>hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i chose excel and word over latex in hope that nowadays everything is possible in MS office. now i cannot format legends in my charts, like subscripted letters after not subscripted letters. its only to format the whole line. the most easiest way would be,
 when the legend would take the same format as the text formated in the cells. but this also seems to be not possible. is there one clear way that I don't see here?</p>
<br />
<p>thank you guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>cheers</p>
<p>bernd</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit:</p>
my way so far, create an textfield over the legend and edit it. also format the textfield so that there is no space to the borders of the field so the text fits better to the legend.
<p />

 (2) In the internet advertisement, there is availability of PDF reader to be downloaded for Nokia 2700c with different memory capacities. Can that be downlaoded directly from the mobile? Can that be involved virus? (3) There is also internet advt for antivirus

<h2>            A Problem with my phone &#40;Sound &#38;amp&#59; Speed&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Yesterday I heavily used my phone. I did many video calls, used the internet, downloaded and saved a "configuration SMS message" etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Especially after I downloaded and saved a configuration SMS message, I realized that the phone's speed/performance slowed down a bit. The configuration message was about Mobile TV's Access Point Connection Settings. The configuration message was saved&nbsp;under
 "Access Points" menu..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I realized the phone's sounds seemed like I turned the volume down. Sounds like "warning tones" sounded "faded down" or something. It was weird.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, when I recieve a SMS message, there was no sound at all. I have that Nokia's very traditional "Message" tune, but it was like the phone was in "Silent Mode." I was recieving messages very quietely. No "sound" in notifiying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I switched off the phone, then took the battery out and restarted the phone, and everything was back to normal. The speed, the sound in recieving a&nbsp;SMS message&nbsp;and all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should I worry or do you think the problem is gone now? Could this be just a minor temporary bug? I was wondering what could cause it to happen in the first place? It never happened before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanx.</p>

<h2>            Tasks removed from PDA - how to get them synced back&#63;</h2>
                    I deleted all the tasks from my PDA. I have the tasks I want to keep on my desktop in Outlook. I want to sync them so that the ones in Outlook transfer to my PDA&nbsp; -
<i><b>not </b></i>to delete the ones on my desktop!<br />
<br />
When I run ActiveSync it looks like a normal sync and no error messages come up, but no tasks come over onto the PDA.&nbsp; The only setting I could change in Activesync was the 'conflict' setting for all sync. It is set to replace items on the PDA. If I highlight
 tasks and choose settings it's greyed out.<br />
<br />
This is a one-off until I get the tasks over then I'll revert to normal sync as I have done before. But how can I get the tasks over? (This only affects tasks, not contacts or calendar which are fine.)<br />
<br />
I'm running ActiveSync 4.5 under XP on the desktop and Mobile 6 Professional on the PDA.<br />

            Move these tasks with notes to a subfolder and sync again to see if that makes a difference. There is a known issue when synchronizing tasks, calendar or contacts that have notes attached. However, those without notes will sync across.
<div><br />
<div>If the above does not &nbsp;help, try adding the tasks by small groups of ten to the Tasks main folder in Outlook. If they sync, continue adding them by small groups until it stops. It will then be easier to identify a corrupt notes if any.</div>

<div>What version of Outlook do you have?</div>

                    I would like the ability to prevent a meeting invite from being immediately deleted (i.e., moved to the trash) upon reply.

<br />
How do I suggest this to Microsoft? I'm stuck in what looks like a community forum—not a features request space.

<p>Are the songs you can’t play downloaded with the Zune Pass or purchased?</p>
<p>Do you get an error message as well with that code?</p>
<p>Since when does this happen? Did you get something different in between? Do you have a new computer or firewall?

<h2>            Please Help&#58; Can&#39;t recovery from Hidden partition Nokia Booklet 3G</h2>
                    Hi all I recently purchased the Nokia Booklet 3G and it came pre installed with Windows 7 Starter. I decided to install Windows 7 Home Premium and replace Windows 7 Starter. After doing so I found out this drastically decreased the notebooks battery life.
 I want to re-install Windows 7 Starter on my Nokia Booklet 3G, I looked in the manual they say to press F8 and choose repair computer from the menu that appears. I do that and I get to a window that allows me to recover from a System Image. I know that there
 is a hidden partition on the Nokia Booklet that contains the original factory system image but when I click "Recover from System image" it says a System image can't be found. Did I corrupt that hidden partition or something or how do I recover my Nokia Booklet
 3G from that hidden partition when the computer for some reason doesn't see it as a System image. All I would like to do is recover the Nokia Booklet to factory condition by using that hidden partition or any other way if pos

<p>This what i did:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copy at least the 802.11 drivers to a flash drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call Microsoft Store and return your 'upgrade' of Starter to Home Premium (its can be a pain but yes they can refund it) and purchase a downloadable ISO. If you go that route make sure you tell them explicitly that you purchased a Windows Anytime Upgrage
 or else they'll get confused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Burn that ISO to a DVD and purchase/borrow an external DVD rom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boot windows 7 from the disk, format your HDD and reinstall a clean OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reinstall your wifi drivers and reinstall all other system drivers/softare &amp; run Windows Update</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively you can call Nokia and have them walk you through a refresh.</p>

            I'm not exactly sure why the partition is there as there aren't any recovery tools from Nokia. Give them a call, perhaps they can send you a recovery disk.

<p>It seems that Nokia is not giving full explanation of the procedure. I was informed about F8 functionality today via their Nokia Care Call Center. But they did not mention that you should first change settings in BIOS (after pressing F2 during the boot)
 to allow advanced boot options (by default it was set to disabled). After this change F8 started to work (previously system did not respond to pressing F8).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After selecting F8 a menu&nbsp;shows with many different options. You should select "Repair computer". Afterwards there is another menu. If you want to go for reinstalling Windows7 from scratch and deleting all your data, you should pick last option which is
 "ImageX Recovery...". Another hard to guess action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reasume, two tricks needs to be done (changing Bios first, selecting Repair computer and then ImageX recovery - secondly) and Nokia Care nor instruction is not informing about those. Shame.</p>

<p>^Hi stan i did as i mentioned in your last post...And now, the windows does not start properly. A window saying that&nbsp; Startup repair is trying to solve the problem and couple of minutes later, windows could not find the file in order to startup the windows...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was wondering could you help me how to solve the problem? Any file within the system would help me to reinstall windows?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>some colors in some cells change if I close Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pettob  say:</h3>
<h2>            some colors in some cells change if I close Excel</h2>
                    <p>My problem is some colors in some cells change if I close Excel. If I save and close the file and reopen it (without closing Excel) the formatting and colors survive but if I close Excel and reopen Excel then some of the colors in
 some of the cells change, usually to black. some cells have multiple names typed in them and the different colors indicate if people have paid in full or a deposit or cancelled etc so Excel changing some colors is driving me crazy! When the spreadsheet was
 set to font size 9, the cells with changed colors changed to font size 10 which made even more work manually correcting colors and font sizes so I have changed the font size to 10 for the entire spreadsheet but still have the random (?) colour changes happening.</p>
<p>Please HELP.</p>

<p>I believe that&nbsp;it might be&nbsp;associated with a known problem that is currently being addressed. See the following link and go down to<em><strong>"Issues affecting Excel features and add-ins"</strong></em> and as of posting this, it

<p>
</p><p>However, my testing indicates that the problem may have been fixed with recent updates even though this is not indicated at the link I provided. Ensure you have the latest office updates as follows</p>

<li>Open Excel with blank workbook</li><li>Select File -&gt; Account</li><li>Click Update options -&gt; Update now</li><li>If update is available it will download and you might need to confirm to close open office apps.</li><li>If update takes place, repeat the above until you get a message "You're up to date"</li></ul>

                    <p>recently we succumbed to a scam that may have affected windows defender. a screen was placed over the computer directing us to call their 18002441111 number. the scammers were given access to the computer and got too much info..they asked specifically if
 we had windows defender. they ran a fake scan "found" thousands of problems and would "fix" the computer but they needed access. so now windows defender not start( the group or resource is not in the correct state to perform the requested operation) with an
 error code Ox8007139f.&nbsp; the scam left us with a tech phone number18002100464 and company icon avira with red background and umbrella on bottom of screen. I downloaded spybot srarch and destroy afterwards and blocked the avira but the icon is still there which
 means their program is still there. is windows defender being blocked by this or maybe spybot??? we wrotedown everything that was availableabout the fixers.aname ghazanfer hasain, a support site *** Email address is removed for privacy *** another name srs labs number 17815039343

<h2>            Permissions for SharePoint Online Communication Site</h2>
                    <p>I'm our firms O365 tenant administrator. I recently discovered Communication Sites and have been testing how to connect my users with a newly created site. I've set permission levels to Read Only, however, when the user launches the site from the email invitation
 link they've been sent, they have full edit capabilities as indicated by the EDIT selection in the upper right-hand side of the site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried over and over to change this without luck. Apparently I cannot find the setting that will allow this change. Does anyone have a solution for this issue?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Kerius,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to assist you further, we would like to know how you set the user's permission to Read-only.<br />
</p>
<p>To change a user's permission, you can navigate to the site's permission by clicking on the
<strong>Gear </strong>icon on the top right corner &gt; <strong>Site information</strong> &gt;
<strong>View all site settings</strong> &gt; Site permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be 3 groups inside the site permission: Members, Owners, and Visitors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Find where the user is located (based on the <strong>Edit </strong>permission, he/she should be in the
<strong>Members </strong>group), delete the user, and add him to the <strong>Visitors
</strong>group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Shen</p>

    <title>Explorer always open in the background - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> moniquemartin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Explorer always open in the background</h2>
                    <p>Why is Explorer always open in the background - I am not using it and do not have it open.</p>
<p>I had to switch to Chrome because when I used explorer it would use ever increasing amounts of memory. &nbsp;If a page was left open the amount of memory used could easily climb over a 1,000,000K slowing my computer and network to a crawl and constantly crashing.</p>
<p>Now Explorer just stays on in the background even though I don't use it.</p>
<p>I have explored the solutions on the internet and have seen people advised to download multiple anti virus programs, apply them in strict order, send in root logs and muck around in the bowels of the computer. &nbsp;Then, after using massive amounts of time trying
 to figure it out, they, and their online computer experts at sites like cnet and bleeping computer, all just gave up because there was no fixing it.</p>
<p>Anyone think this is malicious and can it be fixed if you are not an expert?</p>

    <title>Lumia 800 won&#39;t work with car Bluetooth - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blattform  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 800 won&#39;t work with car Bluetooth</h2>
                    
<p>I've had about 10 different phones (Nokia, Apple, HTC) during the last 6 years.</p>
<p>Nokis Lumia 800 is the first one that wouldn't work with my car's (BMW 330) original bluetooth hands-free.</p>
<p>The pairing is successful and also the connection seems to be on, but still nothing goes to car speakers.</p>
<p>The phone book is transferred though, but even when I initiate the call from my car display the call goes through the phone itself. Strange and in need of an urgent fix!</p>

<p>Mine doesn't work either BMW 530 and it just wont connect as a handsfree where my old E71 did that just fine and my wife's android works perfectly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I figured I'd give this Nokia/M$ thing a try, but it seems it was the wrong choice. Even their support acknowledges the issue, but doesnt promise a fix on any schedule.</p>

<p>Just stay away from this product, it's a lemon.</p>

<p>It works in some cars, but it doesn't in a couple of others :smileyindifferent:</p>
<p>However Nokia Support has actually confirmed that there are compability issues with a couple of Bluetooth stacks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is bluetooth option when in call mode.</p>
<p>Click the keypad button to the right of "End Call" then a there should be a bluetooth option next to were it says speaker and mute etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also maybe try deleting any other bluetooth connections, it may be trying to connect to something else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I said I works in "my car", it was to say that bluetooth works, it's not a problem with Nokia Lumia's in general, everything I have tried to connect to has worked fine with no issues what so ever maybe I should have gave more details. As far as I can
 tell nothing needs to be fixed (I have connected the lumia to 3 computers and 2 cars one of which was a&nbsp;BMW 320d made in 2010).</p>

<p>As i wrote earlier:</p>
<p>Nokia Support confirmed that Lumia does not work with all BT equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the HF works fine with my Jabra HF, here's a example of my experience with my MB180 2012 built in HF:</p>
<ul>
<li>When call is active, entering car and switching on ignition: Car HF gets connected, Lumia reboots. (iPhone works)</li><li>When call is active through Car HF: When turning off ignition call ends and doesn't return to Lumia handset. (iPhone works)</li><li>When trying to stream to Car HF: Lumia is recognized, starts showing Track 3 on HF screen, then immedietly stops, not&nbsp;playing anything. (iPhone works)</li></ul>
<p>While I find the Lumia better at most areas, BT functionality seems a bit disabled...</p>

<p>Sometimes it helps to update the firmware of the cars BT system. Mine worked but contacts with more than one phoneme were displayed as many times as there were phone numbers for the contact. I've updated the firmware and&nbsp;that problem was solved.</p>
<p>Things change over time so in order to stay compatible both sides must be as up-to-date as possible. And when the cars BT firmware is perhaps some years old it might no longer comply to recent standards and new phone might just use those new standards.</p>

<p>if your phone is rebooting then it sounds like it faulty.</p>
<p>It sounds like your problem is that when you disconnect from Bluetooth it&nbsp;interrupts the call, I have never used the phone like this so I don't know. You mention iPhone, but that easnt perfect either, I did have problems connecting that to devices or getting
 calls to work, this was IOS 3 though I have&nbsp;had no&nbsp;recent expeirence.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You could try this but it might be too late:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If they are still in the <strong>Deleted items </strong>folder (which I doubt that they are since you mentioned the
<strong>Recover the deleted items</strong>) you could click the radiobutton marked
<strong>Undo </strong>(seen directly under the right side, main ribbon icons)<strong>;</strong> however that seems to work only once.&nbsp; And if it is Active, holding your cursor on the arrow next to the

</p><p>I can see all the mail items in my deleted folder, but I have to select them one by one, or 19 most at a time to move them into the inbox again. When I select all, the option to move them goes away. Do you know of a way to select all in the deleted inbox

            <p>Not for 5000.&nbsp; But for x-small amounts you can try:</p>
<ul>
<li>click the first message in an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">uninterrupted</span> list</li><li>go to the end of that list</li><li>hold down your <strong>Shift-key</strong></li><li>and click the end-message</li></ul>
<p>That should highlight the list.&nbsp; (I've also had success with holding down the <strong>
Ctrl-key</strong> in a longer list but I aborted that effort because it was about to delete much more than I anticipated, and the test was being performed in the
<strong>Blocked senders</strong>.)</p>

<h2>            Phone desktop application</h2>
                    <p>Since the 2015 nov update (1511), I've noticed the presence of a phone app (which I assume is responsible for notifications of missed calls and option to&nbsp;SMS reply); however, when I launch the app and view the History tab, it indicates:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>"Calls you make and receive on your PC will appear here. sign in to a calling app or service on your PC, and then check back here after calling."</em></p>

<h2>            I am partially deaf and have no telephone number to recieve sign-in code</h2>
                    I am partially deaf and cannot use a telephone. I use Skype on my computer with headphones cranked up to high volume. With the new Skype update I cannot log in because login requires both a code sent to my email address and then a code to be sent to my
 phone, of which I have none. Is there a way to work around this requirement since it discriminates against those disabled by partial deafness?

            <p>Russ is correct - do not set it for 1 minute. Also, do not hit the Send/Receive button that often - it can cause the send/receive process to hang and you won't get any mail until you reboot. You could go down to 8 - 10 min if 15 is too long to wait.
