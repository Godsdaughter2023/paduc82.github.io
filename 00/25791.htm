<h2>            Excel 2007 - sum in status bar and sum calculation result not the same</h2>
                    The sum in the status bar is correct but the sum in the spreadsheet (same range of cells) is different.&nbsp; For example in c16 through c22 i have 6:55, 6:14, empty cell,5:50, empty cell,4:47, 5:31.&nbsp; The sum in the status bar is 29:17:00 (which is correct
 and what I want) and the sum resul in the&nbsp;spreadsheet =sum(c16:c22) is 5:17. This is wierd because in part of the spreadsheet the result in the spreadsheet is correct but starting with this first error, it continues to be wrong.&nbsp; I've copied formatting to
 make sure it's all the same. I've copied and pasted to a different sheet and no change.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks - Caroline

<h2>            How to Loop Video with No Delay in PPT</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to loop a video in PPT so it'd be like a GIF Image looping. but the problem with the loop option for video in PPT is that it doesn't do it smoothly, it does it with a little lag, little pause in between and that
<span>destroys the effect I want to create.</span></p>
<span>destroys the effect I want to create.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to remove that pause in between loops?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Side Note:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've created a 3D model which suppose to go 360 around a model. so I want to do it with video loop instead of a GIF. The reason why is the GIF Image makes the PPT file so big, around 9GBs , but the video (which if I be abled to loop it with no delay) only
 is around 10 MBs.</p>

<h2>            Samsung Omnia 7 &#34;Can&#39;t reach&#34; BT Home Hub 3 via WiFi</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have seen other people with similar problems with BT hardware and Windows Phone 7, but haven't seen any solutions anywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, I have the Samsung Omnia 7, and have trouble getting the phone to connect to my BT Home Hub 3. It sits there for ages trying to connect and then returns an error saying that it "Can't reach" the access point. Somtimes it does connect but - even
 though it is connected - no data is transmitted and anything that I try and do that requires and internet connection times out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything works fine over 3G, although a little slow as I only get typically one bar at home. If I connect to my work WiFi it's fine, also if I connect to my mobile broadband router it is also fine, so it has to be something to do with the router, or the
 phone. The strange thing is that it has only recently started happening - it always used to work fine since before a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have put my old Home Hub 2 back in to test, and with that in place the phone connects every time almost instantly, but often data will transfer for a while,&nbsp;then stop (while still showing a connected state), requiring me to switch of the WiFi connection
 on the phone and turn it back on again, but this only fixes it sometimes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my guess is that this has to be something to do with both the phone and the BT hardware. But I'm thinking it's more of an issue on the phone side as all other WiFi connected devices have no issues with either the Home Hub 2 or 3, and even the Home Hub
 used to work when I first got the phone. It's only in the last couple of weeks that I've noticed the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Aled,</p>
<p>I haven't contacted BT as their support is nigh on useless. It's a call centre and they read from a script - and I don't fancy starting from the begining again, having to repeatedly go over the most basic troubleshooting steps over the phone when I've already
 narrowed things down somewhat. I don't mind doing this if it is likely to result in a fix, but frankly it's not going on previous experience!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing I did try that was recomended elsewhere was renaming the SSID of the Home Hub 3, and this did seem to fix it. The phone could connect and it seemed to use the WiFi connection properly (rather than before when, if I could get it to connect, it would
 just sit there not sending or receiving any data). However, over the last couple of days I've noticed the old issue re-occuring. It can see the HH3 in the list of APs, but when it tries to connect it times out with a "cannot reach" message. It does this 6/10
 times on average which is better than before where, before I renamed the SSID, it wouldn't connect at all. However, I imagine that this will end up in the same state as before I changed the SSID and not connect at all shortly as it seems to be following that
 pattern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still have my old Home Hub 2, and if I swap it out with the HH3 the difference there is that it does connect pretty much straight away with that. But I do still get the issue with it being connected, but not sending or receiving any data. So at the moment
 it's quite hard to pin down whether the problem is down to BT and their hardware/firmware, which is entirely possible (although every other wireless device I have connects to both Home Hubs ok), or the problem lies with the Omnia 7. If it were a hardware issue
 I would have thought that it would either work or not work - not work some of the time and then eventually give up after a number of days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm pretty much stumped. The only thing I find particularly strange about the Omnia 7's behaviour is that it seems to connect to an AP only when it needs to use the&nbsp;data&nbsp;connection, or when you wake the phone up. After that it drops it until the next time
 you need it rather than staying connected.&nbsp;As&nbsp;the phone needs a data&nbsp;connection for&nbsp;different things at different times I was wondering if it is effectively bombarding the router with connection requests, which&nbsp;is then screwing the router up&nbsp;(connects when
 I wake the phone to check the time, drops, connects to check Hotmail, drops, connects to check Yahoo, drops, connects to check Work email, drops, etc...). No other wireless device I have acts in this way, and it seems unnecessary to me. Is this just how WP7
 handles WiFi connections?</p>
<p>Aside from that I have run out of ideas. I like the phone, and I haven't really missed my iPhone at all. But these "niggles" are frustrating. I am kind of optimistically hoping that Mango will magically fix it, but I'm not sure.</p>

            <p>Hello Massifheed,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear you are having issues connecting your phone to your Blue Tooth Hub.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what it sounds like, you are trying to access the internet through your Bluetooth connection, is this correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, the phone does not support that type of connection.&nbsp; There are only a few<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2449475" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> types of Bluetooth connection that are avaliable on a Windows Phone</a>.&nbsp; Unfortunately, internet access is not one of them.&nbsp;
 Thus the reason why Wi-Fi and Data connections work fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adam Ka.</p>

            <p>Adam - It's not a Bluetooth hub. BT (or British Telecom, as they used to be known)&nbsp;is the name of my ISP. The hub is effectively their own branded wireless router. Bluetooth doesn't come into this anywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards my WiFi issue - I noticed something the other day. If the phone successfully makes a connection to the router, and I then plug the phone's charger in, it&nbsp;maintains it's connection (the WiFi icon on the phone stays lit) all the while it's running
 on mains power. So that suggests to me that the phone constantly dropping the wireless connection, and then reconnecting when it needs it, is a WP7 thing, probably done to extend the battery life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that I've had the phone for a few months, I can honestly say I am fairly dissapointed. Not with WP7 itself (although there are a few annoyances with the OS). Instead, I think that the Omnia 7 hardware just isn't up to the job. I seem to be getting more
 and more hardware niggles as the weeks go by. And they are intermittent ones that are hard to replicate on the spot when trying to show someone in my network's local phone store. So, assuming that they are faults, and not just hardware glitches, it's unlikely
 that I'll be able to get it exchanged or repaired. It's a shame, because I do like WP7. But unless Mango resolves the issues I've been having (and I can't see that it will), then I think I'll be moving back to iOS once my contract is up (assuming the phone
 lasts that long).</p>

    <span>Hi Massifheed,</span>
    <br />
    <span>&nbsp;</span>
    <br />
    <span>Thanks for using the Microsoft Answers forums for your inquiries.</span>
    <br />
    <span>&nbsp;</span>
    <br />
    <span>I was just checking in to see if any progress has been made on your end to resolve this issue.</span>
    <br />
    <span>&nbsp;</span>
    <br />
    <span>One thing I was thinking you could try, if you didn't already, is to manually configure BT's&nbsp; hub/router to allow specific MAC addresses on, including (especially) your Omnia 7.</span>
    <br />
    <span>&nbsp;</span>
    <br />
    <span>In regards to having your phone plugged in and being able to stay connected on the WiFi network when it is plugged it, I have found the same thing with my own phone.&nbsp; I also found that my battery runs down much faster if I leave the WiFi on all the time  so I have to manually turn it off, especially when I'm not home, to help conserve the battery life.&nbsp; I would check the phone's settings to see if the phone's power save settings are set a certain way to make the phone connect and disconnect from your WiFi  network based on the "needs" of the phone and/or apps.</span>
    <br />
    <span>&nbsp;</span>
    <br />
    <span>Let us know if this helps at all.</span>

            <p>Hi Annie,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for replying. Configuration options on the router are somewhat limited, but I have tried various settings as far as isolating the phone's entry in my router's DHCP table and telling the router to always use the same IP address for the phone. I have
 also placed the phone outside of the router's firewall (not that that would really make any difference anyway). To be honest, I've kind of given up with it now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, there are no battery or power save options available with Windows Phone 7. Strange, no? I mean, if I had the option of disabling the obvious power management that has been applied to WiFi connections, then I could be certain that this issue would be
 resolved, albeit at the expense of battery life. But I could live with that, and it would be my choice. Instead, it appears as if MS know there is an issue with battery performance if the WiFi connection is allowed to remain active, so they force it to drop
 after a period of inactivity so, to the user, it doesn't highlight the battery drain issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I appreciate that people have tried to help on here and I'll wait and see if the Mango update has any impact (I think I read that there will be new firmware upgrades for a lot of handests at the same time). Failing that, it's back to iOS once the
 contract is up.</p>

            <p>I'm happy to report that this problem is now resolved!</p>
<p>I updated my phone to 7.5 which included new firmware from Samsung, and since then my phone reconnects to my router within a couple of seconds - every time. Rather than before where it would sit there trying to connect for 20-30 seconds then time out.</p>
<p>Anyone with the same issue can rest assured that this should be resolved with the latest firmware.</p>

<h2>            Calculating Standard Deviation using the results of TrimMean</h2>
                    <p>I've looked all over the web at the various expert Excel sites for the answer to this question with no results.&nbsp; Hopefully I can get one here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The TrimMean function will strip off a user specified percentage of entries from the top and bottom values from say an array of values, the purpose of which is to eliminate the outliers when calculating the mean (average).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is how (if in fact it can be done) can the resultant value be used in calculating a standard deviation?&nbsp; I've attempted various ways of using it as a direct input to the STDEV function and either get a zero value or a divide by zero error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also attempted to use the results of the Average function as a direct input to the STDEV function thinking that if I could get to work I would use the same syntax.&nbsp; That doesn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen other convoluted solutions of using trim like calculations as input but could not find any reference to using it the way I described or that it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Excel version is 2007.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any information is appreciated.</p>

            <p>Re:&nbsp; standard deviation with exceptions<br />
<br />
The obvious question (to me) is why don't you just run Stdev <em>without</em> the TrimMean excluded items?<br />
You can prefix them with a single text character and the Stdev function will ignore them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two other Excel standard deviation functions:&nbsp; DSTDEV and DSTDEVP that
<em>claim</em>...<br />
"Calculates the standard deviation ... by using the numbers in a field (column) of records in a list or database that match
<em>conditions that you specify</em>."<br />
I have never used these and the help was sufficiently obtuse that I lost interest. - Maybe you have the motivation.<br />

</p><p>Just guessing, but it sounds like you need a custom vba function that will remove the High and Low from an array of values, then apply the StDev formula to the remaining values.</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>OK Dana, thanks for your response, and I was a little obtuse in my description of the problem, but will clarify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>STDEV will take either a list of values (up to 30) to average or an array of values to average.&nbsp; As part of what I am doing I already had calculated the Average from a needed previous calculation.&nbsp; So, why go through the overhead of recalculating the average
 when I already had it and just want to pass that value to STDEV.&nbsp; My real purpose of attempting to pass the already calculated Average is that once I understood how to do that (assuming that it could be done, which I couldn't do) I could just substitute the
 TrimMean value, which is the same except for the outliers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some thought, it appears that STDEV will only calculate based on the values being presented to it and there is no way to specify a mean value, however it is derived, from which a STDEV value can be calculated, or failing that, being able to specify
 the STDEV should trim (invoke the TrimMean function under the covers) to calculate the mean.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that if one wants to strip the outliers before calculating a STDEV there is no easy way of doing so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that adds some clarity.</p>

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already did the STDEV calculation on the entire array.&nbsp; What I want to see id what the STDEV value would be if I stripped off the outliers in varing percentages (5%, 10%, ...).&nbsp; The only way that I can see that is via TrimMean which does exactly that,
 trim the outliers by a users specified percent.&nbsp; The only problem is that there doesn't seem to be an easy way of passing the necessary TrimMean values from which an STDEV calculation can be done.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as messing with the values there are almost 7000 values in the table and I don't want to add any more complexity then is necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only difference between the the 2 aforementioned Standard deviation calculation is that one is for a sample and one is for a population.

            <p>It's not clear to me exactly what you want to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to calculate the standard deviation, using the entire population, but based on the TRIMMEAN average rather than the actual population average, I suppose you could substitute the TRIMMEAN average for the population average in the underlying standard
 deviation formula.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what that result would mean, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The STDEVP formula, for example, could be represented by this formula:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SQRT(SUM((Values-AVERAGE(Values))^2)/COUNT(Values))</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">So, maybe (confirmed with <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER</strong>)</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =SQRT(SUM((Values-TRIMMEAN(Values,10%))^2)/COUNT(Values))</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">If, on the other hand, you want to calculate a STDEV but exclude those values that would be excluded by TRIMMEAN, then you could use the DSTDEVP function, and set your criteria to exclude the largest and smallest number of entries
 depending on your <br />
TRIMMEAN percent.&nbsp; This would not be using the TRIMMEAN function in the formula, but the result would be appropriate.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Instead of DSTDEVP, you could set up an adjacent column with a formula returning TRUE or FALSE depending on if it met the TRIMMEAN criteria, and use the SUBTOTAL(8,Values) function on the filtered list.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">But before going further, please clarify your intents.</p>

            <p><strong>Edit - The response is for the post of OP not for Ron.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>To exclude another way is to use Array Formula</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a simple range of 1, 2, 3.........9,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's assume I want to exclude values less than 3 and more than 8, I can use following array formula -</p>
<p>
</p><p>=STDEV(IF(A1:A9&gt;3,IF(A1:A9&lt;8,A1:A9)))</p>
<p>
</p><p>This 3 and 8 are just example. You can put values after calculating %age which you are talking about to replace 3 and 9.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note - Array Formula is not entered by pressing ENTER after entering your formula but by pressing CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. If you are copying and pasting this formula, take F2 after pasting and CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. This will put { } brackets around the formula which
 you can see in Formula Bar. If you edit again, you will have to do CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER again. Don't put { } manually.</p>

            <p>Hello Ron:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I thought my intent was clear but apparently not, so I will restate it differently, (I think), as follows and in general;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of using all of the data in computing the average to be used in the calculation of the standard deviation I want to trim off the outliers</p>
<p>
</p><p>More specifically about the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The table contains all (almost 7000) of the various companies (symbols) in the stock market (NYSE)</p>
<p>2. the table has 10 columns, of which each column represents a variable price range of the stock, i.e., &lt;$5.00, $5.00-$10.00, ... , whi8ch are labeled (price) categories, Cat1, Cat2, ... Cat10</p>
<p>3. In each of the columns is a percentage which are the results of a specific formula which produces these percentages</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be able to calculate the mean and standard deviation of each of the aforementioned columns, which I have done already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, what I want to do is to see how much the standard deviation would change if the values were "Trimmed" by a varying percentage.&nbsp; MY belief (which now appears to be incorrect) was I should be able to feed in the results of a TRIMMEAN directly into
 a STDEV or STDEVP but didn't know how to structure the function correctly.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>While I was messing around seeing if I could get the STDEV to work I decide to see if it was worth the effort by comparing the average&nbsp; and various percentages of TRIMMEANs seeing that these numbers would be used in the SD calculation.&nbsp;&nbsp; A sample of the
 results is below</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cat 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cat2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cat3</p>
<p>Average &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 186.95%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 135.99%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 108.74%</p>
<p>Trimmean@5%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 162.99%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 120.86%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 97.39%</p>
<p>Trimmean@10%&nbsp;&nbsp; 156.20%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 115.56%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 92.75%</p>
<p>Trimmean@15%&nbsp;&nbsp; 152.55%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 112.18%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 89.45%</p>
<p>Trimmean@20%&nbsp;&nbsp; 149.95%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 109.87%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 86.82%</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see the results are skewed by the outliers when using the average which would also skew the results of the SD calculation, hence my reason for wanting to trim the outliers (without having to create another 40 columns to hold trimmed values derived
 using other methods/formulas).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully that adds some clarity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note to all that have responded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all for you contributions.&nbsp; This is the first time I used this site and am impressed by the number of people willing to help.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I stated above I think some of the suggestions would work in a situation where the data was know values.&nbsp; In this situation the data is a results of other calculations therefore is variable and generally unknown.&nbsp; It appears that the Excel authors dealt
 with the need to trim outliers off a mean calculation but never considered that someone might want to do the same thing when calculating a standard&nbsp; deviation.&nbsp; I checked a 2013 version of Excel and is doesn't appear to be solved there either.</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I am having the same issue. I have just received renewed certificate from certification authority in Czech Republic. I am using Windows 7\Windows 2008 Server R2 with Office 2007.</p>
<p>Previous certificate that I had (it expired) worked for signing Word documents without problems. Re-newed certificate does not work. When I compare those two certificates the only visible difference is that previous (now expired) certificate used SHA1RSA
 as signature algoritm while new certificate uses SHA256RSA; other then that it appears the same.</p>
<p>Now, the fact is that we re-newed certificate I can not sign Word, Excel. The certificate has valid path up to the root of certification path and all dependent certificates are installed (it means certificate is valid).</p>
<p>Can you please help with resolution of this problem? If you believe that this is 3rd party certificate issue then please say what this issue might be. I have contacted certification authority technical support and they told me that there was MS patch for
 Windows XP regarding this problem but not with Windows 7.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t move emails to folders in Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kendrat63  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t move emails to folders in Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Outlook deleted all my emails, got them back, but can't move to folders</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was in my inbox and all of a sudden it went blank.&nbsp; Figured I must've accidently deleted them all.&nbsp; So went to deleted folder and they were in there.&nbsp; Then I realized a few emails I just sent were in the deleted folder too.&nbsp; So I looked at all my other
 folders - some are outlook folders, some are my own that I created - and all of them were emptied and sent to the deleted folder.</p>
<p>I finally was able to get all of the emails back into my inbox (didn't want outlook to deleted the ones more than 30 days old).&nbsp; Now it will not let me move them into the appropriate folders.</p>
<p>What happened so I don't do it again (or outlook) and how do I get them to move folders?</p>
<p>I am viewing outlook on the desktop in a internet explorer page.</p>

                    Using Office for Mac 2016. I tried to print a saved document that I have printed many times before, but when I print it comes out almost too small to read. Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;

<p>Another great "Duh" moment in my case: I had the same problem and I spent an hour with every possible configuration, going back to other versions of Word, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, the person had sent me to document in Review mode, but because there were no corrections to review (at all), I didn't click. The document had a grey zone to the right in print preview mode but I thought it was just a design feature!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Switching off Review mode solved the problem. Of course you could have a better designed MS print dialogue box warning you about this...</p>

            Dear Elize,<br /><br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.<br /><br />I understand that this is frustrating to receive lots of spam and unwanted emails. It is even more frustrating to receive scams, spoofing and phishing emails. Scammers nowadays are using multiple methods to intimidate users. Recently they invented new way of spoofing your own email address. This is good explained in this (not Microsoft) article <a href="https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/10/15/beware-sextortionists-spoofing-your-own-email-address/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/10/15/bew...</a> If you received such an email, report it and just in case change your password to more secure <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4026406/microsoft-account-how-to-create-a-strong-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/402640...</a><br />

<br />
<br />Hello Elize
<br />
<br />If by ".....demand ransom money" you're referring to a demand to send funds via BitCoin (or some other crypto-currency) ".......or else" then this is a running scam that has been going on for the last few months. (I've now up to having rec'd 313 of these kinds of messages as of this morning). Can be safely ignored and deleted.

    <title>Unable to download offline maps for entire US region - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to download offline maps for entire US region</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a Lumia 950 from Microsoft Store Online about a week ago and since that I haven't been able to download offline maps for the US region. I've tried to reset a phone, download state by state, format the card, etc. Checked SD card and it seems to be
 all right (SanDisk 64GB XC-I). When I try to download maps the progress bar jumps to about 15% and stays there forever. Sometimes I receive a message that downloading was paused because maps are open in some app which I didn't run or open. I also tried to
 delete all maps and format a card with no luck. Music, video, apps open and play from the card no problem. Also, tried it on different wifi spots at home and at work - same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phone is up-to-date - just checked it before posting this, build 10586.164</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on what is going on? Server issue, software bug or what?</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">All apps » Settings » System » offline maps » Storage location » SD card</p>
<p>which provides offline map data for the internal app Windows Maps, even in Windows 10 Mobile. I cannot contribute much to this thread, because I have the map data for entire USA installed already. or stated differently: Might be a server issue. However,
 I noticed that the download gets stuck, when the screen turns off. Therefore, I went for All apps » Settings » Personalization » Lock screen » Screen times out after 5 minutes and swiped up to hide the navigation bar – so that does not burn into the screen.</p>

            <p>Solved!</p>
<p>While downloading, continue to keep the screen "alive" tapping or moving frequently. Probably is a matter of time out after inactivity period (that is quite long for an entire region download).</p>

<h2>            Anyone receiving an over abundance of Junk Mail&#63;</h2>
                    <div>I'm not sure I'm sending my message to the right place, but I do have this concern:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
Besides receiving up to 10 Junk Mail daily in my Inbox, I'm also receiving over 250 daily in my Junk folder. This didn't happen until I switched to Outlook.com. So many of the "Junk" are from the same company, taking up close to an entire page in my Junk folder.
 Might be from different people, using the same company name, but Junk, just the same. Never had more than 30 daily before I switched to Outlook.com and never had so many from with the same company name.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I never open Junk mail. I always "empty" the Junk folder &amp; never "delete". I always report it as Junk, from my Inbox &amp; never open it. Why am I receiving so much junk now? Wondering if anyone else is having the same problem?</div>

                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I received a pptx file from a colleague with comments, but I can't open the comments pane.</p>
<p>I tried:</p>
<p>- clicking on the comment "talk bubbles"</p>
<p>- clicking on "comments" on the bottom sidebar</p>
<p>- clicking on review -&gt; show comments -&gt; comments pane</p>
<p>None of these work.</p>
<p>FYI, I'm using PowerPoint 2013 on a Win7 laptop.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Word couldn&#39;t send mail due to Mapi failure &#34;unspecified error&#34;</h2>
                    <p>This subjec is cross posted:&nbsp; <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/officeversion_other-word/word-could-not-send-mail-because-of-mapi-failure/f62678fe-ef1d-42b5-8cfe-1e43d6a1d609">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know this question has been asked and "marked" answered several times in the Answer&nbsp;forum, but none of the proposed solutions have worked for me.</p>
<p>I am unable to share/send documents to recipients via e-mail from any installed version of Word on my PC (2003/2007/2010/2013).</p>
<p>(Same goes for Excel 2013, except the error is "General Mail Failure .... ")</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Window 7 64 bit, Office 2013 32 bit installed. Outlook 2013 is my default mail program. I also have Word 2010, 2007 and 2003 installed. Word 2013 is the default Word application.</p>
<p>In all versions when I attempt to send a document to recipients as an e-mail attachment, I get the subject error. In Word 2003 if I select the option to send to a mail recipient for ("Review") it works without error.</p>
<p>I can also right click documents on my desktop and use the Send to Mail recipient without problems.</p>
<p>I've tried the following:</p>
<p>1. Verified (using several methods) that OUTLOOK is the default mail program.</p>
<p>2. Ran "Repair" on all installed office products (repairing Office 2013 last)</p>
<p>3. Ran fixmapi.exe.</p>
<p>4. Deleted the Office registry settings and repaired all versions again.</p>
<p>5. Uninstalled all versions except Word 2013 and ran repair again.</p>
<p>6. Installed MapiLabs Mail Merge Merge Tookkit (someone indicated this fixed the issue for them)</p>
<p>7. Removed all add-ins from Word and Outlook.</p>
<p>8. I've tried running Word and Outlook as administrator.</p>
<p>9. I've set User Account Control settings to none.</p>
<p>Nothing works. Open to any an all suggestions to resolve. Thanks. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>found another proposed solution which suggesting renaming Mapi32.dll to Mapi32Old.dll and then restarting OUTLOOK.</p>

<p>I found Mapi32.dll but when I tried to rename it, I got a notification "You need permission from TrustedIntaller to change this file. Ok, who is TrustedInstaller and how do I let him or her know that my computer in mine (not his or hers) and to please let
 me decide what I can and cannot do with it?</p>

<p>Frustration is showing here I know. It is a real shame that MS who owns Window, MAPI, and Office cannot get their players together an provide a viable solution to this issue</p>

            <p><span>This issue is finally resolved for me.</span></p>
<p>This so called "Mapi failure - unspecified error," actually has some specification. Prompted by a tip in another forum, I began searching the Windows event logs for anything related to this issue. I found in the Windows Application event log that Outlook
 was generating an Error ID 27: </p>
<p>"MAPISendMail: Failed to submit message. Attachments to the message exceeded the size limit set by your Administrator," each time I tried sending an attachment from another office suite application.</p>
<p>Now I had never set a size limit. Not with OUTLOOK 2013 or any earlier version. It appears that the when OUTLOOK 2013 was intalled to replace my earlier OUTLOOK 2010, then the "unlimited' attachment size setting is misread and recorded as "0" size in the
 OUTLOOK 2013 registry setting.</p>
<p>Changing this registry key: HKEY_Current_User&gt;Software&gt;Microsoft&gt;Office&gt;15.0&gt;Outlook&gt;Preferences&gt;MaximumAttachmentSize from "0" to some larger value e.g., "5000" (5 megabyte) has resolved the issue.</p>
