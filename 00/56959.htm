<p>Hello, <br />
<br />
The XBOX 360 S internal WiFi adapter only works with 2.4ghz frequency. If you want to run the 5ghz frequency you will need to buy a black adapter.<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Xbox 360 S console:&nbsp;</b>The Xbox 360 S console’s built-in Wi-Fi uses the 2.4 gigahertz (GHz) frequency band. If your router is broadcasting using another frequency, your Xbox 360 S console cannot connect to your wireless network. Check your router documentation
 to find out how to set your router to broadcast at 2.4 GHz. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>If you want to connect using the 5 GHz frequency band, you will need to add the black Xbox 360 Wireless N Networking Adapter to your Xbox 360 S console.</strong></span>
</li><li><b>Xbox 360 S console and black adapter:&nbsp;</b>The Xbox 360 S console and the black Xbox 360 Wireless N Networking Adapter cannot use the 802.11n wireless protocol in combination with WEP or WPA TKIP encryption. If your router requires WEP or WPA encryption,
 your console will try to connect to your wireless network using a slower wireless protocol such as 802.11b, 802.11g, or 802.11a.
</li><li><b>Use WPA2 if possible:</b>&nbsp;The best wireless encryption to use with your Xbox 360 console is WPA2 with AES encryption.
</li><li><b>Wireless N router and a gray adapter:</b>&nbsp;If you have an 802.11n or N type router and a gray Xbox 360 Wireless G Networking Adapter, configure your N type router to use a mixed mode; broadcast using a combination of wireless standard N and either B,
 G, or A. </li></ul>

<h2>            Windows Live Messenger shows on taskbar even though its not started</h2>
                    I installed Windows Live Messenger but most of the time I run Trillian so I don't want it (Messenger) running. I went to options and told it not to start when I start Windows. But the icon still shows up in the taskbar. I can close it but it soon shows
 back up on taskbar. Any way to get rid of this short of uninstalling messenger? thx...

<p>Hi st3v3k4hn,</p>
<p>a. Have you pinned the program in the Taskbar?<br />
b. Are you referring to the taskbar "button" or the icon in the notification area?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Step 1: If you have pinned the program to the taskbar, you can right click on the program in the taskbar and click on “Unpin this program from Taskbar”.<br />
Doing this will unpin the program from the Taskbar.</p>
<p>Step 2: If you are reffering to the icon appearing in the Notification area, you may go ahead and hide the same.</p>
<p>1. Right-click an empty area on the taskbar, and then click Properties.<br />
2. Under Notification area, click Customize.<br />
3. For Windows Live Messenger icon, select the following options in the list:<br />
o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hide icon and notifications. The icon is hidden and notifications aren't displayed.<br />
4. Click OK.</p>
<p>Step 3: Additionally try this step as well.</p>
<p>1. Right click on the Windows Live Messenger shortcut and click on Properties.<br />
2. Under the Compatibility tab, check the Run this program in compatibility mode for box and select Windows Vista.<br />
3. Click Apply. Click OK.</p>
<p>Open Windows Live Messenger to see it's icon location now.</p>

<h2>            Japanese NEC LaVie G laptop, keyboard layout problems and x64 drivers</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
I tried to find a previous post, though didn't find anything specifically similar.<br />
<br />
I have a NEC LaVie G Type C notebook, purchased in Tokyo a few months ago. Currently I have it as a dual boot system, with a smaller partition with the original 32-bit Japanese Vista Home Premium and the Japanese software and drivers that it came with.<br />
<br />
I then have a second partition that has 64-bit English Windows 7 RC 7100. Performance wise has generally been great, however not all the drivers have been picked up. Device Manager shows a few items that it has an issue with, primarily the Intel Turbo Memory,
 NX Pad (used for writing Japanese on the actual track pad), FeliCa Port (scanner next to the track pad that can read Asian ticket cards like Tokyo's Suica and Pasmo as well as mobile phones with the same chip), and the power management software known as Eco-Mode.<br />
<br />
NEC Japan's website has failed to impress not offering really any drivers at all. This is why I've kept the Japanese Vista as everything runs fine. Is there any chance that I can get any of this running in Windows 7 or is there alternatives? Windows Vista English
 had managed to auto-detect the FeliCa Port previously, before I did a reformat, so was surprised Windows 7 didn't.<br />
<br />
Also currently Windows 7 shows that the Japanese keyboard is installed in Device Manager and I've set up the Microsoft IME software. Changing the IME to Japanese I don't have an issue typing Japanese, however the problem lies with all the English punctuation
 marks and extra keys not found on a US keyboard. What workaround is needed?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any assistance in advance.

            Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
I managed to fix it by changing the keyboard driver.<br />
<br />
Originally the installed driver was '<strong>Japanese PS/2 Keyboard (106/109 Key)</strong> ' which was behaving like a standard US keyboard.<br />
<br />
Via Device Manager/Update Driver Wizard, and choosing the 'let me pick from the list' option, I installed the '<strong>Japanese PS/2 Keyboard (106/109 Key Ctrl + Eisuu)</strong> '.<br />
<br />
With this driver the keyboard has been working as it should.<br />
<br />

</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>I will definitely assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, please be inform that since Windows 10 came preinstalled with the computer you don’t need Windows key to activate the Windows. Windows key is already pre-injected on the system’s motherboard. The key you see under PC properties
 it is product ID. </p>

<h2>            Not supporting lenovo motion control in windows 10.......</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I recently bought my Lenovo flex2 14 laptop and with that I was able to upgrade from windows 8 to Windows 10. I love windows 10 but some things are not working for me. &nbsp;I am unable
 to use the google crome browser while open multiple tab in single windos. I had it downloaded before I upgraded and once I upgraded it would no longer work and had to uninstall it. Also my Lenovo motion control will not work. I can not figure out how to get
 it to work on&nbsp; my laptop. I was wondering how to get the motion control to work and why chrome will no longer work.</span>

    <title>can I keep the calculator on top of other windows so I can see - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adam-joh  say:</h3>
<h2>            can I keep the calculator on top of other windows so I can see both&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to use the calculator and a pdf document at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is, I open a pdf document, then open the calculator, and, while the calculator is hovering over the pdf document, I use the calculator to do calculations using the figures on the pdf document. That is, I need to see both at the same time. But every
 time I click on the calculator the screen goes back to the desktop and minimises the pdf document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know i can split the screen to show the pdf on one side but this really is not productive for the tasks that I need to do. I never had this problem using Adobe pdf and windows calculator in Win 7 and I can't work out how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Adam</p>

<h2>            mini militia in wp</h2>
                    <p>Hello my name is sarthak.&nbsp; I am here to discuss about mini militia. A game which every smart phone user have even people having local phones are playing mini militia . But here we are who buy such an expensive phone and too without any good apps. There are
 many more (infinite) no. Of apps which we dont have. Why you have made so many restrictions. This is forcing me to change my phone to an ios or android. I was a huge fan of wp till dates but now i got to know why people hate to buy wp. This is the only reason
 of unsuccess of wp in indian market. Ios and android deserve a lot more than this wpso they are getting it. There is no wonder if wp gets banned from the market. It would be good. #changingmyphone. #**** Microsoft

    <title>Poor streaming when laptop cover is closed, power plan settings are - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gohomeordie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Poor streaming when laptop cover is closed, power plan settings are correct</h2>
                    <p>When I am streaming from my laptop to my TV (thru PS3, Xbox, etc using WMP or PS3 Media Server) with the lid on my laptop closed, the streaming suffers from frequent pausing, or completely stopping. Usually it's just pausing for several seconds, and the
 stream eventually resumes (but sometimes still frequently pauses while trying to stream). Sometimes the stream simply stops altogether. Sometimes, the stream works completely fine with the cover closed. &nbsp;It's completely hit or miss.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>YES, my power plans are set to never go to sleep when the lid is closed.&nbsp;</strong>I am certain they are set correctly. I have checked and double-checked (and more!)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The settings are as follows: &nbsp;Under 'Power button and lid settings' &gt; 'When I close the lid' &gt; 'On battery' and 'Plugged in' &gt; 'Do nothing' for both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, something is sleeping or disabling when the lid is closed. When the computer is closed and the streaming problems occur, all I have to do is open the laptop, and the problem is resolved. But I don't want to keep the cover open all the time!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I never suffer from streaming problems when the lid is kept open. The problems only occur when it is closed.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>A related note: I don't have any problem streaming when the cover is open and the screen shuts off (set to 'Turn off display' after 10 minutes)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is welcome, thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand the frustration when this do not go as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us try the following methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Try running built-in Power<strong> Troubleshooter</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The power troubleshooter can automatically detect and fix any incorrect power settings. Refer to these steps to run this troubleshooter:</span></p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong><em>Windows key +F</em></strong> to bring up the
<strong><em>search</em></strong> Charms bar.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong><em>settings</em></strong> in the drop down menu below search and type

<strong><em>view all</em></strong> option on the left pane.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong><em>Power</em></strong> troubleshooter and follow the prompts.</p>
</li></ol>
</ol>
<p><span><strong>Method 2</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I&nbsp;suggest you to create a new <strong>power plan</strong> and check if it resolves the issue.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>Steps to create a new Power Plan:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Press <strong>Windows</strong> <strong>+ X</strong> and click <strong>
control panel.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>2. In Control panel select <strong>Power options</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Click <strong>create a Power Plan.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>4. Select a <strong>Time frame</strong> for Turn Off display and <strong>
Never</strong> to <strong>Put the computer to sleep</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click create to save the power plan and select the customized power plan you have created.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this would help. <span><span><span>If issue still persists post </span>back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Account hacked..</h2>
                    
<p>I logged in today and got the message your gamertag was last signed in on another console. Now this happened to me before and I updated all the security stuff, changed my pw's, required a pw for login on all other consoles, and whatever else was suggested
 to me by the lady on the phone. Today though I tried to call and clear everything up much the same way i did last time, but when i called i was on hold for two hours no big deal usually but i am in korea and that was a huge pain, then i decide to hang up and
 try again and i call the number again and it says they are closed for the day, the call back option is also not available for me because as i said im in korea. what are my options here, call again and spend another 25 or so bucks on a phone call that may never
 get answered? just let the dude enjoy his jumbo and family bundle along with my 2k points? or wait the 6 more months till i am stationed back in the states and try to resolve it then?</p>

<p>like i said before i DID change all pw's, require pw's on other consoles, and no the pin is not 1234.&nbsp;

<p>Hi there. Sorry about your account becoming compromised but unfortunately the only people that can help are the xbox phone support team. It would be a better idea to call them back asap before too much damage is caused to your account(s). Good luck!

<p>I agree with MeanMachine about needing to call support, however I'm curious to know which pin you're referring to. If it's the Xbox LIVE passcode, then that will only prevent access from everyone else within the household. If your information is stored elswhere
 as well, it will remain there until you reset the trusted consoles where your information is stored. It sounds like you've already done that as well, but Xbox customer support will be able to determine how many trusted consoles have your information stored
 as well to be sure, and can begin an unauthorized access case if need be. Good luck to you :)</p>

<p>Greetings, Drew! First off, I'm very sorry to hear about your situation. It sounds like you may have gone through the steps listed here to secure your account:
<a href="http://xbox.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com/security</a>. Is that correct? If you have done this and are still cannot access or are encountering problems with your account I would recommend getting in touch with phone support
 again. They will be able to conduct an Unauthorized Access investigation and assist you further with this matter.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hang in there! Let us know if you have any further questions.</p>

<p>I just got that exact same pop up about "gamertag last signed in on another console" or whatever.. I also saw on the security help pages that you are only supposed to call customer support if there have been any un authorized purchases or other complications.
 Why aren't we supposed to call just so you can find the person that did it to begin with? I mean, just because someone breaks in to my house and doesn't take anything, doesn't mean I wouldn't want them caught.. I've changed all my info that I can think of
 on my windows live id, pws, security questions, I don't have IE so I can't do the trusted PC thing that is "recommended".</p>
<p>What else should I do? just sit and wait and hope it doesn't happen again? I didn't see any purchases or anything like that. not even free downloads.. the only thing that I THINK they may have changed was my gamer zone in my profile.. I deleted the email
 they tried to add to my live id and all the others. changed pws to basically every site I know of. So, again, what should I do now?</p>
<p>I will add that it is the same thing from that whole Fifa 12 thing that went down, because it says that's the last thing I've played and well, I haven't played it in several days with Max Payne 3 and the new Ghost Recon coming out.</p>

<p>I had my account hacked this week and they used up the 5000 points I had in it plus bought another game with the credit card I have in the account on the 23rd May. I called support and reported it and they helped me going through the security changes. I
 want to reverse these charges made on my card with my bank (which I can since this is fraud) but where does that leave me with XBL? I don't feel like paying a credit card bill for a purchase I didn't make? Anyone knows if it's ok with XBL to reverse the fraud
 purchase on my card?</p>

<p>Apparently Fifa 12 has nothing to do with how these guys are getting account information. I know this doesn't really help you at the moment, but this is an interesting read on how they are accessing accounts:

<p>Greetings, IhAvEnOfRiEnDzZ! Following the directions on the <a href="http://xbox.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://xbox.com/security</a> page should successfully secure your account. However, you are welcome to call customer support for your region at any point if you feel your account has been compromised or have concerns about the security of your account. You
 should absolutely get in touch with phone support if you notice any authorized billing transactions or points activities.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>matahari0711, when you spoke with phone support did they start an Unauthorized Access Investigation? If so they will investigate the issue and help rectify the situation. You may also want to get in touch with your credit card company to report the unauthorized
 charges. They should be able to provide further assistance with the matter.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps! Hang in there!</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see that regular Skype is on the Amazon App Store. However, Skype For Business is not listed. Can you please make Skype For Business available for Amazon Kindle Fire devices that run Amazon's version of the Android OS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, please provide a link to the Skype For Business APK file located on a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Microsoft</span> server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>We do not provide officially APK file for SFB. Generally, we need to download/install from google play or search the apk in Internet. Thanks for your understanding.</p>

    <title>Bluetooth Headset Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skydonut  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth Headset Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently received a pair of bluetooth&nbsp;headphones, specifically the "Bluedio T2S Turbine Bluetooth Headphones" and was pairing them to my Windows 10 PC when I noticed an annoying issue. When I tried to use the microphone that was equipped with the headphones
 while playing Steam games, my audio quickly dropped quality, specifically to the telephone quality. When looking at sound settings I noticed that there were two profiles the "Bluedio Hands-Free" and the "Bluedio Stereo" in the playback section, and in the
 recording section there was the "Bluedio&nbsp;Hands-Free" profile again. The only way for me to get stereo quality is to disable the hands-free&nbsp;profile and that results in the loss of using the equipped microphone. I have tried pretty much anything that I could
 find online, from reinstalling the drivers for pretty much anything related to bluetooth to fiddling with the default audio and recording settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have not made any significant changes to my computer before the issue had started, in fact my USB headset works just fine when I plug it in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The issue occurs whenever I use the headset with my PC including when using the stock Windows 10 recording application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I have checked both the Bluetooth drivers and the Headset drivers for any updates but they are all updated to the newest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help and I await your response!</p>

<p>Based on the information that you have provided us, the most probable cause of the issue is a hardware failure. We recommend that you contact the original equipment manufacturer of your Bluetooth headphones to resolve your concern. They are the ones who
 can assist you better with your concern.</p>
