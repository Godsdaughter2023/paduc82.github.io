</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The error code 1 generally means that the driver for the device needs to be updated and error code 18 explains that if updating the driver doesn’t
 help, you may have to re-install the device driver. I would suggest you to uninstall the device driver completely and restart the computer once before the re-installing the drivers.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Why is the Support Number disconnected&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Seriously,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I seem to be one of the few cases of 360s that cant read new discs without burning it to my hard drive and erasing half my memory. Any help with this would be great, in any manner, considering 0800 - 587-1102 doesnt seem to be paid up. Think Im done
 buying my annual Xbox console. Even as a passionate gamer, I sometimes regret buying a next gen console at all considering how distancing the corporations spearheading gaming are from the consumer, yet they seem to be comfortably keen on raking in my hard-earned
 money and giving me a broken or incomplete piece of plastic and metal. Sorry if I seem disillusioned. I am. Tired of buying an incomplete, rushed, buggy-to-no-belief software &amp; hardware, ie: Fable 3 (everyone I know with the exception of one person experienced
 a game-killing glitch: mine? My good female character and my evil male character somehow merged into one unisex person. I hope you think Im kidding. Im not.) Nothing was done about it, though Im not entirely sure what could've been done (besides properly giving
 your people time to work on the game before release). No public apology. No corporate responsibility. Nothing. Im sure Mr Molyneux is happy with my $120, though personally Im done with Fable games or anything to do with Molyneux &amp; Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I came to see where one applies for a new, possibly working, Xbox 360 and only found someones warning about tampering with hardware. I know I dont seem like the most joyous person at the moment but any help relating to a working support number or any
 proper details regarding where one applies for a new console, mayhaps one that will read new discs, will only have my thanks and the happiness of avoiding me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: I clean my consoles lens almost daily at this point (been trying anything to help), but I dont think its the lens that causes LA Noire to fail to load, or gives me an 'unable to read disc' msg, or if it does manage to load, crashes my box after two steps.
 Microsoft and Rockstar games seem to gimme the worst trouble...</p>

<p>Fallout New Vegas is burned, legally and within my rights as a customer, Im fine with putting the CD in. Sadly, this game isn't working either. It simply wont read it and shows 'Open Tray' option :( even though its on my hard drive. Sorry to post this thread
 under such a strange title, I just prefer to use the phone. Heres an image of my Xbox telling me no...</p>

<p>I'm assuming you've tried all of the steps in <a href="http://xbx.lv/dFEETV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this guide</a>? If so, it sounds like your console will need a repair. You can set one up

<br />
And to be clear, when you say the game was 'burned legally,' do you mean copied to the HDD?</p>

<p>Clearing the cache seems to help sometimes. Hopefully, it'll help someone less compromised than myself. Thankfully the update didnt hit my console as hard as some of these others.
</p>
<p>But that doesnt explain why it wont read American DVDs, or why my Netflix simply banned me temporarily.</p>
<p>Sorry man, to be clear, when you put a game in your console and press 'Y' (details), and install game by pressing 'A', you copy that information to your hard drive, excuse my lack of technical linguistics by calling it burned. By doing this process you negate
 the game having to read straight from the CD constantly, am I right? Only occasionally, for right sake, yes?</p>
<p>Since the update Ive been frequenting this:</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/wZBA1l&amp;AA5Zy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">imgur.com/wZBA1l&amp;AA5Zy</a></p>
<p>How is this MY fault? We should be able to play the games we paid for on the systems we paid for without having to accept xbox-bricking updates if we dont chose to. Honestly, since the whole Playstation Fiasco I've been sincerely glad to have chosen a corporation
 THAT ACTUALLY ENFORCES STRICT ONLINE RIGHTS. I've come to truly appreciate that.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;However, absolutely no one should have to accept a security update that negates their system entirely. I'd rather have a system to play my software on rather than have a hardware paperweight I get to keep buying yearly. Fun times.</p>
<p>Has Microsoft and AT&amp;T had a falling out? This is the only way I can seem to get in touch with anyone, in any way, regarding Microsoft at the moment. Regardless of how bitter I sound, I sincerely appreciate your help Fitzer. Thank you.</p>

<p>You mentioned being able to play American discs? Are you in the US currently? If not, you may be experiencing an issue with region-locked discs.ooks
<br />
<br />
The image you showed from L.A. Noire looks like serious graphical corruption. Do you have a similar issue with other games? If so, make sure the console is in an open, well-ventilated environment (as a hot console can occasionally cause those kinds of issues).
 If it is, and this is occurring with different types of video cables, too, the console may need a repair.</p>

<p>I've pretty much given up, man. I appreciate it. Lost my faith in this ******* company. So tired of a company that can make decent hardware throwing crap hardware at the "gaming" public, that MIGHT last two years. Mayyybe. And thats stretching it. Seriously.
 No offense.</p>
<p>I live in America, I play American discs. My Xbox sits in the open on top of my entertainment center, with a Nyko series 2 intercooler on it (not the one that melts to your system, either). Its only having serious problems reading newer games, as LFD, Sacred,
 Saboteur and several other old discs read fine, for the most part. I have immense problems with reading LA Noire, Fallout New Vegas, and only a handful of new games. As I've stopped buying newer games, now altogether. What good are they gonna do my system
 if it wont read new games? And somehow this is MY FAULT, that I buy a new, however faulty, system. Awesome!</p>
<p>I tried to play New Vegas again now, and as usual it wouldn't read, so I used some compressed air to try and clean the lens. Thinking this might be the problem. Still wouldn't read. So I pop in LFD, works fine. Tried New Vegas again, denied. Tried AC: Brotherhood,
 works fine. Tried New Vegas again, denied. So I tried New Vegas in my fiance's console, reads fine. WTF?!?! And this is my fault? Never should've accepted the useless Xbox-bricking security update with this older console. I was even reading up on it before
 I did it. That theres a chance older consoles will lose their ability to read new discs. Thought mine might be at risk, but surely if it was Microsoft had a plan. Some plan. Have people pay to get a repair, or new console. Maybe your happy working for them
 Fitzer, but I'm tired of fighting my Xbox everyday now to get it to read the new games I've worked hard to purchase, maybe they look out for you. I feel they are definitely not doing the same for me. I bought this console to relax or to absorb myself in a
 story, not to be ridiculed by it with its demonic "Open Tray" text while a new game dumbly sits in the drive. I think most people like to experience new imaginary circumstances with a friend or two maybe. This, I dont get to do anymore, because my console
 wont read new discs and if it does it seems temporary. Taunting me with moments of "Oh that would've been fun... if it wouldn't crash". New games for me now, have been seeming more and more like demos. So most of the time I'm forced to walk down Nostalgia
 Lane, where I get to play games of yesterday, and if my friends wanna play with me this is where they'll find me.
</p>
<p>As of now, defeated, I've unplugged my Xbox. I was able to keep the Xbox on with New Vegas running smoothly yesterday, now it won't read it at all. Other games will. And like I said, New Vegas will read in the fiance's Xbox, it isn't a faulty disc. Just
 my Xbox when it comes to reading certain newer discs.</p>

                    <p>Windows 10 - BootMgr is missing Press Ctrl-Alt-Del to restart</p>
<p>
</p><p>My daughter has a pc that had windows 7 on it but she upgrade to windows 10 when Microsoft had the free upgrade.&nbsp; She had the above error pop up yesterday.&nbsp; She did not have restore points checked so that option isn't available.&nbsp; She has tried to put the
 windows 7 disk in to use the repair my computer tool, but for some reason it's not fixing it.&nbsp; It showed a normal screen and when she took out the 7 disk and rebooted it wasn't fixed.&nbsp; Now, when she repeats the repair steps it doesn't find any operating system.&nbsp;
 She has tried to go to where it asks for a system image but when she navigates to here external backup device it won't use the image file.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have downloaded from Microsoft the iso(?) and instead of burning it to a disk I put it on a memory stick.&nbsp; Can she use this to install windows 10 over the top of her not working windows 10 OS?.&nbsp; Going back to installing windows 7 and then upgrading to
 10 (Microsoft might not even allow that now) puts all of her files etc at risk of loosing or corrupting them.</p>
<p>

            Hi Sal.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to restart PC three times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.

    <title>Stylus too sensitive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicolas maida  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stylus too sensitive</h2>
                    I just picked up my Surface Pro 2 for digital art applications. It was running fine the first couple days, but now the stylus will make marks on the screen when the pen is simply hovering over the machine. I tried calibrating and adjusting the sensitivity
 settings, as well as installing a wacom driver for tablet pc's. Nothing seems to be helping. I had this happen to my very first wacom tablet years ago and could never find a fix. Is this something I can adjust or should I return this and just use an art tablet
 for my old laptop?

            <p>Hi Nicolas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to remember someone else having a problem similar. I believe they tried a new stylus, but I can't even remember if that resolved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you has access to another stylus, maybe give it a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>it seems like you might be using old version of Skype client. What operating system/Skype client version are you using? or are you using some hardware device (Skype phone) ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might help to update your client, then it should work.</p>

<p>I am usinig the latest version of Skype for my Windows 7 desktop.</p>
<p>It worked yesterday, but today Skype (to my Skype number) calls, I click answer, I wait 3 seconds, the Skype call opens and there is nothing in the other end. Meanwhile Skype starts calling again, presumably from the other end, but still nothing. This continues

            Thank-you for the response. &nbsp;As I am not able to delete thePayPal account as a payment method, how then do I update the information on the payment method? &nbsp;The e-mail account that shows on the PayPal account no longer exists, which would cause the payment
 to fail.

<h2>            Laptop with WIN7 running slower all of a sudden.</h2>
                    <p>Hello dear community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>coming here and asking you guys for help is actually my last resort. </p>
<p>My HP laptop with decent specs (2.4Ghz, 6Gb DDR3, etc.) is all of a sudden running really slow.</p>
<p>I was hoping there was an issue with one of the drivers because it slowed down right after an WIN update. I restored the PC to factory condition after checking for malware with several online scans. After the long process of formating it actually worked.
 Then the updates started and i had to eventualy reboot it. After the reboot it went back to being very slow. I again formated the C: and tried it in offline mode. It didnt work this time. I ran several memory, HDD tests and tried defragmenting 3 times, tried
 BIOS performance checks, tried HP performance checks, looked at the performance in the tasked manager and everytime everything looked FINE. I have absolutely no clue what the heck is wrong with this thing. I keep it on my desk the whole time and havent moved
 the laptop in a while. It is in a closed AC enviroment. The computer is so slow it can not play GIFs normaly and also the win media player is skipping. The media player isnt skipping everything just the better quality videos and music. I disabled all enchancments
 and it is just a bit better. I dont know if the youtube wideos in HD are any different than the music im playing but they actually play perfectyIt is most probably a hardware malfunction and i know this isnt the right forum for hardware stuff...</p>
<p>I would just like some help because you guys are the best. :)</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community Form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that your computer is running very slow after recent Windows updates. You have already tried a number of troubleshooting steps like restoring the computer to factory settings but problem reappeared after installing the
 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.
</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the KB number of that updates that were installed?</li><li>When you say “I again reformatted the C: and tried it in offline”, do you mean you formatted the C drive and reinstalled the operating system?</li><li>Have you checked starting the computer in safe mode? Does the problem persist?</li><li>You mentioned that you run memory diagnostics and BIOS performance etc, what were the results?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are not sure how to check which update and the KB number were installed, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Open
<strong>Update History </strong>by clicking the <strong>Start</strong> button, clicking
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>Programs</strong>, and then, under
<strong>Programs and Features</strong>, clicking <strong>Update History</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since the issue persists even after formatting the System partition and reinstalling the operating system it appears that the there is some hardware problem with the computer.
 I would suggest you to contact your system manufacturer to get hardware diagnostics performed on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you meant something else, please reply with the required information and other relevant details about the issue, we’ll get back to you as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the meantime may try these methods below and check if that solves the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1</span></span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s run the following Microsoft Fixit to get the problem automatically detected and fixed. This fixit automatically checks the power plan settings, if multiple anti-virus
 programs are running, several programs are running when Windows starts, or running multiples programs at a time in the background.</span></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am very grateful for you showing interest in my problem. The issue with the slow PC is still not fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I do not think that the updates are the problem after all. I restored the PC to factory settings in offline mode. There were no updates that could have had been instaled and my PC was still slow (gifs on 9gag and video was slow)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I unpluged my PC from the Internet, restored PC to factory condition and tested its performance on GIFs, Video and music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Safe mode i did try. I do not know if the problem persists in safe mode because i can not play any AVI files or open GIFs. I wish there was a way to test it in safe mode but i do not know any since the computer can perform simple operations but its end
 performance is misserable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. The results of all the tests i ran (BIOS memory and disk check, HP assistant 4 different performance checks, WINDOWS Scan Disk tool with checking bad sectors and without, were all no errors found, everything ok, etc.) I also tried looking at the task
 manager if different programs would overclock my PC but they hardly come to 50%. I tried different power options what Laptops have and set all the parameters to max performance passive cooling and so on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device manager says all the components are functioning properly. Is there any other way to test my hardware? I could have also missed a performance setting or something.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

                    <p>I would like to know about the feature, Remote Control (or) Shared Screen, in Skype for Business.</p>
<p>Can that control manage by the authority of administrator privilege although the client (or) other computer has only user level?</p>

<p><span>Hi Ko Si Thu Hein,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can share your desktop to other Skype for business users and if you want another meeting participant to help you present, or demonstrate something, you can grant
 control to that person. These features are independent of the users’ permission.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For more detailed information about sharing screen in Skype for business, here is an article for your reference:</span></p>

<p>From my perspective, it is feasible for you to do that. However the result is based on your test because it is related to third party application. And we welcome you to come back and share your test result with us.</p>

<h2>            Continuous alarm sound</h2>
                    <p>After, but not during&nbsp;logging in,&nbsp; a high pitched continuous alarm sound is heard from my speakers.&nbsp; Going into the Sound panel with the "Realtek High Def Audio speakers" selected&nbsp;by default, if I disable them, and then enable the speakers again, the&nbsp;alarm
 sound disappears and I can hear what I am trying to listen to. If I close down and boot up again the sound returns. I have updated all the relevant drivers. Is there a permanent solution to this issue?</p>

<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties

            Hi Peter.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please run the Sound Playback troubleshooter at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC's Support Downloads webpage.  If no newer then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If no Updates listed this could also be the latest Windows 10 Version 1709 Update which you can check at Settings&gt;System&gt;About and if necessary roll back at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery, then hide with the tool given above to wait for it to mature.  
<br />
<br />Or you can try the most stable method to update to the latest version (which you need anyway) by installing  Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi to Andre and Greg</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to reply to the above issue. Fortunately, I have now found the cause. I have recently installed an Epson printer monitoring window, for watching the progress of a photo print and ink levels. This is set to start up when I log
 in. When the printer is off I, naturally,&nbsp;get a "communications error" message on this window and I close the window down, when I am not printing, often&nbsp;just after&nbsp;I log on.&nbsp;However, it also has a sound alarm which "goes off" when the printer is switched off
 and does not, I now discover,&nbsp;stop even when I close down the window. ( I often do not have the sound system on when I am working so I only discovered this issue some time after installing this monitor and did not make the link between the sound I was hearing
 and the closed monitor window.)&nbsp;Anyway, I have now disabled the sound alarm and the problem is solved. My apologies if I have wasted your time and for not spotting this hidden issue before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>many thanks</p>
        </p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Community where you can find the necessary information about Microsoft products!</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>You get message that
</span></b><b><span>RGSCLauncher has stopped working</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Quick questions:</span></b></p>
<p>
<b><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b><b><span>When exactly do you get this error?</span></b></p>
<p>
<b><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b><b><span>Do you get the message when you try to use a Rockstar game? If yes, which is the game?</span></b></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any
<b>changes</b> on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>If you get the message while trying to use a game, then I would suggest you to reinstall the game in clean boot state and check
 if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1: Clean boot</span></b></p>
<p><span>When the computer is started in clean boot, non Microsoft programs will not be started and any interruption
 from them would be avoided.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link:</span></p>
<span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>:
</span><strong><span>Once you are done with clean boot, follow step 3 in the article to set your computer back to normal startup</span></strong><b><span>.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note: If in case you are connected through a wireless connection then when you start the System Configuration
 Utility to perform clean boot, click Startup &amp; Services tab one at time and ensure wireless related entry is Checked (Enabled).</span></strong></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Uninstall the program</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Refer the site:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Uninstall or change a program</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I would suggest you to contact the vendor of the software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. If the issue persists, let us know and we would be glad to help you.</span></p>

                    <p>I have recently had a problem where my microphone will take output sounds of my computer such as music or videos and games even when my microphone is not turned on. This seemed to be happening ever since I got my headphones plugged in as I recently built
 a new computer and bought these headphones at the same time. It has become fairly annoying since I like to play with my friends but when they can hear my game sound it ruins the experience so I often mute myself or have push to talk enabled to avoid them constantly
 hearing double of the game. I had found a fix and so for a few days was able to enjoy what I had thought was just the fruits of my 'new hardware configuration' phase but it came back and I was at a loss at how to fix it again since what I had done previously
 did not work a second time. For now I have resorted to the tedious 'reinstall the driver' fix which requires a restart every time I do so. I have done all the basic fixes such: reinstalling drivers, messing with settings and sensitivity etc and disabled stereo
 mix and made sure that "listen to this device" was not enabled. I have also tried changing settings of the program I use to talk to friends, Discord, and have had no luck. I can see that at certain points of videos my microphone, even when off, will pick up
 sounds from the video and I am not sure if it is related to volume level or certain pitch/frequencies but I have tried to mess around with both. I am not using any special sound card or program to alter my mic and I have tried also plugging my headset (input
 and output) into the back ports however the problem persisted and the only noticeable change was the sound quality got quieter/worse. Since it is one device for both I cannot plug one into the front and the other in the back etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any recommendations I will happily try since I have just about tried everything so far. I am also using the version 1809 of windows and have used nothing else on this computer since it was new and thus a fresh install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Jude</p>

            Hi Jude
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Could you try upgrading to the newer Windows 10 1903 release to see if this resolved?
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Upgrade this PC now if you want to upgrade right away,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Feature Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1903 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/prepare-computer-windows-10-creators-update-version-1703/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/prepare-comput...</a>
<br />
<br />Also...
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select Communications tab
<br />Choose Do nothing
<br />
<br />If there is an 'Enhancements' tab, click on it then check the box to 'Disable all enhancements'.

            <p><span>Hi Kandice,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. Your interest in Groove music is much appreciated.
</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are unable to copy music from Groove app. I 'll be glad to assist you.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Just to let you know Kandice, Groove music app is only designed for media playback. We cannot transfer music files to any external media device
 through it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to copy songs to your iPod from your computer, you may navigate to the location where you have set the download path for all the downloaded
 files. This settings can be accessed from within the web browser's settings.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>May&nbsp;I&nbsp;know from which web browser&nbsp;did&nbsp;you downloaded the songs?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are also a lot of apps available in Windows store which lets you transfer files from your computer to any external media. You may check
 it out for yourself. </span></p>
<p><span>To name a few, SHAREit, Easy&nbsp;Transfer etc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Connect your phone using the USB cable.

<br />Touch and drag the Notification bar done
<br />Tap 'Connected as camera'

<br />If that does not work:
<br />
<br />Install Smart Switch from Samsung. <a href="https://www.samsung.com/global/download/smartswitchwin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.samsung.com/global/download/smartsw...</a>

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor, 18 years experienced windows guide. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />- Open the Windows Media Player Settings troubleshooter
<br />- Press Start button and type Control panel.
<br />- Type troubleshooting and select Troubleshooting.
<br />- Left corner select view all and select Windows media player setting troubleshooter.
<br />- Follow on screen steps and check.
<br />- Perform same steps for Media player Library too
<br />
<br />For Samsung device sync: 
<br />1. Connect your Samsung device to your PC using a USB cable.
<br />
<br />2. Open Windows Media Player on your PC. 
<br />
<br />3. Sync your files. 
<br />
<br />Click on the Sync tab found to the right of the Window Media Player window. You will see your device’s phone model listed on the sync screen. 
<br />
<br />For Manual Syncing, drag the video tracks from the Window Media Player music list on your PC to your Sync list on the right, and click on “Start sync” at the top of the screen only when all the tracks you want have been added. 
<br />
<br />For Automatic Syncing, simply click on “Finish” to sync automatically. This will select all the media files from the Windows Media Player list of your PC to sync with your Samsung Galaxy device. 
<br />
<br />4. Safely disconnect your PC and mobile device once syncing is complete. View the syncing progress on the right side of the Windows Media Player window. When it is done, safely disconnect your devices by clicking on Start again. 
<br />
<br />Look for “Computer” from the Start list, and click on it. Select your Samsung Galaxy device model, right-click on it, and click on “Eject.” 
<br />
<br />Once you see the “Safely remove hardware” notification appear on the lower right corner of your PC screen, you can remove your USB cable.
