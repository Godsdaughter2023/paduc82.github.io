<h2>            Video and text on Skype</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;When I am on video on skype can I text as&nbsp; well and have it translated? My friend is in Mexico and does not speak English and I do not speak Spanish. I am told that if I want to have it translated that my comments would go to skype then they would translate
 and send to my friend.</p>
<p>I have not used skype to call anyone yet so can you tell me if I can type text when I have the video on as well ?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>New Surface Pro screen goes to sleep randomly or shuts off - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New Surface Pro screen goes to sleep randomly or shuts off</h2>
                    While in tablet mode and watching videos, my screen brightness shoots all the way up, and then my screen goes black. I have to then log back in. I thought it was the sleep settings, but I changed it so that it won't ever go to sleep, but it continues to
 happen. (Literally the whole device just shut down right after I finished that sentence). I've tried updating drivers but nothing seems to work. I'm wondering if I got a messed up device or if I'm missing something.

    <title>External monitor capabilities on surface Book with performance base - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elsevers  say:</h3>
<h2>            External monitor capabilities on surface Book with performance base and docking station</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can the new surface book (with performance base) + docking station drive two external monitors: a 3840x2160/60Hz 4K monitor and a 1920 x 1200 / 60Hz monitor?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that there are some limitations (outlined here:&nbsp;<span>https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/music-photos-and-video/connect-surface-to-a-tv-display-or-projector?os=windows-10)
 and that the original surface book cannot drive two 4K/60Hz monitors -- does this still apply? Would my desired configuration of one 4K monitor plus one 1920 x 1200 / 60 Hz monitor work? Could I also have the surface book screen open as a 3rd monitor?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>Eric</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To resolve this, please check AndyShare's reply on November 12, 2015. Here's the
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfbook-surfdrivers/surface-book-low-resolution-on-4k-uhd-monitor/4b8dd829-a55b-45d0-878e-1bf71dc7390f?auth=1">

 to use your Surface Book as a 3rd monitor.</p>

            <p>Thank you very much! </p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding is that you can't daisy chain from at 4k/60Hz (this exceeds the display port bandwidth) -- so a 4k monitor must be at 30 Hz to support daisy chaining. Is this correct? If so, AndyShare must be using the two minidisplay ports on his docking
 station to do this -- or perhaps a USB3 to HDMI adapter for his 1080P monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any idea if my desired configuration will cause the Surface Book to perform slowly or otherwise cause any trouble? I.e. is having 3 monitors (4k/60Hz, 1920x1200/60Hz, and the surface monitor) all simultaneously connected going to reduce the performance
 of the surface book?</p>
<p>

            <p>After a conversation with Microsoft tech support today I can confirm that they say there are know issues using two monitors of any kind with a surface book and a surface dock.</p>
<p>We have two such setups - on one the external screens flash on and off unusably, the other annoyingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are using DP monitors (no adaptor issues) and the specific cable matters DP to mini DP cables recommended by MS in their troubleshooting guide.</p>
<p>The monitors are only 1920x1080 - and Lenvo Think vision (i.e. a business class brand).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we connect the docking station directly to the tablet component - the two monitors on the dock&nbsp;work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we attach the tablet to the keyboard and then attach the dock with 2 monitors&nbsp;to this we have problems!</p>
<p>
</p><p>On one machine this is occasional flickering from time to time and occasional bouts of unusable flickering.</p>
<p>On the 2nd machine the flickering is nearly constant with the odd bout of stability (swapping components makes no difference) Introducing the base seems to kill the reliability.</p>
<p>Fully patched - weeks on the phone to Microsoft</p>
<p>Today we were told today that it is a known problem, there's no guarantee of a fix but there are updates daily (the MS website says the last update was on the 17th Nov - i.e., a month ago).</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of our units is going back to see if that improves things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd suggest that you may be disappointed if you plan to use two monitors with a surface dock. If you don't know someone who has the confit you intend to use and who confirms it works I'd save your money until there's a fix.</p>

            <p>The best and safest way is to uninstall it using Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features and then reinstall it using the game's installation media (CD/DVD or downloaded installation file).&nbsp; Check with the game manufacturer's website to save and move any saved
 games, customizations, settings, and the like.&nbsp; If you need a license key or other authentication, be sure to find this out before uninstalling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually -- but not always -- when you install a program you will have a "custom install" option where you can select the installation location.&nbsp; Even when this is available, however, there likely will be some data saved on the system drive no matter what
 you do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempting to "move" an already-installed application is fraught with danger.&nbsp; Applications typically have pieces in multiple locations and games often are the worst offenders at this.&nbsp; You may easily miss some component.&nbsp; Moreover, almost all Windows applications
 other than the very simplest ones will have multiple entries scattered throughout the Windows Registry.&nbsp; You would have to find and edit all those entries to point to the correct new location(s).&nbsp;

            Hi there.<br />
<br />
If you want to move the game I would suggest to reinstall it - first uninstall from the current drive, and then install it on the new destination.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, you can install some games on the external drive, but I won't recommend to do it since you may experience some problems with the OS due to the registry keys of the games. Even if you decide to do so, keep in mind that the game would take longer to
 load and it would be slower to load maps/levels compared to SATA since the USB 3.0 bandwidth is not as fast as the one of the internal SATA ports.<br />
<br />
As for the loading speed, there's no sure way to say how fast exactly it will be. Basically the maximum bandwidth of USB 3.0 is 4.8 Gb/s, or around 600 MB/s, which is quite slow for gaming and may cause lag spikes. Also, keep in mind that the HDD speed won't
 affect your FPS or gaming performance, but only the mentioned loading times.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Cheers! :)<br />

<h2>            How can I combine all accounts</h2>
                    <p>Things get saved in different places on the system and I have trouble finding them. Ex: I can't just go to "douments" because there are several "documents" locations. I would like EVERYTHING be contained in one place. As you can see below, eveything is different.
 Is there any way to have just a default user or just my "Steph" so everything (programs, documents, pics, etc) is all in one spot?</p>

            <p>Don't bother with the embarrassing 'Microsoft Support Engineer.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no such thing as a default user account - that would be a big security risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you are the only user of your computer, you need to have two accounts:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>an Administrator account - that's a user account with Administrator permissions - in order to make system-wide changes to the computer. You wouldn't store your personal files in this account. Your Administrator account is only used when you need to make
 changes that affect the entire computer, like installing software; and</li><li>a Standard account - that's a user account that does not have Administrator permissions. This is the account that you use for your day-to-day computer use, and it's in this account where you store all your personal files (documents, pictures, bookmarks,
 etc.)</li></ul>
<p>Your Standard account can be either a local account or a Microsoft account. A local account can only be used on your own computer; a Microsoft account can be used on any computer. Your Administrator account should be a local account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Combining all your personal files into one place from the four corners of the earth is easy-peasy: Once you've settled on a Standard account, move all your personal files from the other accounts into your Standard account. You'll need to do this from your
 Administrator account, because you're making a change that affects the whole computer. Every time you move files, you'll be asked if you want to take ownership of the files, and you'll say 'yes' each time. In Windows, each user account is considered a separate
 person - that's why you have to obtain permission to access other user accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Software should be installed in the same account as Windows. That's usually the C: drive. Since you need to be use an Administrator account to install software, your software programs should already be in your Administrator account, and that's where they'll
 stay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most software installs itself in a way that makes it available to all users. If you installed software for only one user, and now you want to change that user, you'll have to uninstall the software and re-install it.</p>

    <title>Xbox Live 30 Day Free Trial Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bigmike0711  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live 30 Day Free Trial Problems</h2>
                    
<p>I recently decided to get my fiance into video games. I created a new account for her yesterday and when I was putting in my payment information to activate a free 30 day trial of xbox live for her account my system froze. When I turned back on the system,
 the opportunity for the free 30 day trial was gone. All I'm trying to do is get my fiance the free 30 day trial membership of xbox live that she was looking forward to. I am confident that after trying Live that she will love it and stay with it.</p>
<p>I chatted with tech support but the only response I got from them was that they could not make a 30 day free trial happen for her, they recommended that I create a new account for her to get the 30 day trial membership that way, tech support then recommended
 that I simply buy the one month subscription, and their final solution was to redirect me to this forum. I am already uneasy about Xbox Live to begin with for a number of reasons and now this issue, this very basic issue, is about to push me over the edge.
 I suggested a few different options to get the free month of service but to no avail.</p>
<p>I'll attach the transcripts of the chat between tech support and me. Please, I really don't see the difficulty in getting a new user and potential long term customer a one month free trial, especially since the offer was lost due to a simple glitch in the
 console.</p>
<p>My account info is:</p>
<p>BigMike0711</p>
<p>The account that I activated for her and that is being denied the very basic one month free trial is:</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Exactly Davemcfly85!</p>
<p>Each brand new console has 3 1-month free trials, these free trials are only avalible during Xbox Live account creation.</p>
<p>So if there was a system issue that prevented you from making use of the 1 month free trial for that profile you would need to start up a new one!</p>
<p>Bummer I know, added note though!</p>
<p>The email you used for the previous account cannot be used for the new account you will need to make.</p>
<p>So you may have to make a new email for the new account as well.</p>
<p>Just a heads up, if you have any more questions feel free to ask!</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Hey there Mike! I'm sorry to hear about the trouble with getting your fiance's account set up. Unfortunately I'm with the Chat Agent on this one. We don't have any way to provide this 30-day trial outside of the system automatically generating one. The only
 suggestions I'd have for you are the ones you've already received from Chat and Dave's post here. Please let us know if you have any further questions though. Thank you!</p>

<p>This is not an answer or really of any help only I have had more or less the same problem. My situation was/is that I am unable to get my 30 day free trial even though it says that I can. No matter how many accounts I create it stil doesn't work. All I get
 is either - error codes. Told that the service is temporarily unavailable. Unable to process my request at this time or similar, unhelpful explanations. &nbsp;I really feel for you considering your partner has aquired achievements that were difficult to obtain.
 &nbsp;I feel even worse for you because I have been a loyal customer, like yourself, &nbsp;since back even before halo 3 was released. I have called microsft support and they have taken me through steps which I myself already did in order to attempt to rectify / remedy
 the problem to no avail. &nbsp;This is the real KICKER. They informed me that they were incredibly sorry and although the advisor on the phone was incredibly well mannered-- that I would recieve an email with a code for a month of gold membership free. Yes. A "CODE
 for a MONTH of FREE GOLD membership". </p>

    <title>Windows 7 activation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crackp0t  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 activation</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a Win 7 Ult OEM licence installed and was waiting on Windows 10 upgrade completing when one of my hard drives failed. I have 2 60G SSD's in the machine and both of them were nearly full, I figured a clean Win 10 install was required. I d/l'd windows
 10 and performed a full clean install, but wouldn't activate. Searched for a solution and the general consensus was to reinstall windows 7 and wait for the update. Upon reinstalling Windows 7 it would not activate. I tried via online and the automated phone
 service, no joy. So I phoned Microsoft and was informed that my license had been used too many times and needed to contact the OEM. I didn't accept that and asked to speak to a supervisor but was told that he was 'in a meeting' so I left my number for them
 to call back.......</p>
<p>I know for a fact this licence was bought by myself, not distributed to anyone else and only used on my machine. All my problems started when I tried to upgrade to windows 10, so I see this as a MS problem otherwise I would not have been able to activate
 the licence when I first bought it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>
<p>Robert</p>

 Windows 10 upgrade, I seriously wish Id left well alone now. Thanks anyway Noel</p>
<p>Am I Likely to get a response from MS for some help, is this the correct forum?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Store keeps refreshing the page when trying to download&#47;buy apps</h2>
                    <p>This happens on both PCs I own and it's driving me mad, since I really, NEED a specific App (it happens with any App though):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I click on <strong>Buy, Free Trial&nbsp;</strong>or whatever the App page is displaying.</p>
<p>2) The "Button" will momentarily be replaced with a loading bar and display the words "Working...".</p>
<p>3) After half a second or so, the page just refreshes and displays&nbsp;<strong>Buy, Free Trial, etc.&nbsp;</strong>again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been unable to find anyone else so far having this problem. I tried trouble shoots of other problems, like resetting the Store Cache, but it doesn't even let me do that. I run wsreset.exe as admin, the store window opens and then nothing happens,
 no matter how long I wait. Also happens on both PCs.</p>

            Hello, 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />Please try the below steps:
<br />First of all:
<br />Try re-registering Store and clearing cache:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8239-re-register-store-app-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8239-re-reg...</a>

<br />If that doesn't help, make sure:
<br />You are not using a proxy server/3rd Party Firewall or a VPN.
<br />The next step would be to disable metered connection if you have set so.
<br />If all of these doesn't help, try doing a repair install that keeps everything.
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2016/06/how-to-do-repair-install-using-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2016/06/how-to-...</a>
<br />Please let us know how that goes and  if you need any assistance.

    <title>Another Installation Is in Progress &#40;Windows 10&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Another Installation Is in Progress &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    Recently I have came across a problem in the Windows 10 OS that occurs whenever I try to install a new&nbsp;or update an existing program.<br />
<br />
I have read other articles attempt to tackle this through the Services window by simply disabling and re-enabling the Windows Installer service. However, I am blocked from accessing this option.
<br />
<br />
In previous attempts I have scanned my system with both Ad-Aware and AVG both of which found and removed malware and viruses, one of which was in the update manager file, but has not fixed the original problem.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions towards a fix, besides accessing and modifying the registers via cmd or run?<br />
<br />
Many Thanks<br />
Aaron

            The problem occurs when running on battery only. It has always been this way. It is particularly noticeable when viewing videos. Every time the scene changes the screen starts changing the brightness level. I have all latest updates installed, and have
 made the toggle changes many times, with restarts afterwards to no avail. Same result despite toggle settings.

            We understand now. Actually the adaptive brightness have separate settings for plugged and unplugged. It can be found in the Power Options. Can you check if the it is also set as off when unplugged?

<h2>            Cannot find second hard drive windows 8, tried so many things</h2>
                    Hi, I'm Anthony. I have windows 8 and I have trouble finding a second or third hard drive when I plug it into my computer. I didn't feel like writing out specs so here is a picture, sorry I'm lazy lol.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>http://img9.imageshack.us/img9/9636/specst.png</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I didn't know if anybody would need the product id and if I wasn't supposed to post it, but if you need it let me know.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Let me tell the short story so it's known to everyone who reads this. I had an hp and a compaq laptop. Both computers had stopped working randomly on me (not sure why, fixed one recently by randomly taking it apart and putting back together) at the same
 time. That was about 6 months ago, and I held onto the computers until now. I have this new computer and wish to put the data from the other two hard drives on this new 1TB one. All of the hard drives are SATA and I'm not sure why I'm having a problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've hooked up and tried many methods to get my hard drives (not the 1TB one, just the older two) to show up in MyComputer so I can get information off of them. Here are the things I've tried:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-Resetting the computer, no luck</div>
<div>-Went to "Computer Management", went storage -&gt; disk management and didn't see anything new from when I plugged the HDD in and refreshed the page.</div>
<div>-Used that Windows Update and installed like 30 important updates (I forgot I put it on manual lol) everything is updated fully.</div>
<div>-Went in BIOS mode, although I have no experience with it, I found hard drives and scanned them (the quick one, not two hours) and it only found the original 1TB one, nothing else.</div>
<div>-I think I tried one of those microsoft fixit programs online that you start it and lets you see hardware that won't show up, no luck either.</div>
<div>-Uninstalling and reinstalling what I thought was the hard drive but I don't think it was now that I think about it*</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>*I must have thought I found it since it said like st001 but I plugged in two hard drives and nothing changed, I don't think that was one of them.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is a picture I have from the troubleshooter,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>http://img27.imageshack.us/img27/1297/problemharddrive.png</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's how my connections are made with the two hard drives:</div>
<div>-One of them is hooked up to the 1TB hard drive. By that I mean there is a power and a data cable going to the 1TB hard drive, then a data cable from the 1TB to one of my laptop hard drives. The second hard drive is "running", I feel it vibrating and working
 as if it was working fine, no funny noises, nothing unusual. I'm not sure if I need a power cable going to the mother board, I saw that I would need one in a video but I believe it's running, I could be wrong.</div>
<div>-The other hard drive, I'll call it hard drive "B" for short, is hooked up to a cord that plugs in a USB 2.0 port. I know on SATA hard drives there is a section to plug in for data and one spot for power right next to eachother, and this definitely goes
 into both unlike the first one. I am 100% sure this hard drive is running, I feel it humming a bit, not a bad noise, just the sound of working haha.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The first HDD I talked about has vista on it and the second one has windows 7. I have been trying everything I read to solve this problem, no luck :(</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If you need any more information please ask, I do need the information off of these hard drives though, I can't wipe them clean.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you in advance to anybody who posts,</div>
<div>-Anthony S.</div>

<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are unable to detect the hard drive connected to Windows 8 Computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to enable the SATA ports in the bios.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it purely from SATA to USB, the device need power to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information was helpful. If you need further assistance, please feel free to post. We are here to assist you.</p>

<br />
<div>Thanks for answering, I know it's a tough question.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'll look up how to enable SATA ports in the bios, I didn't see anything about it and I'll give it a try.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I know SATA hard drives have 2/3 of a section where you plug in for like memory and data accessing, and like 1/3 of an area right next to it for power. This SATA to USB covers both spots, and I confirmed it by looking at my 1TB HDD inside of my computer
 tower where things were plugged in. It definitely is powered, I'm holding it in my hand right now and feel it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm gonna try what you said about enabling SATA ports in the bios, I'll post back soon!</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are unable to detect the hard drive connected to Windows 8 Computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it purely from SATA to USB, the device need power to work.</p>

    <title>Brightness slider in Action Center and settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thankful67  say:</h3>
<h2>            Brightness slider in Action Center and settings</h2>
                    <p>Why is there no Brightness Slider in the action center when the upgrade to version 1903 clearly says that there is a slider there?&nbsp; The brightness settings on my screen are awkward so I would prefer to just take the user friendly option that 1903 is advocating.
 &nbsp;&nbsp; I can't see a slider in settings either. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Hi thankful,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />The display driver might not be working correctly..
<br />
<br />Please see the below options:
<br />
<br />Option 1.Try Rolling back if you have an option:
<br />Go to Device Manager by typing in Devmgmt.msc in Run dialog box. 
<br />Navigate to Display devices and right click ATI Radeon HD or Similar device you have. Choose Properties. 
<br />On the Driver tab, hit rollback Driver to go back to the previous version. 
<br />
<br />Option 2. Remove drivers completely and Install the the newest ones available from the OEM or the maker.
<br />What you need to do:
<br />1. Uninstall everything of Display driver using DDU
<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the driver from the OEM or the maker like AMD
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.

            The display driver will be reinstalled automatically. 
<br />
<br />You might need to perform a repair upgrade if the above steps do not work...
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.

<br />
<br />Select the option Upgrade this PC now if you want to upgrade right away,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Feature Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1903 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying option one, I went for doing a reinstall with your instructions above.&nbsp; Everything went along well but instead of a reinstall saving my files and apps— I got an error message and Windows 10 was reverted back to the state before the attempted
 reinstall.&nbsp; This is the message that the installer gave me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ox800737-Ox20003</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during INSTALL- UPDATES operation</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 1903 already and all I have noticed on my machine is the missing brightness slider bar in the action center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do about this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            It is likely why this function is currently not working. I'm afraid there is not much else that can be done. You could consider rolling back to the previous release and stick with it.

<p>Hi Kenneth</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried this but nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the system tray icon bundled in the electron app, or is it taken from the /usr/share/icons/hicolor/.... ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those icons, which are installed by skypeforlinux, have a "preview" written across the skype logo.&nbsp; The system tray icon does not.&nbsp; That's why I'm asking, in case maybe it's taking the wrong icon from who-knows-where?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>This exact same icon problem also started happening for me since 8.20.76.1 on Arch Linux running GNOME. Also in 8.20.76.3 and current 8.20.76.8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This guy also reports the same problem in another thread here: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/skype_linux-skype_startms-skype_installms/issue-with-skype-tray-icon-starting-with-version/82dcc7bb-cd51-4d31-a843-e8cc949564e6</p>
<p>
</p><p>I concur with what free6 is saying. All the PNG files bundled in the deb file have a either a P or a Preview emblazened across them but the small icon we are seeing the the system tray does not. So it does not seem to be coming from any explicit image file
 bundled in the deb. Please moderators here, appreciate what we are saying here and don't just tell us to "reinstall". This is affecting multiple (possibly all?) Linux users since 8.20.76.1.</p>

<p>Guy from the other thread here. Thanks for making me aware of this thread.<br />
<br />
Same problem as the other people here, re-installing Skype fixes nothing. Every version of Skype after 8.20.76.1 has the problem, whereas all versions before that work fine (but of course bug you to update all the time).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the problem shows in xfce, GNOME and Budgie (the latter being my case). Seems like every desktop environment is affected (unless others like KDE handle things in a very different way). This has kept us from updating the Skype version for Solus, because
 a constant update notification is less annoying than a broken tray icon.</p>

<p>Hi Kenneth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This made no difference whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since more people are having this issue, I think you guys should really try to find a solution, because it makes Skype the only application that looks like crap in the system tray - not good for business :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a tiny bit of research on this and I think it might be related to an Electron issue.&nbsp; These guys seem to be having a similar problem:&nbsp;https://github.com/meetfranz/franz/issues/233#issuecomment-358488534</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully you guys can reproduce this and solve it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I haven't, but it never looked good with older versions for me either.&nbsp; It was similar to how it looks now, wrong height, all scrunched up in the top there, but it wasn't repeating.&nbsp; Now it starts to repeat the icon and it looks even worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By older version I'm assuming you mean "new skype, old version", so like 8.x, and not skype 4.x...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's another funny thing, when I change the status, I start to get some funny green stuff below the icon which doesn't go away until I restart skype... as if it's starting to show the next image from a sprite or something.</p>

<p>Yes, all versions before 8.20.76.1 work fine, every version after that (including 8.20.76.1) shows the issue.</p>

<p>Have you tried the newest version (8.20.76.8)? I saw the same thing before, but I can't reproduce it anymore with the new version. Well, it's not the main problem anyway.</p>

<h2>            My PC is messed up after latest windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>After updating the latest windows 10 update my computer is having severe problems. Sometimes only the task bar is visible but the start button will not operate. Sometimes the start screen flashes on and off. I tried bringing it back to an earlier version
 as suggested on a mocrosoft advice chat but when I tried to recover nothing happened. I went through a series of steps to get to reset this computer but when I signed in again the same message about taking longer than normal came up. When it completed my computer
 start up screen is flashing off and on again.</p>
<p>My PC was working perfectly well until this upgrade. Totally disgusted at the time spent and the damage done. How do I recolve matters?</p>

<h2>            Error 0x80820002 - Disc spins and stops regularly before giving error message</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>My Xbox One has recently developed an issue where it won't play any discs that I put into the console. When I put the disc in, it will spin for a second and then stop, and this will continue until I get the error message:</p>
<p>"Restart the app, then try again. Make sure you are using an Xbox One game, a music DD, or a movie on Blu-ray or DVD. (0x80820002)</p>
<p>There is no grinding noise, and the disc is not damaged when I then eject it.</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated as it's very annoying not being able to play my game discs - my downloaded copy of FIFA works absolutely fine.</p>

                    <p>Original Title - Mail App Error 0x80070490</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of Thursday the 12th, Mail app won't sync on multiple win 10 machines.&nbsp; App updates on windows 10 mobile, and Outlook.com shows up-to-date email.&nbsp; Both machines (one home and one at work) stopped syncing on that day.&nbsp; Other accounts added to the app (one
 gmail, one an exchange account for work) function without issue and update/sync as expected.&nbsp; Only the Hotmail account refuses to update and returns the 0x80070490 error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook 2016 installed on one of the machines also works fine with the Hotmail account added.&nbsp; Only Hotmail in the win 10 mail app are non-functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how to fix this?</p>

            <p>My apologies, I thought I had replied to this the day after posted.&nbsp; The windows trouble-shooter did not provide any answer.&nbsp; As mentioned, this occurs on three different machines so it is hard to imagine the same thing happened on all three.&nbsp; Particularly
 because one of them didn't exist until after the issue started.&nbsp; The other is that the app itself was working as other accounts added to the app did not experience the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot remove the account and reinstall as recommended in the second option as there is no option.&nbsp; Apparently if the Microsoft account is primary, then it can't be removed, so this is a solution proposed without understanding how the mail app works.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The privacy switches are already at the suggested positions.&nbsp; I had actually tried these before posting, but I re-examined to double-check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, today, after about 10-days of not working, the account seems to be syncing again, at least on one machine.&nbsp; I will check the others. as I said, other accounts have not experienced the issue so it is definitely something with syncing MS accounts
 in the mail app.&nbsp; Surprisingly gmail, and exchange work without issue.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Console Lock Timeout &#40;60 seconds&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My computer (Windows 10 Pro, Build 1709, 16299.371) just changed its behavior yesterday. After 60 seconds of inactivity it turns off the screen and then locks it so when I wake it up I have to enter my password again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power settings are 30 minutes DC, 60 minutes AC. Screensaver is set to "None" with no timeout specified.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp; Subgroup GUID: 7516b95f-f776-4464-8c53-06167f40cc99&nbsp; (Display)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; GUID Alias: SUB_VIDEO<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Power Setting GUID: 3c0bc021-c8a8-4e07-a973-6b14cbcb2b7e&nbsp; (Turn off display after)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GUID Alias: VIDEOIDLE<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Minimum Possible Setting: 0x00000000<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Maximum Possible Setting: 0xffffffff<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Possible Settings increment: 0x00000001<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Possible Settings units: Seconds<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Current AC Power Setting Index: 0x00000e10<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Current DC Power Setting Index: 0x00000708
</p><p>
</p><p>I have looked everywhere else and can't figure out where else I might be able to change this setting. 60 seconds inactivity timeout is SUPER ANNOYING.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>TWH</p>

            This is what i do to cover all settings cause there are a few places which is super annoying agreed!
<br />
<br />Go to start - settings - personalization - lock screen.
<br />Screen timeout settings make your changes and then still in this screen far right Additional Power settings. Change Plan Settings.
<br />
<br />Then back to Go to start - settings - personalization - lock screen.
<br />Screen Saver settings set to None.
<br />
<br />That should cover you.

<p>Yeah. I did all that already. Several times. Timeout is set to 30 minutes on battery, 60 minutes plugged in. Screen saver is set to "none". I also tried setting the screen saver to "blank" with a 90 minute timeout, just in case. No change in behavior. None
 of this fixes / fixed my problem so far.&nbsp;</p>

            See link below for reg fix.
<br />Make sure you create a restore point before you do this.
<br />So go to start and search 'create a restore point' and then create.

<p>Download update KB4340917.</p>
<p>Guarantee it will give you back control of&nbsp; your energy saving preferences and stop the lock screen after 60 seconds nonsense.</p>
<p>Microsoft keep doing updates that just do not work and cause us problems like this and it takes them&nbsp; months to do anything about it even though they know they have made your computer an irritating mess.</p>
<p>Check your updates and make sure you have this one</p>

    <title>Disable Pinch Zoom - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disable Pinch Zoom</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just bought a Lenovo Ideapad 330 with windows 10. I works well except for the fact that pages keep zooming in and out when I touch the mousepad. I looked at advice given to others with this problem and it doesn't see to work for me because my menu seems
 to be different from that of others. When I go to settings, touchpad, additional settings, I don't have a side-menu with pitch zoom as an option. In fact I don't have a side menu at all. There are buttons, pointers, pointer options, wheel, and hardware, and
 none of them say anything about pitch zoom.</p>
<p>Please help</p>
<p>- Julie</p>

<p>Hello Julie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you with your concern, I'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Confirm which build is currently installed on your device. To check, follow the steps below:</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Press <em><strong>Windows key + R</strong></em>, then type in <strong><em>winver</em></strong>.</li><li>Click <strong><em>OK</em></strong>.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>It would be best if you can send me a screenshot of your touchpad settings. You can use the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13776/windows-use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Snipping Tool</a></strong> to capture screenshots.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, try to perform the steps below and check if you can disable the pinch to zoom feature:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click on <strong><em>Start</em></strong>, search for <strong><em>Control Panel</em></strong> and click on it.</p>
<p>2. Search for <strong><em>Mouse </em></strong>and click on it.</p>
<p>3. In the <strong><em>Mouse Properties</em></strong> window, look for <strong>
<em>Device Settings</em></strong> tab. Click on <strong><em>Settings</em></strong>.</p>
<p>4. On the left side of the window should be an option that says <strong><em>Pinch Zoom</em></strong>, click that and then uncheck the box for<em><strong>Enable Pinch Zoom</strong></em> and click
<strong><em>OK </em></strong>to save changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
        </p>

</p><p>According to a User Guide you may be able to toggle your Touch pad with Fn+F8.</p>

<p>See page 14.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps a better solution would be to get a real mouse.</p>

<p>That's what I'm thinking too - might just get a wireless mouse and be done with it.&nbsp; Never was that fond of the touchpad anyway.</p>
