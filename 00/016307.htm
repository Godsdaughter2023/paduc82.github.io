<h2>            Syncing my Contacts to my Google Pixel Phone</h2>
                    <p>I know that this is probably a simple thing to do but I can't seem to get it to work.</p>
<p>I have been organizing my contact list on my Outlook Email Account.&nbsp; Once Ive completed this, I want to sync it to my Pixel phone.&nbsp; The only problem is, the categories that I put the contacts in are not on my phone.&nbsp; Contacts move but the headings are not
 there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Catherine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's possible that your device does not support the file. For us to better address your Contacts concern, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were you able to sync your Outlook contacts on this device before or this is your first time?</li><li>Were you able to sync your contacts on a different mobile device with no issues?</li><li>Have you already contacted your mobile device provider to check if there are other settings that need to be configured to successfully import contacts?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>

    <title>When double clicking a Visio shape some of the fonts turn to wingdings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john fiar  say:</h3>
<h2>            When double clicking a Visio shape some of the fonts turn to wingdings 2 from Arial</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes when we double click a&nbsp;shape on a Visio page the text font changes to WingDings 2. As an example we have a shape that has a title of EN006 in the top left of it. When I double click the shape we receive the message "The OLE data in this object
 is inherited from a master. Performing an OLE action will create a local copy of the OLE data." Upon clicking OK another window opens and the EN006 title has changed to WingDings 2. We can change the font back but it is an annoyance. Is there an option that
 we can set so that this does not happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>According to the error message, if you use a master shape, the normal shape will be inheritance the format of a master shape.</p>
<p>So I recommend you check your master shape, then we may unlink it or edit it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to remove masters from a document stencil that are no longer linked to shapes on the page, you can display the document stencil and delete them manually.&nbsp;More detail steps please refer to the following link:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to edit the masters , please refer to the following link, we may do it step by step:</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio-help/edit-a-master-shape-HA101827309.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/visio-help/edit-a-master-shape-HA101827309.aspx</a></p>

                    OK, so I can record video/audio, but can't take a simple picture with my either of the onboard cameras in OneNote 2013 on my Samsung Windows 8 tablet? &nbsp;But this feature is available on the much, much more restrictive OneNote "MX" version? &nbsp;Am I missing
 something?

            <p>Nope - I think that's just one of the rare features the MX version has that the 2013 version doesn't.&nbsp; Can you use the tablet's built in camera software to take a picture and then insert that into OneNote?</p>

    <title>Issues with Office 2019 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markmcd58  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with Office 2019</h2>
                    <p>I just bought and loaded Office 2019.&nbsp; As background I have been using Office since 1995.&nbsp; I am getting a couple of very weird glitches.&nbsp; Opening existing files I am being told "Name Conflict" with the dialog box showing a different name than the actual
 file.&nbsp; Will not "take" correct name of file -- even though this filename was working previously&nbsp; for 5 + years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also getting momentary "black screen" flashes when hitting "enter" on spreadsheets.&nbsp; There seem to be numerous threads re this issue but they seem to be closed, so hard to find solutions -- the ones mentioned "update Office, etc" are useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a brand new licensed MS Office -- the fact that it's having these very basic issues out of the box is really annoying -- and it's pretty clear lots of people are having the same issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

<div>Hi <strong>Mark</strong>,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>There may have been some system conflicts that were triggered after making the changes that result to this error. To isolate your concern, we'd like to ask for a screenshot of the said error message when you are opening the existing files. We'd also like
 to verify what is the build and version of your Office. To check, please follow the steps provided on this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/about-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the meantime,&nbsp;<span>I'd recommend repairing
<strong>Office</strong> to diagnose and fix this issue. You may perform the steps presented on this&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>link</strong></a></span><span>.&nbsp;</span></div>

<p>2019 is actually just a version of 365 that was feature frozen back in the Spring of 2018. So "in theory" you should not be having these problems. They should have been worked out by now.&nbsp; But all too often practice does not match theory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do report the full Version and Build number (just in case you are not completely up to date and are not aware of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The name error seems like it could be a registry problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The "black flashes" seems like a video error, a problem between Excel and the Video driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try doing the "standard" trouble shooting process:</p>
<ol>
<li>restart the application (I assume this has been done since problem first appeared)</li><li>restart Windows (again, I assume this has also been done ...)</li><li>Do an Office Repair (see instructions in previous reply)</li><li>Start Excel in "Safe Mode"</li><li>Start Windows in "Safe Mode" then start Excel normally</li><li>Uninstall from control panel</li><li>Uninstall using "Fix It" script (from the article linked to below)</li><li>(last resort) re-pair and/or re-install Windows (very drastic, last resort)</li></ol>
<p>That is the extended "standard" trouble shooting process. Before getting to step 8, for your video problem try some video trouble shooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many mid to upper range computers now have dual video support. The CPU chip has built in "intel" video and they also have a 3rd party video card, ie NVidia, installed.&nbsp; Check to find out which video system is being used by Excel. Try forcing use of other
 one. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Identify the full version number of both of your video drivers.</p>
<p>Go to the video driver web site and see if anyone else has reported same problem, if there is a known fix.</p>
<p>Potentially you may find a newer driver than is currently installed. Try downloading and installing it.

<p>I finally got fed up looking for Microsoft to fix this issue and decided to try the regedit solution and went online to find this again but could not locate this thread until after I had already found another solution that removed
 the /dde from the default string and replaced it with “%1” and changed the name of the ddeexe folder where yours replaces the command string with “%D”</p>
<p>I tried both and when I use the “%D” I was still receiving the warning but the file did open so I went with the other option</p>
<p>Here is the other link in case others need this fix as well</p>

<p>I did this for both entries</p>
<p>Excel.Sheet.12</p>
<p>Excel.Sheet.8</p>

<p>Have been using Excel 2010 for the past four weeks.&nbsp;Today, I went to open Excel&nbsp;documents in My Documents, I received the “<em>problem sending the command to the program”

<p><span>The compatibility mode was set to XP SP 2, so I changed it on both excel and word to Win7 and they are both now working thanks so much this isuse has been killing me.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>

<p><span>This issue may also occur on systems with Dell Data Protection | Security Tools installed. To test if this is the case, Run msconfig and under the services tab, disable the service called&nbsp;Dell Data
 Protection Security Tools Authentication Service.</span></p>
<p><span>Apply and then restart your system.</span></p>
<p><span>Now try to open the Excel file with Excel closed.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;Snip&gt;The problem was not related to the file or its content.&nbsp; I could stop the message by changing the name of the file to end .doc without changing the format of the file content.</span></p>
<p><span>I searched for and found many suggested fixes for the problem ... and none of the fixes worked for me.&nbsp; I eventually fixed the message “There was a problem sending the command to the program” with
 a change in the registry.&nbsp; I edited “HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Word.Document.12\shell\Open “ and deleted the “ddeexec” key.&nbsp; The “ddeexec” key can also be deleted from “HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Word.DocumentMacroEnabled.12\shell\Open”.&nbsp; A similar change may work for earlier
 versions of Word.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>For Word 2013, you can change the registry by right-clicking and saving&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://www.dilloway.co.uk/del-ddeexec.reg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="REG file for There was a problem sending the command to the program"><span>this file ...</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Double-click the file after downloading to update the registry.&nbsp; WARNING ... It is you that knows the situation of your own computer.&nbsp; I cannot know about your computer and cannot be responsible
 for any unintended consequnces.&nbsp; I have tested this process and I am confident that it is safe.<span>&nbsp;

<p><strong><span>******************
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>Basically I needed to be able to run all my macro enabled workbooks as administrator (because for some reason using adobe functionality in macros requires this), so I was not willing too succumb
 to having to run excel manually in Administrator mode every time I wanted to open a file.</span></p>
<p><span>when I changed the default for Excel.exe to always run as administrator, I would be unable to open an Excel file directly. I would either receive the “There was a problem sending the command to
 the program.” Error or Excel would just open with no workbook. Then I would have to select the office button and open the file from within Excel.</span></p>
<p><span>I had a play with a shortcut to my excel file that used the Excel.exe application with the Filename as a parameter...Strangely this actually worked. So I next went into Windows Registry and amended
 all of my parameters for excel files to do this. </span></p>
<p><span>Here is how you can do it in Windows 7/8:</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>1. Allow the excel application to default to Run As Administrator.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>2. Press the Windows Key and R to open the run cmd line ... Type in regedit</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>***Warning</strong> editing Registry Values can cause serious harm to your computer***</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>3. Navigate to the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT directory and locate your excel file extensions</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>NB</strong>: Depending on your version of excel, these might be listed under the extension (.xlsm etc) or at the bottom by file type name (Excel.Macro.Worksheet.12
 etc)</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>4. Navigate to the Shell&gt;Open&gt;Command property and right click on the command value (right hand section) and click modify.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>5. At the end of the line of jibberish you will find a parameter (usually /e). Replace this value with “%D” including quotation marks.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>&nbsp; NB</span></strong><span>: What this does is runs the Excel application with the full Filename and path of the file that you
 have tried to open as the parameter.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>6. Repeat this for all excel extensions that have a Shell&gt;Open&gt;Command property.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>7. Close Regedit, and test out your work by double-clicking on any excel file.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Sercho.</span></p>

<p>I have a Microsoft Word 2016 installed on my computer. Recently, when I was trying to open any .doc file using Word, the whole display has no text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the tool bars could work, but there's no display for any of them, and the text won't display either. It is surely not a hidden text, it must be something wrong with Office</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>I systematically went through every single option disabling things that might effect it, and the dumbest solution and dumbest option for me was simple... . By “toggle”, I mean change current setting, for these 2 or 3 options (depending
 on version) try all of the combinations of the settings on and off. The specific options you see depend on the Office application and its year (2010/2013/2016).

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>This issue is most noticeable on machines with dual video chip sets, ie. video support built into the CPU plus an external graphics card.</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>It didn’t have an immediate effect until I closed and re-opened Word, then it was fine. I unchecked the box and the screen flickered and it was sluggish again until I repeated the steps. The combination of the two options for whatever
 reason seems to have fixed for me.</p>

<p>Another option to try is this: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Try disabling display scaling on high DPI settings</span></strong></p>
<p>by following the steps below:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open your<strong> Office installation folder</strong> and <strong>right-click on the Office app</strong> that has poor scaling issues and select

Click to add Checkmark beside “Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering” <br />

<p>click ok button</p>
<p>Restart the computer to apply this change</p>

<p>PowerPoint 2010 only has the Disable Hardware Acceleration option</p>
<p>PowerPoint 2016 has a second option, “Disable Slide Show Hardware Acceleration”.</p>
<p>One user reported that changing this second setting could enable/disable display of old Flash animations that had been embedded in presentations created in versions prior to PPT 2016.</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<div>
<p>With hardware acceleration disabled, screen renders (drawing) is done using software rendering (WARP) that relies mainly on the CPU and uses limited or no graphics card resources. You can cause a lower frame rate and increase in the
 working set. Performance becomes more dependent on CPU characteristics, like memory, number of cores, and on how many apps are open, and can strain the CPU resources.</p>
<p>On Windows 7, Office animations are disabled. On Windows 8, animations are enabled because of D2D WARP improvements found in Windows 8.</p>

<p>Could you please help me to fix this problem with my phone? Every time I try to log into my mailbox, it says there is an error 80040153 so it cannot synchronize. Also, I cannot use calendar and see photos and other documents stored both on my phone and OneDrive.
 It just kicks me out of there.</p>
<p>I tried restarting, but it didn't help. Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Powerpoint slide narration doesn&#39;t replay</h2>
                    <p>I have recorded a narration for a slide in Power Point. When I replay the narration, I don't hear anything at all. The timer also advances in a weird way during replay: it sticks at zero and then jumps to the last 1-2 seconds of play time for the current
 slide before advancing to the next slide (skipping over my narration?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have double checked that the microphone is configured, picking up sound and playing back in other programs. I can hear other audio through the headphones. The microphone symbol in Powerpoint is turned on. What am I missing?</p>

                    Since I'm pretty much uneducated with the computer age, I've had to depend on others for much of the problems I've had when I'd run into problems with my laptop. Last time here, I'd had a virus that Mast thing and couldn't remove it myself. Ended up taking it in to be repaired a couple towns over,... then began having other problems. I'm back on the Dell again. Had this one worked on as well, and it's been pretty good till the other night. Every time i'd got online, I'd been getting these driver out of date, warnings from Microsoft. Had a guy check into my computer and said I'd had 19 driver that were out of date and needed to replace them. For 32.00 or there about that amount, they installed their software and got all the drivers updated for me.Before we'd began to run the Driver Updater Software, this tech did a systems check on my computer. And he'd even shown me a page with nothing but Red Errors and Yellow warnings on every single file that I'd had in this computer. Is this even possi

            <p>Unfortunately, not very much, Laura. Do know that Microsoft will never call you. And the only messages on your PC about updates should come from the programs themselves (Adobe products, for example) or Windows Update. Drivers are never presented as required
 updates or pop-ups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do remove the Driver Update program. And if you paid for it, either dispute the charge with your bank or credit card and maybe you can get it refunded as you were scammed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then run the scans I suggested, including Malwarebytes.</p>

    <title>Outlook Calendar Invites - Wrong Times on Receiving End - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zac_l  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Calendar Invites - Wrong Times on Receiving End</h2>
                    <p>When I send calendar invites from my Outlook email at work, some items change to 2-4 hours earlier on the receiving end. For example, when I send an invite to a 1:00pm meeting, when I receive the notice on my Gmail it has been changed to 11:00am. The same
 thing happens when I send it to a Yahoo account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem only occurs with events that were added to my calendar from an import. Someone else in the office created a master calendar on their Outlook, which I imported and shows up correctly on my Outlook calendar. But when I send a calendar invite to
 another calendar (Gmail or Yahoo), they show up with the wrong time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have checked for time zone issues multiple times. My Outlook calendar is set to UTC-05:00 Eastern Time (US &amp; Canada). There is no option to check anything for daylight time. My Gmail calendar is set to GMT-04:00 Eastern Time, also no options for daylight
 time. I don't think it's a daylight time issue, because events would be showing 1 hour off, instead of 2-4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Time zones could be the only reason why the events are changing when someone received your Calendar invites. You can try and replicate the concern by setting up an event using the current
<strong>time zone</strong> on your Outlook. Once done, send it to your email address, and then change the current
<strong>time zone</strong> on your Outlook.com or Outlook Mail. You'll see that the time that you've set up in the event that you've created will change as well. Check these articles to learn more about
<strong>Time zone</strong><strong>s</strong>, and how to do so:</p>

<h2>            Error Code 5 &#61; Blue screen of death &#61; expensive Zune paper weight</h2>
                    I have a Zune 80G and loved it.&nbsp; It is about 2 years old and never really had any problems.&nbsp; Just got the Error Code 5, contact support message and from what I gather, reading in the forums, this is unrecoverable.&nbsp; The experts advice on here is always,
 "contact support, here is the link".&nbsp; I think i know what that means, time to hear a sales pitch for a new Zune.&nbsp; Anyone ever recover from the dreaded "Error Code 5"?

<p>Hi KCBosox1975,</p>
<p>Sometimes reinstalling the software&nbsp;on&nbsp;the Zune HD player or&nbsp;restoring the Zune device software is sufficient to fix the issue. It really depends from case to case. By the way, were you able to recover from your error code?</p>
<p>Thank you for posting!</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Why?&nbsp;&nbsp; Specific features please.&nbsp;&nbsp; IE6 I could understand because it is so different but IE7 and IE8 are so similar I can�??t remember anything that is significantly different let alone worse in IE8.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, you aren�??t forced to use IE as your browser;
 you can try installing any other (non-IE) browser and use it.&nbsp; Also, I have never tried them but I understand there are also third-party browser shells based on the same core of IE which simply provide a UI that some find more appealing.</div>

            <p>You cannot install IE7 nor can you downgrade IE8 to IE7 in Win7.</p>
<p>If it's a Win7 64-bit computer, you have two versions of IE8: IE8 64-bit (the default) and IE8 32-bit.</p>
<p>The executable for IE8 64-bit is located here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe</strong></p>

<h3> mrwinniethepooh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Overlapped I&#47;O operation in progesss &#40;0x800703E5&#41; when doing File Explorer &#39;paste&#39; of encrypted file with Windows 10 build 10122</h2>
                    <p>This problem has been mentioned in another thread (which has a misleading title referring to OneDrive). Since the problem actually relates to the use of encrypted file systems and persists in build 10122, it seems better to have a more appropriately named
 thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an encrypted file system. Using FileExplorer, if I try to 'paste' a file into a directory in which there is a file with the same name I get the message "An unexpected error is keeping you from copying the file. ... Error 0x800703E5: Overlapped I/O
 operation is in progress".&nbsp; In particular&nbsp;I am now unable to do&nbsp;"Copy/Paste" of a file (to create a copy of it in the same directory). With an unencrypted file system, File Explorer automatically creates a new file with "- Copy" appended to the file name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is a distinction made between encrypted and unencrypted files? Is this just a bug or is it a deliberate change in functionality? No such distinction was made in WIndows 7.</p>

            <p>This problem seems to be a 100% repeatable issue that it is independent of the location of the encrypted file.&nbsp; I&nbsp; have tried multiple disks and directories - the behaviour is always exactly the same.The steps are trivial to reproduce:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create any file in any folder (it does not matter whether or not the folder is marked as 'Encrypt contents to secure data')</li><li>Using File Explorer -&gt; Advanced Attributes mark the file as 'Encrypt contents to secure data'. (Again it does not matter whether the parent folder is also marked for encryption).</li><li>Using File Explorer attempt a Copy/Paste for the file. (e.g. Right click on file name, select 'Copy'. Right click again, select 'Paste'. Or use equivalent keyboard shortcuts).</li></ol>
<p>A message box appears: "An unexpected error is keeping you from copy the file. Error 0x800703E5: Overlapped I/O operation is in progress"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the file is not encrpyted then File explorer creates a new file with "- Copy" appended to the file name.&nbsp; On Windows 7 there is no such distinction between encrypted and unencrypted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either this is a WIndows 10 bug, or it is a deliberate change in functionality (which I doubt).</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t sync with zune, I was able 2 months ago but not now</h2>
                    Hi, I have the following:<br />
<br />
Samsung Focus with WP7 (of course)<br />
Carrier: AT&amp;T<br />
Latest Zune software running on W7<br />
Original USB data cable<br />
<br />
I have 2 months since my last sync, previously I have configured even the wireless sync with no issues, and now I tried to sync again but my device is not even detected on Zune!, either with USB cable and/or wireless, what can be the problem?<br />
<br />
I prefer not to uninstall then reinstall Zune, but if that is the only solution I'll do it of course.<br />
<br />
Please advice.<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>I am having a similar issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My OS is Sierra Version 10.12.6.&nbsp; MS Office 2016 for Mac version 16.11.1 (180319).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon trying to launch Word or PowerPoint an error message come up.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad628484-0e3a-402a-bd9d-e44a3653b355?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad628484-0e3a-402a-bd9d-e44a3653b355?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I uncheck the Restart Microsoft Word button and click OK, it closes, not allowing me to open the application.&nbsp; This does NOT happen with Excel.&nbsp; I am fully able to work in Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have three other computers in my office running Office 2016 for Mac and neither of them is having this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a big problem because on the affected computer I cannot use the Word or PowerPoint applications.</p>

<p>Hi KA_3710,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please start Mac in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a> and run Word or PowerPoint alone, check if the issue still exists. This may help us determine if the issue is related to incompatible login items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, we’d like to know when did the issue start? After you update Office to 16.11?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Joshua</p>

<p>The wifi is turned off because we do not use it as we are connected through and ethernet cable (and always have been), therefore this solution is irrelevant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have uninstalled MS Office and reinstalled it.&nbsp; The install version was 16.11 (180311).&nbsp; I updated Word and Powerpoint with the 3/19/18 update that was suppose to address this issue (Word &amp; Powerpoint crashing or forcing Microsoft Error Reporting window
 to appear, thus not allowing the app to open). The 3/19/18 update version is 16.11.1 (18031900).&nbsp; No dice - it did not correct the problem.&nbsp; I am still left with Word &amp; Powerpoint not opening but Excel does open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone send me a link that will install a version <em><strong>prior</strong></em> to 16.11?&nbsp; I would like to get back to a previous version so that I can work in Word and Powepoint.</p>

<h2>            Linking One Note to other task folders in outlook other than &#34;tasks&#34;</h2>
                    Hi, I am trying to link all my tasks/goals from onenote into outlook.&nbsp; The issue is when I change folders or drag a task into a new folder in outlook it disconnects with one note and can't be found.&nbsp; So, say if I have a "goals" tab in one note that I want
 to connect all my tasks with but there are multiple catagories as in my case.&nbsp; I create new folders in the tasks section of outlook for each specific category.&nbsp; Now, when I link a task in with outlook by default it goes into the "tasks" folder of the task
 section in outlook.&nbsp; I want it in one of the other folders I created and the only way I seem to be able to do that is to drag it into said folder (ex employment).&nbsp; However, doing this disconnects it with one note, so I can't interact with the task using one
 note.&nbsp; Does anyone know any way around this?

<p>Categories let you group items together. &nbsp;You assign a category basically the same way you would assign a folder. &nbsp;You can make a category for each project or categories for types of tasks. &nbsp;Then you assign one (or more) categories to a task.</p>
<p>Once you've done that you can view your Tasks folder "By Category" you can even set up filters if you want to that only show items from that Category (creating essentially virtual subfolders). &nbsp;You can also search by category.</p>
<p>It does take a little effort to set up, but once it's set up it should run pretty smoothly and it lets you keep all your tasks in a single folder so OneNote has no issues. &nbsp;AND for those time when you want to see your next tasks across ALL projects you don't
 have to try and aggregate 10 different folders.</p>

<h3> harry468  say:</h3>
<h2>            CTRL&#43;SHIFT&#43;ALT&#43;F9 on Mac Excel 2011</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I often use functions written in VBA. They are only calculating, when I edit one field inside Excel and press enter. But this calculates only that one field. When I want to calculate the complete Excelsheet I need a hotkey for calculating all.</p>
<p>The simple CMD+= (equal sign) or F9 (in Windows) only calculates the 'easy' stuff, but not my VBA-functions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Windows there is the Ctrl+Shift+Alt+F9 and this works well in&nbsp;Excel 2010 (for Windows), but I need the same Funktion for Excel 2011 (for Mac).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards Harry</p>

<h2>            Silent Hill Downpour on Xbox 360</h2>
                    Why can't I re-download Silent Hill Downpour on my Xbox 360? I purchased it years ago and after needing a new 360 console I went to download my games and it seems Downpour has been removed from the Xbox live store completely. Do I get my game or a refund?
 Or, am I out of a purchased game AND the money I spent on it? I don't think I'll ever buy a digital game EVER again.&nbsp;

    <title>n95 Outlook synchronization problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hubbers---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            n95 Outlook synchronization problem</h2>
                    I have My Nokia N95 successfully connected to Outlook 2003 on my Windows XP SP2 PC. I am able to synch my calendar items and contacts. I am using Nokia PC Suite version 6.85.14.1.<br />
<br />
BUT ...<br />
<br />
My contact in Outlook do not all appear in my phone menu when I try to make a call.<br />
<br />
AND<br />
<br />
And in my Outlook contacts some of the contact that appear are missing numbers that I have on my phone.<br />
<br />
So I can sync but the sync is incomplete.<br />
<br />
My thoughts on what might be wrong.<br />
<br />
1. are there types of data that don't synch properly? Like number with spaces or similar. Does anyone have a list of bad data types that I could look for. Currently I can't see anything obviously wrong.<br />
<br />
2. Could data on either the phone or sim be non syncable? How do I move contacts from my phone or sim (I can never find this on the n95).<br />
<br />
Is there anything else I should look for or posts that I could look at.
                </div>

            Contact sync happens only between Outlook contacts and contacts in phone memory (Not SIM, that is not supported)<br />
<br />
Do you mean that in one contact, all the details(the contact fields) that you have inserted in Outlook do not syncronise over to phone ?<br />
<br />
It is possible that it is the case, because N95 "contact model" (= what different fields there are possible to ad in one contact) is different compared to Outlook.<br />
<br />
One major difference is that in Outlook, you can only assign 1 mobile number to 1 contact, where as in N95 one person can have several mobile numbers, by default those are: mobile, mobile(home), mobile(work) and additionaly you can rename the field in N95 to
 be something else.<br />
<br />
This all complicates the sync somewhat.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I have max. 5 different type of telephone numbers in one contact and those sync over to N95, providing I have selected the fields to use in Outlook the right way.<br />
<br />
You can make a test contact in Outlook, put a test contact A and add different numbrs to it using the different fields (avoid using "car", if my memory serves me right, that is not synced to N95, not sure though and had no time to test now)<br />
<br />
You will most likely by testing out (and chck also the details of syncrhonisation log after sync, it tells you about "non-supported data i.e. fields that did not get synced) find the right fields to use in Outook (and the phone)

            Thanks that was useful.<br />
<br />
The main cause of the problem after some investigation was that numbers with spaces after them on the phone were not being pushed /pulled into Outlook. I am not sure where these spaces came from (maybe some other sync operation) but they were enough to stop
 Outlook accepting the numbers. It took some time to remove the spaces that were on about a quarter of my numbers.<br />
<br />
The other thing that seemed to cause issues was that if an email address in outlook had brackets i.e.Carl Hubbers this sometimes stopped the address being send to the phone. Perhaps this was also a space issue and the space in the name part of the entry caused
 the problem.<br />
<br />
All in all a lot of work to get it working properly when it should have worked first time around. Poor effort from Nokia in my opinion.<br />
<br />
E-mail removed for your personal safety<br />

            Hi all,<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your posts. Even i faced similar situation where some of my contacts are not fully synched with MS outlook. So i was little bit hesistant to sync my N81-8gb with Outlook. One more issue...Hope some one will help me in this regard.<br />
<br />
Before i stared to sync my new N81-8 gb i selected the option in PC sync settings, In synchronisation Range, i selected From 1 week in the past and 1 month in the future and then i tried to sync the device with MS outlook. But to my surprise, all the entries
 which were there before one week, even that got synched ( which i really donot now to be synched as i selected only 1 week from the past and 1 week in the future). When i saw in my device, all the entries in my outlook were synched to the device. Stragely,
 most of the entries are repeated again and again on the same day (memos, to do are repeated for the same day)..... My PC is Windows xp 32 bit and SP-2. So i have to manually delete all the previous entries everytime....Some one facing similar issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.

            (BTW, a very short period, my sync range is 1 week back and 1 year ahead, any reason why you chose so short period?)<br />
<br />
BUT:if you choose 2 weeks (1 back , 1 for the future), any weekly a other recurring event that you have in your outlook will sync to device, because a recurring event is actually one insident, that happens to have a recurring nature. So if any of the event
 were like that, the end result is as expected.<br />
<br />
I did not get wat you meant by the task showing on every day ? I have a separate task view in my phone and also in Outlook the tasks appear as separate "folder" and then as list with due date ?<br />
<br />
And one more thing: I just added to my Outlook a new contact with tel.number: +(358 (50) 1234567 $<br />
<br />
And of course i can not make a call to that number because it is not a viable number, but it synced to my N95 with no problems. And i just checked, I have many,many numbers in outlook that date back a long time a ago and many have empty spaces and ( and ) and
 those all sync without problems

            I see Rohn007's answered there already, and really, that's the best place to follow up. &nbsp;Since the issue (and all the others) goes away when you disable the driver, it seems pretty clear that the driver's not compatible with Win8.
<div><br />
<div>I would check for updated video drivers for your video card or, if it's a desktop computer, even consider replacing the card, if the manufacturer of the one you have isn't supporting it with Win8 drivers.</div>
