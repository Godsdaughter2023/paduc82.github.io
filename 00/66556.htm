    <title>mouse and keyboard frequently locks up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drjohn74  say:</h3>
<h2>            mouse and keyboard frequently locks up</h2>
                    <p>I'm running a Surface Book with windows 10 8GB ram, 125GB drive and i5. My problem, the mouse and keyboard frequently locks up for a few seconds to several minutes, however the touch screen still works so I can get around whatever I'm working on. I've tacked
 to a service rep - had me download and re-install win 10, no joy. updated all drivers, no joy. I think this is the 1st gen book and know they had a lot of problems, but haven't found anything concerning my issues. I bought it used and it works great except
 for this problem.&nbsp; Any thoughts on how to fix this issues?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for any&nbsp; help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for your help but it did not help. To say that I am frustrated wound do an grave injustice to the word!! I have been dealing with this since I bought this machine! I spoke with tech support several months ago and the tech, who was out of country
 AND VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND, told me to reinstall/repair the os. I did this to no avail and the problem slowly progressed. I am beginning to believe that this is a hardware problem , as I have read of multiple problems with this generation of Surface
 Book on several forums. I am also a component level&nbsp; electronics tech of many years. I am very tired of dealing with this problem and have done exhaustive research and have not found a suitable repair or solution. I truly love this platform and propose a hardware
 upgrade as a solution.&nbsp; of course I would consider a reasonable upgrade fee due to the generation of this notebook. Otherwise, I am inclined to go back to Toshiba as I have had MANY of their business tablets over the years.&nbsp; Also, I would be more inclined
 to inform the public at large of the unwillingness of Microsoft to stand behind there product.&nbsp; Don't get me wrong, I have owned many Microsoft devices over the years and while working in computer retail, putting myself through under and graduate school, I
 have sold thousands of dollars worth of Microsoft hardware and software products. I truly hope that we can come to a satisfactory solution for both parties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Also, the delays in dealing with this issue is due to multiple auto accidents resulting in, as of this date, 9 spinal and hand surgeries. Also if this weighs in your decision, I am a 9.5 year naval veteran (where I earned my electronics degree).</p>

<h3> confusedpc  say:</h3>
<h2>            802.1x save credentials is greyed out on Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I&nbsp;have no problem logging into wireless anywhere around the world. Except the building in which I now work. Somehow their wireless triggers my computer to try to log on using Computer Authentication instead of User Authentication. They tell me this is
 a windows 7 issue that does not appear with other users running window 8 or 10. It is a Radius Server if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can click on Manage Wireless Networks-&gt; Properties -&gt; Security and see WPA2-Enterprise and AES. Authentication is by PEAP. "Remember my credentials" check box is ticked "yes". Advanced Settings always shows up as "Computer or User Authentication". Authentication
 Method is EAP-MSCHAP-v2. Configure always shows up as "Automatically use my Windows logon name..." with check "Yes".</p>
<p>
</p><p>And so it fails to connect. Workaround is to change the MSHAPv2 Properties to uncheck that box. Then go to 802.1x settings and change to User Authentication. And "voila!". It correctly prompts me for my username and password and I can log on no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until I reboot. Next time up I have to do all of this again. In particular, it for sure is not remembering my set up. One particularly odd feature is that on the 802.1x settings the option to "Save Credentials" is greyed out. I do not have any group policies
 on my computer that might be enforcing that. I've looked through the registry for something that might help, but failed so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions (other than upgrading to Windows 10)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p />

                    <p>I recently upgraded my motherboard and CPU, and it broke my windows genuine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've ran the troubleshooter and clicked on the "I've changed hardware" button, and it just times out on a error.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Unable to activate windows</strong></p>
<p>We can't reactivate Windows as our servers aren't available right now. Wait for a few minutes or try adding your Microsoft account again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 home license was purchased though the Windows store, and is tied to the account I am currently logged in as.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd also tried the product key i acquired though ProduKey, and that just says it cant be used on this copy of Windows.</p>

<br />This is a well reported problem, since your licence is a retail licence, your only option is to contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10 licence

            <p>I've been having this same problem on one of my computers for over 2 weeks. Then the other day, I got a Windows Update on my second computer and now the problem is on both: great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When searching from the Start menu or Cortana it always says "Search is getting ready" and does not return complete results.</p>
<p>E.g. it can't find a .exe file in my Downloads folder; it can't find a shortcut to the same .exe in my Start menu; and it can't find anything in Settings like 'Windows Update' or 'Advanced Startup', which always worked in Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open Settings and try&nbsp;to search, I get no results at all and the message "Search results aren't quite ready yet, but we're working on getting them together. Try again in a few minutes."</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no exclusions in my indexing settings as mentioned by previous poster. Both my Downloads and Start menu folders are apparently indexed, as well as .exe and .lnk files. And the problem mentioned by the Support Engineer does not apply and should
 have been fixed by KB3081424 on 8/5/15 anyway.</p>

            <p>None of the fixes I have seen worked. However, I have a dozen computers in a dozen configurations.&nbsp; Search works on some but not on others.&nbsp; But this is what I found out.&nbsp; I had been using Classic Shell/Classic Start&nbsp;on my Windows 8 computers to get the
 start button back.&nbsp; On those machines Windows 10 search still works.&nbsp; I added Classic Shell on this Windows 10 computer and despite the Windows search box saying "We're getting ready . . ." the Classic search box works and I can get back to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Three machines where Classic Start bypasses&nbsp;the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Pro, x64, upgraded from Windows 7 Ultimate, x64. AMD-8 processor, Radeon 7460G graphics chip. (HP Pavilion dv7-7715nr)</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro, x86, upgraded from Windows 8.1 Pro w/Media Center. Intel Dual Core 5200. (Dell)</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro, x64, upgraded from Windows 8.0 Pro, Intel i7, 3630QM (HP).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first thought maybe the upgrade path had something to do with it since the 8.x upgrades seemed to work better than the 7.x upgrades.&nbsp; But's it's random across x86, x64, Dell, HP, ASUS and Toshiba, Pro, and Home Premium platforms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Classic start can be found on ninite.com.&nbsp; Great site if you're setting up a new PC.</p>

            <p>I'm having this problem now, same as Tobias - even after rebuilding index, I can't get searches inside Settings to do anything other than give me the "Not quite ready" message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a new local user and tried that - after a couple of minutes, it worked fine, so it looks like something has got corrupted in my own user profile and I have no clue how to fix it.</p>

            <p>I've got the same problem as Andy Eff. When I try to search in Settings I get the message
<em>'Search results aren't quite ready yet, but we're working on getting them together. Try again in a few minutes'</em>. Well the second part is not true as how ever many times I try I just get the same none result. I've tried the troubleshooter and the fix
 mentioned by Viper AFK <a href="http://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/1267252-windows-10-no-searchresults-from-control-panel-or-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>&nbsp;both with no luck. Search in Control Panel works fine&nbsp;but the Search Box suffers from the same problem. If I try searching for a file I can see in Windows Explorer it comes up with the same message. Searching in Windows Explorer works just fine. This
 is only a problem on my desktop PC which I've only just updated to Windows 10 (Version 1511 Build 10586.17). Searching in Settings and Search Box work fine on my laptop (Build 10586.14).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the so-called 'finished product' rolled out 5 months ago I can't believe there are so many bugs in Windows 10. This looks like a major bug to me and Microsoft really should have sorted it by now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only clue I have is that when I did the update Windows 10 from Windows 7 it gave a temporary profile which it later&nbsp; converted to a profile which uses my Microsoft account.</p>

            <p>After my last post I re-indexed my files - still getting the same error message. In desperation I went to Windows Update and found a new build available (v1511 build 10586.29) so I installed it and I still got the same error message.
</p>
<p>This evening, however, I find that all is working as intended so maybe an extra reboot was needed after the installation of 10586.26 to kick start Search in Settings and the Search Box?</p>

            <p>Sadly did not cure the issue here, despite the update and two reboots at various times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resigned to the fact that I'll have to re-create my profile to get it working, which I'm really not wanting to do again after already migrating from Windows 8 and then doing a full, clean install. Even copying AppData and various snippets of registry entries,
 it's still far too painful to migrate a variety of applications and their settings across between user profiles :(</p>

    <title>How to get Windows 7 to re-detect partition size&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> huang_a  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get Windows 7 to re-detect partition size&#63;</h2>
                    I installed Windows 7 after I got my Win741 license, but at the time, my disk space was being consumed by school projects so I only chopped 32GB of space to my BootCamp. After semester ending, and removing a lot of content from my HD, I now want to allocate
 more space to my Windows 7 partition.&nbsp; I moved the contents and boot records off of my bootcamp partition, resized it, and copied things back, and everything works until I see this:<br />
http://ow.ly/i/h15<br />
<br />
Note the drive identifies partitions of ~50GB for Windows boot camp, and ~100GB for Mac, but Windows explorer (and command line) all says ~32GB.
<br />
<br />
Short of re-installing Windows and everything on it, is there any way of getting the system to re-detect the partition size its in?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
Andy

<p>Hi Andy,<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</p>
<p>I would suggest you to look whether the hard drive is working fine under the Disk Manangement.</p>
<p><strong>Unreadable</strong><br />
The Unreadable status occurs when either a basic or dynamic disk is not accessible. The disk may have experienced hardware failure, corruption, or I/O errors. The disk's copy of the system's disk configuration database may be corrupted. An error icon appears
 on disks that display the Unreadable status.<br />
Disks may display the Unreadable status while they are spinning up or when Disk Management is rescanning all of the disks on the system. In some cases, an unreadable disk has failed and is not recoverable. For dynamic disks, the Unreadable status usually results
 from corruption or I/O errors on part of the disk, rather than failure of the entire disk. You can rescan the disks (click Action and then click Rescan Disks) or restart the computer to see if the disk status changes.</p>
<p>Visit the following links for more information:<br />

<p>If this does not help, perform a <strong>Repair install</strong> and check if you can get the space required.</p>
<p>An in-place upgrade is also named a repair installation. This operation reinstalls Windows to the same folder on your computer where it was originally installed. You may want to perform an in-place upgrade if your installation of Windows must be repaired
<br />
<br />
<strong>HOW TO PERFORM AN INPLACE UPGRADE OR REPAIR INSTALLATION</strong></p>
<p>If you have the Windows 7 DVD, you can attempt a Inplace Upgrade (Repair) on Vista - this will not work if all you have is a Windows Recovery DVD.<br />
If you do not have the Windows 7 DVD and only have the Recovery Media, do you know someone who has the exact same Version of Vista as you that has the Vista DVD?&nbsp; If so, borrow their DVD but do "not" use their Product key, use yours if asked for a product key.&nbsp;
 If you do not have or cannot get a Vista DVD, the steps below will not work with the Recovery media and you may be forced to do a Clean install.</p>
<p><strong>Repair Installation:</strong></p>
<p>You may reinstall your copy of Windows 7 while keeping your files, settings, and programs by performing a repair installation or an in-place upgrade with the following steps: (Note:&nbsp; This does not always resolve all issues, especially if the corruption was
 caused by a 3rd party program or service, you might need to do a clean installation if this is unsuccessful.)<br />
&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; <br />
Please make sure you Backup any and all important data before proceeding. Please see: Methods for backing up your files.<br />
Always make sure you have the means to reinstall your programs, either through an install disk or having access to the installation files.<br />
&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Insert the Windows installation disc into your computer's DVD or CD drive. You must start Windows installation while running your existing version of Windows.</p>
<p>2. On the Install Windows page, click <strong>Install now.</strong></p>
<p>3. On the <strong>Get important updates</strong> for installation page, we recommend getting the latest updates to help ensure a successful installation and to help protect your computer against security threats. You will need an Internet connection to get
 installation updates.</p>
<p>4. On the Type your product key for activation page, we strongly recommend that you type your 25-character product key to help avoid problems during activation.</p>
<p>5. On the Please read the license terms page, if you accept the license terms, click
<strong>I accept the license terms.</strong></p>
<p>6. On the Which type of installation do you want? page, click <strong>Upgrade </strong>
to begin the upgrade. You might see a compatibility report.</p>
<p>7. Follow the instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following settings will be reset to default:</p>
<p>Computer Sound Scheme</p>
<p>Device Drivers</p>
<p>Visual Effects</p>
<p>Windows Mail</p>
<p>Windows Services</p>
<p><br />
If you notice files missing after the upgrade look in the following folders:</p>
<p>C:\Windows.old</p>
<p>C:\$INPLACE.~TR</p>
<p>C:\$WINDOWS.~Q</p>
<p>These files can be cleared with disk cleanup as "Files discarded by Windows upgrade".</p>
<p>Delete files using Disk Cleanup</p>
<p>Check if you can re-allocate the disk space as required.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

<p>Has anyone heard of a law suit against Microsoft for the Perfect Circle Scratch known defect in the Xbox 360?&nbsp; I know no individual will sue over a $50 game, rather this should be a class action lawsuit.&nbsp; If anyone is interested in a class action please
 let me know.&nbsp; I am not an attorney just an angry father that has a son that does not move the Xbox but the circle scratch happens.&nbsp; Not fun having to spend $$ on a replacement game for a disappointed son.&nbsp;

<p>The perfect circle is often caused when someone moves the xbox while the disc is in use so i wouldn't recommend suing a multi- billion dollar company but if you want to sue them then good luck man</p>

<p>it can also happen when the disk is not set in right or moving the console this is why educating your kids &nbsp;is important on disc care</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this specially happens when the child doesn't look at the disc tray and just drops in the disk</p>
<p>or when another disc is already in and 2 discs are in the drive</p>
<p>&nbsp;this is also why gamestop disc replacement warrenties are so popular</p>
<p>due to lack of care</p>
<p>if you want a disc replacement you can either contact the publisher but it usually costs 20bucks or if you feel the console did it then if you are in warranty then you can call support for a repair or pay 120dollars for out of warranty repair (this is what
 extended warranties are for wear and tear)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is why most parents are smart and buy disc coverage</p>

<p>thats old news and unless you have a gen 1 xbox 360 </p>
<p>there is a rubber stoper and unless there is MULTIPLE scratched disks its doubtful the console did it</p>
<p>in the case of multiple scratches disks you will have to call support and if it is over 1 year old pay 100dollars for a console repair due to wear and tear
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and you'll need to prove that your child actually put the disk in correctly</p>
<p>(video proof if you want to even start with good evidence)<br />
if the console is standing horizontal i recommend puting it flat</p>

<p>slow down and put the disc in correctly</p>
<p>if its constantly happening on multiple disks what you need to do is then repair your console if it is out of warranty (this is why we suggest yoiu have a stable surface ) it will cost you 100dollars then buy a service plan from xbox this prevents huge costs</p>
<p>after a paid repair you get a 1 year warranty plus whatever service plan </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>no company will cover wear and tear beyond 1 year for under 500dollars this includes laptops</p>

<p>My son is fairly responsible, but he does error, but putting in a disc into a game console, well I think he has mastered this task, so I don't think that is the problem. &nbsp;I would think it was my son's problem until I researched this issue and see the huge
 volume of this problem out there.</p>
<p>There is nothing to repair on my Xbox; it is operating just as MS designed, to scratch disks. &nbsp;What would MS do, just install another drive that has the same design defect. &nbsp;Not worth the time.</p>
<p>The issue here is an engineering defect. Our Xbox is less than a year old. &nbsp;I also have a Wii and Nintendo figured out how to make a game consol that does not scratch disks. &nbsp;In fact, pretty much every car has a disk player in it that can handle pretty serious
 bumps in the road with out skipping a beat let a lone not scratching disks. &nbsp;Many even cheep boom boxes have disk player in them that can handle movement.</p>
<p>Gee, let me enlighten MS then, you are making a game console that kids will be playing, therefore designing an egg shell disk player was probably not the most intelligent thing to do. &nbsp;Also, basically everybody else in the world has figured out how to make
 a disc drive unit better, less fragile and less sensitive to movement. &nbsp;MS figure it out and own up to your obvious design flaws and take responsibility. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, you are right no company will cover out of warranty problems...willingly. &nbsp;That is why I wish some motivated (money grubbing) attorney would pick up on this and start a class action lawsuit. &nbsp;This seems like a pretty obvious made to order situation
 for an attorney. The Xbox product does not meet reasonable levels of merchantibility or practice standards which generally superceeds MS's corporate Caveat Emptor approach to the consumer.</p>
<p>Many companies have had to accept and fix problems out of warranty when it is shown that there was a material design flaw in the product. &nbsp;Warranties are generally for individual defects such as manufacturing flaws. &nbsp;But when a product works as designed
 and the design is defective, courts have routinely ruled that the companies need to fix the design flaw and then offer the repair to their customer base.</p>
<p>Believe me I am not holding my breath with MS, just look at most all of their other products...like Windows, need I say more.</p>

<p>It should be noted that it's not MS who make the disc drives. A class action suit would also fail because the defence would point out if this was a manufacturing defect why is it only affecting certain users instead of everyone who owns the console? It's
 also been well known for years that moving devices that use lasers like DVD players, laptops et al with discs in the drive isn't going to end well for the discs.</p>

<p>im in england and they tried looking into this on a programme called watchdog(a consumer rights programme) a long time ago.they did loads of independent tests and found it was mostly caused by having the console upright and it being knocked or moved while
 in use.any lawsuits they tried to pursue &nbsp;failed due to it being the "users" fault.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Most printers that work with Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 will work with Windows<br />
10. And virtually all printers sold today will work.<br />
<br />
If you are trying to print in Edge Browser use CTRL + P or click the little 3 dots in<br />
the top right corner (under the "X" then - Print.<br />
<br />
As OEM&nbsp;the Printer Maker is responsible for the proper operation of the printer <br />
and their&nbsp;supplied drivers. Check with&nbsp;the Printer Maker's&nbsp;Support, their on-line
<br />
documentation and&nbsp;drivers, and ask in their forums.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available driver.<br />

<p>As far as I can recall, such dialing prefixes are not supported by Skype. This leads me&nbsp; to believe the disabling of such symbols during initial dialing (in the latest versions) are intentional. Whatever the case, to control Caller ID, you would enable or
 disable it in your Skype settings.</p>

    <title>Surface touch screen stuck right clicking Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lann094  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface touch screen stuck right clicking Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>EDIT: I noticed the first paragraph was removed from my post. Basically I'd been having this issue on my Surface Pro 3 for a few months in the tech preview, but it seemed to go away after going to official release. It's happened maybe twice since release
 on my Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I've just upgraded my girlfriend's Surface 3, and she says she has the same problem very regularly. It's obvious touches are being detected as right clicks as jump lists open on the task bar, and the touch indicator is a square.<br />
<br />
<br />
Performing an actual right click does not fix it, nor does locking and unlocking the device. Pen inputs are shown, but have no effect during this either. The only foreseeable method of fixing it is a restart.<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't found any other posts on this issue, but the fact it's affected both of us is very strange. I can provide video of the issue if needed.
<br />
<br />
<br />
I do hope someone has some insight into how to solve this problem. Thanks.</p>
<p />

            <p>redfearnb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The KB&nbsp;3093266 is the update the contains the fixes. You should also make sure your version of OneNote is updated. &nbsp;OneNote 2013 and OneNote 2016. &nbsp;Select File/Account/Check for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has fixed the Touch tap right-click. &nbsp;There appear to be at times ink issues disappearing still. &nbsp;I +1 for closing the thread as the touch tap right-click looks solved. &nbsp;If anyone is still having it they should contact support and potentially start a
 new thread as it might be a different situation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are links for the offline installers for the update. &nbsp;Give this a try.</p>
<p>32-bit OS:&nbsp;http://download.windowsupdate.com/c/msdownload/update/software/crup/2015/09/windows10.0-kb3093266-x86_bd8d24aa395995b640427db646da69e88ecdbf4c.msu</p>
<p>
</p><p>64-bit OS:&nbsp;http://download.windowsupdate.com/c/msdownload/update/software/crup/2015/09/windows10.0-kb3093266-x64_6751b43720389771ff946993ed0def5a7ec4acc3.msu</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you are a member of a domain worst case scenario the domain with Windows Update Server is holding back the update. &nbsp;You have a problem with your IT guys holding you back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if anyone performs a Windows 10 upgrade from Windows 8.1 using Windows Update you will not see the KB&nbsp;3093266 in your Windows 10 Windows Update history. &nbsp;Windows Update upgrade to Windows 10 has some of these streamlined into the installer. &nbsp;That threw
 me off for about 3 reinstalls because I could not find the update. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you manually run the offline installer it will tell you if the updates have already been installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, run the "Surface App" and make sure it works correctly. When I was installing a fresh install of Windows 10 from USB the Surface App would not find the pen yet the pen actually did work. &nbsp;Only upgrading from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 was I able to
 maintain the Surface App working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd also make sure to unroll any of the temporary fixes you may have tried from these threads. &nbsp;When I saw the news I choose to rebuild my surface to give it a fresh start at having the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My story.... but maybe something to help. Good luck. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Kernel-Event Tracing&#47;Event Log&#47;Errors - Homegroup Log failed to start.</h2>
                    I hope this is the proper place to put this.&nbsp; I'm getting this error in my event logs every time I have to restart my computer.&nbsp; Specifically, Homegroup Log failed to start, and within the event logs it shows up as "Kernel-Event Tracing log error.&nbsp; There
 is nothing wrong with my homegroup though, as I can see all of the other systems located throughout my house and each have access to one another.&nbsp; Errors in my logs have always bothered me :), and I would be very grateful if someone could help me out with
 this.&nbsp; Thank you.<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way, this error is happening on multiple computers within the Homegroup, so it is not confined to one machine having the difficulty.&nbsp; This error however is not having an impact (as far as I can tell anyway) on the performance of my system.<br />

            Ok, I'm just adding a bit here to mention the POSSIBLE work a round/fix or whatever you want to call it for my original problem.&nbsp; As I mentioned in the previous post, the system(s) have not displayed the error any more for many days now.&nbsp; I believe that
 it is because I restructured the HomeGroup and made sure that I created the homegroup with my desktop which stays ON almost all of the time.&nbsp; So in other words, I think the problem originated from the fact that when I set up my wifes new laptop, I initally
 created the homegroup on her computer which she puts to sleep all of the time when she's not using it.&nbsp; The other systems, which are mine, continued to generate the error about the homegroup log, when her machine was in sleep mode.&nbsp; Since I restructured the
 homegroup to make it so my desktop was the system that originally started the homegroup (and it stays on almost 24 hours a day), I haven't experienced the original error.&nbsp; If anyone is experiencing this same ty

Undead Nightmare Collection Problem
<div>
<p>I purchased the Undead Nightmare Collection, which is different from the Undead Nightmare Pack, digitally in the xbox store back in the 2010. The Undead Nightmare Collection (19.99) is a combination of the stand alone game plus all of the other dlcs. 'The
 Pack' (9.99) only includes the stand alone with 2 additional dlcs. The collection was not listed in my xbox one list of downloadable games. After digging through the store, I was able to locate and download it and the separate dlcs free of charge (because
 I own the digital rights). However, upon downloading everything, the game is not listed in my games and apps section of my xbox one. It seems as if the Undead Nightmare Collection is being treated as dlc that needs to be paired with the base game and not the
 stand alone experience that it was advertised as. It had been reported that all versions of the game, digital or physical, are backwards compatible. This is seemingly untrue. I should not have to pay another 10 dollars for what I already own, and I shouldn't
 have to buy the base RDR (9.99/7.49 with gold) in order to enjoy my "stand alone" game. I'm only interested in the multilayer aspect of the game. What is going to be done, if anything at all, to rectify this? As it stands now, this is definitely false advertisement,
 and I should be free to enjoy the product I have already purchased.</p>

<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>Happy to clarify on this. The Red Dead Redemption Undead Nightmare Collection DLC is just that. It's the DLC for Undead Nightmare as well as the Liars and Cheats Pack &amp; Legends and Killers Pack. In order to use the digital version of the Undead Nightmare
 Collection, you would need to own the base game of Red Dead Redemption since this is considered an Add-On and not a stand alone version.</p>
<p>If you own the physical version of Undead Nightmare, you would be able to play the standalone Undead Nightmare campaign and DLC. The differences is that the Disc version is a stand alone experience, while the digital version is an add on to the base game.</p>
<p>I hope this helps to clarify on the differences between the two versions. Also, if you're not seeing the DLC as available in the manage content/ready to install section in Red Dead Redemption. You'll want to verify that you own the license by verifying the
 purchase on <a href="http://www.commerce.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">commerce.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;and if you're not seeing the purchase, please reach out to our chat or phone teams for further assistance in locating it.&nbsp;<span><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us#2:2:2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Contact

            Hi Scuba5teve 
<br />
<br />Boot your system into BIOS
<br />
<br />From there, you may need to turn off Secure Boot
<br />
<br />Then set the USB installation media as top of the boot order list
<br />
<br />Save those settings and restart your system to see if it boots from the installation media
<br />
<br />If that does not work, boot into BIOS, please post the exact version of MSI BIOS you have on your system . . .

            <p>Checked using both methods. No corrupted files or other problem detected. Didn't make a difference, as still keep getting the error messages. Why is this file required in the first place? It is not even a Microsoft application. Any way to remove it from

            <p>Hi Commondorechick01.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your question. Zynga games use flash to operate. Many sites have been white listed to allow for compatibility with the Surface with Windows RT, so most game will work. The performance itself will vary depending on the game you are playing and
 what other activities / apps you are currently running on your Surface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that helps. Please let me know if you have anymore questions. </p>

<p>Hi izhrin,</p>
<p>As adobe has discontinued its services for SVG viewer you will not be able to use the program on windows 7 directly. I would suggest you to contact adobe and check if they have any new program available which can be used in place of SVG viewer.<br />
<br />
You may refer to the below provided support link - <br />
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/support/</a> <br />
Also as a workaround you may try using the mapping program with SVG viewer in windows 7 under Windows XP mode with Virtual PC and check if this helps–</p>

    <title>Audio imbalance after May 10th Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> personsomeone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio imbalance after May 10th Windows 10 update</h2>
                    The audio is skewed toward the right side by a variable amount, I can't manually rebalance because the amount keeps changing and sometimes isn't there even. I tried restarting, updating drivers, using the automatic troubleshooter, changing settings, and
 none of it worked. The headphones I'm using work on other devices, and the problem occurs on multiple audio jacks so I'm basically sure it's not a hardware problem. Can anyone help?

<p>
Im having this issue too. The youtube app, games and home screen are fine but when i launch edge it creates black bars around 2 inches thick all round. I try to remedy this by adjusting scaling on the tv itself but the most zoomed in i can make it with no distortion
 still has black bars. Even if it is on the default edge homepage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there Max!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue concerning Edge. </p>
<p>That does sound like a peculiar issue. Maybe a recent update was interrupted and needs to be redone.
</p>
<p>I would suggest trying what we call a soft reset of your console. <span>
<span>It's a reset of your console back to factory settings but one that does not uninstall any of your games or apps and is a really good troubleshooting step for most issues.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Just
 make sure that before you go ahead with it, that you do know all of the sign-in information for any/all of your accounts</span></span><span><span>(as</span></span><span><span>they
 will be removed) </span></span><span><span>and
 have easy access to your internet network</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">

<h2>            Microsoft wireless mobile mouse 3500 settings don&#39;t work.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Mouse settings don't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a Microsoft wheel mouse optical for several years, and several computers.&nbsp; I had the wheel button set to double-click.&nbsp; The mouse has failed so I had to purchase a replacement.&nbsp; I found a Microsoft wireless mobile mouse 3500, I couldn't find a wired
 mouse anywhere.&nbsp; I downloaded the mouse control center, and set the wheel button to double click.&nbsp; It doesn't double click.&nbsp; The setting is there in the program, the rest of the mouse buttons work ok, but it just refuses to double click even though the program
 says that's how it's set.&nbsp; Windows 7 Home premium, Gateway DX4860.</p>

    <title>Automate Switch User in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hornet31  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automate Switch User in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I would like to&nbsp; automate the Switch User functionality to operate from a desktop icon in Windows 10.</p>
<p>This would mean that upon clicking the icon it would open up a guest account with minimal domain access from a normal users account. (not admin, but both are domain accounts).</p>
<p>The purpose is to allow a staff member to give the device to a client to complete a survey (online) with out giving the staff member the password to the guest account or requiring the staff member to give the client the device logged in under the staff members
 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the client has finished the staff member could then just&nbsp;log out of&nbsp;&nbsp;the guest session and re-login to their own session that would still be running.</p>
<p>I would have to parse both the guest user account name and the password&nbsp; and if possible to keep the password out of visibility.</p>
<p>Any suggestions appreciated</p>
<p>I have looked at TSCON but it needs the guest session active before it will work.
