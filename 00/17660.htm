<h2>            ActiveSync Upgrade missing important features&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot seem to find any of the following features</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1- Connection thru Bluetooth</p>
<p>2- Ability to pick another folder to sync from outlook other than the default (In regards to email, contacts and appointments)</p>
<p>3- Full Backup/Restore</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did microsoft decide it did not want to have these features anymore?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help/work arounds will be appreciated</p>

<p>In WMDC, if you look under Mobile Device Settings and then Connection Settings you will find a drop down where it allows you to set bluetooth.&nbsp; The same is true for version 4.5 of Active Sync if you are not using Vista.&nbsp; Look under File, Connection Settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In regards to email, contacts and appointments, that has remained the same it always has been.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Full Backup/Restores have been from 3rd party vendors although I've had a device in the past that came with a version from a 3rd party vendor.&nbsp;

            I think you are right. You have to wait for next generation Navigator 7, which you can't bye i Denmark yet. I think it is possible to bye Navigator 7 now i Germany. You can try over the Internet.

    <title>Add a macro to Quick Access Toolbar in Powerpoint 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> npanag1961  say:</h3>
<h2>            Add a macro to Quick Access Toolbar in Powerpoint 2016</h2>
                    <p>In my company I was asked for a button in Powerpoint 2016 (in the QAT), to print a specific selected slide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or, somehow, Powerpoint to have as default the Print Current Slide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, PP 2016 doesn't have a Personal Macro file like Excel or Word to store global wise macros that could be linked to a button of QAT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to put such a button to QAT?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>

            Your are correct about no equivalent to Personal.xlsb.
<br />
<br />Below thread has the solution to this problem. You will need to create an Add-in which will be part of Powerpoint. Hence, whenever Powerpoint is loaded, your Add-in will also be loaded and you can add the macro to QAT also.

<h2>            How to disable all annoying Script error pop up messages that started on 08&#47;28&#47;12&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Mid evening on 08/28//12, 'script error messages' started popping up on every website I went to.&nbsp; I have tried at least 8 or 9 fixes that I found posted online and could read after clicking to get rid of the error message over 10 times in order to even see
 the webpage I was on and nothing is disabling these popups.&nbsp; What made these messages begin in the first place and short of shooting my computer screen, I really need a solution for this increasing problem, ir there even is one?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And please don't advise 'disabling in the advanced tab of internet explorer'.....because that tip is useless!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Why is it difficult-to-impossible to edit an Outlook Contact&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom regan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is it difficult-to-impossible to edit an Outlook Contact&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Two very difficult problems with Outlook Contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One, I cannot edit the email address that Outlook chooses to use for an Outlook Contact.&nbsp; When I attempt to edit the email address there is a read-only "Previous Email Address" which remains.&nbsp; When I send an email to this Contact Outlook automatically uses
 this "Previous Email Address" instead of the email address I want it to use.&nbsp; I find the sole workaround is to completely delete the Contact, wait a bit, then re-add it with the new email address.&nbsp; Absurdly, this does not stop Outlook from using the old (bad)
 email address if the Contact is a member of a group.&nbsp; I must go into any groups that the Contact was a member of, drop the old "Previous Email Address", wait a bit, and then add the new Contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two, Outlook automatically created hundreds of inaccurate "links" between Contacts, and arbitrarily decides which of these "links" should receive the email when I send to one or the other.&nbsp; For example, if Outlook decided that "Joe Smith" and "Mary Smith"
 are the same Contact it would create a "Link."&nbsp; Then, when I select Joe Smith to send an email, Outlook sends that email to Mary Smith.&nbsp; I've had to go through my entire Contacts list and manually delete each inaccurate link.&nbsp; Frustratingly, many of them will
 not delete (there is no error message, the "link" simply remains no matter how many times I delete it).&nbsp; For these Contacts the workaround is the same--delete all "linked" Contacts, wait a bit, then re-add them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've posted this issue before, and received a response from an MS support person, which basically boiled down to "hey, its free, stop your whining."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish I'd never created my first Hotmail account years ago, and I wish changing an email address was not an extremely difficult task, because I would love to abandon Outlook.&nbsp; I just want to be able to edit my Contacts, and when I choose a Contact I want
 the email to go to that Contact and not to some phantom "link."&nbsp; I do not understand why MS has made that a&nbsp;<span>time-consuming exercise in frustration.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand distributed data storage, the need for document databases, and etc.&nbsp; I understand why there is a delay between the time I make an edit and the time the edit takes.&nbsp; But I don't understand why you make editing Contact email addresses nearly impossible,
 nor do I understand why your application would automatically create these bogus "links."</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; I'm using Outlook.com (not the desktop app).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Yes and no.&nbsp; The&nbsp;impossibility of editing an email address is common to both Outlook contacts and Contacts that were imported from social media.&nbsp; &nbsp;For the "links" problem, one or other of the inaccurate "links" is a contact that was imported from Facebook;
 however, the contacts imported from FB&nbsp;were linked to non-FB contacts.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; I'm using the latest version of Edge on the latest version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; I'm not using the Desktop app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; I'm not using Office to access my Contacts, but the Windows 10 machine I use has an Office 365 subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp; Everything on my machine is up to date, I have automatic updates turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;have the&nbsp;same problems when I access Outlook.com using Windows 7 and IE 11.&nbsp; This is not a problem with my machine.&nbsp; This is a problem on the MS server.&nbsp; For some reason&nbsp;MS Outlook&nbsp;decided to make it impossible to edit a Contact's email address, and for
 some other reason Outlook decided to create hundreds of bogus "links" between contacts, and for some of those "links" I'm not allowed to delete them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The instructional links you provide are of no help.&nbsp; They do not tell me how to edit a Contact's email so that I can get rid of the old email address; they don't tell me how to get rid of all these bogus links between Contacts.</p>

<p>1. I use Outlook website don't have or know what an Outlook desktop app is. I use the same Outlook that comes on the MSN home page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I have no contacts imported from social media accounts. I just type them in and save them. Then when I try to change them the old one remains and never goes away and always comes up first when I try to use them in email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. How exactly am I supposed to optimize my IE browser?&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Answered already</p>
<p>5. I don't have office I just have Word</p>
<p>6. No updates for no app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Read the support articles and I do what they say and I still have the problem. They are no good to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. So, the question remains, how do I delete an old address and make it disappear, when I add a new one?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft doesn't seem to know the answer to what should be a very simple question.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to delete an old phone address or email contact and make it disappear when adding a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They just keep asking more questions that most of us, who are not technically savvy, have no idea what they are talking about. (If they even know, is more and more doubtful.) It is as if they think by making their questions more and more difficult, we will
 just all go away and leave them alone. And, in fact, that may be what ultimately happens as we all switch our email accounts over to a more user friendly platform.</p>

<p>No, this has nothing to do with the health of your servers, unless your servers have been suffering from ill health continually for several years.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is how you wrote the application.&nbsp; The question is, will you change your application so that users can edit the email address of a Contact and delete unwanted "links" between Contacts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Judging from your responses, all of which appears to be canned, I suspect no human actually read the question, and that all of the "replies" I received from MS were generated by a bot.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This entire MS "Community" reminds me of those "Close Door" buttons inside elevators which are sometimes deliberately left unconnected.&nbsp; You seem to want to give users the illusion that problems are being considered and addressed, by asking for follow-up
 information and so on, but in fact none of these bogus "replies" addressed the two specific questions I asked, nor did you provide any useful information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing an email address is incredibly difficult and time-consuming, so of course I'm going to stay with my Outlook account, but I deeply wish I'd never signed up with you.</p>

<p>The phone is designed to turn off the screen when in a call and the device is held next to your face.&nbsp; Some folks have had it turn off because they are covering it with their hand somehow.&nbsp; I have also seen someone who had a screen protector on and that
 was causing the screen to go off.</p>

<p>Place your phone on a table and make a call.&nbsp; Now,&nbsp;without touching the device, does the call go through and the screen is still on?&nbsp; If yes, then you know that somehow you were touching the Proximity sensor.</p>

<p>I can do the margin change, but I don't understand how to change the table to fit back on one page.&nbsp; If I change the table size how do I keep all the cells the same size and proportional&nbsp; to the original size of the table/&nbsp; It looks like if I change the
 table size manually it only shrinks one row and keeps the other the same size.</p>

            I have tried using Microsoft edge but it still does not work . I don't think it is embedded in any program - it just doesn't work!!!

<p>The first thing to check is if it's enabled in Edge. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On your computer, open Microsoft Edge.</li><li><span>On the top right-hand corner, click the&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fhelpx.adobe.com%2fcontent%2fdam%2fhelp%2ficons%2fMore%2520Info.png" /><span>&nbsp;icon.</span></li><li><span>Click&nbsp;</span><strong>Settings</strong><span>&nbsp;near the bottom of the menu that appears</span></li><li><span>Click&nbsp;</span><strong>View advanced settings</strong><span>&nbsp;under the&nbsp;</span><strong>Advanced Settings&nbsp;</strong><span>header</span></li><li><span>Toggle&nbsp;</span><strong>Use Adobe Flash Player</strong><span>&nbsp;to On</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The next thing we need to check is the Blocked Adobe Flash content puzzle piece. Here's how:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>If you see a <strong>Blocked Adobe Flash content</strong> puzzle piece near the
<strong>Favorites</strong> button, click it, and then select either <strong>Allow once</strong> or
<strong>Always allow</strong> to allow Flash on the page.<br />
</li><li>If you don’t see the <strong>Blocked Adobe Flash content puzzle piece</strong>, but you do see a note to download Flash on the page, click the download link, and Edge should enable the puzzle piece icon so you can follow step #1.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also, we suggest that you refer to this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro4-surfweb/adobe-flash-player-not-working-after-creators/9a43a145-9ae8-4d63-a261-070242aee2ed">thread</a></strong>. See the posts that were marked

<p><span><font color="#000000">Based on your post, you're unable to receive new messages and send as well. Allow me to assist you in addressing both issues.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">There are different reasons why an account cannot send/receive messages. To know what these are, please refer to the details I provided below:</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">A. Reasons for not receiving new messages:</font></span></p>

<p>- <span>Delay notification</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You mentioned on your post as well that colleagues&nbsp;who are sending you&nbsp;emails received a bounce message. I'd like to know if this only happens to particular senders/contacts?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Can you also ask the information from the bounce message that one of your colleagues received for it will provide us information why the issue is happening. These details are as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">• Final-Recipient:<br />
• Action: failed <br />
• Status:<br />

To gather these details, he/she needs to view the full message header of the email. To get this, right-click on the unopened message from the message list then choose
<strong><span>View message source</span></strong> option.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Furthermore, please post your affected email account in the private message area I have for you so that we can check it on our end. You may also include the details from the bounce message. To view it, please sign in using a Microsoft account and click&nbsp;
<strong>Private Messages</strong> tab across <strong>All Replies</strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, the possible reason why you don't have any saved sent emails is that you must have not enabled the said feature on your account. To check on this, please refer to these steps:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Do you have any other ideas???</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>First - please disengage your CAPS LOCK when typing - no need for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second - you wouldn't see the &lt;Map Custom Fields&gt; button since you never got that far into the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, whatever the problem is lies with the construct of the CSV file itself which is impossible to determine without access to the file. Initial guess is that it is in someway related to the header row and second guess is that the you have multi-line fields
 that have not been properly bracketed OR fields that contain multiple text/field qualifier characters (i.e. numerous unqualified double-quote characters as a for instance).</p>
<p>
</p><p>One quick test we run to check very problematic csv files is importing them into an MS Access database and looking at the errors - there shouldn't be any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, can absolutely guarantee that whatever the problem is, it's related to the CSV file itself and not the Outlook import process. Have yet to encounter a case where Outlook doesn't properly import a clean .csv file and can assure you I've gone through
 the process countless numbers of times with all different files submitted by customers over the years using every version of Outlook. If there's one legitmate complaint that can be made about the Outlook .csv import process is that the error messages generated
 are "less than informative" (to put it mildly).</p>

<h3> vitezslav zurek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 start menu search ignores search indexer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I may have not understood the new windows 10 search field. It looks like it's capabilities are strangely limited and the start menu search in windows 7 found a lot more things then this one :o&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why doesn't typing a filename, clicking "my stuff" find a file which is in the indexed folders? I have added one folder into indexing options a long time ago and still this start menu search does not find it. Although when I go to my computer and search
 for that file in the right top search field it finds it! Why is start menu search limited? It seems like it looks only to those default fodlers like documents and desktop and ignores indexing options. Is that right? Why is that so?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community and Welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that you are unable to find a specific file by its name in the search field in Windows 10, as it used to in Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that in Windows 10, typing a word or phrase in the search field will give&nbsp;a list of suggestions. You can do the same thing by clicking the Search icon, but in that case Windows also displays recent and trending searches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend you to type the shortcut key Windows Key + S from the keyboard, and see if it gives the desired search results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, I recommend you to follow the below suggested methods and see if it helps.</p>

 In Windows 10, even with the location indexed, searching in the Start Menu returns no results for installed applications which just have a shortcut.

</p><p>But still there are files which can't be found using this search field. It is really weird, because the file I was looking for and did not find last time now CAN be found and appears in block Documents / this device! It is a txt file in&nbsp;c:\GDrive\dokumenty\Texty\.
 But I CANNOT find other txt files in the very same folder! :o Interesting.<br />
</p>
<p>I can find all the files using search field in the top of explorer window BUT I have a feeling that the indexer somehow does not work at all, because it takes minutes to find something as it does not use the index. Even when I look for the file I CAN find
 in the bottom search box / my stuff it takes long time before it appears in the results. In windows 7 when I was searching it first looked at the indexed locations and showed results quickly and then I could click search again in non-indexed locations. (if
 I remember it right), but here I don't see "indexed locations" in results. Any thoughts?<br />
</p>
<p>UPDATE: It seems pretty broken, because if I search for a string&nbsp;_backupplan, it shows me webtodo.txt, but in this file there is no "_backupplan" string present, so I have no idea why it appears in results. But the file&nbsp;C:\GDrive\aaaveci\_backupPlan.txt
 which I was looking for is not shown in the search results...</p>

<h2>            N70 - accidentally bypassing the LockCode</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
This post was originally added to the Connectivity board but was probably in the wrong place so I have deleted it (no responses) and moved it here instead..<br />
<br />
<br />
I have looked through a number of the threads and also searched on a few relevant terms (N70, S60, Bluetooth, Lockcode etc...) but could not see anything relevant, so..<br />
<br />
I have a Nokia N70, bought from an Orange retailer in December 2006.<br />
<br />
As I drive a lot I also purchsased a Jabra BT250 Bluetooth headset.<br />
<br />
As I am security aware, I also have a userlock on my phone that kicks in after 10 minutes of inactivity.<br />
<br />
In normal use and when in the car, I receive an incomming call, I accept it using a button on the headset or on the phone, talk, chat etc... then hang up. This works whether the userlock is active or not (as expected)<br />
<br />
What is NOT expected is that after the call completes and even if the userlock is active I can then navigate through my contacts, texts, emails, the whole phone menu system; either immediately after or after about 20 minutes or so.<br />
<br />
The only thing I CANNOT do is turn the phone off - If I try to do this it either a) Locks the phone controls and I have to remove the battery, or b) prompts for my lockcode first (to unlock the phone then I have to press the power off button again)<br />
<br />
Any advice \ pointers to existing relevant threads would be useful (or even confirmation that I'm not the only one suffering this).<br />
<br />
One other minor issue I have also found (but think I know the reason why), if I am paired with the headset or another device If I attempt to send a photo \ file \ text by bluetooth to another user (searched for and found), the phone typically locks up afterwards.
 Cheers<br />

            This isn't only when the headset's connected, though it may only be that so far...<br />
<br />
I also use a Jabra headset, though the 250V - fantastic aren't they? lol<br />
<br />
I've had endless problems with the lock, and it locking up, having to reboot, it was fixed with a firmware update a while ago, but it's got even worse now.<br />
<br />
You could try updating your firmware, though make sure you've got everything backed up first.<br />
<br />
This has got so bad for me I'm changing phones... well, when the N95 is released... wish that was sooner though.

            Firmware is at the latest version.<br />
<br />
After reading a few more posts, it could be that the issue was known about for quite a while (Series 60 issue affecting N70s and N80s).<br />
<br />
Orange told me I couldn't buy the N80 due to the OS error but let me buy the N70.<br />
<br />
Ah well.....

    <title>Retirement Eligibility Rules Formula - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danieltosh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Retirement Eligibility Rules Formula</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to figure out a formula to return the date I am able to retire given my birth date and date of hire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rule is if your age plus years of service with a minimum of 8 years of service equals 75, you are eligible to retire.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The formula I'm using is =IF(TODAY()-F17&lt;2922,"Not eligible prior to "&amp;TEXT(F17+(365.25*8),"mm/dd/yyyy"),TEXT((27393.75+F19+F17)/2,"mm/dd/yyyy"))
</p>
<p>
</p><p>F17=date of hire</p>
<p>F19= date of birth</p>
<p>
</p><p>The formula above&nbsp;gives me an answer that is a month off.&nbsp; My date of hire is 06/05/06 and DOB is 10/01/80. The formula above gives me 02/01/2031 as my first date I'm&nbsp;eligible to retire&nbsp;but&nbsp;according to our retirement plan&nbsp;its 01/01/2031.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions??</p>

<h2>            Linking a Parent Account with a Child Account</h2>
                    Hello, My name is F***** A***** and I'm currently trying to accept the new terms of service today on November 26, 2013, and you guys want a parent approval, so my mother created a live account, and signed in as a 'parent' and accepted the terms of service,
 and this error keeps appearing blaming it on the internet service as insufficient, and we have tried it on multiple computers on multiple networks, and the same problem occurs. Can I please receive assistance on how to link these two accounts?

            <p>Hello Franke Andujo:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding the issue you are having accepting the terms of use.&nbsp; When you have issues related to accepting the terms of use chat support is typically the best avenue to get full troubleshooting of the issue.&nbsp; Chat support
 is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and can be accessed from here, <span>
<font color="#000000"><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us?xr=footnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us?xr=footnav</a>.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">I would like to clarify a couple things about a parental accounts association with a child account.&nbsp; For the purposes of accepting the Xbox Music/Zune terms of use, the parental
 account would be set up when you originally set up your account.&nbsp; If you have been using this account for sometime that means there should already be a parental account associated with your account.&nbsp; That likely means the account that your mother just created
 would not be able to be used as the parental account for the purposes of accepting the terms of use.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">The best way to attempt to accept the terms of use on your account is to sign into the child account at
<a href="http://xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.com</a>.&nbsp; Once you are signed in, click on MY ACCOUNT and then billing contact information.&nbsp; You will be asked to retrieve a security code and sign in with the parental account credentials.&nbsp; Try doing this and if you can
 successfully sign in you should be prompted to accept the new terms of use.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font color="#000000">
<p>If you cannot get signed into the proper parental account there is one option to locate that email without contacting chat support.&nbsp; This process requires a Xbox console and the steps are outlined here,
</p>
<p><font><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/forgot-microsoft-account#b675f88be17c44a9b60eff839c15f5ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/forgot-microsoft-account#b675f88be17c44a9b60eff839c15f5ad</a>.&nbsp;
 If you do not have a Xbox console then contact chat support as they may be able to provide another means of locating the proper parental account.</font></p>

<p>Is the record source updatable?&nbsp; Can you open the query that the form is based on and directly enter records?&nbsp; If not, that is the problem.&nbsp; Another thing to check is that the AllowAdditions AND AllowEdits are set to Yes.&nbsp; But it sounds like your record
 source is non-updatable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;(by the way do you happen to have any tables that the subform(s) are based on in the main form's record source?&nbsp; If so, they shouldn't be there).</p>

<div>These callers never know what version of Windows (XP, 7, Vista or 8) I am running, so I don't tell them.</div>
<div>Is there a useful command I can run on Vista so I can read the output over the phone to a cold-caller, such that it would "expose" a fraudster, or mislead anyone but a real "expert" ? &nbsp;Maybe there is something that relates to a specific system only (particularly
 if you can name something under Vista !) or some output that couldn't possibly be created from Windows XP, 7 or 8 or . . something, please ?! &nbsp;Something I can use to categorically expose them quickly, and shorten the phone call !</div>

            <blockquote>Yeah, fair enough, I understand, but I still get the calls, so is there anyone "teckie" enough to tell me what&nbsp;"Windows-key" and "R" actually DOES !?; if I know this, I can string the callers along for 30 secs and then show
 them I've seen through them. &nbsp;It may ultimately stop them calling again !
<div>As it is, I am currently getting more and more calls ! &nbsp;I would like to know what this key sequence does, so that I can interrupt their "spiel" straight away with it and get rid of them more quickly !</div>

<p>WinKey + R opens the Run dialog (same as Start/Run)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The point being that there is no need to interrupt any spiel. You will never be called for problems with your computer unless you made the call first. Hang up. They interrupted you by calling, they do not deserve the courtesy or an interruption -- just hang
 up. </p>

            <p>Anyone that "cold calls" you saying you have computer problems is a scammer.&nbsp; Just hang up when they call or tell them you've reported the calls to police who are monitoring your phone line...maybe that will discourage them from calling back.</p>
