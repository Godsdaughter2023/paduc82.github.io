    <title>Why Windows 10 Update installs AMD 16.6 Driver instead of 16.12.2&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why Windows 10 Update installs AMD 16.6 Driver instead of 16.12.2&#63;</h2>
                    I have just bought an AMD card (RX 480). After adding the card, Windows update installed the 16.6 driver. Then I manually updated the driver to 17.2.1. I had some issues with that driver so I tried to roll back to the latest stable driver which is 16.12.2.
 However after uninstalling 17.2.1, Windows installed 16.6 on its own. I just want to know why Windows installs 16.6 instead of 16.12.2 even though 16.12.2 is the latest WHQL driver.&nbsp;

<h2>            Audio stuttering Help</h2>
                    <p>Good day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with my PC lately. There has been some audio stuttering that has been driving me crazy. I am not very savvy with technology so I do not know the cause of this or how to fix it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Upon searching the internet, I came across this program called LatencyMon that apparently detects the cause of the stuttering. Unfortunately, I do not understand anything about it and I do not know what to do to fix my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the copy of the text in LatencyMon:</p>
<p>
</p><p>_________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p>_________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Your system appears to be having trouble handling real-time audio and other tasks. You are likely to experience buffer underruns appearing as drop outs, clicks or pops. One or more DPC routines that belong to a driver running in your system appear to be
 executing for too long. One problem may be related to power management, disable CPU throttling settings in Control Panel and BIOS setup. Check for BIOS updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>LatencyMon has been analyzing your system for&nbsp; 0:00:19&nbsp; (h:mm:ss) on all processors.</p>

<p>_________________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Hard pagefaults are events that get triggered by making use of virtual memory that is not resident in RAM but backed by a memory mapped file on disk. The process of resolving the hard pagefault requires reading in the memory from disk while the process is
 interrupted and blocked from execution.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>NOTE: some processes were hit by hard pagefaults. If these were programs producing audio, they are likely to interrupt the audio stream resulting in dropouts, clicks and pops. Check the Processes tab to see which programs were hit.</p>

            Hi JoelBenitez2,
<br />
<br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor here to help you.
<br />I think that the cause of audio shuttering could be a bad old audio driver or that your BIOS need an update.
<br />However it isn't bad to perform a complete maintenance of your device.
<br />First of all I suggest you to perform a scan and repair of filesystem: 
<br />
<br />1. Type "cmd" in windows search bar 
<br />2. Right click on "Command Prompt" 
<br />3. Select "Run as Administrator" 
<br />4. Type "sfc /scannow" without quote and press ENTER 
<br />
<br />Then you can perform a clean boot:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />At this point proceed with the driver update (I suggest you a remove and install again procedure) like this:
<br />
<br />1. Press WINDOWS + X
<br />2. Click on "Device Manager"
<br />3. Click on "View"
<br />4. Click on "Show hidden device"
<br />5. Click on each element on list and if you see "transparent" device then:
<br />    a. Right click on the transparent device
<br />    b. Click on "Uninstall device"
<br />    c. If asked, click on "Remove software driver" option and the click on    
<br />        "Ok"
<br />6. Once deleted every "transparent" device, then click on "Audio video and game controller"
<br />7. Right click on your audio device
<br />8. Click on "Uninstall device"
<br />9. Click on "Detects Hardware change" (monitor icon)
<br />10. Right click on your audio device 
<br />11. Click on "Update driver"
<br />12. Click on the online option
<br />
<br />Once finished reboot your system and see if the problem still exists.

</p><blockquote>Hi JoelBenitez2, <br />
<br />
I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor here to help you. <br />
I think that the cause of audio shuttering could be a bad old audio driver or that your BIOS need an update.
<br />
However it isn't bad to perform a complete maintenance of your device. <br />
First of all I suggest you to perform a scan and repair of filesystem: <br />
<br />
1. Type "cmd" in windows search bar <br />
2. Right click on "Command Prompt" <br />
3. Select "Run as Administrator" <br />
4. Type "sfc /scannow" without quote and press ENTER <br />
<br />
Then you can perform a clean boot: <br />

<br />
<br />
At this point proceed with the driver update (I suggest you a remove and install again procedure) like this:
<br />
<br />
1. Press WINDOWS + X <br />
2. Click on "Device Manager" <br />
3. Click on "View" <br />
4. Click on "Show hidden device" <br />
5. Click on each element on list and if you see "transparent" device then: <br />
a. Right click on the transparent device <br />
b. Click on "Uninstall device" <br />
c. If asked, click on "Remove software driver" option and the click on <br />
"Ok" <br />
6. Once deleted every "transparent" device, then click on "Audio video and game controller"
<br />
7. Right click on your audio device <br />
8. Click on "Uninstall device" <br />
9. Click on "Detects Hardware change" (monitor icon) <br />
10. Right click on your audio device <br />
11. Click on "Update driver" <br />
12. Click on the online option <br />
<br />
Once finished reboot your system and see if the problem still exists. </blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>

</p><p>Unfortunately, this did not solve my problem. I did everything the instruction said but the audio stuttering is still there.</p>

    <title>How can refer to the current directory in &#39;Target&#39;, within an - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jlroper  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can refer to the current directory in &#39;Target&#39;, within an LNK shortcut file&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a VB.NET app&nbsp;that&nbsp;uses command line arguments, and having those arguments passed in by using a .lnk Windows shortcut file works beautifully.&nbsp; However, if the executable and lnk&nbsp;files&nbsp;move to a different folder, the shortcut file will still point to
 the previous folder path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need to be able to put something in the 'Target' box, telling it to look in the same directory it is in (basically the current directory).&nbsp; I know that it will allow %windir%, but I'd like to have some other dynamic type tag to use (forgive me if the term
 I used is totally incorrect, I just don't know where to start).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me what I can use in place of the static path (somewhat like %windir% points to the Windows directory path)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a list of acceptable dynamic type tags which will work (like %windir% for example)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

=========================================<br />
Ok...as I understand it...the DVD plays but is choppy?<br />
<br />
No guarantees...but disabling all the filters in DVD Maker <br />
before burning the DVD may be worth a try...<br />
<br />
See the following article::<br />

(scroll waaay down to ...What To Do In Case Of Issues)<br />
<br />
Another alternative may be to save the Movie Maker file <br />
in the .WMV movie format and then use the following <br />

========================================<br />
Did you save the project in the .WMV movie format?<br />
If_Yes_does it play successfully in Windows Media Player?<br />
<br />
It's possible that one or more of your source files are<br />
incompatible or corrupted.<br />
<br />
Many formats are reportedly compatible with the various <br />
versions of Movie Maker but the most reliable choices are:<br />
<br />
Photos -&nbsp; bmp, jpg<br />
Video -&nbsp; wmv<br />
Audio -&nbsp; wma, wav, wmv<br />
<br />
Maybe Freemake Video Converter would be worth a try.<br />

<h2>            Folder windows&#47;installer has over 50GB of reported space used.</h2>
                    The computer is a Toshiba satellite with a 75GB hard drive.&nbsp; Very little software installed and only used for internet.&nbsp; I have removed all pictures and all temp files and have recovered up to 15GB free space.&nbsp; There should be about 50GB more available
 that is.&nbsp; The windows/installer folder shows it has over 50GB in that folder.&nbsp; I used System Suite 9 File Size manager to determine that.&nbsp; I did the same on my desk top and it shows about 800MB in the same folder.&nbsp; I believe it is reporting more usage than
 it really has.&nbsp; I looked around and could not find any excessive files.

<p>If as you say there are very few programs or data on your system I would expect you to have something like 40gb of free space on the win drive, that being the case why are you worrying?</p>
<p>The windows installer folder contains patches and updates, remove these and programs may fail. Its a hidden Folder, so in explorer enableing view hidden, would allow you to view the folder and its contents</p>
<p>Have you run Disk Clean Up and Defrag as part of a monthly maintenance routine. Most 'Tune Up Utilities' contain nothing that isnt allready available with Win</p>

            Thank for your suggestions.&nbsp; I agree that I should have around 40GB available but I only had about 400mb before i removed the pictures.&nbsp; Now i have about 11GB available.&nbsp; I have run Disk Cleanup and Defrag.&nbsp; This is my wife's machine and it has not been
 maintained properly.&nbsp; The drive is very fragmented and defrag does not completely fix this.&nbsp; I have run it many times and it still has mostly red in the bar. I tried to view the windows/installer folder using the view hidden files as you mentioned.&nbsp; It still
 does not show up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any further advice will be greatly appreciated.

            Another bit of information I just thought of.&nbsp; The microsoft office included was a trial version that was never activated.&nbsp; Now I have noticed that it tries to do five updates to it daily and they always fail.&nbsp; Could this have contributed to the excess
 files in the installer folder?

<p>Your Office Trial will by now have expired uninstall it together with any Activation Assistant via add/remove</p>
<p>If you had only 400mb free something is seriously 'ontoward' with your system Niether Disk Cleanup or Defrag or win will function correctly unless you have at least 15% free space</p>
<p>I'm a bit puzzled that the win/installer Folder appears to show 50gb, but you cannot view that folder when View&gt;Enable Hiddon Files is enabled in explorer.&nbsp; Have you checked the path, as shown in your utility?</p>
<p>Has the PC been scanned for both Virus and malware? - you can run online scans at F-Secure site</p>

    <title>How to grant a temporary time extension Win10 Parental Controls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris darrigo  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to grant a temporary time extension Win10 Parental Controls</h2>
                    <p>I've set up my child's account in windows 10, and allowed him 1 hour a day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that he's back in school, sometimes he needs a little more than an hour to complete his homework on the PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When his hour is up, he gets a dialog "Your time is up, ask you parent for more time or come back tomorrow." (or something similar to that message).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I give him more time. &nbsp;Say I want to grant him another 20 mins, just for today. &nbsp;Is there a way on this dialog I can grant him additional time, without having to log into parental controls and changing his allotted time for the day, and then I have
 to remember to log back in later and restore his original time limit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find a discussion on this issue anywhere in the help or online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>This truly the most unhelpful reply from MS I have seen. Windows 8 permitted extensions on a relatively easy basis by putting in the parents password but alas not with W10. It was easy to explain to my autistic son that he had 15 more minutes but now the
 system just shuts down and I cannot add anymore other logging on myself and allowing him in effect unlimited time. Come on get a grip and put back the system that existed under W8 it cannot be that difficult. I would add that as Chris says the child is told
 to ask for more time but the parent cannot give it - thanks MS.</p>

            <p>My child's computer it is locked due to the time limit. They had a PA day and he asked me politely if I can give him more time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I had to deny his request and explain him that Microsoft decided us to predict precisely our child's future and we need to know in advance how much time they will / need to spend in front of the computer with no way to adjust it later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not even mentioning that if they play and if they request more time for school, we cannot do that.</p>
<p>

            <p>Same thing here. It worked flawlessly in Windows 8 - I could just type in my Parents password and extend by 10, 30, 60, minutes. Now I have to go into the Parental Control, and change the entire time slot for that day; although MS states somewhere that it
 will only be changed for that day, it stays changed, so I need to go back afterwards to cha&amp;nge it back what it was before !</p>
<p>Why can this simple extension method not be reinstated ? It worked, so why break it ?</p>

<p>Hi LuvMyPC,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When sharing a USB- connected printer to the network, the printer and the computer where the printer is connected should be on when you're trying to print as the printer will not be available when the computer sleeps or when it is shut down. If you have
 enabled a password protected sharing, then only the users on your network who has the username and password of the computer where the printer is connected will be able to print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you already have shared the printer, then make sure the printer and the computer are both on before you try to connect to it from the other computer. To connect to the printer, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Printer &amp; scanner</strong>.</li><li>Click the<strong> + </strong>sign to <em>add a printer</em>.</li><li>Once your shared printer shows up, click it to proceed with the installation.</li><li>In case your printer is not on the list, then click the link <strong>The printer that I want isn't listed</strong> to show other options in adding the printer.<br />
</li><li>Click the option <strong>Select a shared printer by name</strong>, then browse for the name of the computer where the printer is connected.</li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I will be waiting for your feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>Vanessa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer and printer are both on and shared.&nbsp; The second computer cannot connect to the first computer via network to even get to the&nbsp; printer on the first computer.&nbsp; Therefore, I think it's something in the networking settings on the first system that
 is causing the problem. I have turned off password protection and still get the error of unable to access Computer1, you do not have access.</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back, Rose. In that case, let's make sure that your printer is properly shared. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the Windows key, type <strong>Devices and Printers</strong> in the search box, click it from the first results, then hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Right-click the printer you want to share with the network and click <strong>
Printer properties</strong>.</li><li>In the <em>Printer Properties</em>, click the <strong>Sharing</strong> tab.</li><li>Check the <strong>Share this printer</strong> option, then click <strong>Apply &gt; OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once this is done, try connecting to the printer again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please update this thread with the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

<p>In that case, let's look into your network profile. Have you set your network as a public and or private network? Basically, with the set up that you have, your network should be set to Private (Home). In case your network is on Public, have it changed to
 Private. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet</strong>.</li><li>Click <em>Ethernet</em> if your PC is connected via Ethernet, <em>Wi-Fi</em> if connected via Wi-Fi.</li><li>For <strong>Ethernet</strong>, click your computer icon, and toggle on the <strong>
Make this PC discoverable</strong> option.</li><li>For <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>, click <strong>Manage known networks</strong>, select your PC, then click
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Toggle on the <strong>Make this PC discoverable</strong> option.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Do this on all the computers you want to share the printer with and make sure as well that the
<em>File and Printer Sharing</em> option is enabled on all of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you still can't access the computer where the printer is connected, then try to disable the firewall or antivirus software installed on your computers and see if you're now able to access the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Vanessa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After checking all the settings, I retested and now I can access the system across the network and am able to install the printer. The person who has the system said there was a Microsoft update put on last night so apparently something changed.</p>
<p>Thank you for your assistance with this process.</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>

</p><p>How can I choose which folders appear on start Via Group Policy or Registry of Windows 10? I would like to disable/hidden Settings, so I can deploy the settings to all client in the domain.</p>

    <title>How do I turn off the password reset feature - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danskitt  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I turn off the password reset feature</h2>
                    <p>I have set user accounts for my kids that have parental controls attached to them and we log them in when they are allowed on the pc so we can monitor the time they spend on it. My youngest however has discovered that if you just hit return with no password
 in the field it then gives you an option to reset your password which he then types in what he feels and hey presto gains access to the account. My first question is why bother having a password if you can change it without knowing what the set password is
 and my second question is can it be turned off?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Yes absolutely correct. If i press return with nothing in the pssword field the usual message saying incorrect password pops up but underneath the password box a link appears saying reset password and if you click on it a box opens with type new password
 and confirm new password and thats it the password is changed.&nbsp;

<p>Well, when you click on that 'Reset Password' link, you should be told that the password reset media (if you have created one) is not present and be prompted to insert the password reset media.

<p>Hmmm, I don't think Windows would allow the password recovery to be created on your HDD, as it would not be secure . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like an error has occurred in Windows to allow this behaviour, indeed it may be a bug, if I were you I would post my Question on TechNet (<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/en-us/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click HERE</a>)
 and a Microsoft Tech may be able to assist you from there.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Sharing Xbox Live and Game Pass</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A friend and I share a lot of games together and it can get expensive for us to both pay xbox live, games pass, and purchasing two copies of each game. So we have come up with a system where I would pay for xbox live and he would pay the game pass on my
 account and I would set my account up on his xbox as "my home xbox" and do the same with his account on my xbox. I use to do this with brother with no problems. I am now doing it with a friend of mine but we are having an issue. He is getting my xbox live
 now and all my digital games/content but he does not have the access to the game pass. Like I said tho I have done this with my brother in the past and there was no issue. I have also done this with another friend of mine in the past with no issue but there
 is an issue now. We have tried removing both accounts from his xbox and re-downloading them and that didn't really change anything. I know the switch worked on his xbox because he is getting xbox live now and all of my digital games/content except the game
 pass stuff. What can be done to get the game pass working on his xbox? I have read several forums online that says it has worked for them and then others say it hasn't worked for them. Anything help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi sorry you are having issues.&nbsp; Sharing the game pass is possible but doesn't work quite the same way.&nbsp; The person that has it as the main console needs to download the game the other person wants, first.&nbsp; Then they can go to the gamepass store and download
 the title.&nbsp; They can't just download any titles otherwise.&nbsp; It's currently the only way of doing it.&nbsp; So he would need to tell you what he wants and you start the download.&nbsp; Then he will be able to do the same.

            Sharing games with friends is also not really allowed. The home Xbox feature is for families or if you have more then one console. It not only isn't allowed its also very risky. People lose their accounts all the time to this. They also get bans, become
 victims of fraud or worse. Sharing account info with others is against the Xbox code of conduct as well and could result in a ban.

<p>
</p><p>Windows&nbsp;8.1 mediacreationtool.exe already supports USB 3.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't ask about mediacreationtool.exe supporting USB 3.0 - it already does that.</p>
<p>USB 3.0 is 7 year old obsolete technology.&nbsp; Anything that doesn't support USB 3.0 was obsolete 7 years ago.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has a habit of shipping Windows with good support for obsolete technologies and no support for current technologies.&nbsp; I'm concerned that will continue for Windows 10.</p>

    <title>Trouble getting driver updated to level of OpenGL 3.0 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffreylawton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble getting driver updated to level of OpenGL 3.0</h2>
                    I have so-called "onboard graphics" ie Intel(R) HD graphics on a G6950 processor. The OpenGL level showing is 2.1 but I want to run some new SW that requires 3.0 (I am not a "gamer", this is BASIC ENGINEERING SOFTWARE). If I ask Microsoft to update my
 driver it says all is up to date, if I ask Intel driver update it indicates a higher number release exists but for reasons I can't understand it refuses to install it and when I called them they indicated they didn't think they "had an obligation" to support
 the higher level! I understand that I COULD purchase and install a "real" graphics card (both slots are obviously empty right now) but I don't get it, the onboard system isn't THAT bad and the graphics utility indicates it actually has 12 cores - how many
 should I need for a basic system?? I mean I don't think this is really all Microsoft's problem but shouldn't it be possible to get support all around that's a whole lot better than this? The system's only about 5 years old, I've owned

            <p>The&nbsp; <em>Intel(R) HD graphics on a G6950 processor </em>is limited to Open GL 2.1.
</p>
<p>It is compatible with DX10 but not DX11.</p>
<p>This is a hardware limitation. There is nothing that can be done to fix that.</p>
<br />
<p>You may well have owned systems that were older than 5 yrs previously but were never</p>
<p>confronted by hardware limitations such as this, but 5 yrs is, unfortunately,&nbsp; a long time in computer/dog years. Particularly with graphics.</p>
<p>Apparently your cpu was released in 2010, and I believe it does have an early version of the newer
</p>
<p>Intel HD graphics that are integrated into the cpu vs a chip on the motherboard, but is a bit too
</p>
<p>early for Open GL 3.0.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>"...if I get a third-party graphics card, on what basis should I expect them to support their product BETTER THAN Intel does?"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel don't have a long graphics support period. This is at least in part due to the fact that drivers get modified to suit motherboards, which requires that you download the drivers from the</p>
<p>motherboard mfg if you want a guarantee of stability, and the motherboard mfg's and laptop mfg's</p>
<p>don't often offer a driver update after one or maybe two years.</p>
- However, Intel does often update drivers for their graphics for a longer period than the motherboard mfg's, so you can
<em>sometimes</em> download more recent drivers for intel graphics directly from
<p>Intel or even via Windows Updates (the 'optional' section) and have no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mfg's of dedicated graphics cards do tend to support their cards with the new drivers for longer</p>
<p>periods&nbsp; ie - Nvidia's latest drivers still support graphics cards released in June 2010.</p>
<p>They were still supporting gpu's in their drivers in July 2014 that were released in '05</p>
<p>Note that while the drivers may still support these 'older' cards, there is little or no benefit</p>
<p>in updating drivers for graphics cards more than about three years old, and the 'optimisations'</p>
<p>are directed more at the newer series cards, particularly the latest series (largely because</p>
<p>the 'older' series have been optimised as much as possible).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which brings us back to the motherboard. You may need a BIOS update for your motherboard</p>
<p>to be able to recognise a current, or previous series dedicated graphics card (with Nvidia this is</p>
<p>the 700 and 900 series cards). </p>
<p>This is assuming your motherboard has a recent enough BIOS update available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then we come to the part about the <em>power supply</em>. You also have to verify the power supply</p>
<p>has adequate Watts/amps to run the dedicated graphics card, and power supplies loose
</p>
<p>capability to produce the full current and current stability, with age. </p>
<p>This would be less of an issue if you were to add a low end graphics card, as they can often run</p>
<p>off the PCIe slot, with no additional power connection required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Short answer....</p>
<p>If you need this software for professional purposes (or want to use the 'newer' version at all),
</p>
<p>you may want to get a newer machine if&nbsp; you want to avoid complications.</p>
<p>And with a new machine you may not need a dedicated graphics card. The newer Intel HD graphics</p>
<p>are far more capable than what you have currently, particularly on the i5 cpu's.</p>
<p>- My&nbsp; 'older' i5 3570 cpu with HD400 from 2012 can use up to Open GL 4.0.<br />
I believe i3's with HD3000 are also capable of up to Open GL 4.0, but haven't verified this.</p>
<p>You do still have to be wary of which newer cpu you use as not all of them have integrated graphics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Did some double checking and found this on the Open GL site (This would be for on going support, and would not affect the Intel HD graphics that is capable of using&nbsp;up to OpenGL&nbsp; 4.0)&nbsp; -
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Intel does not provide a proper, up-to-date OpenGL implementation for their integrated GPUs. There is nothing that can be done about this. NVIDIA and ATI provide good support for their integrated GPUs."</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

            Hi Ian,<br />
<br />
This error message can occur when installing a Windows Update. We'd like to know if you are trying to install the Windows 10 Version 1709. If yes, you may check and follow the steps given by
<strong>Andre Da Costa</strong> on this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/error-code-0xc0000005-when-trying-to-install/85d4f10e-0883-4371-a0e1-29cba82f5fbd">thread</a></strong>
 and see if that will do the trick.<br />
<br />
Kindly get back to us with the outcome. <br />

            So I double checked your thread and checked several of your options. I couldn't find anything wrong even after using Dism commands. Eventually I tried Windows update troubleshooter and after some time error 0x80300113 appeared. I'm not certain if this
 is the reason behind the update failures.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9966d730-23f7-4f95-b696-828bca449113?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9966d730-23f7-4f95-b696-828bca449113?upload=true" /></a>

<p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error that you're getting when trying to run the troubleshooter for Windows Updates is common in almost every version of Windows. It usually occurs when you try to run a built-in troubleshooting feature of Windows or Microsoft’s official Fix It tool.
 In order for you to proceed with installing the Windows Updates, let us try to resolve the error that you're receiving when running the troubleshooter first. It is possible that Cryptographic Services process is disabled that's why this error occurs. Kindly
 follow the instructions below to enable it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open <strong>Run </strong>by pressing the <strong>Windows key + R</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Type in <strong>services</strong>.<strong>msc </strong>and then press
<strong>Enter</strong> to open <strong>Services</strong> <strong>Manager</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fcdn.windowsreport.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2017%2f12%2fwindows-troubleshooter-stopped-working-services-1.png" height="206" width="399" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Look for <strong>Cryptographic </strong><strong>Services</strong> and double-click on it. Its Startup type will be set to MANUAL in your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/91ed155a-2507-47b7-ae06-4c9984a46458?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/91ed155a-2507-47b7-ae06-4c9984a46458?upload=true" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Set <strong>Startup </strong><strong>type </strong>to <strong>Automatic</strong>, and then click on
<strong>Start </strong>to immediately start this service if it’s not running. Once done, click on
<strong>Apply </strong>and <strong>OK </strong>to save changes.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Restart your PC, and then try to run the troubleshooter for Windows Updates again.</p>
<p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>

            Making progress, but there are still issues. On the Windows Update Assistant the Update proceeded and seemed to be making progress until it got around 84% or so and then it just failed.

<p>Error <strong>0x8007001F</strong> usually occurs when your computer has stopped responding or when a general failure has occurred. It can be due to a faulty audio driver, or a compatibility issue between Windows 10 and your computer’s hardware. Since the
 cause of the error can be traced back from audio or sound driver issues, we recommended that you run the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">audio troubleshooter</a></strong> for us to detect and resolve issues with your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If running the audio troubleshooter didn't resolve it, you can try updating or reinstalling your audio driver. It's possible that some driver updates might have been missed due to poor Internet connection. For instructions and more information, kindly visit
 this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, there's a chance that the issue could have occurred due to a conflict between third-party applications. We advise that you perform a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong>. This method lets your system eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program
 or an update, or when you run a program in Windows 10<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, refer to <strong>"</strong><strong>Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong><strong>"&nbsp;</strong>to boot your computer in normal startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know the result and current status of the issue and we'll take the next action to resolve your concern.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Insider-Hub does not show AoE&#58; DE Beta</h2>
                    <p>On tuesday, i obtained beta access to Age of Empires: Definitive Edition. Unfortunately, I used the wrong Microsoft account to sign up, so I logged in to Xbox Insider-Hub with the wrong account. The logout button in this app does not work, if I press it nothing happens. This means I was not able to test the beta until today, where I logged in at&nbsp;my sister's PC.&nbsp;</p><p>She never used this app, so I logged in with my other MS account. Here I should see the Age of Empires beta in the content section of the Insider-Hub, but it is not there.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I created a support ticket, asking about my logout problem two days ago but did not get an answer yet.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Is there anyone who also has the problem, that a beta access is not shown?&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Thank you for help,&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Michael</p>

            Thanks for the reply, Monica. Uninstalling Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center seems to have resolved my problem for now. If it persists, I'll try your suggestions.

            Hi MSaied10 it is possible you are logged into a temporary user profile . .. 
<br />
<br />Before you do anything or move any files around:
<br />
<br />Restart (not shut down) your PC 4 times in a row, this will fix this issue a lot of the time . .. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise: 
<br />
<br />Please open Windows File Explorer 
<br />Navigate to C:\Users 
<br />Do you see a user folder that look like yours?
<br />Open that folder and check inside Pictures, Documents . . . etc. and see if your files are there 
<br />
<br />If your files are there: 
<br />
<br />Create a new user profile with Admin privileges 
<br />Log into the new user profile 
<br />Copy all your data from the old profile to the new profile (Documents Library, Pictures Library . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />If you still have not found your files, look for a Windows.old folder on your C Drive, expand that to open the users folder contained inside - check there for your files, icons . . .etc. 
<br />
<br />If you do find your files . . . etc. there, copy them out as soon as possible as Windows will remove the Windows.old folder in time
<br />
<br />NOTE VERY IMPORTANT: Do Not copy your files into the Temporary profile you are currently in, when the situation is corrected, your files will be deleted with the Temporary Profile and will not be recoverable !!

                    Removed Cisco VPN software only to create this problem.&nbsp; Cannot get to windows login in either regular boot or safe mode boot. The regedit fix for this issue&nbsp;is straight forward but first I have to get through windows boot.

            GINA = Graphical identification and Authentication<br />
<br />
It sounds like you know what the problem is...&nbsp; the Cisco VPN software added a reference in you registry to their GINA DLL (CSGINA.dll)&nbsp; then you uninstalled their software and the uninstall did not remove the entry in the registry telling XP to load the now
 nonexistent CSGINA.dll.<br />
<br />
In XP, the default GINA DLL is called msgina.dll and assuming XP is installed on your C drive, you will find the msgina.dll file here:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
By default, there is no registry entry to load a specific GINA DLL and in that case, XP just loads the msgina.dll by default.&nbsp; If your system has been afflicted with malicious software, or sometimes installing and uninstalling some third party applications,
 they may have adjusted your registry forcing it to try to load a different GINA.dll file.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If for some reason that particular GINA.dll file no longer exists on your system (maybe you uninstalled that software) but the registry is still telling XP to load that GINA.dll file, your system will not be able to load any GINA file, then it complain about
 it and not boot.&nbsp; It will of course not even try to load the default msgina.dll file since the registry is telling it to load something else.<br />
<br />
Your registry is still telling XP to load the nonexistent CSGINA.dll, but you can fool it temporarily long enough to get your system to boot and then fix it.<br />
<br />
You need to boot into the XP Recovery Console or some other bootable media, and copy the c:\windows\system32\msgina.dll to the same name as the GINA file that XP is trying to load.&nbsp; Something like:<br />
<br />
copy c:\windows\system32\msgina.dll&nbsp;&nbsp; c:\windows\system32\csgina.dll<br />
<br />
Then when XP tries to load the csgina.dll (since that is what the registry is telling it to do), it will really be loading the Microsoft MSGINA.dll instead.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; Foiled again.<br />
<br />
Then you system will boot and you can edit the registry here:<br />
<br />
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\GinaDLL<br />
<br />
...and remove the GinaDLL entry from the Winlogon section since it probably doesn't belong there anymore.&nbsp; If there is no GinaDLL value in the Winlogon section, XP will just load the MSGINA.dll (this is what you want to happen for this problem).<br />
<br />
So, you are going to have to boot on something like a genuine bootable XP installation CD to get into the XP Recovery Console or something else...<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD?&nbsp; This is not the same as any Recovery CDs that may have come with your system.<br />
<br />
If you don't, you can make one (no XP media required).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
You could also make a Hiren's Boot CD (or Hiren's Boot USB) and do the same thing and that CD also has a remote registry editor you could use, but the above is "easier".<br />

            Sure thing.<br />
<br />
Just in case, tell us what your XP version and Service Pack, your system make and model and if you know if you have IDE or SATA drives since (if you are using SATA drives) there may be an adjustment necessary to get this CD to boot (go ahead and make the CD
 - that part doesn't matter):<br />
<br />
<div>
<p>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure what you have (no XP media required).<br />
</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come with a store bought system.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD (do not install UniBlue or the Ask Toolbar - ever!):<br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>

<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recovery_console_cmds.mspx?mfr=true</a></p>
<p>A good idea before starting things is to first verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear
 to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>
<p>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</p>
<p>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will not be present.</p>
