<h2>            Windows Update I Tried Everything</h2>
                    <p>INTRO: I have a Windows 7/8 Update PROBLEM!&nbsp; Been using internet on this pc for years, this is an update problem.&nbsp; Not a simple issue and fix.&nbsp; I know this because I have tried every forum, every comment, every post, and every Microsoft quick fix including&nbsp;update
 agent, update diagnostic, patches to it like Windows6.1-KB3135445-x64, cmd start stop update...&nbsp; checking registry folder for 1 not 0 in folder, changing System 32 Distributed Software folder name to .old, deleting log files.&nbsp; Changing firewall settings to
 allow everything and deny nothing, checking proxy server ports, found I have no proxy I am direct connected, talking to security suite providers who gave me a walk though how to set it up.&nbsp; I scanned with several anti virus programs, I ran some utilities to
 fix the registry and other files....ran disk clean up.&nbsp; In Services Update and the 2 other apps, Background Intelligent Transfer Service Properties are set to start auto, I added a "Network" to the 3 other System/User/Admin, now Network.&nbsp; net stop wuauserv,
 stop bits, stop cryptserv, change check for updates, don't check for updates, check let me install, never check, .... LITERALLY EVERYTHING!?&nbsp; Been 4 days and 300 pictures along the way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PART1: Here is the problem.&nbsp; Windows Update runs ("Checking for updates") but returns nothing,&nbsp;in the beginning it had updates, but showed that 0/KB of updates were installing on&nbsp;screen and this problem never changed and after a few attempts to fix it it
 shows there are no updates to install so instead it searches for updates none stop.&nbsp; It also now shows ("Updates were installed: Never") instead of the most recent ("Updates were installed: 1-1-2016")
</p>
<p>
</p><p>PART 2: I get updates from other sources, &nbsp;like java, and flash, I UPDATED TO WINDOWS 10 and it worked to solve this issue, but the windows 10 update down in the task tray seems coming from a different Microsoft update server I guess.&nbsp; Windows Firewall,
 "Domain Profile" inbound is set to allow, so is the Private and Public Domain tabs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Popular error codes Microsoft has given me include.&nbsp; <br />
1.) THIS IS FROM UPDATE SCREEN Code 800800005 ("error occurred while checking for updates")<br />
2.) THIS IS A POP-UP Windows Update standalone Installer ("Installer encountered an error: 800800005....Server execution failed")<br />
3.) When I tried net stop wuauserv, then net stop cryptServc the command box said System error 5 has occurred.&nbsp; Access is denied.&nbsp; (might have been&nbsp;I was not running it as an&nbsp;admin at the time?)<br />
4.) Tried to download update for windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB3135445) but couldn't get it download at first, then when did it did nothing.</p>
<p>5.) WINDOWS UPDATE TROUBLESHOOTING REPORT =&nbsp;Rootcause: RC_DataStore, ErrorCode: 0x80070057<br />
this says multiple things are not wrong, udate is running, nothing cirrupt or missing, variable are correct,&nbsp;cryptograph is registered..<br />
but it also says the problem is "Not Fixed" Windows Update error 0x80070057(2016-07-26-T-03_57_45P)<br />
6.) Microsoft Malware Protection webs site page shows&nbsp;the Malicious Software Removal Tool but when clicked says page doesn't exist, found another page and clicked on "Download" in bright orange the button was, but it wouldn't download, like it wasn't there.<br />
7.) downloaded Microsoft Diagnostic and Recovery Toolset (DaRT) but it does nothing when clicked on.<br />
8.) THIS IS FROM UPDATE SCREEN Code 80244019 ("error occurred while checking for updates") this was the earliest&nbsp;update screen, and still showed the dates of the last updates being installed.<br />
&nbsp;PART4: Do I want windows management instrumentation(WMI) to communicate though the windows firewall, there are&nbsp;2 check&nbsp;boxes for this WMI it uses DCOM so I am unsure.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Part5:) The major issue is that Windows Update is using 25% of my RAM, making my fan speed up, placing error logs on my pc, and it does this even if it turned off, it just restarts itself when the pc is booted.&nbsp; So I need to remove Update, or all of the prior
 updates which number around 300 updates have been installed.&nbsp; Can I just uninstall them all?<br />

<h2>            Keep getting Network Limited &#40;Wired&#41; - Says no Internet Connection... BUT I HAVE INTERNET...</h2>
                    <p>So yeah that title pretty much sums it up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have internet connectivity.&nbsp; But in the notification bar I have a yellow triangle that says limited access "No Internet Connection".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing else on my network has this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought the $15 dollar upgrade to Windows 8 Pro from Windows 7 Ultimate last year when they had that deal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It happens to BOTH of my INTEL nics (which are running the latest drivers).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wizard that helps troubleshoot your network connection says it doesn't find anything wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ipconfig /all reveals nothing out of place (DNS is right, IP is right, Subnet is right, Gateway is Right)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again I have connectivity to everything including the Internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reboots take care of the issue (occasionally).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ODDLY when I go in and change my mac address (if you have an INTEL nic there is an advanced tab and you can change the mac address (it's not the cards address it is more like a spoofer deal) it will not have that problem for quite awhile... (everything will
 be fine)... I have to change the mac and then reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use Comcast for an Internet Provider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've turned off Bonjour Services (someone in another thread suggested it - no workie)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've flushed dns (ipconfig /flushdns), rebooted, disabled and re-enabled the adapter...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried using other DNS services like Google's and Verizons and even open dns
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm at a loss...&nbsp; Anyone want to weigh in here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems there are quite a number of people having these limited network issues... I haven't seen anyone that had connectivity though...
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the help</p>

            No I've made no changes, as I said in the ipconfig /all ip, subnet, gateway, network, dns is all right...&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Right now it's normal, I changed the mac address, disabled the network adapter (first) then changed the mac address and rebooted. &nbsp;Then I enabled the adapter and it is not limited again. &nbsp;If I change the mac address without disabling first it doesn't work
 (still says limited).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Keep in mind... I have Internet connectivity regardless... (even when it says I do not and it is limited).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried your suggestions before I posted my question (I searched the forums first, and read the suggestions to others). &nbsp;The thing that is different about my issue is that I have connectivity... even though it says I do not.</div>

<p><font color="#000000">I would have you remove any interference between the router and the computer. The common interferences are cordless phones, wireless devices etc.</font></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><font color="#000000">You can also try resetting the router and updating the wireless drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000">You need to power off the Router and wait a few minutes for it to lose its cache. Then power up the router, wait for it to talk to your ISP (Internet Service
 Provider) and stabilize a couple minutes before powering up other devices connected to the computer.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Hopefully then all be alright after the router has plenty of time to gets IP (Internet Protocol) and stabilize too.</font></font></p>

            I understand you are trying to help me, however in the future you should take time (as a support engineer) to actually read the issue instead of scanning it and assuming it is like the majority of these other issues. &nbsp;This is not a wireless issue, my desktop
 does not have a wireless adapter and I indicated we were talkig about a wired connection. This coupled with a long multi-week wait for a response has wasted weeks of my time and illustrated how absolutely useless this tool is for support. &nbsp;Perhaps Microsoft
 and their poor earnings report would be better served if the people they employed actually cared about their company and in this case their own credibility/reputation. &nbsp;

            <p>I have been having the exact same issue on many Win8 laptops I have been setting up for my company.&nbsp;While I originally thought it was harmless because&nbsp;they&nbsp;still had internet access, I found out that&nbsp;as long as the Ethernet connection doesn't think it has
 internet access (even when it really does), metro apps will&nbsp;see no internet connectivity and fail to get your mail, weather, etc.

<p>I did some further looking today and found the following article which seems to have solved the problem for me.</p>

<p>The key for me was resetting the ip stack with the netsh command. Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>This post is from 2013 but I just saw it since it had never happened to me until now. While reading and reading none of the answer listed below were useful went into ther webpages and nothing. Finally started seeing my sdervices looking for one related to
 the Network and this is what i found!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Windows + R<br />
type: Services.msc then click OK or simply hit enter<br />
Search for the " Network Location &nbsp;Awareness Properties (local Computer)"<br />
On the General tab, search for "Startup Type" and make sure is in automatic, if it's not then set it to Automatic, then click Start on the Service Status right below.<br />
click Apply, OK.<br />

    <title>New Logitech Wireless Mouse Not being Detected Win 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emergency  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Logitech Wireless Mouse Not being Detected Win 7</h2>
                    
<p>New mouse, it is not the&nbsp;new and properly&nbsp;inserted&nbsp;battery , it is not the usb port/hub thingee where I plug the&nbsp;Nano Reciever&nbsp;in (the printer works) it is not the distance 1-3", it is nothing metallic in the way. I find similar questions marked as answers,
 some say it may be a chipset update needed, I checked win update, nothing there about chipsets. I probably wouldn't know a chipset update if I saw one. I don't know what details to give: Upgraded to Win 7 Home Premium 32,&nbsp;from Win Vista Home Basic, Acer Aspire
 5315, Logitech M215 wireless. I have also gone to Acer and updated two of the 3 available updates, I didn't update the tv thingee.</p>
<p>And sometimes the mouse decides to work by itself. It likes to make me think I had something to do with it, by say after 3 hours of it not working and numerous times of plugging and unplugging the Nano reciever I accidentally bump the hand unit and it decided
 to start working. But it has refused to do it tonight for 6 hours so far.</p>
<p>I see some people suggesting (as near as I can understand) going into the computer and writing code or changing stuff and I am not qualified to do that. I don't understand why there are so many instances of this being questioned, and yet almost all of the
 questions are marked as answers even though it looks to me as if the question is not being answered.</p>
<p>Thought I might add that I have been attempting to do a troubleshooter with Hardware &amp; devices. I click on the Configure a device and it goes to a page that says&nbsp;Troubleshoot and prevent Computer problems, and I click the "next" button and then it goes to
 a scan mode and then a page says changes to my hardware were possibly undetected, and that changes were made to my&nbsp;system and it doesn't matter how many times I run this I get the same results. I also ran the troubleshooter on network adapters, because I thought
 it might be the Nano Reciever causing the problem, it says fixed problem (but not the mouse one.). Tomorrow night there will be an extra laptop available, but I don't think it is running Win 7 and is different MFG than mine, but I will plug the setup into
 that CPU and see if it works right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In addition, if I attempt to add new device, I get a blank page, with no devices being detected, I even hooked up the printer and it wouldn't show up. Only two devices I have is printer and mouse. BTW, is my touchpad considered the PS/2 Microsoft compatible
 mouse? That is the only mouse showing in device manager.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is the wireless mouse "receiver" seen in the Windows 7 Device Manager?</p>
<p>Logitech has provide the Windows utility which should help to "re-pair" the mouse with the nano style receiver:</p>

<h2>            System Restore Doesn&#39;t Work&#58; System Restore is initializing...</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp; whenever I attempt a System Restore I get as far as "System restore is initializing..." and it gets stuck.&nbsp; Now without this rather handy function I often get "stuck."&nbsp; I'm running W7 Home Premium 64 bit on an Asus M4A78T-E MOBO with an AMD Phenom II
 X4 955 processor and 8 gigs of DDR3 RAM. The MOBO failed and was replaced with same.&nbsp; (Strangely enough, System Restore worked once after this event.)&nbsp; Here's what I've tried so far, all with no success:</p>
<ol>
<li>Turned off Norton 360 v.4 </li><li>Removed Norton 360 v.4 </li><li>Safe Mode </li><li>Clean reinstall of OS </li><li>sfc/scannow </li><li>Clean boot </li><li>Repair reinstall of OS </li><li>Turned System Restore off and then on again. </li><li>Cleaned up the registry and whatever else I could think of to address this problem</li></ol>
<p>I've been through customer support at Symantec.&nbsp; They sent me to the computer manufacturer.&nbsp; The computer manufacturer told me to reinstall the OS.&nbsp; (Couldn't see the point of a third time reinstalling!)&nbsp; No help there.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any other ideas?&nbsp; And by the way, I can't make a system image with W7 software.&nbsp; I'm using Macrium Reflect in this case.&nbsp;&nbsp; ERUNT is being used until I can get System Restore working but this utility is not ideal.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.&nbsp;&nbsp; One request though, if a suggestion is complicated please give me enough details to employ it.&nbsp; I'm at best a very motivated beginner.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hello Jim,<br />
<br />
No problem, you are welcome. <br />
<br />
Well, I was looking at the list of what you’ve tried, I see that you<br />
have done all the below actions: <br />
<br />
</span><span>1. Turned off Norton 360 v.4<br />
2. Removed Norton 360 v.4 <br />
3. Safe Mode <br />
4. Clean reinstall of OS <br />
5. sfc/scannow <br />
6. Clean boot <br />
7. Repair reinstall of OS <br />
8. Turned System Restore off and then on again. <br />
9. Cleaned up the registry and whatever else I could think of to address this problem<br />
<br />
And it still failed, so therefore I think that the BEST option is do use DBAN and<br />
wipe out the disk on the magnetic to 100% clean it up of old data etc. Then <br />
perform a normal Windows® 7 installation with disk format etc. Then install <br />
the program I suggested including a much lighter and better AV, Microsoft®<br />
Security Essentials (MSE). </span></p>
<p><span>I hope you find this information useful and if you need any further assistance,<br />
please feel free to contact me and let me know.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this information was helpful…</span></p>
<p><span>Have a nice day…</span></p>
<p><span>Best regards,<br />
Fisnik</span></p>

    <title>Gears of War 3 Golden Wings Week &#40;first week&#41; gold skins never - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> claydood  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gears of War 3 Golden Wings Week &#40;first week&#41; gold skins never unlocked.</h2>
                    
<p>I pre-ordered Gears of War 3, bought it on 9/20 the day is was released. It was posted all over the internet on the game that when players play online during that week, they will unlock the Gold Lancer and Hammerburst. It seems like the entire Microsoft
 Support team and Epic Games was unaware of the first week event as non of them are able to help me. I keep getting told about achievements both when I call, or email, even though I never say the word achievement. I even reply back that I'm not having problems
 with achievements, yet they continue to reply back telling me about achievements.</p>
<p>Now I did play online several times that week on various game modes, including the main story, but the gold weapons never unlocked.</p>
<p>I played online with a friend, and the old weapons did unlock for him. What the hell, that isn't fair.</p>
<p>We both played the beta, and never unlocked gold weapons in previous Gears of War games, so the only explanation is there is a glitch on my saved game somewhere.</p>
<p>Why did this happen to me? Why did I have to pay full price for a game and not be able to access all the content in the game?</p>

<p>this skins NEVER unlocked. The first week Gear of War 3 was released, they had the golden wings week event. It was listed on the in game event calender, Epic announced it on Facebook on their page, it was also announced on the Gears of war fan page. It was
 listen in forums, and gaming sites all across the internet. I even seen it on Xbox.com a few times.</p>
<p>The event stated that to unlock the gold lancer and hammerburst, simply play an online game by 9/26. I've played several online games, the gold weapon skins never unlocked.</p>
<p>I played with a friend, and they unlocked for him, so a glitch in the game prevented them from unlocking on my end.</p>

<h2>            XBOX 360 com TV desligada funciona</h2>
                    
<p>Quando o XBOX 360 está ligado via HDMI na TV ele liga e logo depois desliga e fica uma luz vermelha acesa.</p>
<p>Se eu deixar a TV desligada ou o cabo HDMI descontado ele funciona normal, procura os controles, fica luz verde e o cooler funciona. Se eu conectar o cabo HDMI ele desliga.</p>
<p>Alguém já passou por isso ou sabe explicar o que pode ser?</p>

<p>Grato!</p>

<p>Complicado, é que não jogava muito, umas 2 horas por semana...</p>
<p>Estou entrando em contato em algumas assistências, pelo que explico, eles falam que não é problema no console, pois se o mesmo liga sem estar conectado a TV, está normal, é apenas quando recebe o sinal da TV.</p>
<p>Obrigado, vamos ver se aparece mais alguém, com esse defeito!</p>

<h2>            Accidentally did this...</h2>
                    Hello! <br />
<br />
I downloaded Windows 10 when it was free and it was working fine.<br />
But I used KMS Tools to activate office but accidentally clicked on Activate Windows which made my Windows unactivated for some reason.<br />
(I still have a key which shows me the last five letters and/or numbers only)<br />
Hope you can help me solve this as I can't do anything without activating.

<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Also the error seems to be a case of conflict between lg mobile drivers installed on windows 8.1 and cyanogenmod since the error started appearing after I installed LGdrivers. Now the obvious solution is to uninstall lg drivers, but

<h2>            Destiny 2 not working</h2>
                    <p>I bought Destiny 2 on the Xbox Store and I downloaded it twice but it isn't working. The first time it would start downloading but it didn't say that it was downloading Destiny 2, and when it finished, it wouldn't show up in my games. When I tried to open it from the store, it would only take me to manage game, but then it would just be blank. I uninstalled it and tried to install it again. The second time was a bit better, it showed that Destiny 2 was downloading. When it finished it showed up in my games but still didn't have a picture. When I pressed it, it would say that the game is getting ready, but nothing happens. I need help.</p>

            You are getting this cause Norton has found this file outside of c:\windows\system32 where it normally should be.
<br />So yes it could potentially be a virus.
<br />Have Norton remove it then run a malware check.

            <p>Hello Russell,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience. Let me assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that t<span>he compatibility report in the Get Windows&nbsp;10 app makes sure your PC with the installed
</span>devices, apps <span>can run Windows&nbsp;10. </span></p>
<p><span>So, we would like to if you received any such notifications. </span><span>If there's a problem with a device connected to your PC, it means your PC can run Windows&nbsp;10, but the device won't work correctly after the upgrade because it isn't fully compatible.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, a major chance for such&nbsp;situations to occur is when you bypass&nbsp;Windows compatibility&nbsp;check and install Windows 10 straightway using any Windows 10 media sources.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now, to be able to assess the issue further, let us know the following details.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>What is the exact error or the difficulties you are experiencing? When you say '</span>bypass this glitch', what is the exact glitch or the hurdle you are referring to?</li><li><span>What is the make and model of the PC?

            <p>As an update to the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I used DDU.Exe ( Display Driver Uninstaller) as recommended by Nvidia to remove all traces of the Nvidia driver software and uninstalled the card but left it in the PC and rebooted windows and had the display use&nbsp;the Windows drivers. I ran the Windows 10
 upgrade adviser again but it still advised there was an issue with the Nvidia drivers which I doubted as I had methodically removed all traces of Nvidia drivers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then started the upgrade process for Windows 10 and after the install&nbsp;was completed reinstated the Nvidia graphics card and installed the Nvidia driver for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only issue I've had is Internet Explorer has had a lot of errors and is continually giving a message saying it has stopped working and is looking for a solution. I recently reinstalled Internet Explorer and cross fingers I should have no further problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was never able to identify a single issue that was causing a problem so I don't think my experience will provide much of a guide for other users experiencing similar problems.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 is not recognizing a Thunderbolt 2 device - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 is not recognizing a Thunderbolt 2 device</h2>
                    <p>Hi!<br />
<br />
I've just bought a NAS (QNAP TVS-1282T) and a PC with the motherboard&nbsp;Gigabyte GA-X99-Designare EX.</p>
<p>The motherboard supports Thunderbolt 3 via USB Type-C connector and the NAS is Thunderbolt 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once i connect the NAS via Thunderbolt 2 cable into the USB Type C port with this
<a href="https://www.startech.com/Cables/thunderbolt-3-cables/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-thunderbolt-adapter~TBT3TBTADAP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Startech adapter</a> i get this message: "the last usb device you connected to this computer malfunctioned and windows doesn't recognize it".<br />
If i go to the device manager in Windows i see that under "USB Device (Universal Serial Bus)" there is a "Billboard Device" reporting an error with Code 10. (<a href="https://i.gyazo.com/f7be096528ed9ec610c8c15c3423aa4e.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">screenshot
 here</a>)<br />
(it's in italian. A literal translation would be: Impossible to start the device (Code 10). You specified an unexisting device)<br />
I tried to click on it and automatically look for drivers, but it says that the device drivers are up to date.<br />
The NAS works for sure, because if i connect it via thunderbolt on my girlfriend macbook it works.<br />
<br />
So, how can i make this work via Thunderbolt 2 on my Windows PC?<br />
I've spent 13K€ on this setup (NAS + PC), you can imagine i cannot work without Thunderbolt!<br />
<br />
Additional details:<br />
- Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-X99-Designare EX. Bios Version F3. All drivers installed. It supports Thunderbolt 3<br />
- Windows 10 Version 1511, Build OS 10586.633<br />
- Gigabyte tech support said a Thunderbolt 2 device would work with this Motherboard using that adapter. I've asked them before buying all this stuff<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help</p>

            <p>Hey all, I was having this problem too and finally figured it out. This fix could apply to anyone with a Gigabyte Thunderbolt 3 certified motherboard, it will solve "Billboard Device" errors including "error 10":<br />
</p>
<p>On the Gigabyte website we are instructed to download and install a firmware update to upgrade to Thunderbolt 3 capability (http://www.gigabyte.com/support-downloads/Utility.aspx#de). The instructions say:
<br />
<br />
"Please follow the steps instructed after executing Thunderbolt FW Update Tool, remove the system power cord for at least 30 seconds after FW update. Thunderbolt function will be available after system powers on."
<br />
<br />
The problem is the wording in these instructions, what it SHOULD say is this:<br />
<br />
1) Download the zip file and decompress it.<br />
2) Run the setup file and install the program (this will take 2-3 minutes and will have several steps)</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Note: it appears a lot of people (including me) stopped here and assumed the update was complete, however, this is not the case!</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>3) After the program has finished installing go to C:\program files (x86)\GIGABYTE\flashTBT and run the file "flashTBT_100.exe". This program will flash the BIOS and upgrade it to Thunderbolt 3 capability.<br />
<br />
So yeah, that's it! Everything is working great now. It's a really simple fix, but until Gigabyte updates the wording in their instructions I suspect people are going to continue to have this problem.<br />

<p>They dont come with the flashTBT_100.exe file as of the newest downloads for the Gigabyte GA-X99-Designare EX motherboards. I have looked at other thunderbolt drivers and cant find it there either. Basically my USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 port on my computer reads
 as a USB-C port with card readers and the like, but my thunderbolt 3 devices it wont read. I just downloaded and installed v&nbsp;16.1.47.275 of the thunderbolt software from Gigabyte. &nbsp;Also there are no instructions in the .zip (link
<a href="http://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/GA-X99-Designare-EX-rev-10#support-dl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only get the "try improving USB Connection" message or "does not recognize USB device" and I can go no further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try the unplug power source for 30 seconds, but as this is a custom build and I'm pretty sure I've done that already multiple times, I dont hold out much hope</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any and all help is greatly appreciated as I bought this board specifically for the TB 3 capabilities for my line of work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>DPC Latency Audio Crackling - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> earnestz  say:</h3>
<h2>            DPC Latency Audio Crackling</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I originally created a different post but the community moderator that tried to help me hasn't responded for days, despite of the mail I wrote him. I hope that is okay.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>While playing Arma 3 I noticed strange crackling/popping noises in the menu and in-game when there were a lot of background sounds. I found a video of someone else on YouTube who had the same issue:<br />
<a href="http://www.sysnative.com/forums/redirect-to/?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DZ_aRVETLm_s%26feature%3Dyoutu.be" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Arma 3- Crackling and Popping Audio - YouTube</span></a><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><br />
</span>The crackling was also brought to my attention during video playback on YouTube at some occasions. Sometimes videos froze or turned black. I did not think much of it when I first noticed it. A few days ago, I remember having a "nvlddmkm.sys stopped working
 and recovered" warning when the pc came back from sleep mode that I now recognize as another symptom of the issue. I also experienced multiple BSODs caused by nvlddmkm.sys a month or so ago that I suspected to be caused by faulty drivers. However, no BSOD
 has happened to me ever since. Today I got another "nvlddmkm.sys stopped working" notification while I was watching a YouTube video.<br />
<br />
When I googled the sound crackles, I read that there might be a connection to a latency issue with my drivers. I installed LatencyMon (Dpc Latency checker doesn't work with Windows 10). I let it run in the background while I continued playing Arma 3 and it
 confirmed my suspicion. According to LatencyMon, the Nvidia Windows Kernel Mode driver, my old friend Nvlddmkm.sys, is causing the "buffer underruns". I attached screenshots of the LatencyMon results to this post. When I found out that the problem lay with
 my graphics driver, I did a complete clean install of Windows 10. I turned off automatic driver updates and reinstalled all drivers manually from scratch. But the issue persisted. I even plugged in a different pair of speakers to see if my subwoofers were
 failing but still no avail. The new speakers had even worse sound disruptions (strange low tone background noise eve though there was no sound input). I also updated my BIOS.
</p>
<p>I also changed the processor minimum state to 100% in the&nbsp;power plan settings and entered
<span>BCDEDIT /SET DISABLEDYNAMICTICK YES into an elevated command prompt. None of these fixes worked. I also booted the system up in safe mode, I could not reproduce the issue though, as I couldn't run LatencyMon, Microsoft Edge. I was unable to start any
<span>BCDEDIT /SET DISABLEDYNAMICTICK YES into an elevated command prompt. None of these fixes worked. I also booted the system up in safe mode, I could not reproduce the issue though, as I couldn't run LatencyMon, Microsoft Edge. I was unable to start any
 app. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>As advised by ZigZag, I made a system file check with the sfc /scannow command (issues found and repaired). CBS log here:</p>
<p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/o7mm8olgp1g61rl/CBS.log?dl=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tested my GPU with Furmark. It completed a 30 Minute session on the 1280x720 preset without a problem.</p>
<p>Additionally, I tried an older GPU driver. That didn't fix the crackling and latency either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran a Windows Performance Toolkit trace within 40 seconds of gameplay. I hope there is someone who could take a look at it and advise on&nbsp;how to further proceed:</p>
<p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/uxgjt7p45cs2kjy/newDESKTOP-MC0C4RH.10-20-2015.17-00-54.zip?dl=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is another trace recording&nbsp;a latency spike after coming back from sleepmode:</p>
<p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/essgy6fzxvbubke/Sleep%20modeDESKTOP-MC0C4RH.10-20-2015.16-17-22.Standby_1.zip?dl=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be very grateful if you&nbsp;could take a look at these as I really don't have any more options. There is one more thing: I&nbsp; installed Arma 3 and LatencyMon on a different machine also running Windows 10. It showed almost exactly the same symptoms, including
 the audio popping and the latency spikes. How is that possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>
