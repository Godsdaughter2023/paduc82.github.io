<h2>            Fill form fields with same name</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, i want to find&nbsp;the easiest way to fill the same content in two form fields from a word document, only writting the data in the first of them.</p>
<p>I think in filling in "name" field across the whole document (form), no matter the number of occurrences it has.</p>
<p>It would be appreciated if it solves the problem without programming macros or visual basic code, because the documents will be managed for administrative personal.</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

<p>For checkboxes &amp; radio buttons, you need an 'on exit' macro attached to the formfields to initiate whatever action you require. For that, see:<br />

    <title>Equation editor preferences - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gh541  say:</h3>
<h2>            Equation editor preferences</h2>
                    Hi everyone,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've received a document containing over 175 equations that were created using Word's built-in equation editor. I now need to convert those equations to MathType equations using the add-on software called "MathType".&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In MathType, you're able to save a preferences file in which contains information such as the typeface, font size, symbol positioning, etc. of all new equations created with MathType. Before converting all of the original equations, I need to find out
 what the original settings are so that once the equations have been converted they look like the original ones.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've done a test and have found that some of the symbols aren't the same size as the originals so I'm assuming that I'm using incorrect settings in Mathtype.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I wondered if anyone knows where I can find the settings for new equations in Word's inbuilt editor so I can copy them across before doing the conversion in MathType?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Really appreciate any help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance.</div>

I haven't seen him around for a while, but Bob Matthews of Design Science, the makers of MathType has been very helpful in the past.</p>

<h2>            Nokia E71 Exiting an application</h2>
                    Hi I have the Nokia E71 and I have used blackberries, windows mobile, UIQ, and the Iphone, but I like symbian the most. Yet, exiting an application is so annoying. Normally you can change it so the phone end call button can be set to exit and application
 and not just hide it, but I cant figure out how to do that on the E71. The only way to exit an application is go to options and then exit. Is there anyway to set a key to automatically exit an application?

            The E71-1 should automatically have the feature installed, which is not changeable, that quits applications when hitting the Red Phone/end key.<br />
<br />
If this is rally not working for you then an easier way is to hold down the Menu/Home key. A list will appear in the top left of the display with all the open applications. Simply scroll to the one you want to quit and hit the delete/backspace key.

            Note that some applications do not exit with the red/hangup key. It is default behaviour (since S60 2nd Edition Feature Pack 3), but the application developer can write the application so that it does not happen.<br />
<br />
In other words, whether it works or not depends on the application.

            I'm also using E71-1 but it seems mine is not having any default application exiting thing when I press the red key straight away, I guess its cool to exit apps from the list as you stated..

<p>Hello Firedog</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes I did notice, but for some reason or another on my hotmail it never changed to the out look layout till a couple weeks ago(my wife was mad lol). also I use a&nbsp; email client Iceweasel (Linux version) a variation of&nbsp; Thunderbird. So i haven't went&nbsp; to
 the actual web site client for awhile. but my question still wasn't answered. While after reading your msg and doing a little research. I still wounder, &nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p>no I am not a end of days person. I&nbsp; just like wondering about things. the below is some questions about the new and improved
<a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
privacystatement</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;If there is a legitimate reason for some of this i would love to hear it. As long as it is in the&nbsp; scope of an email provider as this is what it was just an email provider
</p>
<p>
</p><p>ok some questions</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. <span>Microsoft collects data to operate effectively and provide you the best experiences with our products...its an email service we it was when is the last time the post office collected random bits of data so they can improve there service ?</span></p>
<p>2.We share your personal data with your consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any product you have requested or authorized........ Again it is a or was an email service what transactions ? I just want my mail
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.</p>
<p><strong>Name and contact data</strong>. We collect your first and last name, email address, postal address, phone number, and other similar contact data.
</p>
<p><strong>Credentials</strong>. We collect passwords, password hints, and similar security information used for authentication and account access.</p>
<p><strong>Demographic data</strong>. We collect data about you such as your age, gender, country, and preferred language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now some of the above I get as they need some of this infomation for the system to work correctly. so my question is this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Name contact details why do they need this and why do they need to give it on to there 3d parties (police or FBI excluded ) &lt;-- That i understand</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Credentials .... I made the account with them why do they need to collect it as it was already given
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Demographic.... again why is this important in the scope of an email provider.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I still don't know how Email isn't protected just like normal Mail as it is the same thing only electronically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>just wondering </p>

<h2>            Scroll bar</h2>
                    Hello all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This little issue has been driving me crazy. I have an excel spreadsheet, and the scroll bar at the bottom is tiny and scrolls over information too quickly if I drag it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(see the image of what I'm talking about here:&nbsp;<a href="http://i.imgur.com/tp7IWAc.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/tp7IWAc.png</a>&nbsp;)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have attempted all possible solutions listed in every way (doing the control+shift+right arrow for columns, then right click deleting; pressing Ctrl+home to find last cell with data, and that's always way before where the scrollbar goes; and clicking
 the clear all function for the columns). Literally every single thing I've tried has ended with failure. I'm at my wits end over here because even after hours of research and tinkering, the issue is still there. Would anyone be able to help me out with this
 problem?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Thomas</div>

            <p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>I will assist you with the issue you are facing with Excel file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need some details:</p>
<p>Is the issue only with the particular file or all files?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue is with particular file then try repairing the file and check if it helps:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/820741" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/820741</font></a> (Open and repair)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above step fails, copy the contents of the file to new file and then check in new file if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the above step helps.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            There is no way to do that. That’s for security purposes. If you happen to use a password saving addin in your browser, it may be able to show it to you.

<h2>            How do you remove duplicates on Excel online&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi. Myself and some of my fellow students have a question. I use Excel 2016 on my computer and do not enjoy working on documents on the web, but I am asking to try to help them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our "DATA" tab some of us only have a few options: "refresh selected connections", "refresh all connections", "calculate workbook", and "sort ascending" or "sort descending". We need to remove duplicates. We are working on a mock document for health records
 and we have an assignment where we are to use the "Remove Duplicates" function to remove duplicates. It proves difficult for those of us without that button.</p>
<p>How do you remove duplicates on Excel online? Thank you!!!</p>

    <title>Updating multiple worksheets in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike_67  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updating multiple worksheets in Excel</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I have a workbook with five worksheets.&nbsp; The master worksheet shows all work orders for the various groups in my work center.&nbsp; The next four worksheets are for each of the four work groups in my work center and show only the work orders for that work group.&nbsp;
 Currently, I enter work order information on the master worksheet then copy and past the row to the appropriate work groups worksheet.&nbsp; It works, it's not terribly difficult, but it can be time consuming updating several work orders in this manner.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to set my master worksheet so that when I add a new work order, or update and existing one, that information is automatically copied to the appropriate work sheet?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Mike<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, it is possible, any number of ways - macros, formulas, event code. But a better way is to use only one worksheet, and apply data filters to your data. Choose which group you want to see details on from the dropdown at the top of the "Group" column -
 or choose all to see everything. Much better - you only enter data once, it can never get out of sync, and you see what you want to see. You can filter on other columns as well, and you may learn something more by playing with the filtering that you would
 by just grouping by group.</p>

<p>On the View Ribbon, click on "One Page" This will zoom to fit exactly one whole page on screen, but as you zoom in or out (eg using Ctrl + scroll wheel) it will stick to only showing a column of pages which is a single page wide.</p>
<p>If you click on "page width" then this will change to 2 or more pages wide if you zoom out far enough, as Jeeped describes.</p>

            At lower zoom levels while in<em> Print Layout</em> view, Word will always display two pages in a multiple page document. You can switch to another view mode (e.g.<em> Draft</em>) or raise the zoom level to show
 a single page. Resizing the Word application window to something smaller than full screen will also reduce the display to a single page is there is not enough screen real estate to show two pages.

    <title>Microsoft Word - How to Show Footer Information in Front of Image - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Word - How to Show Footer Information in Front of Image</h2>
                    <p>Hello, all:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running into a bit of an issue with Word, and I was hoping someone might be able to assist. I have an image that I am placing at the bottom of each page of my document (think of it as a visual footer). I am having trouble figuring out how to display
 automatic page numbers (within the footer) in front of the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first assumption was to set the image to the back&nbsp;in terms of the arrangement - that did not work, as the page number footer remains hidden. Setting the image/word wrap to different settings also did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I had finally found a solution by creating an 8.5 x 11in image with the footer at the bottom, and setting the document background to the image. Everything looked fine until you scrolled in/out as the background then changed - it would also never
 show up in Print Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how I can achieve having page numbers at the bottom of the page show through the image?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.<br />
</p>

<p>If both the image and the page number are in the footer, there should be no problem doing this. Set the image to be behind text.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 365 contacts not syncing</h2>
                    <p>Using Outlook for Mac, Version 15.33., part of Office 365 subscription</p>
<p>I've imported 1,500 contacts into Outlook on my Mac and this works fine. The problem is that these contacts do not sync up to the cloud-based version of Office 365. My calendar and email is syncing fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to the web-version of my Outlook, I can see the calendar and emails, but non of my contacts. And I assume this also explains why I also cannot see my contacts on my phone or ipad mobile versions of the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get my contacts to sync properly?</p>

<p>Thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I clearly know your current situation. Please manually drag a test contact in the
<strong>Address Book </strong>to <strong>Contacts</strong> and check if it’s update to your Outlook for Mobile applications. If the test contact can be found in your Outlook for Mobile application, please move all the contacts in your
<strong>Address Book </strong>to <strong>Contacts</strong>. </p>

    <title>Windows Phone 7 Feedback - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaapn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Phone 7 Feedback</h2>
                    
<p>I've been using my Samsung Omnia 7 since December 14th, and love it so far.</p>
<p>My feedback:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Multi-tasking</strong> </span>
: Yes, I miss it, and would really love to have it added.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Messaging</strong> </span></p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Delivery report</span> : does not recognise numbers (so it always displays it as 'unknown contact')<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">MMS</span> : Sending a MMS for me only works like this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Go to Messaging<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Start a new message<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Hit the Attach icon<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) Attach the pic<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) Send it<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What doesn't work is:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Go to a picture<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Select Share<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Select Messaging<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) Send the message<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I do the last, it does appear to send the message, but the receiving party never<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; receives anything.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">MMS 2</span> : No delivery reports for MMS messages.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>E-Mail</strong> </span>: No option to Select All messages at once.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Start Menu tiles</strong> </span>
: give us an option to turn 1-size Icons into 2, and vice-versa.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Live tiles</strong> </span>: sometimes stop updating. Removing and re-adding the icon to the start menu sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. Then uninstalling and reinstalling works.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apps where I noticed this problem: The Weather Channel, Bezz.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps app bugs, perhaps OS.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Phone ('dialing')</strong> </span>
:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No way to 'quickly' call people from your address book. I don't mean last calls. What I mean is this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) You go to Phone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Press Keypad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) You start typing a number, or more importantly in this case: a name, it finds the name in your address book, and you can call from there.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>People</strong> </span>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Linking: 'Can't link two people who both have joined your Windows Live network'<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Explanation: I have several people who have more than 1 Messenger/Live account (let's say 1 for work, 1 personal). I want to link these to 1 contact in my address list, but can't because of the above mentioned message.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Application list</strong> </span>
: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no way to search for apps, making it hard in long lists.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suggestions: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) Make the (Bing) Search button work in the list, giving you the possibility to search.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) Add Letters/Numbers like you have in People, so you can quickly jump to that letter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) Add a search box at the top, where you can enter text and it searches for (partial) matches<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Marketplace</strong> </span>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seems to be the app which crashes/stops responding for me the most. Only restarting the phone fixes it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Options to search:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally I like to keep track of Free, New apps. You can look for New apps, and for Free apps,<br />
but you can't search for Free, New apps. So give us better search options.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make Marketplace internationally (i.e. I would love to see all apps from all English speaking countries, even<br />
when I'm from the Netherlands)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Office</strong> </span>: No way to pin individual apps to the Start menu (i.e. Word, OneNote).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally I only want to use OneNote, and want to just press 1 button in my start menu to start it, not two.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right now I'm using a free app called "Light Notes" for the simple reason that it's an app which I can put directly on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my start menu.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Facebook integration</strong> </span>
:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Missing features:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uploading multipe pictures at once (making it easy to select multiple pictures (tick boxes?)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Making it possible to upload pictures to a different Album than Mobile Uploads<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No option to Caption your own pictures (at least not possible in the pictures hub for me; I can however post comments there, and it does display any caption if present)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No option to Tag people in pictures<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Volume buttons</strong> </span>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No way to toggle between Sound on/off and/or Vibrate on/off. I can put the Volume down to 0, but then it will still keep vibrating, unless I go to settings and turn it off there.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For me this would be logical: lets say your volume is on with vibrate. You turn your volume down.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it 1st reaches 0, the Volume goes off, but Vibrate stays on.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn the volume down even more (let's say to -1), and then vibrate also turns off.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And turning the volume back up does it in reverse. Of course that would mean that it would always turn<br />
vibrate back on when your volume goes on. Perhaps add the usual Sound profiles most phones have).<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Camera</strong> </span>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On my phone, the quality of the pics *can* be very good, but 75% of my pictures are very very bad because<br />
they seem out of focus, or it appears if I would be shaking while taking the pictures, which is not the case.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This happens indoor and outdoors for me. Very disappointing, none of my NYE pics were usuable.</p>
<p>EDIT: Seems I'm a noob and didn't know I had to focus my camera by half-pressing the button for a short while</p>
<p>before taking a pic (never had to do this on my old Touch HD).</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Settings</strong> </span>:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give us an option to put options from the Settings or submenus there on the Start Menu. Personally I would put WiFi there.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Bing</strong> </span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doesn't find anything Local for the Netherlands (0).<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Other</strong> </span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Missing Dutch Word Completion. Obviously I knew this when purchasing it, but I hope this will be added to *all* phones, not just the localized versions for Holland/Belgium.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Keyboard</strong> </span>: no option to switch input language quickly when typing (could put this to any button with a Long Press I guess)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Live/Zune</strong> </span>: give an option to change Country. Right now I have it set up with US as a country (because I'm from the Netherlands; if I would use that I would have no martketplace). When/if NL get's
 it's Marketplace, it means I'll have to <br />
get a new Live account and setup my phone again.</p>

<p>These are all good suggestions. Though there's a few things that caught my attention .</p>
<blockquote>

You may also want to share feedback about the camera with the manufacturer of your phone (HTC, Samsung, LG). Some aspects of the implementation of the camera are up to the manufacturer instead of up to Microsoft.&nbsp;
<blockquote><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Bing</strong> </span>
:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doesn't find anything Local for the Netherlands (0).<br />
<br />
<br />
</blockquote>
<p>This is a known issue :-( Right now I think Bing local search is only fully implemented in USA.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Live/Zune</strong> : give an option to change Country. Right now I have it set up with US as a country (because I'm from the Netherlands; if I would use that I would have no martketplace). When/if NL get's it's Marketplace, it means I'll

<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
A conversation briefly came up about this in another forum. I don't know the full story on this but it has something to do with content restrictions for the videos and music available through Zune. You'll find that it's possible to change the country on a Live
 ID but for a Zune account once it is created it inherits the country from your LiveID and then your Zune account's region is set in stone never to change again. Country restrictions on media services seem to be common (ex:I've seen new barriers put up over
 time to ensure Hulu.com or Netflix.com are not available outside the USA). I've never seen the contractual obligations that Microsoft has with the content providers, but if the contract providers have a say-so in this restriction it may take more than Microsoft
 wanting to lift this restriction for a change to occur here.

<p>All great suggestions.&nbsp; Personally I found the ability to dial people very fast and wanted to share some of the techniques I use in case they may help.&nbsp; I use one of these four methods:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Hold the start button and say "Call John Mobile".&nbsp; This is the fastest way for me.&nbsp; Voice recognition is supurb.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; In areas where I would feel stupid speaking aloud, I just tap the People hub, tap the "A" to bring up the alphabet grid, tap "J", tap "John", then tap&nbsp;"call mobile".&nbsp; All of my contacts are waded through and the call initiated in 5 quick taps without
 having to "type" anything on a keyboard.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; For those I call often, I pinned their contact tile to the Home menu.&nbsp;Tap tile, Tap number.&nbsp; 2 quick&nbsp;taps.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; For those I know I have a text messaging conversation with, I tap Messages, tap conversation, tap name, tap Call.&nbsp; 4 quick taps.</p>

            My problem with your suggestion: too many tiles build up on start, Thats way too many screens to go through to make a call-For me its incredibly inconvenient. I Suggest Windows phone introduce an app or program that allows the user to designate any button
 on the phone for push to talk as an option in settings and offer a setting that allows the key pad to automatically engage when the user opens the phone or pushes a key on the qwerty board.

<p>The only reason I got this phone is because it has a radio, 3.5mm jack, and qwerty board I couldnt find any other att phone with this combo (radio seems to be the limiting factor). If it werent for the family plan with my mom I would be with sprint and have
 a Logically designed HTC evo phone. With The LG Quantum I constantly feel like im using a very counter intuitive device. Also Im not please that there isnt an official site for window 7 phone suggestions and bugs.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestions for the Windows Phone:</strong></p>
<p>1. (Please) ability to save camera settings</p>
<p>2. Option on settings to designate any button on your phone for push to talk or option in setting to choose for the dial pad to automatically engage when you open the phone or press qwerty key</p>
<p><strong>3. Ability to send/attach video or audio or both with text messages or email or anything for that matter its just not there</strong></p>
<p>4. Ability to have speaker for the music player (only there for the radio)</p>
<p><strong>5. Ability to close a window instead of having to back out of it with the back button (come on). Close tabs seem to only be available for web usage and they suck - it doesnt feel natural to access them as does alot of stuff on this phone.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>6. I cannot stand having to slide that screen up before i can access my phone - there are just too many obstacles with the phone when you want access too your stuff. There should be an option to remove it.</p>
<p><strong>7. Once again it take 4 steps before i can even make a call (Hello random emergency - please wait while i go through several unnecessary screens before i can call for help) or you have to pay 2 dollars from market place for a dial pad tile that doesnt
 even include call history or names.</strong></p>
<p>8. Why does the windows phone have a people tile and a phone tile. The phone tile has everything the people tile does plus the history. Its almost like it wasnt well thought out or something.</p>
<p>9. Data connection usage!! Oh my gosh i just turn off my data connection for now</p>
<p>10. Some email folders are not available and yes selecting more than one email.</p>
<p>11. Can you make the onscreen qwerty keys alittle fatter or give users the option to change the size.</p>
<p><em>There's more i just cant remember it now</em></p>
<p>Now for the actual phone due to windows having its specifications for phone manufactuers</p>

            <p>Ok - let's get serious here.&nbsp; One of the most important issues is tethering my Samsung Focus and creating a WiFi hotspot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many say this capability is hidden because it uses a lot of power.&nbsp; If this is the case - stop treating us like children.&nbsp; Make sure you note that and let everyone know and enable the feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is ridiculous.&nbsp; I want to tether my HP Touchpad to my Samsung Focus and the only feasible way, without hacks (which I don't want to use) is to enable a WiFi hotspot.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know what Microsoft?&nbsp; It's my phone and I want this right/ability.&nbsp; NOW rather than sometime in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what are you going to do about it?&nbsp; Or do I have to say enough and switch all my systems to Android or Mac?&nbsp; I have been a faithful MS user for almost 30 years - but I have just about had enough of this silliness.</p>

            After using other Operating Systems, I have settled with Windows Phone. &nbsp;I am happy with all things. &nbsp;However, I can only make one suggestion. &nbsp;Please enlarge the onscreen keyboard to use more of the screen. &nbsp;There is a lot of dead space and my fingers
 would appreciate it.
<div><br />
<div>As I stated before... I hope to receive many updates to my phone improving the performance. &nbsp;Something Android users can't understand. &nbsp;Additionally, I enjoy the skydive (free in my case) and ability to be respected as a consumer, something iPhone owners
 can't understand!</div>

    <title>OneNote search function for handwritten notes and inserted pdfs - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            OneNote search function for handwritten notes and inserted pdfs</h2>
                    In OneNote for Mac, if I try to search for handwritten notes or text that is part of an inserted pdf, it always says that there are no results found. The only thing OneNote is able to search is any text that was typed in. I have already tried to uninstall
 and reinstall microsoft, but it did not fix the issue. I have OneNote version 16.19 on macOS 10.14.1.

            You have chosen the category as Infopath. Is it a problem of copying the table from Excel and pasting into Outlook?
<br />
<br />Are you having some knowledge of VBA as it will require customization from you?

            Consult Ron De Bruin's resources. This covers almost all screnarios

<br />Probably "Mail Range/Selection in the body of the mail" will be something which you can use.

    <title>Outlook emails are being sent to Yahoo Spam - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dford17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook emails are being sent to Yahoo Spam</h2>
                    I use Outlook 2010 to send order confirmations to customers through a Microsoft Office 2010 mail merge. Emails being sent in a single merge can range from 30-400 emails depending on the sale. I have been receiving a number of complaints from customers
 saying that they are not receiving my emails. Turns out that all of the customers experiencing an issue have a yahoo email address and my emails are being sent directly to their spam/junk folder. I am unable to send a message to each customer telling them
 how to adjust their spam mail settings and to add me to their contacts. We are losing sales because customers are not able to pick up and pay for their orders without the emailed order confirmation. Any suggestions?

<p>Outlook doesn't control want the recipient(s) flag as SPAM so not sure what exactly it is that you're expecting. Evidently the material you are sending is deemed as SPAM by the Yahoo servers either because of the IP address/domain name from which the messages
 are being sent or the content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your issue is with Yahoo and/or your ESP if your email server has been flagged which could occur on any kind of shared type of environment where another person is the actual cause of the problem but&nbsp;it has absolutely nothing to do with Outlook.</p>

    <title>Powerpoint borders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david_182  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint borders</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Is there a way to see what colour borders are within tables in powerpoint?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very easy to assign new borders, but without knowing what the old border or existing border colours are, it is very difficult to find the right colour to match.&nbsp; So to change one border I might need to change all borders within all my tables. That
 is a pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The equivalent in word would be done via the borders and shading dialog box.&nbsp; But that is missing under the powerpoint menus (and I have not been able to find a shortcut, perhaps because context based menus don't allow you to explore easily.&nbsp; A bit like
 "you can have the map for Newcastle when you get there, but only then...&nbsp; good for keeping menu items down, terrible if you want to find something or find new functionalities)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

    <title>Office 365 OneNote desktop shared access to Office 2010 &#38; 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stur2009  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 365 OneNote desktop shared access to Office 2010 &#38; 2013 desktop versions</h2>
                    <p>Good Morning.</p>
<p>I have Office 2013 installed on several computers, and recently decided to go with Office 365 for the older(running Office 2010) and newer computers(no Office activated)</p>
<p>So I have activated Office 365 on 1 computer and I am trying to sync OneNote(2016 desktop version) between Office 2010 and 2013 desktop versions.
</p>
<p>I have created a OneNote notebook in Office 365(from the desktop app of 365) and 'shared' that Notebook with another computer with different log in credentials. Works…except that instead of that 'shared'
 notebook being available to 'open' from MY OneDrive account, therefore being available to select "File, Open" for sync to the desktop version of 2010 and 2013…it appears as a web page link in the 365 Office OneDrive!</p>
<p>I have followed many different threads, but nothing appears to have my issue.</p>
<p>I have not tried the reverse…sending a link from 2010/2013 OneNote back to Office 365 desktop version of OneNote.</p>
<p>Simply question: Is there a work around for syncing between old Office desktop and new Office 365 desktop (web based Programs)?</p>
<p>In anticipation of a reply. Thank you</p>

            <p>Usually in the E-Mail which is sent to the account/person you share a notebook to there should be two links. One pointing to OneNote Online (opening the notebook in the web browser) and one to open it directly in the local OneNote client.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, if you opened it in the browser there should be a button on the page to open it in your local OneNote instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once it has been opened that way in OneNote 2010/2013/2016, it should remain available from the OPen command in the File menu.</p>

            <p>I don't know of an version of Excel - PC or Mac - that has an "edit tab"... for "fast access" or any other purpose.
<em>Preferences</em> on a Mac are roughly the equivalent of <em>Options</em> on a PC, but if you're comparing Excel for Mac to Excel for Windows, you're absolutely correct -- there are significant differences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, you haven't specified which "functions" you're looking for or what your basis of comparison might be. Unless you provide accurate descriptive details it's impossible to offer a solution... or even to determine whether there is one.</p>

            <p>Your observation is correct. Menus and toolbars can not be customized. The Ribbon cannot be customized. The Quick Access Toolbar can not be customized. That's just the way it is in Office 2016 for Mac.</p>

            Trying to add a few buttons to the "quick menu" (including the Save, undo and redu buttons) which was very easy and possible in PC. I think this option will also allow to add many other action buttons (might be that "fast access" is one of them). Do you
 know how to add this option? <br />

            <p>If you're referring to the <em>Quick Access Toolbar</em> [QAT], customization currently is restricted to the few items supplied in the dropdown list. Click the down arrow (inverted ⏏) at the right end of the QAT to access the few commands that can be added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mac Office 2016 simply does not have customization features for the QAT or the Ribbon comparable to those provided in the PC versions.</p>
