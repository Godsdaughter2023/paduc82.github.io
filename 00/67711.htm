    <title>Why does Adobe Flash Player 10 Activex appear twice in Add&#47;Remove - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does Adobe Flash Player 10 Activex appear twice in Add&#47;Remove Programs&#63;</h2>
                    I tried asking this in an Adobe forum but got no answer. I'm using Windows XP SP3. When I go into the control panel Add or Remove Programs, I see Adobe Flash Player 10 Activex listed twice. Same name, and both show the last time I accessed them was 8/14/2010.
 The second one is slightly different in that it shoes a size of 2.42MB. Why the duplication? Can I remove one? For that matter, if it hasn't been used since August of last year, do I need it at all?

            The information about "Last used" and "size" in Add/Remove Programs is notoriously inaccurate.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Uninstall both of the Adobe Flash Player entries from Add/Remove Programs.<br />
<br />
Open Windows Explorer and go to C:\Windows\system32\Macromed\Flash<br />
<br />
The current Flash ActiveX control is Flash10s.ocx.&nbsp; There are several other auxiliary files as well.&nbsp; If there are any files with earlier letters after the 10 (e.g., Flash10p.ocx), delete them.<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 Backup Error 0x8007007B - please help&#33;</h2>
                    When I try to backup my computer to an external hard drive, the backup runs for 16 hours and I get the following message - "The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect Error Code: 0x8007007B". I have tried backing up to 4 different
 external hard drives and only one of them worked.&nbsp; I have tried looking for answers on this forum but there are so many different answers I don't know which one is right and for some of them I don't have the tabs mentioned in the system folder.&nbsp; Any help would

            Hi Con.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Which is it Google Drive or OneDrive?  One is from Google, the other from Microsoft.
<br />
<br />I'm assuming it's Google since it offers 15gb free storage while OneDrive only offers 5.  
<br />
<br />What I do when I reach the Google Drive backup (allows you to sync your User folders) limit is right click to Quit in Settings until I move some files out of it and turn back on to sync again.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  If not just ask back anything else you need.  I'll be standing by here to help as needed with any of the steps, and will continue to help until the problem is resolved.

            Hi 
<br />
<br />IÂ´m an Independant Advisor for Microsoft Community
<br />
<br />I will try my best effort to help you.
<br />
<br />First of all you combine two different systems it is Google Drive and One Drive.
<br />
<br />You can pause your syncing in the icon of your drive in task bar. Also you can move files from your drive in you computer so you can make free space in your drive
<br />
<br />Let me know if this help you in your issue

            Mine may be different because it's Google Backup &amp; Sync which uses  Drive to sync your User folders.  When I right click it's cloud icon in System Tray and choose Settings (...) it offers Quit Backup &amp; Sync.

    <title>Installations failing on external drives - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scorchingsanity  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installations failing on external drives</h2>
                    
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>About a month or so ago, I decided that it was time for an external hard drive as my space was very limited on my Xbox One. I went out and bought a Seagate 3 TB expansion, and it consistently had issues with installing games. Installations would start, sometimes
 get to a certain point, head back to the queue, begin installing again for a few seconds, then the installation would just stop. Attempt to continue the installation did not bring any new results and neither did cancelling and restarting the entire installation
 process. I went ahead and returned the hard drive to where I got it from after reading that Seagates have a higher failure rate than some of the other big names out there. Just under a couple weeks back, I went ahead and bought a Western Digital My Book 3
 TB external drive from Amazon, as that particular one popped up many times in articles I read about good hard drives for the Xbox One. When it first arrived, I installed four games onto it, a couple of which being Grand Theft Auto V and The Evil Within. After
 having not used the hard drive too much over the last week, I decided to play The Evil Within. It required an update and after starting the update, my hard drive began to have the same issue my old one had. The installation stopped a couple times before eventually
 finishing up. So then I tried installing Titanfall and my hard drive had the same issue installing it and its DLC. Each item downloaded to a certain percentage before repeating the aforementioned process. I tried installing Forza 5 and LEGO Marvel Super Heroes,
 which also had the same issue. I can still play the games that are already on the hard drive just fine, but I can't install new ones on it. It's becoming increasingly frustrating attempting to find a hard drive that will actually work properly for me. Whenever
 I search around, it seems there are a lot of people having issues with various hard drives working consistently on their Xbox One. Is there just some sort of issue between external drives and the Xbox One that is unsolvable at the moment, or is it possible
 I'm just getting defective drives? I'm not against the idea that it is indeed a coincidence and that I'm just unlucky, I just don't think that is the case. I've just sent an email to Western Digital about this issue and will await to hear back from them. Does
 anyone have any sort of answer for this? Microsoft or otherwise, I&nbsp; would greatly appreciate any help.</p>

<p>Hey buddy,</p>
<p>I do not beleive its a problem with your hard drive. When I read you'd bought a seagate 3TB, my first thought was that it was an HDD issue, however you then went out and replaced it with a pretty decent one, so I am now thinking that it isn't the HDD.</p>
<p>From what I have heard and read, you might need to reformat the hard drive to get it working properly again. This has worked for another user, which is why I suggest it. He moved all of his stuff back to the internal drive (or as much as he could), the reformatted
 the drive, the moved and reinstalled everything back to the External HDD.</p>
<p>To format the hard drive, do the following: </p>
<p>1.Press the Menu button, select Settings, select System, then select Manage storage.
</p>
<p>2.Select your storage device, then select Format for games &amp; apps.</p>
<p>Really hopes this sorts it out for you mate :)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Denaz</p>

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>I would suggest checking the drive for errors and if the console itself is not causing the drives to malfunction. I would recommend hooking up the drive to a PC and running WD Data Lifeguard Diagnostic tool. It should give you a pretty good idea of the condition
 of the drive. Here's a link: <a href="http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=zYc5CG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
products.wdc.com/.../kb.ashx</a></p>
<p>If the drive is faulty, I could recommend checking out WD My Passport X as it is specifically designed to expand your console's capacity and is optimized for best performance. Here's a link:

<p>I had the same issues with certain games and apps not installing on the external USB 3.0 Lacie Rugged Mini 2TB HDD.</p>
<p>Once the games or apps would not install on the external HDD it will not move to the external HDD either.</p>
<p>The HDD is not faulty. &nbsp;I believe it is fine. &nbsp;I tried with several brands myself and they are fine on the Macs and PCs.</p>
<p>I believe it is digital rights management issues along with Xbone system software issues.</p>
<p>I hope Xbone engineering team resolve this soon as I cannot buy any games from the store since I cannot install on the external HDD.</p>

<h2>            The request could not be performed because of I&#47;O device error while opening USB flash drive</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title: USB Flash Drive Issues</strong></p>
<p>So I tried to open my flash drive on my Dell Inspiron 15 with Windows 8 today in order to do an assignment. But for some reason it doesn't open. This is what shows up when I try to open it. I have done a multitude of things that are supposed to fix the problem
 with the ports themselves but nothing seems to work which makes me think it's the actual flash drive. I don't know what to do all of my university materials are in there so I really need it to work or at least find a way to recover at least most of my files.
 Thank you for the help in advanced.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/699040d5-964d-4018-a963-1e8d6d2b07cb" /><br />

            <p>Sorry for the late reply Jose. I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue.</p>
<p>It could occur due to one or more of the below reasons:<br />
1. The currently loaded USB driver has become unstable or corrupt.<br />
2. Your PC requires an update for issues that may conflict with a USB flash drive and Windows.<br />
3. Windows may be missing other important updates hardware or software issues.<br />
4. Your USB controllers may have become unstable or corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the USB flash drive on different computer to make sure that the issue is not with the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try the below Methods:<br />
Method 1: Uninstall and then reconnect the USB flash drive:<br />
This method resolves issues where the currently loaded USB driver has become unstable or corrupt.<br />
1. Go to Search, type Device Manager in the Search box<br />
2. Click Device Manager from the returned list. <br />
3. Click Disk Drives from the list of hardware<br />
4. Right-click the USB flash drive with the issue, and click Uninstall.<br />
5. After the flash drive is uninstalled, unplug it.<br />
6. Wait for 1 minute and then reconnect the USB flash drive. The driver should automatically load.<br />
7. Check for the USB drive in Windows Explorer</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Method 2: Reinstall USB controllers.<br />
This method resolves steps where the currently loaded USB driver has become unstable or corrupted.<br />
1. Click Start, then type device manager in the Search box, then click Device Manager.<br />
2. Expand Universal Serial Bus controllers. Right click a device and click Uninstall. Repeat for each device.<br />
3. Once complete, restart your computer. Your USB controllers will automatically install.</p>
<p>

            Hi  DeBenedictus 
<br />
<br />Try restarting Windows Explorer process to see if it helps.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Processes tab
<br />Scroll down to Windows Explorer then select it
<br />Click Restart
<br />
<br />If that does not work:
<br />
<br />uninstall your display driver:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Check if it now works.
<br />
<br />Still not working?
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Activity History 
<br />Scroll down to Clear activity history
<br />Click Clear
<br />
<br />Restart your computer.

<p>Hi&nbsp;<strong>DeBenedictus</strong>, my name is <strong>Paul</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need your help, <em>please</em>. Based upon your original post "... Some Items can be removed without a problem. However, others just darken out and will not remove. â¦ ", I have a like kind problem with one activity event from January 14th. At least for
 me, it&nbsp;appears to be&nbsp;an annoying problem&nbsp;and not&nbsp;necessarily a sad situation that can't be fixed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system information from: Windows Logo (Start) &gt;&nbsp;Settings &gt;&nbsp;System &gt; About&nbsp;&gt; (under section) Windows specifications &gt; (it reads)&nbsp;Edition Windows 10 Home, Version 1809, Installed on 12/20/2018, OS Build 17763.292. I am up to date according to Microsoft
 as of this posting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should note, as of now, I&nbsp;have not perform the&nbsp;second step&nbsp;listed&nbsp;in Andre's (<strong>Andre&nbsp;for Directly</strong>) response to you. It doesn't seem to be a display issue. Also, and as you stated,&nbsp;"I don't have a "CLEAR BUTTON" at&nbsp;Windows Logo (Start) &gt;&nbsp;Settings
 &gt;&nbsp;Privacy &gt; Activity&nbsp;history &gt; (under section) Clear activity history. What <em>
is</em> present "Clear history for&nbsp;myusername@ domain.com" but&nbsp;is <em>not</em> active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have&nbsp;two questions regarding&nbsp;a point&nbsp;made in your last&nbsp;post on February 2nd.&nbsp;In part you wrote&nbsp;"... My problem as to why it was missing is that an updated&nbsp;needed to be applied. â¦"</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">(1) What particular update might I be missing <em>or</em>&nbsp;if&nbsp;our operating systems are the same and complete with all updates, should I perform the second&nbsp;option offered&nbsp;by Andre&nbsp;and then check for updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">(2)&nbsp;Do you now have a "new" button (e.g. "Clear") to clear activity history
<em>or</em> is "Clear history for&nbsp;myusername@ domain.com" the&nbsp;infamous button and is active
<em>or</em> neither has happened? Perhaps this particular nuance is key to solving this problem,
<em>obviously I don't know at this point.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your time to assist me and&nbsp;look forward to your reply. <strong><em>Thank you kindly,</em> Paul</strong></p>

<p>Hi <strong>Andre</strong>, my name is <strong>Paul</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am writing to replace a lengthy message I posted yesterday and substitute it with&nbsp;my answer to the question that first started this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following is the first paragraph of my reply to <strong>DeBenedictus </strong>
(original poster) about this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">"I need your help, <em>please</em>. Based upon your original post "... Some Items can be removed without a problem. However, others just darken out and will not remove. â¦ ", I have a like kind problem with
<strong>one activity event from January 14th*</strong>. At least for me, it&nbsp;appears to be&nbsp;an annoying problem&nbsp;and not&nbsp;necessarily a sad situation that can't be fixed!"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>*bold added</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In one of my messages on another Microsoft Windows community forum I made&nbsp;a comment about "waiting 30 days" from the date of the&nbsp;event&nbsp;and see if instructions for displaying Timeline events&nbsp;in Task View would cause it to self-delete. Well, that happened
 for me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your participation and I hope this helps other users should there be a need. Best wishes and bye for now, Paul</p>

<p>You will need to purchase the game again as the Steam platform is not cross-compatible with the Xbox platform.

<h2>            Windows 10 64bit, Blue Screen of Death &#40;BSOD&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there have been several posts about this already, but difficult for me to narrow down what my specific resolution to this problem may be. &nbsp;I am currently running Windows 10 Pro, Version 1607, Build 14393.222.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my computer for business purposes, and so I require it to be on basically all the time. &nbsp;I have turned off any power settings that would put it into sleep mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have noticed usually once a day it will restart on its own for no particular reason. &nbsp;Only one day was I able to catch the BLOD appear which advised me my computer would have to be restarted, which it did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I was not quick enough to catch the error. &nbsp;Any help on how to resolve this would be appreciated. &nbsp;This happens too regularly.</p>
                </div>

            <p>Even once is too many.&nbsp; Here's how you can find out what error is happening:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; Right-click the Start button and choose System</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; On the left side, click Advanced System Settings link</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; Click "Settings" under the Startup &amp; Recovery section</p>
<p>4)&nbsp; Turn OFF the "automatically restart" checkbox, then click OK</p>
<p>5)&nbsp; Click OK to save your changes, then close everything and restart your computer so the changes take effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Next time the failure happens, it will wait for you to see the error instead of restarting itself. Then you can take that error and find out what happened.</p>

            Also, it may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a couple of links on using OneDrive (SkyDrive):</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time</p>

            <p>That stop code is nearly universally going to be a driver causing the issue. &nbsp;It's likely with video card drivers, SSD hard drive firmware, and even touchpad drivers such as those from the Synaptics company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the best things you can do first is to go the website for whatever company built the computer. Go to their updates/drivers section, find your model number, and download the latest version of drivers for your model.</p>

                    I have been waiting since that update to try and find a fix for this code. It is now January 2014 a month now and there has been no fix to it. I have called xbox twice about this and all the ways they told me to do didn't do anything. I want to know what
 to do so i can start playing live again. Does anyone know of a fix to the status code 4099-40A3-1380-267F-C000-0185.

<strong>While trying to install the update, I get the message "&nbsp;<em>Can't download the update. To test your connection, open System Settings and select Network Settings, Test Xbox LIVE Connection.</em>&nbsp;" What do I do?&nbsp;</strong>
<p>
If you see this message, please read this entire sticky and try all the solutions mentioned before posting! These solutions are very likely to solve your issue, somake sure you give them all a shot! :)&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solution 1:</strong>&nbsp;Try installing the update again. To do so, follow these steps:&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; </li></ul>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Restart your console. </li><li>Press the&nbsp;<b>Xbox</b>&nbsp;<b>Guide</b>&nbsp;button on your controller (center "X" button on your controller).
</li><li>Go to&nbsp;<b>Settings</b>, and then select&nbsp;<b>System Settings</b>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Network Settings</b>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Wired Network</b>&nbsp;or your wireless network name (if you are prompted to do so).
</li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Test Xbox LIVE Connection</b>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Yes</b>&nbsp;if you are prompted to update your console software. </li></ol>
<p>If this does not resolve your issue, give solution 2 a try!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solution 2:</strong>&nbsp;Make sure you have enough storage space </li></ul>
<div>
<p>The latest console software update requires at least 190 megabytes (MB) of storage space (or 256 MB if you live in Japan). If you do not have enough free space, you need to move or delete some items. See&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/games/xbox-games/manage-games-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Copy,
 move, or delete content</a>.</p>
<p>If your issue is still not resolved, please check out solution 3.<br />
<br />
</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solution 3:</strong>&nbsp;Clear the system cache </li></ul>
<div>
<p>Removing the temporary files on your console might solve the problem. To clear your console's cache, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Restart your console. </li><li>Press the&nbsp;<b>Xbox</b>&nbsp;<b>Guide</b>&nbsp;button on your controller (center "X" button on your controller).
</li><li>Go to&nbsp;<b>System</b>&nbsp;<b>Settings</b>, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Storage</strong>.
</li><li>Highlight your&nbsp;<strong>internal storage device</strong>&nbsp;(Hard Drive or Internal Storage), then&nbsp;<strong>press Y</strong>.
</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Clear System Cache</strong>, then confirm by selecting&nbsp;<strong>Yes.</strong>
</li><li>After the process completes (it will likely be fast!), restart your console.&nbsp;
</li></ol>
<p>After clearing the cache, try the update again. If this does not fix the issue, try solution 4.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solution 4:</strong>&nbsp;Reinsert the storage device </li></ul>
<p>If youâre using an Xbox 360 Memory Unit or a USB flash drive instead of a hard drive, remove and reinsert the memory unit or USB flash drive.<br />
<br />
If you have a hard drive, try&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/accessories/add-remove-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">removing and adding the hard
 drive again</a>.</p>
<p>
After replacing the storage device, try the update again. If this does not resolve this issue, please proceed to the next solution.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solution 5:</strong>&nbsp;Update via a USB Flash Drive or CD-R </li></ul>
<p>The next step would be to update your console using a downloaded file on USB Flash Drive or CD-R prepared in your PC. This method can also be used to apply the update to consoles that do not have access to LIVE.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Copy to a USB flash drive</em></p>
<p>If you cannot connect your Xbox 360 console to the Internet, you can copy the console update from your computer to a USB flash drive and then install it on the console.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>&nbsp;The USB flash drive must use the FAT32 file system.</p>
<ol>
<li>Plug your USB flash drive into a USB port on your computer. </li><li><a href="http://www.xbox.com/system-update-usb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download the update file</a>.
</li><li>Click&nbsp;<b>Save</b>&nbsp;to save the console update .zip file on your computer. </li><li>Unzip the file. If you are using Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7, double-click the .zip file to unzip it.
</li><li>Copy the contents of the .zip file to the root directory of your flash drive.
</li><li>Unplug the USB flash drive from your computer. </li><li>Plug the flash drive into a USB port on your Xbox 360 console. </li><li>Restart the console. </li><li>When the console restarts, the installation program starts automatically. Select&nbsp;<b>Yes</b>&nbsp;when you are prompted to update the new console software.
</li></ol>
<p><em>Burn to a CD or DVD</em></p>
<p>You can update your Xbox 360 console software by downloading the update to your computer from Xbox.com, burning the update to a CD or DVD, and then installing the update on your console. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>On your computer,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/system-update-cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">download the update file</a>.
</li><li>Click&nbsp;<b>Save</b>&nbsp;to save the console update .zip file on your computer. </li><li>Unzip the file. If you are using Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7, double-click the .zip file to unzip it.
</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>If you are using Windows XP, Windows Vista, or Windows 7, double-click the .zip file to unzip it.
</li><li>If you are using an earlier version of Windows, you need to use a special software program to unzip the file (for example, WinZip).
</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Insert a blank, writeable CD or DVD into your computer. </li><li>Copy the contents of the .zip file to the root directory on your CD or DVD, and choose to write (burn) the files to the disc.
</li><li>Once the files have been burned to disc, remove that disc from your computer and insert it into the disc drive on your Xbox 360 console.
</li><li>Restart the console. </li><li>When the console restarts, the installation program starts automatically. Select&nbsp;<b>Yes</b>&nbsp;when you are prompted to update the new console software.
</li></ol>
<p>
<br />
If the issue still persists, please continue to Solution 6.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solution 6:</strong>&nbsp;Simplify your Network Setup&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p>
Sometimes, there is a firewall on your router or modem that is blocking the update from being downloaded. In this case, the fastest way to get that update on your console is simplifying your network setup. To do so:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Establish a direct connection between your console and your modem via an ethernet cable. There should be no other devices plugged into your modem at this point. This will completely bypassing your router or switch (and it's update-blocking firewall!) in
 the process. </li><li>If you have a gateway, you can accomplish the same thing by setting your gateway to "Bridged" mode (please refer to your gateway instructions for information on how to perform this.) This is only a temporary step until the update has been downloaded and
 installed! Once you have completed the update process, you can revert back to your normal network configuration.
</li></ol>
</ol>
<div>If you cannot perform this step due to wireless connections or a Gateway without a "Bridged" mode, please view Solution 6.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<br />
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solution 7:</strong>&nbsp;Disable your firewall </li></ul>
<div>For this, you would need to refer to your router or gateway's manual for help. Usually, there is a way to completely disable the firewall on your network device. Again, this would
 be temporary, and<em>&nbsp;you would only have your console connected to your gateway or router so as to not expose PCs or other devices to risk.&nbsp;</em>Once you have disabled the firewall, restart your console and try to accept the update again. Once you are finished
 downloading the update,&nbsp;<strong><em>please do NOT forget to turn your firewall back on! Leaving your firewall off will expose your PCs or other network devices directly to the internet, which is dangerous!</em></strong></div>
<div><br />
<br />
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solution 8:&nbsp;</strong>Check out your error code for specific instructions.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<div>If you still are not able to get the update downloaded or installed, you are probably receiving an error code, which is typically 6 groups of 4 digits (or letters.) An example of
 an error code like this might be:<em>xxxx-xxxx-xx8x-xxxx-8007-2746</em>&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<h2>            Different BSOD codes every few days after fresh install of Windows</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed a fresh copy of Windows (updated to 1809) on one of my SSD drives and since then I've had nothing but problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some short back story: I attempted to update the firmware on the motherboard, thought I may have borked it, and just decided to start over with Windows and erase all my drives. I installed a fresh OS on the M2 SSD and was on my way updating drivers and whatnot
 when I got a random BS and thought it might have been me updating too many drivers at once. A few days go by with great performance and I get another blue screen error while installing an application different than the first. Just now I recieved two blue screens
 with completely different codes in less than an hour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No overclocking, basic components and updated drivers from ASUS website, please assist! I'm going crazy here!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've included the memory dump, minidump, MSINFO and Speccy of my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help me Microsoft Community, you're my only hope.</p>

            Hi James, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />It's possible your BSODs are due to a hardware issue, but here are some steps to try to narrow down what could be the cause.
<br />
<br />Firstly, try running the System File Checker in case it can repair any corruptions:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type cmd.
<br />- Right-click Command Prompt and run it as administrator.
<br />- Type sfc /scannow
<br />- Press Enter.
<br />
<br />You may also want to run a checkdisk to check your drive's integrity:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type "cmd".
<br />- Right-click Command Prompt and run it as administrator.
<br />- Type ""D:"" (without quotes) and press Enter. If your external drive isn't D, change it to the appropriate letter.
<br />- Type "chkdsk /x /f /r" (without quotes) and press Enter.
<br />
<br />It'll ask you to reboot so it can check the disk. Press Y and your computer will reboot, check your disk and repair any errors.
<br />
<br />You can also run through this Microsoft Support article helping to troubleshoot blue screen errors:
<br />

<br />
<br />Please let me know how you go! Thanks!

            Hello my name is Brad and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community and I wanted to assist my colleagues on fixing your issues with Windows 10 BSODs. 
<br />
<br />From what you shared already, I conclude the actual issue is your motherboard is trying to operate normally with a damaged BIOS image and after a while, the miscommunication within the board is causing the SSD controller to error out leading to your BSOD. 
<br />
<br />1. I would suggest that you, after reviewing the Asus's website for instructions, reflash your BIOS with the latest version, or simply flash AGAIN with the same version. 
<br />2. However, DO NOT FLASH the BIOS with the Windows utility. 
<br />On Asus's support page are instructions on how to flash the motherboard outside of Windows using a USB drive and other methods. 
<br />
<br />SSD's don't fail in a slow way older hard drives do and since this problem is repeating itself- after you did the failed flashing attempt- the damage is the bios image. 
<br />
<br />When you have a moment please I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.

<h2>            all AAA games implayable</h2>
                    hello guys it's been a time that i have this issue that i can't play animore a single AAA game on windows , it's not my specs i have 8gb ram i7 2600 k and gtx 960 but for some raison any game that will consume 78% + ram will start lagging as **** , it's
 not normal to me , i did everything tried to supresse the page file but some games require it and can't launch without it also windows re create another one on it's own anyway , i tried to play with everything closed still lags i tired boosters and that helped
 for some games , with my experiments on my games i notices the more ram they use the more laggy they are , and it only happends if a game would use more then 80% or 75% of my ram , my hdd use become all time high and the game become totally implayable in case
 it's stable in the range of 70 tp 80% use of ram the game is laggy a little until becoming implayable after sometime . well listen guys , usually just cause use less then 80% or 85% at max and it's laggy in the picture i will share i had some programmes running
 also the pc was up for sometime but it should help you understand . this problem was present for 2 years now i sold my soul to have this pc and i'm not even kidding , please help me get the best from it , of may be a downgrad to 7 would salve my problems&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07a004cf-da64-4072-b7ef-aa2eaf60374d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07a004cf-da64-4072-b7ef-aa2eaf60374d" /></a>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you also experiencing this issue when playing other games?</li><li>Does the Disk still shows 100% even if there's no application running the in the background?</li><li>Are you also experiencing lags when performing basic task? </li></ul>

            <p>1- i experience lags only with demanding games in terms of ram usage like i explained in my post , for exemple i have alot issues with deus ex mankind devided , a little with watch dogs 2 and alot just cause 3 , sometimes the witcher 3 but i never ever had
 any problems with other less demanding games , they play pretty well , surprisingly battlefield 1 is the only demanding game that works really well but it doesn't use more then 78% ram</p>
<p>2-no my hdd becomes 100% usage only when the ram is over 78% , well sometimes it happends that the pc gets slow but i think it's just normal because it's quite rare most of the time my pc is fast and workes fine, to be honnest i had some issues with my hdd
 before , that that i upgraded it not detected at the start so i have to open the case and play with the plugs many times before getting it to work properly at that moment i may experience some data lose , but by magic the problem disappear for another mouth
 or two and then it's back again , i don't know i tried tools they tell me the hdd is in good health i changed the sata cables and it still happens but really rarely but i don't think it's related , because when it happens the pc totally freeze , also &nbsp;like
 i said before i play battlfield 1 all the time and i never had any problems with it despite it demands alot of hdd work , so the hdd should be fine only the games that consume more then 78% of ram start lagging&nbsp;</p>
<p>3-well like i said no , i think that my pc perfomes as good as it should be at regular tasks&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Based on the details that you provided, the root cause is the game itself. Like what you have mentioned, when you play the game, it uses up to 70-80% of your RAM and your HDD becomes 100% while basic task runs smoothly. We then recommend that you get in-touch
 with the game's developer to get more information on this issue and for better assistance.</p>

            <p>Your problem is the 100% disk usage, not the game.&nbsp; We will need to see your full list of processes that you have running in the background.&nbsp; Please create a list of all running processes after your PC boots up and is idle for 5 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a similar issue, but not w/ games, 100% Disk usage could be caused by a bad driver, a back ground task running like Cortona or by you changing your swap file settings.&nbsp; I suggest that you put your swap file back to automatic. (Swap not being Automatic
 was my problem).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make a list of all the hardware connected on your motherboard.&nbsp; Video card, Audio card, Chipset, and then go to their websites and download their latest drivers.</p>

    <title>Surface Book 2 Freezes Up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jshcplnd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book 2 Freezes Up</h2>
                    <p>I've had my Surface Book 2 for about two weeks and have been quite pleased with it thus far.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing that has been taking place, which I'm not sure if its usual or not (as I have been a Mac user for the past decade), is that when I'm utilizing it as a tablet, the screen will freeze up and become unresponsive. I press (not hold) the power button
 to turn off the screen and then press again to turn back on. It doesn't appear to be major, but is a little inconvenient when taking notes in a meeting and then having to turn off and then back on. To clarify, I do not power down the device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding updates I have two updates that downloaded during work that I intend to restart after work. They are the&nbsp;<strong><em>Surface - Firmware - 12/12/2017 12:00:00 AM
</em></strong>and&nbsp; <em><strong>2018-01 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1709 for x64-based Systems.&nbsp;</strong></em>Not sure if these will fix the issue or not, but I figured that I would at least start the conversation in the event that this doesn't
 address the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            To clarify this a little further, as I have discovered a little bit more, it is the touch screen that has become unresponsive rather than a freeze-up. I am attempting to utilize my finger and the surface pen to make selections on the screen as well as
 edit documents and am not able to do so, but can with the track-pad.&nbsp;

<p>Having the same issue.</p>
<p>Only occurs when tablet is detected from the base and when computer has been asleep.</p>
<p>Shortly after waking the screen freezes. Sometimes toggling the screen of with the power button works but transient. Reboot fixes it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Must be a software or firmware glitch.</p>
<p>This and small Crackle at extend if he opening are the only issue with an otherwise amazing device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if this can't be fixed it had to go back.</p>

                    <p>Why does Mulitmedia Class Scheduler continue to start and stop every half hour or so. I happen to have an event sound for the Open Program event and this event gets triggered by Multimedia Class Scheduler, it seems, every half hour.<br />
Is this normal??<br />
Can I disable it??</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The Multimedia Class Scheduler service (MMCSS) enables multimedia applications to ensure that their time-sensitive processing receives prioritized access to CPU resources. This service enables multimedia applications to utilize as much of the CPU as possible
 without denying CPU resources to lower-priority applications.</p>
<p>This service is required only for the fact that Windows Audio service lists this as a dependency. Without the Windows Audio service, no audio will be played on the system. This service is started upon system boot, but shortly after (~ 8 minutes), it stops.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a Notification that will start with all the programs that uses Windows Audio. For an example if you open Windows Media player, then the Multimedia class scheduler will also be started because it uses the windows audio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

<p>Since my son can't post due to age i'm posting on his behalf. We signed up for live gold and should get a promo code for lovers in a dangerous spacetime. Since there was an issue with the promo when we signed up, the support person, Jhazz, told me to post
 on this forum to ensure we get the code for the game download.</p>

    <title>Running Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour on Windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saudate  say:</h3>
<h2>            Running Command and Conquer Generals Zero Hour on Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    So everyone knows that <span style="font-weight: bold">Generals Zero Hour</span> is an old game but it's still one of the best that EA created (maybe because of
<span style="font-weight: bold">Westwood</span>).<br />
<br />
I wanted to run this game on a <span style="font-weight: bold">Windows 7 Basic</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold">32-bit</span> machine with <span style="font-weight: bold">
4 gigabytes of RAM, ATI Mobility Radeon 8500 and a 500 GB Hard Disk drive</span>.
<span style="font-weight: bold">Generals work perfectly on Windows 7</span> even without applying any
<span style="font-weight: bold">compatibility mode</span>, and unfortunately its expansion
<span style="font-weight: bold">Zero Hour</span> has <span style="font-weight: bold">
graphical display glitches</span>.<br />
<br />
Zero Hour runs without any 'Technical Difficulties' dialog, but the main screen of the game shows no animations and only a bright purple background is displayed. I applied a
<span style="font-weight: bold">Windows XP SP3 compatibility</span> and with <span style="font-weight: bold">
admin rights</span>. <br />
I am able to play it but all the structures are colored pink and the map is just plain back background. I can see the Dozer (the main builder unit) but only the smoke coming out of its chimney. The game is also very fast. In short, it's unplayable.<br />
<br />
I browsed for solutions online and found some suggestions of creating an '<span style="text-decoration-line: underline; font-style: italic">options.ini</span>' file that is supposed to be placed on the Data folder of both game located on My Documents. Here are the
 contents of the INI file:<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">AntiAliasing = 3</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">FirewallBehavior = 1</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">FirewallNeedToRefresh = FALSE</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">FirewallPortAllocationDelta = 0</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">GameSpyIPAddress = 0.0.0.0</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Gamma = 50</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">IPAddress = 0.0.0.0</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">IdealStaticGameLOD = High</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">LanguageFilter = false</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">MusicVolume = 39</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Resolution = 1440 900</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Retaliation = yes</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">SFX3DVolume = 37</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">SFXVolume = 33</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">ScrollFactor = 42</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">SendDelay = no</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">StaticGameLOD = High</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">UseAlternateMouse = no</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">UseDoubleClickAttackMove = no</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">VoiceVolume = 40</span><br />
<br />
NOTES:<br />
: I updated the resolution to <span style="font-weight: bold">1440 by 900</span> because this was the resolution of my laptop (the default resolution posted online was 1024 by 768).&nbsp;
<br />
: I also manually created the Data folder on my documents before loading the game but alas, all has failed.<br />
: I just <span style="font-weight: bold">copied the game from my desktop computer</span> where it is originally installed to my flash drive and
<span style="font-weight: bold">transferred the game to my laptop(kind of like a portable version)</span>.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Any ideas on how to fix this graphical glitch? Any answer to this question will be greatly appreciated! ;]<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>The purple background displayed while playing the game is caused due to graphics card issue.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform the following troubleshooting methods:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to update the latest Graphics Card driver form the manufacturerâs website and then check if this fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer these links to update the drivers:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</a></span></p>

</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps. You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup
 is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>To set the computer in clean boot, follow the steps from the link:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform a clean boot</a> </span>

<p>When I said Inferno I mean </p>
<p>1) when I tried rebooting from the HDD the PC flips up and no matter what key I punch It says
</p>
<p>BOOTMGR missing</p>
<p>2)when I tried boot from CD the WINRE only shows 2 options</p>
<p>a) Check PC</p>
<p>b)Click to restore to Factory settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have downloaded a program Ultimate Boot CD Ver 5.1.1 but I am not sure on how to use it to get to command prompt</p>

<h2>            BSOD DRIVER_IRQL_LESS_OR_EQUAL &#40;Wdf01000.sys&#41; on newly built computer on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I consistently BSOD (2/3 times an hour) on my new CPU build running Windows 10 with a&nbsp;DRIVER_IRQL_LESS_OR_EQUAL error caused by driver (Wdf01000.sys). Does anyone know why this is happening? I suspect it's due to my USB wireless adapter (http://www.tp-link.us/download/TL-WN823N.html)
 because it seems to be primarily happening when I'm downloading large files or using the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following link stores two .dmp files and the output that windbg outputs upon analysis of the&nbsp;063016-3828-02.dmp file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Byhx1P_P_fhAZnBLVkJkWWJaZFk&amp;usp=sharing</p>
<p>
</p><p>some other details:</p>
<p>* no norton antivirus installed</p>
<p>* ran windows memory diagnostics with no issues</p>
<p>* the TPLink driver is officially only for windows 7,8, and 8.1</p>
<p>* using newest nVidia graphics drivers for msi GeForce 970 GTX</p>
<p>* &nbsp;mobo: Gigabyte Z170 Gaming 3</p>
<p>* have updated all my drivers via windows update</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help resolving this issue is greatly appreciated!!!!! :):):):)&nbsp;</p>

                    I got a Logitech USB Headset H390 and it wont work on my Windows 7 PC. The microphone kind of works sometime, but when I listen back at it, there's just a ringing noise. The headphones don't work at all.
