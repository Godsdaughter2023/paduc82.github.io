<h2>            Sticky Notes v3.0.118.0 Crashes</h2>
                    <p>I'd like to use Sticky Notes on my new Surface Studio. But the app keeps crashing. I've even tried Reset and uninstall/reinstall. It will work for a brief period and then I find the next time I open it the app will crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what else to check. The only relevant setting which I've also turned off is "Insights."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have it synced to other devices. I only like to keep 2-3 sticky notes and generally the app is closed until I need it.</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />If your computer begins to feel buggy and you notice problems during boot, you can use the System File Checker (SFC) command-line utility to check the integrity and replace any corrupted or missing protected system files with a known good version.
<br />
<br />When SFC is unable to fix the problem, chances are the utility was unable to get the necessary files from the Windows image, which might have become broken. In this situation, you can use DISM to repair the Windows image (.wim), which then it will allow you to use the System File Checker to fix any issue with your Windows 10 installation.
<br />

<br />
<br />If the above does not work, follow these steps: 
<br />
<br />1) launch powershell 
<br />2) Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3) Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}

<p>Unfortunately, none of these steps has found an error or resolved the issue. I will add more detail to what I see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I select Sticky Notes out of the Windows Ink Workspace from the taskbar - or when I select Sticky Notes out of the start menu - it will open with the screen background slightly grayed out and a red x to the upper right to close the grayed underlay.
 The few notes I have are available as the "top layer". </p>
<p>
</p><p>I might be able to add or edit a note successfully. But then subsequent app open/closes exhibit crash behavior.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried working with the notes with both the gray underlay intact and by clicking it away first. Neither instance seems to help with app crashes. I basically get to the point where I open the Sticky Notes app and wait a couple seconds and it will crash
 without any input from me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I reboot the computer it might work for a bit, and then I end up in the same crash cycle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for other pen-centric app examples, I can work with Sketchpad or Screen Sketch all I want without issue.</p>

<p>Thank you Aravinda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the main point I take from your troubleshooting is the sign-in / sign-out nature. I had done resets and re-installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was not signed in with the Windows store, I guess I also was using the Sticky Notes app while not signed in to my account. I followed the procedure and now see Sticky Notes syncing to the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to use it for a while to see if this makes the difference in preventing the crashes I experience. So I'll report back to the group after some time passes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your input!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 VERY slow to boot up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dyanlee9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 VERY slow to boot up</h2>
                    Windows 10 boots up very slowly. &nbsp;In Windows 7 and earlier versions I was able to go to the startup menu under MSCONFIG and disable all automatic startups. &nbsp;Then windows booted rapidly and automatically turned on necessary programs. &nbsp;Tried that with Windows
 10 and really screwed up - booted fast but also turned off many necesssary programs (internet connection and sound for example) and I was not able to emable them without a lenghty search. &nbsp;Question: &nbsp;Does anyone know which progams can be safely disabled in
 the startup grouping without causing functionality issues? &nbsp;Anything I can turn off will help speed up the booting process.

    <title>Hard drive not in My Computer but in Device Manager and Computer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hard drive not in My Computer but in Device Manager and Computer Management</h2>
                    Hello all...I have some extremely important irreplaceable files on my second hard drive. Today I bought an external to back them up and when I turned my computer on, I was unable to get to the drive. The drive was listed as "RAW"<br />
<br />
So I tried to start recovering the files from all the programs online, which they just ended up estimating a 35 and counting hour wait and then crashed my computer. So I restarted and now the drive is unrecognizable in "My Computer" but is listed in Device
 Manager (as a storage device)<br />
<br />
I have tried it in 2 diff computers and also 2 diff external cases with the same result.<br />
<br />
Any help or suggestions is highly appreciated!<br />
<br />
THANK YOU!<br />
<br />
Derek

<p>Hello DMoneyPros,</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the status of the hard disk in the Disk Management? </li><li>Does your External Hard disk show up as Raw Partition from the Disk Management or the Secondary Hard disk?
</li></ul>
<p>If the Hard disk does not show up in the Windows Explorer and shows up in the Disk Management, it means that the hard disk is raw and is not formatted?</p>
<p>You should try to assign the drive letter for the hard disk from the Disk Management and check if it appears in the Windows Explorer:</p>
<em>
<p><strong>Change drive letter:</strong></p>
</em>
<p>1. Open Computer Management by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, clicking Administrative Tools, and then double-clicking Computer Management. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation,
 type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>2. In the Navigation pane, click Disk Management.</p>
<p>3. Right-click the partition or drive that you want to change, and then click Change Drive Letter and Paths.</p>
<p>4. To change a drive letter, click Change, click Assign the following drive letter, click the letter that you want to use, and then click OK.</p>

            You research errors like this by doing a Google search for the file name.&nbsp; Usually they turn up no hits.
<p><br />
When a search results in either no hits or suspicious hits, the answer usually is that the file in question is malware-related and your anti-malware application has deleted or quarantined the file but left behind the Windows registry entry that attempts to
 start the malware when you start up your computer.<br />
<br />
First, download, install, update, and run full scans with both of these free scanning tools:</p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes AntiMalware</a><br />
<a href="http://superantispyware.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SUPERAntiSpyware</a><br />
<br />
Don't run the scans simultaneously.&nbsp; They may take a while, so start one up and then go do a non-computer chore for a while.<br />
<br />
If the scans don't fix the problem (and they may not, because the actual malware file has already been dealt with), then download and run
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Autoruns</a>.&nbsp; Click the "Logon" tab and look in the "Image Path" column for the dll named in your error message.&nbsp; If it isn't shown in the Logon tab, click the "Everything" tab and use
 the File &gt; Search tool.&nbsp; An idiosyncrasy of the Autoruns search tool is that you have to move the selection line below the "found" item before you "Find Next."<br />
<br />
Once you find the line with the offending file, either "Delete" it or (if you want to be safer) uncheck it.&nbsp; The latter prevents the line from being executed but you can reactivate it later by replacing the checkmark.</p>

    <title>Unable to change region - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to change region</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I recently moved from the UK to CZ, bringing my Xbox 360 with me. Whenever I try to make a purchase I get a 80150017 error.</p>
<p>I've logged into my account to try to change the region, but it always fails with the "<span>There’s a problem completing your move right now..." error.</span></p>
<p>I meet all of the criteria on the support page. Could it be that I have a UK Credit Card tied to my account for a One Drive subscription which is causing this error?</p>
<p>I'm on the verge of buying a Xbox One, but it's pretty pointless until this can be resolved.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hey Lee ws,</p>
<p>What did the support agent ask you to do (troubleshooting steps) when you were unable to change your region?
</p>
<p>Is your One Drive subscription still active? Because if that is, that might be the cause of your trouble switching regions.</p>

<p>Support is pathetic.</p>
<p>Excuses have ranged from my OneDrive subscription, my PC locale, nonavailability of OneDrive in my country (which is BS), 24-72 hour sync time on my account... Whatever excuse they can dream up to get you off of the call they will use.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 printer spooler won&#39;t start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimvanderslice  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 printer spooler won&#39;t start</h2>
                    my printer spooler just won't start in win 7.&nbsp; I got a message that the spooler wasn't running when I tried to use it today.&nbsp; I have used the printer for a few days. "net start spooler" fails from the command promt as administrator.&nbsp; I have verified that
 that the RPC is running.<br />
<br />
I successfully installed SP 1 yesterday, but went back to the restore point, but spooler still won't start.<br />
<br />
The system acts like the spooler is missing.<br />
<br />
How do I fix this problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

            The problem turned out to be malware.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Thanks for everyone's help.&nbsp; I was reluctant to try the malware route because I my concern of downloading some new issue.&nbsp; for example, the malwarebytes site sends me to a site called betanews.com.&nbsp; That makde me wonder what else I might be downloading.<br />
<br />
Lucky for me, a good friend of mine sent me to a site called ninite.com where I downloaded malwarebytes.&nbsp; That fixed the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for everyone's help.&nbsp; I know much more about win 7 than I did before I met you.<br />

            <p><span>I would check the status of Services. </span></p>
<p><span>Click on the Start button and select Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Services. Locate RPC End Pont Mapper in the list. Check that it has started and that the StartUp type is Automatic. If it is not set to Automatic right click and select Properties,
 General tab. There is a box after StartUp type. The options are available on a drop down by clicking on the arrow down to the right of the box. Make the change and click on Apply and OK. Restart the computer and check whether it has started.</span></p>
<p><span>Repeat the procedure for DCom Server Process Launcher.</span></p>
<p><span>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware.</span></p>
<p>Boot the computer to safe mode with networking and download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only), update definitions and run in safe mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans.<br />

<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a><span><br />

<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/download.html</a></p>
<p>Some malware is now installing proxy server entries redirecting internet connections. If you encounter this problem see Step 2 in the link which follows:<br />

<p>-No, I haven't done any changes<br />
-I don't know when this started because i have the same pin for my pc since a year. I never tried to change the pin but when i am trying it now it is showing error.</p>
<p>-I found probable solutions in a community and i did following :</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Opening Service (Win +R and services.msc) and changing credential manager Startup type into Automatic</p>
<p>
</p><p>And i reverted these changes since it didn't work</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Running cmd as admin and running DMIS scan health and restore health commands</p>
<p>
</p><p>But cmd said the "health" command is not recognized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, None of them worked</p>
<p>That's all i did</p>

                    Hi!<br />
I'm in a... strange situation... at the moment. A year back I bought a new rig and I tried to buy a legit version of Windows 10.<br />
I'm Swedish, Living in Japan, and I can not read Japanese - i prefer to keep everything in English...<br />
I tried to buy Windows 10 on Us Amazon but they would not send it abroad. I then tried to buy the US version over at Windows .com but they wouldn't let me, because I used my Japanese Visa card/They would not allow me to buy it based on my IP address.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The only option I had was to buy it on the Japanese Amazon site, but previous experience with MicroSoft, Sony, Steam etc, made me nervous.<br />
Side Note, my Xbox account was registered in Sweden, so when I buy Digital Games, I'm forced to get the Swedish Version with Swedish dubs... These games are unplayable and I've stopped buying digital because of this.<br />
So. I ended up getting a "free" version of Windows 10 (I think it was free for everyone at some point, right?) A year have past and its working fine, but now I get notifications of updates etc and it makes me nervous.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I want to buy a legit US VERSION - Not Japanese, not Swedish... Why is it so hard? As I logged into THIS site I got a a popup message saying "Do you want to visit the Japanese Site instead"? - soooo, I feel forced to get the Japanese version which I absolutely
 don't want. I'm more then willing to pay for my Windows 10, but how do I do it? Why can't I buy Windows 10 with my Japanese Visa card? Why can't I buy it on Amazon? Why am I forced to get the Japanese version? If I get Japanese version, can I install ALL ENGLISH?
 I don't want ANY trances of Japanese or Swedish on my PC...

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here it is:  <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-10-Home/productID.319937100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US...</a>
<br />
<br />Then folllow these steps which compile the best possible install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, and has zero reported problems.:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />

<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, configure privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.

<p>I'm pretty sure they gave it away for free to catch any pirate versions and make people pay later?<br />
I mean, I had tons of PC's in my past so I assume I had a legit Licence at some point? But I have no idea how to find it? Or if they are "locked" to that specific rig?<br />
Anyway, thanks for the info!&nbsp; Are you sure I can use the Japanese Key for that?<br />
When I buy games here in Japan that comes with DLC's stuff I can't get them because my PSN/XBOX account is Swedish and the Key's seem to be linked to Japanese Accounts only.<br />
The problem with changing language after installation is that I can't read whats on my Display.&nbsp;<br />
As I mentioned, all my actions seem to be "tracked" by the IP-police.. Ex, If I visit IGN.com I will end up on IGN.jp.co and since I cant read Japanese I can't figure out how to change language/visit the US version of IGN... Its all a nightmare :"( Its meant
 to make life more convenient by translating stuff to the country you are located in, but for me, its just a pain in the a**... :/&nbsp;</p>

            There is no way to find how Windows was activated, but I can try.
<br />Right click Start&gt;Command Prompt-Admin and type in the following command:
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />If you have Powershell instead of Command Prompt Run these in order:
<br />cmd.exe
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />You will get a window, take a screenshot using snipping tool and paste it it next reply.

<p>I tried the Command stuff but failed. Not sure how to do it.<br />
<br />
I will try to buy a key from Amazon.Jp.co and hope if will work.<br />
I assume I need to do backups etc before I attempt anything like this :S<br />
Isn't there any way to just paste my new Key to the existing OS? Like, when you try a Trail from photoshop and you decide to buy the full version, all you do is paste a Licence Key and it will update and good to go?<br />
Im terrified of messing up my PC. Its running so well with no problems at all :S</p>

    <title>Windows 10 updates freeze my laptop. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 updates freeze my laptop.</h2>
                    <p>In early August 2015 I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 with update.</p>
<p>My processor: 2.4GHz; &nbsp;Ram: 16 GB; &nbsp;Hard disk space: 608 GB free of 907 GB; Graphics Card: DirectX 12; &nbsp;Display: 1024x600. &nbsp;My system exceeds the specifications to run Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The initial upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 went very well, and I was able to use my laptop right away with only one minor problem. &nbsp;I had to reinstall Norton Internet Security with an update for Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything went well until the next update which occurred a few days later. &nbsp;Then I noticed a problem with my laptop freezing because an update was occurring and seemed to take over all the resources of my laptop until the update finished installing. &nbsp;I
 let the laptop sit until it seemed to respond again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last update to Windows 10 which occurred around September 3rd has caused the most serious problem by making my laptop very unstable because freezes occur constantly preventing me from being able to do any work. &nbsp;I must stop and reboot my laptop more
 than one time before it will work, and then it is slow. &nbsp;There is nothing to indicate an update is occurring until after I reboot a couple of times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of my programs crashed on September 5th, and I cannot open it any longer.<br />
</p>
<p>My laptop continues to operate in a very unstable manner, and it takes a long time to boot and load my programs. &nbsp;Sometimes they don't all load, and I have to reboot again.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try the following methods and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>Start the computer in Safe Mode and check if the issue persists. If the issue does not persist in safe mode, place the computer in clean boot state and check.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
<strong>Safe Mode </strong>appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you're using.</span></span></p>

            <p>Dear: &nbsp;Re Issues with Windows 10 subsequent updates freezing my laptop. &nbsp;I followed your recommendations and the directions for clean boot and sfc/scannow. &nbsp;<strong>Verification indicated
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile following clean boot, scan, etc and rebooting normally, my system froze while trying to type this reply. &nbsp;I had to wait a few minutes until it unfroze so I could continue.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile my laptop continues to freeze when turning on first thing in the morning. &nbsp;Only recourse is to continuously reboot until it stops freezing. &nbsp;This can take up to an hour until I can use my laptop without it freezing. &nbsp;I have 16gb ram so why the freezing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop also freezes whenever there are "Notifications" indicated in that little icon in the far right corner of my system tray. &nbsp;Also sometimes there is a tiny circle with a dash in lower right corner of that little icon. &nbsp;When that happens my laptop
 freezes. &nbsp;I have to reboot to get rid of it. &nbsp;I don't know what the freezing is all about, but Windows 10 is very disappointing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to fix this situation?</p>

<h2>            BUG&#58; Skype contacts not linked to People contacts, appear as separate conversations in Messaging app</h2>
                    <p>Ever since getting my Lumia 950XL, I have experienced a persistent bug in the Windows 10 Mobile Messaging &amp; Skype app. Although Skype conversations (from the desktop Skype application) appear in the Messaging app, these Skype contacts are not linked
 to their regular SMS / People contacts and appear in the Messaging app as separate conversations. Trying to send a Skype message or place a Skype call with these contacts results in the error</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Can't send</em></p>
<p><em>One or more of your recipients is invalid. Check for typos and errors, then try again."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The Messaging app thinks these Skype contacts are phone numbers, and they cannot be linked to existing People contacts that already have phone numbers saved. Meanwhile, their Skype &amp; Outlook contacts are linked online at people.live.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4b06c642-449a-436f-87b5-7a60148acde1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4b06c642-449a-436f-87b5-7a60148acde1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have submitted bug reports in the Windows Feedback app (see for instance</p>
<p>windows-feedback:?contextid=156&amp;feedbackid=30ba2de3-2270-4daf-a523-2af559f4c559&amp;form=2&amp;src=1) however after multiple app updates, this issue still has not been addressed. Please forward this information to the appropriate development teams and let
 me know if you would like any further details. Many thanks!</p>

            <p>I have similar problem. I have Lumia 640 XL dual SIM. For it to call a Skype telephone international contact (not send it a message) I need to open Skype. I would like to have a choice to call from mobile operator or from Skype. My telephone is without any
 operator contract. Android has an option in contacts, to choose which app to use to call.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>WhatsApp is the same - no way to choose it from People. Moreover one would expect to have a choice how to send a message SIM1, SIM2, Skype (these three are available) OR WhatsApp (this is not available).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know if this is a bug in WhatsApp or in Windows 10 Mobile. I have 10.0.10586.164 recent update.

            <p>Problem identified, and solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype contact in question hadn't accepted my contact request. Even though we had already messaged and video chatted multiple times on desktop, strangely the Messaging app wouldn't allow me to interact with the Skype contact until she accepted my contact
 request. The funny thing is, she didn't even know she hadn't accepted my contact request (since we had Skyped multiple times over the past months).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully Skype shifts away from their current system, where you have to</p>
<ul>
<li>Search for friend</li><li>Find friend and add as&nbsp;one of your contacts</li><li>Wait for them to accept your contact request</li><li>Finally you're able to interact with them in the Messaging app</li></ul>
<p>and instead shifts toward a WhatsApp-like system, where all you need is to have your friend's phone number saved in your address book and&nbsp;they are automatically available for you to Skype with. Please Skype, learn from WhatsApp!</p>

            <p>did you ever get a fix for this? I can send skype messages to my wife's phone (lumia 950) using skype and she gets them in her messaging center</p>
<p>
</p><p>she has the option in the dropdown from your image to send a message to me from the messaging app via skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I, however on lumia 950xl (running build 14390) do not have that option, only the sim to send her a message. any messages she sends me to go the actual skype app, not messaging...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed on this page: https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34587/what-is-skype-preview-in-windows-10-mobile</p>
<p>
</p><p>there's an image where it says "introducing messaging + skype" where I recall entering my skype info to set this up, but I can't seem to bring this "setup" screen again on my 950xl nor can I find any setting allowing me to link my skype account to my messaging
 app...</p>
<p>
</p><p>how do I do this? I want to be able to message her via the messaging app using skype, but I cannot seem to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is this just a bug or is there a setting somewhere to complete this integration?</p>

<p>hello !</p>
<p>The current computing scenario does require a lot of RAM, but in todays time too you can work out a lot of thing with the amount or RAM you have. I would suggest you to please share your laptop model and make with us. And also if you have chaged the pagefile
 size, make sure to only set the pagefile for one drive and not al partitions. As you have 256 mb ram, i would suggest you set it to 512-512 in both max and min. ! Virtual memory is not shared with your physical memory, it a space on your hard disk that is
 used to cache applicationsso that they run smooth. Getting a new hard disk ( external) would be a good way so as to make sure that you dont loose data anytime soon.</p>

<p>Sorry to say, if your laptop has only a 20 GB hard drive and is not able to have more than 256 MB of RAM, it is past time to get a new laptop.&nbsp; There really is not much you can do to increase performance, other than removing most of your applications.&nbsp; At
 this point, with only 0.6 GB of free space on your drive, you won't even be able to run Disk Defragmenter (which would like about 15% free space, or in your case about 3 GB).</p>
<p>Unless you are 100% certain that 256 RAM is your maximum, please identify the make and model of your laptop.&nbsp; You may have to discard your current RAM in order to get more.&nbsp; If you can increase to 512 MB of RAM and replace your drive with a larger internal
 one, you probably can markedly improve performance (yes, you can get an external hard drive, but based on the specs you have so far identified, I suspect that your laptop only has a USB 1 or 1.1 port (rather than a USB 2.0 port).&nbsp; In that case, getting data
 on and off the external hard drive will be excruciatingly slow.</p>

<p>Thank you both for your feedback.</p>
<p>The make and model of my laptop is Sony Vaio PCG-F403, I realise that it is pretty old!</p>
<p>I did manage to run the Disk Defragmenter when I had about 6% of hard disk space. The system did warn me that this function ideally needs about 15% of hard disk space but asked me if I wanted to go ahead anyway - I said yes.</p>
<p>I have changed my page file to System Managed and recently (just prior to sending my original message) gone ahead with the Disk Compression function of the C Drive and Folders and Subfolders. I have noticed that each time I turn on my computer my hard disk
 space has increased, it is now 1.35GB.</p>
<p>Whenever I use my Flash Drive (memory stick) I get a message saying that I haven't got a USB 2.0 port and that transfer of data will be slower than ususl, so I gather that LemP is right here (the transfer of data wasn't that slow though!). Can I get a USB
 2.0 hub to plug into my current USB port which will&nbsp;allow me to&nbsp;use an external&nbsp;hard drive so that it does not transfer data horribly slow. I'm not sure how that works.</p>
<p>On searching for info&nbsp;in Windows Support, I&nbsp;see that either the RAM or my page file size&nbsp;is rarely the problem in relation to 'virtual memory running too low' problems. There they suggest that it is the number of programs running at StartUp or in the background.
 I have run Autorun and can see that there are a lot of programs running but I don't have a clue as to what programs I should&nbsp;remove.</p>
<p>I have to say, when I get the&nbsp;error message saying that Windows is trying to increase my virtual memory,&nbsp;applications do run more quickly after a while, but of course this is little consolation, as this has to happen each time I turn on the computer.</p>
<p>Any more help much appreciated.</p>
<p>AD&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even if you bought an external USB 2.0 hub, it would be limited to the speed of USB 1.1 if you plugged it into your current USB port.&nbsp; On the other hand,I believe that your Vaio has a PC-Card slot and you could buy a<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;DEPA=0&amp;Order=BESTMATCH&amp;Description=pc-card+usb+2.0&amp;x=15&amp;y=33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PC-Card
 USB 2.0 adapter</a> .</p>
<p>You are correct that the maximum RAM for your Vaio is 256 MB.&nbsp; However, you can replace the current hard drive with a larger one, which will help things a bit (it seems that this was done at least once before; from what I can tell, the Vaio PCG-F403 originally
 came with a 6 GB hard drive).&nbsp; See, for example, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/PCG-F610K-PCG-FX270-PCG-GR150K-PCG-GR290P-PCG-GRT100K/dp/B003UIU914" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Amazon 160 GB drive</a> . Give the other limitations of your laptop, it's a hard decision.</p>
<p>When you open Task Manager to see what's running (or see what starts up by using Autoruns), you can Google the names if they don't seem clear.&nbsp;<a href="http://answersthatwork.com/Tasklist_pages/tasklist.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This</a> is a pretty good list for running tasks.</p>
<p>Although it's certainly possible to overload a machine like this with too many legitimate programs, you should also check for malware.&nbsp; Start by downloading, installing, updating, and running both of these free scanners.&nbsp; You can uninstall them once you're
 sure that there is nothing bad left.</p>

<p>Finally, I don't think your question about virtual/physical memory was answered.&nbsp; You have 256 MB of physical memory.&nbsp; Ignoring the possibility that some of that physical RAM may be shared with your video card, at any given time, some of that memory is in
 use by the operating system.&nbsp; The rest is available for applications.&nbsp; The combination of the Windows operating system and your running applications typically require far more than 256 MB of memory.&nbsp; Windows handles this situation by creating "virtual" memory,
 which is simply a file on your hard drive.&nbsp; If you open Task Manager and select the "Performance" tab, you'll see information related to this.</p>
<p>The "Kernal memory" is the memory used by the operating system.&nbsp; The "commit charge" is the total amount of physical and virtual memory currently in use.&nbsp; The "limit" is the sum of the actual physical memory and the maximum size of the page file (virtual
 memory).&nbsp; There are a number of explanatory articles<a href="http://www.theeldergeek.com/paging_file.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> (these seem to have been written at about the time, or a little later, that your computer was originally available).</p>

                    I have installed the new Chromecast ultra 4k and it works correctly under Chrome, however,&nbsp; when I try to connect to it through the Edge browser it does not show up as an option.&nbsp; The Edge browser can see the older Chromecast but it does not operate correctly.&nbsp;
 I thought I had read that the Edge browser does now support Chromecast.

            <p>I had a similar problem today with KB3119142, but each install said in my update history, that it had installed successfully each and every time.&nbsp; So here's what what worked for me.&nbsp; Hope it works for you too.</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>I had the same problem today.&nbsp; Windows 10 Pro x64 kept repeatedly installing kb3119142.&nbsp; Without boring you with unnecessary details, here's what I did to fix the problem:</p>
<p>1. Went into Programs and Features list of installed programs.</p>
<p>2. Right clicked on Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Redistributable (x64) - 11.0.61030</p>
<p>.....then clicked on Change, then clicked on Repair.&nbsp; After repair was completed, I was instructed to Restart my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reboot, the problem was gone.</p>

 drive with the latest and greatest version of Windows 10 Professional (currently version 1803) to keep my updates to a minimum?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it can be done, can you please explain how this is done?</p>
<p>

            Hey IggyCastillo,
<br />
<br />Yes, this is possible. You'll need the Media Creation Tool to write over the current Windows installation media on your flash drive. In one of the prompts, check "Create installation media (USB drive..." and click Next. Be sure that your flash drive is selected, and follow the prompts.

            Hey Iggy (great name).   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />They're normally write-protected, but we can see if you can remove the write protection so you can plug it into Media Creation Tool and create the latest media which is always loaded in there:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Here's how to try to disable write protection:  <a href="https://www.easeus.com/storage-media-recovery/fix-read-only-error-on-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.easeus.com/storage-media-recovery/f...</a>
<br />
<br />If that's not enough then you can try wiping the drive deeper with Diskpart Clean All command: <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/52129-disk-clean-clean-all-diskpart-command.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/52129-disk...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then buy a new 8gb flash stick and create the latest bootable media.  After it's written to be bootable, you can even add and remove files from it as you wish just as long as you don't touch the seven files the MCT places in the root.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Yeah, Iggy, then key was provided separately, right?  Then the media is the same as long as you choose the correct version (Home or Pro) and bit rate (64 bit for all but weaker netbooks).  It's also recommended to always use the latest media for reinstalls.  
<br />

            Iggy,
<br />
<br />It should be just fine, the Media Creation Tool is known as an outlet to prepare installation media if you purchased a license without the USB flash drive in the Microsoft Store. You do not have to specify a key when installing, nor is it unique to a flash drive, it's just installation media. Usually the license is unique to your hardware, but of course you have transfer rights given that you want to put it on another computer, but otherwise it should be just fine. While installing, you can just click "I do not have a product key" should you not choose to provide one due to losing it, but if you do, then all the better.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps.       
        </p>

            Iggy,
<br />
<br />Additionally, when you go the "I do not have a product key" route, and you've installed that copy of Windows 10 with that product key, you should be okay. If you have the product key, although not necessary, that can also be useful.

<br />
<br />My apologies. There is no setting to control HD/SD resolution of video in Skype.

<br />
<br />Skype will use your Web Cams default settings 
<br />So, if you want to make video calls in SD, you would need to adjust your camera settings

<h2>            A Minecraft SOS</h2>
                    
<p>To Whom It May Concern,</p>
<p>I don't know if this glass bottle and letter will find you floating on the high tide, but if it does, I'm in dire need of your help. I'm lost. My party has perished and I'm the only 1 left. Even worse, my supplies are dwindling. I went out to find my fortune
 with pickaxe in hand, but it looks like I might find my end instead, along with the others&nbsp;- this world is far larger than I ever could have imagined and I've since lost my map and compass. Thankfully, I still have my 8-way long-range radio. I'm conserving
 the redstone battery, but if you receive this message, please try your party-patented radio, if you have 1, on all frequencies. With luck, you just might be able to get ahold of me and I can help guide you from there - that is if the redstone battery&nbsp;holds
 out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's getting dark - I have to find shelter. It looks like that Enderdragon may have bested me after all... After all, it's in the darkness that his minions come out to play. That nefarious monster thinks this is a game, but I know better! After all, it's
 my life that's at stake!</p>
<p>No, I can't talk like that. I refuse to give up! I can't afford to lose my sanity out here - not now. Not ever. I must make it home! But to do that, I need you to join the cause, take a leap of faith, and find me - if you can. But you must do it quickly,
 before time runs out. If you do this for me, I will count you among my friends.<br />
<br />
While there is still time, I will do what I can and see if I can scrounge for supplies and&nbsp;find some familiar landmarks (for whatever good that might do).</p>
<p>My world is an open book and you're welcome to take part in it - take the risk and you shall be rewarded - handsomely. Remember, however, if I die, all is lost. I also can't guarantee your safety, but what I can guarantee you is the adventure of a lifetime.
 Do this for me, and you will have learned what it is to really live and saved another life in the process.</p>
<p>Please find me and return me home.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours,<br />
Galactic Geek</p>

<p><strong>OFFICIAL NOTICE:</strong></p>
<p><strong>The remains of famed adventurer Galactic Geek (sometimes referred to as GG) have been identified at the bottom of a newly discovered desert temple, at least what was left of him - there appears to have been an explosion of some sort. The following
 sheet of paper, with writing, was found on his person, badly burned, but still, surprisingly, entirely legible:</strong></p>
<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>If you are reading this, then I'm afraid I've met my untimely demise, probably due to some foul creature that the ever evil-minded Enderdragon sent after me. Or perhaps, possibly from starvation. Or a great fall. Regardless, if you are reading this, it means
 that help never came, or came too late.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I'm greatly disappointed. I needed help from anyone who was willing to risk it, and nobody would. I'm sure you're one of those people who decided not to come to my aid. After all, why take the risk? I suppose all of the great treasures I
 have discovered will remain hidden until the end of time, since I now lay dead Notch knows where. Then again, that was the choice you made. Or rather, didn't make.</p>
<p>I want you to know however, that despite my untimely demise, I did everything in my power in order to survive. For days, I traveled, both on foot and by boat (I was able to cobble together a few pieces of wood), and saw some amazing sights - I travelled
 across frozen mountains, barren deserts, massive jungles, and forests filled to the brim with all sorts of creatures. It seems even a couple of times, I managed to reach the end of the earth (3x actually). As awe-inspiring as it was too see, it will never
 compare to my home. Too bad it all wasn't enough... The sun and moon even seemed to play tricks on me - I could've sworn I saw the sun rising in the west and then setting in the east! I really wish I hadn't lost my compass... Still, I suppose that's life.
 You take the good with the bad. Now, I'll never see my home ever again. To my dearest friends, please take care of it for me.</p>
<p>I really wish you hadn't failed me, though. The world is beautiful, despite its dangers - and you could've seen it! Too bad the people in it, such as yourself, won't lift a finger to help others who are in dire need.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll come back as a zombie and eat you - I can only hope.</p>
<p>Hauntingly yours,</p>
<p>GG</p>

<p>Thanks for the compliments, guys. The story told above was an imaginative retelling of what actually happened. My attempt was to make it sound real, but still within the world of Minecraft. The downside is that my plea for help was genuine.</p>
<p>You see, I recently expanded my world from classic-sized to large-sized, in effect multiplying its original size by 32x. When I went to see what lay beyond the boundaries of the known area, my attempt to turn around failed and I lost all sense of direction.</p>
<p>I tried my best to send messages to friends asking for help, as well as game and party invites so they could come find me, but for some reason Xbox Live refused to let me send them. When I would click send or invite, nothing would happen. My brother wasn't
 uploading or even downloading anything at the time, nor was there any Xbox Live service alert. Furthermore, my network seemed to be running normally. Even now, I'm still not sure why I couldn't reach out to anyone. Hell, I even tried to leave an SOS on my
 activity feed - that didn't want to load either!</p>
<p>That's why you got to read my imaginative take on my dire situation - I was desperate, and it was the only way I could think of to still ask for help. I suppose I could've straight out asked you guys to jump into my world and come get me, but where's the
 fun in that?</p>
<p>Still, I am genuinely disappointed that nobody came to help. I literally wasted 4 hours today just wandering the wilderness. Everything in my story is true. I eventually did die at the hands of a vile desert temple trap, for example. The 3x I reached the
 ends of the earth? I literally had - I had to turn around and try a new direction. The sun and moon really did play tricks on me too. When I started the world, the sun always rose from the left and set on the right. When I was lost, the opposite was true,
 which really messed with my sense of direction.</p>
<p>I also made numerous heavy-handed references to Xbox Live in the hopes that someone would figure out that I genuinely needed help. For example, the party-patented, 8-way radio referenced the fact that I had a party open and that I wanted someone to join
 it so I could tell them that I needed help.</p>
<p>Alas, nothing came of it. Well, except for the loss of all of my enchanted, diamond tools (pickaxe, axe, sword, and shovel - all of which never failed me to the bitter end) and iron armor, among other things.</p>
<p>That being said, that life is over. I am now forced to begin again, anew.</p>
<p>I have to wonder, though - if I'm ever in desperate need of help in the future (Minecraft or otherwise), will help ever come?</p>
<p>Minecraft really is a great game, and I recommend it to anyone, despite my own misadventures such as this one...</p>
<p>There are literally countless ways to play this game, if you have the imagination for it. ;)</p>

<p>I need to get cracking with my own xbox 1 worlds i only have roughly 3 worlds. I use to put in heaps of time in 2012 but since im older and since most of my friends are on 360, ive kind of lost the discipline of really working, on worlds. Ill try and do
 some work on my 1 worlds this weekend. Some of my friends have joined me on my worlds. O and its Friday afternoon for australia and new zealand. I have a full 360 friends list but im not striving for 1000 friends orherwise ill struggle with playing with everyone
 regularly. K bye :)</p>

<p>Come to think of it, I would love to make a world where the goal is to ultimately find someone - or something (treasure perhaps?). We already have adventure mode, so that would help out a lot. All I would have to do is just create a massive world filled
 with clues scattered across the various biomes to create a great Minecraft scavenger hunt. The clues left behind would be like the messages above, but shorter.</p>
<p>If I were to do something like this, do you guys think you might be interested enough to participate?</p>

<p>Why don’t I have the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em>&nbsp;app? </p>
<div>
<p>If you don’t see the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em> &nbsp;app on your PC, it might be because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your device isn’t up-to-date with at least Windows&nbsp;7 SP1 or Windows&nbsp;8.1 Update.</li><li>Windows Update is turned off or is not set to received updates automatically.</li><li>You’ve blocked or uninstalled the necessary Windows Update functionality.</li><li>Your device is not running genuine Windows.</li><li>Your Windows License is from a MSDN or TechNet subscription. If it is, you will be able to get Windows 10 through your subscription if it is still active.</li><li>Your computer is part of a Windows Domain</li><li>Microsoft has not determined your device capable of running Windows 10 even though it meets the minimum system requirements.</li><li>You are running a volume license client: Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 8.1 Enterprise
<strong>(only retail store bought or preinstalled OEM licenses) get the upgrade offer.
</strong></li></ol>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will domain joined non volume license Windows Pro clients receive the upgrade offer?</strong></p>
</strong>
<p>Domain Joined computers are not supported at this time unfortunately. Your best option is to download the .ISO file and upgrade the computers manually/offline.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How will Domain Joined computers that are not volume license clients be able to check their systems and reserve the Windows 10 upgrade?</strong></p>
</strong>
<p>You will need to use Enterprise Assessment tools for the range of computers you have. The reservation app does not work in complex IT environments.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is likely to release a new version of its Microsoft Assessment and Planning Toolkit (MAP) that will support Windows 10. It can help you quickly inventory small or large IT environments without requiring you to install any agent software in your
 environment. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Watch this blog for updates to know when it will be available with support for Windows 10.</p>

<p>Hi Maggie,</p>
<p>It is when I open my browser, not when I am using Skype. I recently tried to download a new copy of Skype and ever since it has been going back to the browser so that when I am on the internet bit interrupts what I am researching.</p>

<p>Thank you for your help so far. I could not see how to run the exe file so decided to remove all elements of Skype from my computer and download again. This appears to have worked.</p>

    <title>USB PnP device - sound cuts out, makes unplugging sound when not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> genetic lifeform and disk operating system  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB PnP device - sound cuts out, makes unplugging sound when not touched, &#34;device not recognized&#34; or malfunction, etc...</h2>
                    Here's a hopefully comprehensive list of what happens (this is the Microsoft forums so I expect you guys will read a lot of information):<br />
<ul>
<li>The sound on my USB PnP sound device randomly cuts out for no reason. It is not being touched
<span style="font-style: italic">at al<span style="font-style: italic">l</span></span>, and it happens a lot when I'm not even listening to any sound.</li><li>Before it goes out, it makes a fuzzy sound in the headphones like it is being unplugged or the cord is being cut or something. I have to unplug it and plug it back in a few times for it to work.<br />
</li><li>It's been working properly for several months, it just this month started doing this, for about a week.</li><li>I <span style="font-weight: bold">cannot use my headphone jack</span> because it is loose. I got the usb device to solve this problem because it's too expensive to get the jack fixed. I didn't buy the device first hand, I got it from a family member who
 took my laptop in to get it fixed, and the guy there recommended and sold us two of these jacks.<br />
</li><li>When it goes out during a game, I cannot get the sound to return. I can sometimes fix it on a game (like Portal 2, for example) by going into options and changing the sound type (or whatever it's called) from headphones to speakers, then back to headphones.
 However, the game often freezes when the sound goes out and I have to remove the usb, and in that case the game also has to be restarted. Plus, not everything has sound options like that.<br />
</li><li>This happens randomly, but it tends to happen every five minutes or every few seconds, and coincidentally it almost
<span style="font-style: italic">always </span>happens during a loading screen on a video game.</li><li>It doesn't always give me a warning sound, especially on games. It just goes silent.</li><li>The device manager does not show an exclamation point or question mark next to any sound device and the usb pnp device is listed properly. In the sound options in control panel, there are sound bars next to the usb device that shows that sound is playing,
 but it isn't <span style="font-style: italic">actually </span>playing. <span style="font-weight: bold">
The usb pnp device is listed as the default device,</span> so don't tell me to do that.
<span style="font-weight: bold">The microphones are disabled as well.</span></li><li>It does the same thing in all my usb ports.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-weight: bold">The driver is up to date and meant for Windows 7.</span></span></li><li>I do not install Windows Updates. <span style="font-style: italic">
Updates are evil.</span></li><li>The box for it calls it a "USB External Stereo Audio Adapter" by StarTech.com, or "ICUSBAUDIO"<span style="font-style: italic">.</span> It came with a disk which I used to install
 the driver, and I went to their website to get one for Windows 7 specifically and installed that.</li><li>I'm running a Windows 7 64-bit laptop. In device manager, there are three things listed under sound: Realtek High Definition Audio, Intel(R) Display Audio, and USB PnP Sound Device. None of the USB devices have exclamation points.</li><li>For the first time today, when the usb made it's unplugging sound, my computer told me "Device not recognized" and said it might have malfunctioned; when I clicked on it for more info, it said it couldn't tell me what the usb even was because it was not
 plugged in, which wasn't true. I also had a window show up that tried to install the device driver (it's already installed) and then told me the device had been unplugged before it could do so (not true). The latter just happened a couple seconds ago, for
 the second time today.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the link and run the Fixit and check.</p>
<p>Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows </p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/en-us</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Install Windows updates as some updates may fix some issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you mention that the computer is second hand troubleshooting&nbsp;accurately would be difficult. I suggest that you contact the manufacturer. Refer the link.</p>
