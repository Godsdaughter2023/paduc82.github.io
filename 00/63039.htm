    <title>Empty Open Folder Icons on Desktop - Windows 10 Home - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r-lewllewellyn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Empty Open Folder Icons on Desktop - Windows 10 Home</h2>
                    <p>I just got through with a remote session with a Client of mine. There were 4,869 Empty, Open Folder icons on his desktop. I ran Malwarebytes and&nbsp;Defender, and they did not find any malware or viruses on the system. The folders were numbered, without a name,
 and empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue started September 12, 2016, when a remote Tech Company took control of his computer. After the session, he could no longer log into the computer. He took the computer to the Microsoft Store in White Plains, NY to resolve the login problem. After
 they resolved that issue, they called him and asked him if he wanted all of the empty folders on the desktop. He didn't, and the Microsoft Store Technician deleted the folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When he brought the system home and turned it back on, the 4,869 "new" empty folders appeared again on the desktop. After my GoToAssist session, I haven't a clue what is causing the issue. There are no programs running at Start Up, no unknown items starting
 on the Taskbar, etc. The folders were numbered, no name, and no properties...just an empty, Open Folder icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to delete the folders, but expect that they will return. IMO, there is an unknown Malware/Virus/??? causing the folders to be generated in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any of you have a clue to the problem or resolution, please let me/us know, as I feel this will reoccur with other users!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks! Lew Llewellyn, Norwalk, CT</p>

            <p>Hi Lew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you go back to the Microsoft Store and ask for an alternative solution because it seems like the issue has not yet been resolved. Since it has been brought to the Microsoft Store prior, they would know what they need to do next.</p>
<p>

<p>Same here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Windows Store shows&nbsp;Code: 0x00000190 and nothing else</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Start menu search does not run, it does nothing and it shows nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried resetting Windows Store, reinstalling Cortana, resetting Windows to a clean state etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All this came about after Windows installed the Creators Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Windows Event Viewer, I can see the following under System:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<em>The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Activation permission for the COM Server application with CLSID&nbsp;</em><br />

</p><p>
</p><p>I have verified all the permissions seem to be correct in RegEdit and in Component Services / DCOM.</p>

<p>Hi Mr. Smith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the issues and error message you've mentioned and the troubleshooting steps you've tried, this looks like a Windows Store server problem. Since this thread has been idle for 2days, there's a possibility that the server is now working. For us to
 verify, we would like to know if Windows Store is already working on your end or do you still receive or experience the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Vanessa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the same problem and the same error message is still there. I think it is a problem related to my local Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, when I start the Calculator, it opens but closes itself immediately after that. Also, Microsoft Edge does not open any web page at all. At the same time, Internet Explorer works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the start menu search does not function at all, there is no search animation nor any results.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to reset Windows but at least using the option that keeps user data intact did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Cortana and Microsoft Edge, the Windows Event Viewer contains the following errors:</p>
<p><em>The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Activation permission for the COM Server application with CLSID&nbsp;</em><br />
<em>{C2F03A33-21F5-47FA-B4BB-156362A2F239}</em><br />

            That I had already tried and also several other things, but none of those was of any help.<br />
<br />
I finally managed to fix it by doing a full reset without retaining the user data.<br />
<br />
To be honest, Windows10 is the most brittle and least stable generation of Windows I have used since Windows XP came out.<br />
<br />
Please test your releases more thoroughly before you release them.

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />Places to look for your BitLocker key:
<br />	○ -On a printout you saved. Look in places you keep important papers.
<br />	○ -Saved on a USB flash drive. Plug the USB flash drive in to your locked PC and follow the instructions. If you saved the key as a text file on the flash drive, use a different computer to read the text file.
<br />	○ -In your Microsoft account. To get your recovery key, go to&nbsp;BitLocker Recovery Keys.
<br />	○ -In your Azure Active Directory account. For work PCs where you sign in with an Azure Active Directory account, to get your recovery key, see the device info for your&nbsp;Microsoft Azure account.﻿﻿
<br />Or ask someone for help:
<br />	○ -Ask someone with administrator privileges on the same PC to unlock it with their key.
<br />-If your PC is connected to a domain (usually a work or school computer), ask a system administrator for your recovery key.
<br />

    <title>Halo MCC Freezing back to Dashboard. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dadliestgamer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Halo MCC Freezing back to Dashboard.</h2>
                    
<p>The other night a buddy and I were co-oping the Halo CE LASO playlist on Master Chief Collection when twice I experienced my game freezing, making an obnoxious buzzing noise through my headset then kicking me back to the dashboard. The first time it happened
 about an hour into the level, the second time about 4 hours into our play through(we were 3/4 of the way done). If anyones played Truth and Rec LASO, you can only imagine how frustrated we are. In the 500+ hours of gameplay this is the first time I've experienced
 this problem during the campaign but I've previously had this issue while looking through the Speedrun leaderboards. I can almost get it to happen on demand there.</p>
<p>My console is powered down daily as I never use "instant on mode", at the time it was recently unplugged for a few minutes while I moved it from my main tv back to my monitor. I've read somewhere online that maybe having a near full Hard Drive could cause
 these issues? Mine was at around 90%.</p>
<p>Anyway, what can I do to fix this or at least have confidence in a prevention method. Just yesterday I went out and bought a 2 TB external, deleted a bunch of games including MCC off my internal then reinstalled it to the new drive. Surprisingly it took
 about 2 hours to install compared to the 15 hours it originally took me. I went back into the leaderboards where I can usually replicate the issue pretty quick and within a minute it locked up and froze. I'm terrified to give this level on LASO another shot,
 its a grueling grind and I really don't want to waste another 5 hours of gameplay for zero progress.</p>

            <p>Hey there DadliestGamer.</p>
<p>Odd that you're having such consistent freezing issues. Have you possibly tried playing through the level while playing offline? Often teams internet connection can be the cause for in-game trouble such as this. Let us know if you've tried playing while offline :) </p>

<p>Thanks for the reply Mister Maka!</p>
<p>I've played a bunch of levels offline including Truth and Rec just not on LASO since I don't want to go through that punishment alone lol. Solo I never have any issues with campaign, I've also previously never had any issues playing Co-op. I don't understand
 why this particular level has been giving me so much trouble. My co-op buddy mentioned that it seemed to happen during some of the bigger explosions in game, I figured the Xbone should be able to handle the demand of an Annv game made originally for the 360.</p>
<p>After my first post about this, I deleted my local save, my gamertag, then unplugged my xbox again for a good 20 minutes. When I signed back on I re-downloaded my Tag and sync'd my save from the cloud. Turned off BD Live as I read it as a suggestion somewhere
 else and unplugged my Kinect. We tried one last time to beat this level and actually succeeded without a hiccup. I don't know if any one of these things fixed it or if it was the new external since the game seemed to run smoother. But I'm happy to at least
 put that Nightmare of a level behind me, and hopefully no more freezing during LASO runs lol.</p>

<p>Hello Todd218,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the recipient is using Skype for Business client, it’s an expected behavior that you will see this notification. You don’t need to make any changes about Skype for Business client on your side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you and the recipients both use Microsoft Teams, please give us a screenshot of the error message. We may need to check if it’s a problem or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Barry</p>

    <title>Metal Gear Solid V&#58; Phantom Pain Installation Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> allthegooddogs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Metal Gear Solid V&#58; Phantom Pain Installation Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there:</p>
<p>I recently purchased MGSV: TPP over Xbox Live and started downloading it. &nbsp;After several hours, the installation stopped, but when I went back to the Queue later, the game was not there, and I was informed that it was "Ready to Play!"
 &nbsp;(I checked the game's status, and so far as I could tell, there was nothing left to download). I finished the prologue (wonderfully done, beautiful game btw) and was met with a black screen that says only 8.0% of the game data is downloaded, and that I need
 to wait for the rest.</p>
<p>Many hours later, I am still at 8.0%. &nbsp;My connection to xbox live is active/secure, and I have tried hard resetting and downloading (unnecessary) xbox updates. &nbsp;I am stuck. &nbsp;Any suggestions, besides uninstalling and re-downloading?</p>

            <p>When you say you're still at 8%, did you return to the dashboard or did you leave the game running in the foreground? If you were at the dashboard, try leaving the game running for an hour (on the screen where it says more needs to be downloaded) and see if the percentage increases.</p>
<p>If the game still does nothing, I'm afraid the best option sounds like the uninstall and reinstall that you mentioned.</p>
<p>Let us know how you get on.</p>

<h2>            Designer Mouse clicks but doesn&#39;t move</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Microsoft Designer Mouse and it worked properly for the past year. but recently, I tried to use it and noticed that the bottom blue light is not turning on. First I thought that this was a battery related problem, but the mouse still connects and
 clicks normally. &nbsp;What should I do? There are no apparent damages to it, and it was kept safe from any harm. I don't know if this is a hardware or software problem. Already tried reconnecting and updating the driver, nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Frederico,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue can be related to hardware problems.</p>

<p>How can I migrate my account to the Live BR services? My account is US but I live in Brazil and don't have access to all the games and apps due to IP region.</p>

<p>Would love to know the answer to this as well as I am emigrating to Australia.</p>
<p>I contacted support and basically was told no you can't migrate the account which I don't believe for a second. I can understand not being able to migrate microsoft points and some DLC, but there must be a way to change my account from a UK one to an Australian
 account.</p>

<p>@op why didn't you migrate when the tool was available</p>
<p>@trulch well no Australia was a launch region therefore was never available for migration</p>
<p>The tool was only for the new 9 regions not existing </p>
Your only option is create a new account even if the tool was still available @op noone took the warnings seriously and it was abused by phishers So they took it off Noone believed that it wasn't reversible They will only rebuild an account for compromise access
 no other reason Create a new account People used the tool and complained about content but they forgot the tool was to enable local billing and follow the terms of use And that it was only one way

<p>I don't see "being a launch region" as a good excuse to not offer a way to migrate my account. Basically all I want to keep is Gamertag if possible, something I've invested time and money in to for 8 years and I'm being told no you can't do it when people
 in other countries have been able to.How is that possibly fair?</p>
<p>MS is a global services company and yet their users are being restricted by country, again I understand where licencing is involved this has to be the case, but if I wish to use my account in Australia, I should be able to.</p>
<p>On a side note, I use a Windows Phone, I will have to set up a new email address for a new Xbox Live account, meaning I wont be able to use Xbox Live on my phone for my new account as I use the currently attached email address for everything.</p>

            <p>Hey there Trutch - We can certainly understand where you're coming from. You actually are free to use your account in another region, but there may be issues with purchasing or downloading content, and your previously purchased content may not function correctly. At this time, we do not have a means of migrating accounts to alleviate these issues. </p>

<p>Hi Miss Portia, thanks for the information. I had the understanding that I wouldn't be able to use my UK account in Australia, and was actually told this was a violation of the ToS in an email from customer services. If it is ok to keep using the account
 then I will carry on doing that.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>Okay, I'm using LIVE US here in Brazil and I'm really upset about those download issues... Almost all the GoD are blocked for my IP region..</p>
<p>When the tool was enabled I didn't used it cause this was not our main account.. Our first console account belongs to my girlfriend and she migrated to LIVE BR.. But then I created mine and forgot to migrate...</p>
<p>Now, 4 months later, I wish I had =(</p>
<p>No way I could go to Live Br, Miss Portia?</p>

<p>Brazil being one of them. That they can do it over the phone. But don't know if that's the case or not.</p>

<h2>            Skype custom voice message</h2>
                    We use a Skype number as our business contact number and in the past have been able to forward calls to a message bank as the office is not always attended. We have used a custom recorded welcome message however since moving to O365, have lost the recorded
 voice message and cannot find how to re-record this. Instead our customers hear a generic 'the person you are trying to call is not available' when they call us. How do we change this please?

<p>The standard consumer version of Skype has not offered that capability for quite some time now. If that is what you are still using, no option exists. If you are using Skype for Business, I would refer you to the guidance found on this page:</p>

            Thanks for your answer. &nbsp;I followed every step mentioned but I wasn't able to fix it. &nbsp;I contacted Microsoft Tech Support 2 weeks ago, and after all this time, they call me today to let me know that they can't fix this issue because they can't locate the&nbsp;usb.inf
 file for windows 7 64bit in my computer. &nbsp;They don't have the file neither, even though they work for Microsoft ..??????? &nbsp;They advised me to format the hard drive and reinstall windows 7 or to locate the file in a friend's computer running Windows 7 64 bit....
 This doesn't make any sense to me... any other ideas?

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to wi-fi...seems like some kind of computer problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi...<br />
I am using Windows 7 on Dell and have not been able to connect to wi-fi with this device for months. It always lets me connect through the ethernet cable. This laptop was months ago upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10 and several weeks after the upgrade wi-fi wouldn't
 connect anymore. Wi-fi worked fine before that on the previous Win 7, so I restored back to it but it did not resolve the problem. Tried to look online for help, nothing worked... Meanwhile, another computer with Win 7 and iPhones in the household all connect
 to wi-fi with no problems. I just recently decided to reinstall Win 7 on this laptop from a CD. I figured if the post-Win 10 Win 7 version couldn't connect to wi-fi, then if I put a new one in it'll be a clean slate and there will be no issues. Not the case...Wi-fi
 still not working. It's showing me the list of networks and I can see the one I added, but it says it's unable to connect every time. Troubleshooter only suggests to reset the router which I've done seems like thousand times now. Laptop is inches away from
 the router too. I don't think it's the router issue. I went through Windows Update, it updated to Service Pack 1. Updated all the drivers. Maybe something is wrong with my wi-fi network adapter I'm thinking. When I try to update the driver from Device Manager,
 it is stuck on "searching online for software". It's Intel WiFi Link 5100 AGN. I tried to look on Intel's website and using their Intel Driver Update Utility and it showed nothing. I also tried checking available drivers off Dell's support website and I downloaded
 and installed the latest driver, restarted the laptop, it didn't do anything. I've searched online for days for resolution and there are a million other people in similar situations it seems, no tricks helped. I'm so at a loss as far as what is causing this
 wi-fi problem. I decided to write here because it seems like it's a problem in a component of my OS. Can anyone help? Thank you in advance...</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
If you can't resolve the issue then you can disable the WiFi device in the BIOS and/or Device Manager and use a USB WiFi device which is not expensive.</p>
<p><br />
WiFi works best if the computer is not too close to the router, at least a few feet.<br />
<br />
Some Dell's have WiFi&nbsp;On/Off switches and hotkeys. Have you checked with Dell Support, on-line documentation and drivers, and asked in their forums about any known issues.<br />

<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />

Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are <br />
you positioned from the router? Are there obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - click Update Driver (may not do<br />
anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi<br />
Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />

Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Installing and updating drivers in Windows&nbsp;7 (updating drivers manually <br />
using the methods&nbsp;below is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System <br />
maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated <br />
drivers as Windows 7&nbsp;loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />
I would also disable auto-updates for drivers. If Windows Updates suggests <br />
one just HIDE it as they are almost alway old and you can look for drivers<br />
manually as needed.</p>

            <p>Hi Michelle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help! I recognize I came across this guide in search of a solution. I'm away from that computer until tomorrow evening and I will try to get the wireless report. I also remember trying to ping my default gateway and thinking, do I do this
 with ethernet plugged in or not? As long as the cable is in the computer, I have internet and ping is successful as expected. As soon as the cable is out, it failed to ping.
</p>
<p>I believe the router or ISP aren't the culprits because wifi works without problems on all of the Apple devices in the house.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to update the wifi network driver automatically with ethernet cable in and it's just gotten stuck on the "searching for update" screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For manual install, I tried to install the latest driver offered on Dell's support website, specific to my service tag. It was a 2012 version and I have not found anything at all on Intel's site.Your teammate in the post below offered a number of resources
 to look for the driver further; I will explore or at least start exploring those tomorrow evening when I'm off work for the day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran network adapter troubleshooter earlier and remember no fixes...I will re-run it tomorrow too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did also try reset/ renew/ release/ flush commands in cmd and there was no change after restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did uninstall the network adapter driver from Device Manager and restart, it automatically re-installed but didn't fix my issue. I did hear others have had success with this trick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't tried network reset or to take firewall down temp. I will try all the steps as above and will get back to yall on results.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The router still can be involved even if other computers are working just fine. Make sure it has the latest firmware.<br />

            <p>Hi SpiritX MS MVP,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your time and sharing possible ways to fix my problem!</p>
<p>I'm in between work shifts this weekend and will have some solid time to dedicate to this tomorrow evening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for letting me know about the separate wifi device I could use if my wireless is stubborn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll also try moving the computer farther away in the room, it may be sitting too close! Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a wifi button on the keyboard and I looked everywhere else on the laptop and didn't identify any switches. When wifi button is pressed, there's no light but it shows as a red X over the wifi symbol on the display if it's off. I have used Dell Support
 to scan the computer for issues and just look for drivers, but I chose this site to troubleshoot first because really think it's something to do with the system components, like the wifi network adapter.</p>
<p>I will check out the Dell and the other two resources you referenced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did call my ISP and asked if they can possibly update the firmware on my modem/router. I bought it after leasing the ISP's modem/router for way too long. This Arris (Motorola) router cannot be updated through the router login page and official site says
 there's no firmware available. I read online that ISP has to update the router, by request. I called and they said it's running the latest version. The guy said he didn't think it's the router because if it was, then all of my house devices would have connectivity
 problems. Makes sense, though who knows having latest firmware is safest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm (the computer is) sitting possibly too close to the router. I will try to move the computer. There are no obstructions it seems. Rouuter is sitting on the bookshelf and my table with the laptop is attached to the bookcase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to update the wifi driver but I have only tried 3 ways: automatic via Device Manager, download from Intel, and from Dell Support. I will research your suggestions and resources in detail tomorrow evening! I'll sure be busy haha!</p>
<p>

<p>I tried to do wireless network report, as Michelle suggested, but the link was for Win 10. The cmd command didn't work on my Win 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Went to Win 7 support, connectivity section, and went through the options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basics...<br />
-Wifi switch is ON on the keyboard and there are no other wifi physical switches<br />
-Went across the room but in clear path of the router to not be too close to it, it didn't make a difference<br />
-Router settings are pretty much factory set, there's no restrictions on MAC filtering, wireless definitely enabled, security setting WPA2-PSK and this matches the setting in the wifi profile I created on the computer.<br />
<br />
-Ran Network Diagnostic Troubleshooter for the wireless adapter specifically - no luck with connecting but got feedback:<br />
--"None of the networks you have previously connected to are in range - not fixed"<br />
--"Problem with wireless adapter or access point - detected"<br />
Clicked "explore additional options" -&gt; no additional info, Win provided links to resources where I can search for help, like this forum.<br />
<br />
-Wifi network driver update (current version installed # 14.3.2.1)<br />
--Device Manager (search automatically) - it was stuck on "searching online for software" for literally 30 minutes, I decided it was enough time and cancelled it<br />
--Device Manager (manual install)<br />
---Off Intel's site: it said it provides no more support for Intel WiFi Link 5100 and there were no drivers at all. I downloaded Intel ProSet Wireless tool* to manage networks (instead of Win native wifi manager)<br />
--Off Dell's site: got the latest driver version they had, installed manually via Device Manager, it said that I have the latest version installed (my current driver version did not change after installation)<br />
--iObit Driver Booster software scan: no drivers found<br />
--Driver download sites, didn't find anything more recent than what I have<br />
<br />
*When I ran a search for my problem, I came across a forum where someone said that this ProSet wireless tool is able to turn wireless on and off, kind of like an additional hard switch that some Dell laptops have. It's unlike pressing the wifi button on the
 keyboard. I made sure the switch in the software is on, but it isn't able to connect.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
-Went to cmd as admin to run network commands (to reset TCP/IP. release IP, renew IP, flush DNS)<br />
--Could not renew wireless because media disconnected<br />
(screenshot of ipconfig release and renew (through Dropbox share, should work for anyone):&nbsp;<br />
https://www.dropbox.com/s/fgl4vywt0c9aixf/release.JPG?dl=0</p>
<p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/wvlsch0mszeqrfb/renew.JPG?dl=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Ran Dell Diagnostics previously, it "passed" my wifi network adapter<br />
</p>
<p>I am also exploring Intel forum with search about Intel Wifi link 5100 AGN windows 7 not working, hoping to find some useful information. Thank you...</p>

<h2>            Sound Familiar&#58; The System Could Not Find The Environment Option You Entered.</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>This is on a Toshiba Portege M200 Tablet with 2 GB RAM, 320 HD, Nvidea FX Go 5200 (32 MB), SD Card Slot, Wacom Tablet Digitizer, PC Card slot, Touch Pad, BlueTooth (Cambridge), and WiFi (Intel 2100 b/g).</p>
<p>A brand new install of Windows 7 Ultimate with RC Service Pack 1, Visual Studio 2010, Microsoft Phone 7 Developer Tools, CloneBytes Virtual DVD, FTM 2011, 7-Zip, Direct X SDK (June 2010) and all Windows Updates (not many after installing RC Service Pack
 1).</p>
<p>The problem?</p>
<p>The System Could Not Find The Environment Option You Entered.</p>
<p>for almost everything.</p>
<p>This&nbsp;problem existed in Vista and now Windows 7 since Vista was released. Search the boards and you'll see it time and again. It's time for MS to fix it.</p>
<p>This happened after spending a&nbsp;few hours clean installing Windows Vista (including SP1 RC), Visual Studio 2010, and Microsoft Developer Phone Tools (XNA 4.0, Microsoft Phone 7 Development stuff like Expression 4 for Phone Tools and Silverlight 4 SDK) and
 then rebooting. The system did not hang on reboot. Expression 4 was the last thing installed before I rebooted. I am suspicious of it as it seems to use different GUI then the rest of Windows and maybe under diffrent things under the hood. I installed everthing
 in one session with no reboots (except of course when installed Windows 7 and the RC Service Pack originally).</p>
<p>Many icons are broken, sound is broken, most System Administration Tools are broken (Event Viewer, Device Manager, Advanced System Settings).</p>
<p>Before you tell me to remove SP1 you should know this Windows 7 will corrupt itself without it after it auto updates with some Windows Update patch (a 15 mb one if I remember). And you should remember MS is about to release SP1 RC to the general public so
 first go tell MS they shouldn't release this SP1 to the general public.</p>
<p>Yes, I have old HW but it is supported old HW and yes I would like to buy new HW. My mistake was paying for new MS SW (and its VERY EXPENSIVE) rather than buying new HW. New HW is better value for my mone it seems than new MS software.</p>
<p>I was wanting to program using Windows 7 Phone Development Tools but if this mess doesn't straighten out I have a Mac and I can get Linux for this laptop, I'll just do iOS or Android programming and spend much LESS money.</p>
<p>That said, except that this problem seems to show up again and now, after months of being OK, again, Windows 7 runs good on this old HW.</p>
<p>+++++</p>
<p>So from this Explorer location (as an example, icons and such are broken just about everywhere including the start menu):</p>
<p>Control Panel\System and Security\System</p>
<p>1. Trying to start Device Manager gives this error:</p>
<p>::{26EE0668-A00A-44D7-9371-BEB064C98683}\0\::{74246BFC-4C96-11D0-ABEF-0020AF6B0B7A}</p>
<p>The system could not find the environment option that was entered.</p>
<p>2. Trying to start Advanced system settings</p>
<p>Windows cannot find '%windir%\system32\systempropertiesadvanced.exe'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again.</p>
<p>3. Using Run... to try and run regedit gives this error:</p>
<p>C:\Windows\regit.exe</p>
<p>The system could not find the environment option that was entered.</p>
<p>4. Going to Accessories&gt;Cmd Tool&gt;Right Click&gt;Run as Administrator doesn't work. You see the icon is missing and a cmdtool never starts.</p>
<p>5. Windows Update finds (minor, optional) updates but I don't dare try to install then with the system in this state. I am surprised that networking is working at all.</p>
<p>+++++</p>
<p>Now I know there are no viruses, trojans and the like because these have all been installed cleanly from new downloads from Microsoft's own sites.</p>
<p>All these problems seem to have to same root cause.</p>
<p>I'm hoping fixing this is childishly simple as entering %windir% somehow in the registry with regedit.exe but how do I start regedit now?</p>
<p>How many different places do I need to entered %windir% in the registry?</p>
<p>Why did this sudden disappear. Is the ridiculous strings of characters mentioned earlier&nbsp;that is enclosed in braces Microsoft's robust portable way of saying %windir%? What is that anyway? It seems to be some variable that lacks definition and without that
 definitions Windows 7 Ultimate (32bit) just does not&nbsp;right.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to fix this. I've been pretty clear as to the symtoms and possible causes given the restrictions this broken version of Windows has put on me.&nbsp;</p>

            These blue arrows are nothing to worry about. I'm assuming that you have Norton360 installed. The blue arrows are just indicators to let you know what has been backed up and what hasnt been. To get rid of the arrows, open up Norton and go to settings.
 Then go to backup. There is an option that says "Backup Status Overlay". If you uncheck this option then the arrows will no longer appear. It wont make your computer more vulnerable or anything, it just gets rid of the arrows.

<h2>            Windows 10 and hardware upgrade</h2>
                    With Windows 7 I was able to transfer my copy of Windows 7 from my old PC to my new rebuilt PC. Upgraded motherboard, ram, etcc. Can I do this with Windows 10. Would hate to have to spend @ $200.00 every time I want to upgrade my hardware. I kept Windows
 7 for over 5 years. Never moved to Windows 8.&nbsp; I may upgrade my hardware in two years time, and will want to still run Windows on it.&nbsp; I'm not your average joe. But a tech enthusiast, who likes to build my own PC, and even dualboot with Linux Mint.

            <p>Sure, you'll be able to do it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. From an elevated command prompt, type <strong>slmgr /dlv </strong>and hit Enter. You'll get a script window with your activation

<p>
</p><p>2. Now, type <strong>slmgr /upk </strong><strong><em>your product ID here</em></strong> and hit Enter. The product key is now uninstalled from the system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. After you upgrade your hardware or if you have a new PC you want to transfer the license to, open an elevated command prompt, type
<strong>slmgr /ipk <em>your product key here</em></strong> and hit Enter.</p>

<h2>            Fighting games on XONE</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I don't know where to post this but I need to tell you this:</p>
<p>After the announcement of Street Fighter 5 and KOF 14 on PS4, MS have to move to give to XONE customers access to it.</p>
<p>KI is not suffisent, corresponding to a marginal community, to keep the image of TOP Geek console, MS needs a real Japanese fighting Game. And those 2 monuments SF and KOF couldn't be avoided by a generation...</p>
<p>Buying an arcade stick with the lack of titles is not an option, this is for me the biggest lack of this console face of other platforms.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>
<p>RG</p>

<h2>            hp laserjet 1300 prints light grey. How do I get it to print darker black</h2>
                    I am using Windows 7&nbsp; on a Toshiba, and printing with HP LaserJet 1300. Text comes out very light black, almost gray. How&nbsp; do I get the printer to print the text in a heavier, black color? When I use my Vaio, the printed text comes out dark black and very
 easy to read! How do I get the printer to give me the same quality when I use my Toshiba as when I use my Vaio?<br />

            <p><span>Hi James, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to the Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if this helps in resolving the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try connecting the DVD drive to different system and let us know the status.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I recommend you to un-install/re-install the DVD drive deriver and check.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and select <strong>
Device Manager. </strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>DVD/ CD-ROM drives</strong> to expand, right click on the
<strong>device</strong> and click on <strong>Uninstall.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once you are done un-installing the driver restart the computer, it will automatically install the generic driver.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>If the issue still persist, try updating <strong>DVD/ CD-ROM drives </strong>
and check.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and select <strong>
Device Manager. </strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>DVD/ CD-ROM drives</strong> to expand, right click on the
<strong>device</strong> and click on <strong>Update.</strong></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>If the above method sis not help to fix the issue, try the below method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persist, I suggest you to go to the <strong>DVD/ CD-ROM drives</strong> manufacturer website and download the latest updated
<strong>DVD/ CD-ROM drives </strong>driver and install the same. If the available driver is not for Windows 10 you try install the driver in compatibility mode.
</span></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right-click on the setup file of the driver and select<strong> Properties</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Check Run this program in <strong>Compatibility mode</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</p>
</li></ol>
