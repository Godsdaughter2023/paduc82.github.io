<h2>            Install multiple windows updates using wusa in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to use a script to do multiple quiet windows updates (*.msu) for Windows 7 using wusa.<br />
I have a script which achieves this for Vista, but the Windows 7 version of wusa seems to need a different syntax.</p>
<p>It installs the first update OK, but then displays a&nbsp;windows&nbsp;showing the correct syntax, seeming to indicate it doesn't understand the syntax of the command.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It now seems that the problem was in the preparation of the (*.msu) update files.</p>
<p>The script needed to have the folder name shortened.</p>

<h2>            Reporting a bug on Skype 7.36.0.150&#58; Cannot make or receive calls on Win XP</h2>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p></td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>I'm reporting a bug in Skype 7.36.0.150 (Windows desktop XP last vversion) that prevents me from making or receiving anny calls on Windows XP SP3. I'I'm not talking about international calls or mobile skype calls. I'm referring to regular, normal, desktop-to-desktop,
 same-country Skype calls. The problem started with the newest version, 7.36.0.101. I encontered this problem last week, so I tried many things to solve it: reinstalling, making a clean reinstall and a regular one, checking internet settings, restoring the
 system. I even changed my internet browser (from Internet Explorer 6 to Chrome, setting it as my default browser) but it didn't work, Skype still recognized IE6 as the default browser and calling was still imposible. I couldn't even call the sound test service:
 Skype just hung itself, it didn't even ring. It just hung itself. I've been using Skype for the last 10 years and never encontered such a problem. So, after trying many things, I decided to roll back to previous versions. I went back to version 7.35.0.103
 and boom! It worked perfectly: I could make, receive calls again, I called the sound test service and everything was perfectly fine. So, I'm staying with version 7.35.0.103 until this bug gets fixed. I don't know what happened, but this is a problem/bug that
 appears exclusively on this last version 7.36.0.101, so it must be a bug. Hope you can fix it for the next version, 7.37; Skype is very important for many people and I cannot stop using it. So, I'm staying with version 7.35 that works perfectly. I'd attach
 the logs, but I don't see any "attach" buttons here, so...</p>
<p>P.S.: While I was trying various things to solve the problem, I signed out of my account. Then I found I couldn't log back in, even rolling back to previous versions (I rolled back as far as version 7.15 and could not login. My Skype account is perfectly
 fine and working BTW, it works on the Skype forums and everything). When I tried to login, I got a message saying "Skype cannot connect." and checking the forums, I see a lot of Windows users are having the same issue I had. Again, hope these issues get fixed
 for the next version, 7.37. A lot of people depend on Skype for calling, even make calls on the same country, and for me at least, version 7.36.0.101 is useless right now. So, I'm staying with 7.35 until this gets fixed. Thanks, and please fix this bug. Regards,
 George</p>

<p>I am using the latest version just fine on several Windows XP computers.&nbsp;&nbsp; All of my computers meet&nbsp;Skype's minimum requires in both hardware and&nbsp;software (even if they are older machines).&nbsp; Not meeting those requirements can&nbsp;create issues as you go from&nbsp;version
 to version.&nbsp;If you are running Windows XP you need to make sure:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; You are running the XP/Visa build of Skype.&nbsp; That is not version 7.36.0.101.&nbsp; The latest version of Skype for Windows XP/Vista is
<a href="https://download.skype.com/1de55ae8023424270d5c382554da5584/SkypeSetupFullXp.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 version.</p>
2.&nbsp; You have the latest Service Pack installed.&nbsp;That is SP3 for XP 32-bit and SP2 for XP 64-bit.
<p>3.&nbsp; You have updated your Internet Explorer to the latest/last version for XP.&nbsp; This would be IE 8.</p>
<p>Running an older version can create serious problems with your ability to sign in.&nbsp; This and the above have been minimum requirements for years.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; You have the latest<a href="http://download.windowsupdate.com/msdownload/update/v3/static/trustedr/en/rootsupd.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Rootcerts
</a>installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All versions prior to Skype 7.17 have been retired.&nbsp; Trying to run these older versions you will either be unable to connect or stay connected.</p>

<p>Thanks for answering.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running version 7.36.0.150 for XP. That's the exact version that presented the problem. I didn't download it from an external website, but from the Skype site. I only wrotte that number because I couldn't see, at the time, which exact number/version
 I was running. I'm using Windows XP SP3 32 bit. I know that using a version of Internet Explorer older than IE8 could (could) cause signing problems, and that rolling back to a version older than 7.15 can't also work. Apparently, that's the reason why I couldn't
 login propperly into my account. However, that doesn't explain the not-making-or-receiving-calls issue. Why, when I'using version 7.36.0.150 I cannot make or receive calls, but as soon as I roll back to version 7.35.0.103, it works perfectly fine? That's why
 I insist it's a bug exclusively related to this version. The signing problems --I understand, they are caused by an older browser. But the calling issue? Why it gets resolved when I roll back to version 7.35? And why, when I set Google Chrome as my default
 browser, Skype still does not work and keeps opening with IE? It doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I ask you once more to check and fix the 7.36.0.150 version for XP: it has this bug that prevents making or receiving calls. I would like to send you the logs
 I took when I was running the last version, but again I don't see how I could attach those to my message. Right now, I'm running version 7.35 that works perfectly with the calling issue. Also, I've edited my previous message, to showcase the exact version
 I was running when having the problem. I'I did a clean reinstall a couple of minutes ago to make sure, downloaded version 7.36.0.150 from the link you gave me. Same issue, cannot make or receive calls. I don't even get an error message, Skype hangs itself,
 it doesn't even ring. I rolled back to version 7.35 and surprise surprise, it works perfectly fine. The login issue I can understand, the calling issue is completely disconcerting and I strongly think it's a bug. Please, I beg you, check it and take it into
 account, before the next version gets released. Thanks again</p>

<p>I have no idea what your exact issue is.&nbsp; A condition of that nature would have error messages, or signs of connection issues.&nbsp; You have not presented&nbsp;much for me to work with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue can be network-related.&nbsp; Skype has made networking changes in the past few releases that might not work in your existing configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you run multiple network connections simultaneously?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do have multiple IPs per network adapter?&nbsp; </p>
<p>These might cause issues.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>A newer version of Skype can be blocked by your antivirus for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; This can be due to it finding Skype suspicious or different enough from the last version that was run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried disabling or temporarily uninstalling you antivirus it case it is blocking that specific version of Skype?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype uses IE's engine, as a resource.&nbsp; It does not use Google Chrome.&nbsp; If you set Chrome as your default browser it will allow you to open up your links in Chrome, like the ones sent to you in Skype.</p>
<p>If this is not working properly you would need to reset IE to defaults, then set Chrome as your default browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>General freezing can also be cause by problematic drivers.&nbsp; Skype makes updates that may require you to update your drivers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried updating your video and audio drivers to the latest release?</p>
<p>That may resolve this condition.</p>

<p><span>Yes, I know I’m not giving you a lot of information to work with here. Maybe if you'd have the required logs you’d be more helpful, but I don't see how I could send it to you. However, here's the central issue that manifests in the last
 version of Skype:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. The problem is not audio-or-video-related specifically: the audio/video work perfectly fine on Skype. The central issue is that I simply cannot make</span></p>
<p><span>or receive calls, from anyone, even if we are in the same country, even if we're just calling from desktop to desktop. I've re-checked my Windows audio</span></p>
<p><span>drivers, video card/settings...everything works fine. And anyway, they wouldn't work propperly if they were not updated to the last version.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. The problem goes like this: I make a call, audio or video, to the sound test service for example. The call begins, I hear the little beeping sound that Skype makes when connecting calls (the 4 beeping sounds before the call starts ringing)
 and then I hear the sound Skype makes when the call doesn’t connect and it just hangs. The program does not freeze or close, it just hangs the call. A message saying</span></p>
<p><span>"The call to Sound Test service has not been answered" appears on my chat window, and that's all. No error messages, no freezing of the program, the call</span></p>
<p><span>connects, and 4 seconds later it just hangs itself. I roll back to version 7.35 and it works fine again: the call connects, rings, audio/video work perfectly,</span></p>
<p><span>I can get and make calls again. Meanning, the problem is related exclusively to the program, and to version 7.36 specifically.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. I tried and discarded a lot of things before making this post (I don’t like to post my problems, I’d rather solve them myself, and besides you have a lot of questions, discussions and issues to deal with in these forums already. My
 only intent was to report this posible bug, so that it can be fixed/checked when the next version arrives.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. I checked network settings, adapters and all before posting. I don't have multiple IPs, nor do I run multiple network connections simultaneously. I'm running a simple, desktop home computer with Win XP SP3 with everything running fine
 except for this particular issue on this particular version of Skype. I’ve also tried disabling my antivirus (Avast) with no luck or difference whatsoever. I tried changing the IE settings, returning everything to it's default state, reinstalling different
 versions of IE. IE8 worked for the signing in/login problems, but the calling issue persisted. But I roll back to version 7.35 with the default IE6 installed and it all works out perfectly fine. I double-checked the things you mentioned and I can't see anything
 wrong or malfunctioning/miss-configured, but again I'm not an expert.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’m sorry I can’t do much to help you. I can't even make a screenshot of the problem (how could I? there's not any error messages or freezing or anything), and well, the only thing that would help is the log I took. Maybe we could chat/call
 eachother on Skype? It’d be easier?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I will not be posting a lot around here after today, I think. posting has become more difficult since you moved the Skype forums (especially for blind users, I'm currently posting with Firefox last version, I'm not complaining or anything
 BTW, it</span></p>
<p><span>was a wise decision). I only wanted to report this bug, to make you aware of it existing and manifesting, as do other users on these forums, so now</span></p>
<p><span>you know the bug/problem exists, and manifests only in this version (7.36.0.150) you'll be able to check, revise it and fix it for the next release.</span></p>
<p><span>Again, I thank you a lot for taking the time to answer. I'll be staying with version 7.35 for now, but I wouldn't want it to be forever. So, I really hope</span></p>
<p><span>this issue/bug gets fixed. My only intention was reporting it, make you aware of it so you can check the program and maybe fix it. Again, thanks for your answers, and sorry I can't give you more to work with. The logs would help; maybe
 the forum moderators could add an "attach file" button here for us users to send our logs, like we did on the Skype comunity forums. A lot of application forums like these do that, it'd be a good idea. If you want anything, maybe more insight on the problem,

            Hi, I'm having the same problem with 7.36.0.150 but with Vista, not XP. Did you get any success with solving this problem? I tried the same solution as you, downloading version 7.35.0.103 which works perfectly. However version 7.36.0.150 insists on reloading
 itself, even with Automatic Update turned off. Grrrrr! Regards, Chris<br />

<p>Had exactly the same problem with 7.36.0.150 - couldn't make calls or receive calls to another xp machine with 36...150</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other xp machine could call and I could answer on my android phone or with version 40...103 on a windows 8 machine but that xp machine would lose sound card connection after a few minutes. sometimes skype would reestablish connection to the sound card
 and the speakers would start working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>we both down-leveled to 7.35.0.103 and have been unable to make skype fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>don't forget to turn off automatic updates or you'll be right back where you started.</p>

                    I can't get my computer to stop associating with .sas7bdat files. &nbsp;I want to open them in SAS but my computer automatically assigns them to notepad. &nbsp;I can go to defaults and change what program to associate the files with but I cannot disable the "always
 open this type of file with" box. &nbsp;This means I can change the default but cannot disassociate all programs. &nbsp;I just want to download a file. &nbsp;Not have it open or associate with any program so that I can open it from inside SAS. &nbsp;Please help.

            <p><span>Hi <span>TTU24</span>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community. It seems that you have an issue with opening default files on the computer.
</span><span>This can be really frustrating for you and I appreciate the efforts that you have put in. Let us work together as a team try to get this issue fixed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let us start with a few questions-</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you get any error message or error code?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What exactly happens when you try to uncheck the check box?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on the computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would like more information regarding the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 1–</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1-</span></p>
<p><span>You need to check if this issue persists in Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the article-</span></p>
<p><span>Start your computer in safe mode with networking</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</a></span></p>
<p><span>Note: Make sure you log back into Normal Mode after performing all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Proceed to Step 2, if the issue does not occur in Safe Mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Step 2-</span></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to perform <span>Clean Boot.</span><br />
<br />
Placing the computer in a <span>Clean Boot</span> state helps in identifying if <span>
any third party applications</span> or <span>startup items</span> are causing the issue. You need to perform the steps from the article<span>-</span><br />
<br />
<span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Note</span><span>: You need to follow <span>Step</span> <span>3</span> from the article to get the computer back to
<span>Normal Startup</span> after performing all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 2-</span></p>
<p><span>I would have you run an online virus scan.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link-</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Note: The antivirus will try to repair bad sectors on the hard driver damaged by virus. Any data present on these sectors might be lost in the process.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 3-</span></p>
<p><span>I would have you run an SFC scan to check for integrity violations.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link-</span></p>
<p><span>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 4-</span></p>
<p><span>Try logging into a different user account. Check if the issue persists over there.</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, then refer the articles-</span></p>
<p>Create a user account</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting.
<span>&nbsp;</span>From your issue description, I understand that you want to get the directions for a route and also want to print.
</span><span>If I am wrong, please let me know.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Open the

<h2>            Backing Up My Current Windows 10 system image and data to install on a new hard drive</h2>
                    I am getting a new hard drive on my other laptop. My question is how do I backup the current system image on my current Windows 10 laptop so that I can do a image recovery on my HP laptop, and also I want to exclude the recovery partition from being backed
 up in the system image backup as I just want to recover the windows 10 partition on my other laptop that I am going to be installing the image file on?

            New retail hard drives come with imaging software, and hard drive manufacturers are well experienced in helping users move their stuff from the old to the new hard drive. Fear not. Hard drive manufacturers have copious details about the procedure on their
 websites and their technical staff are good at explaining. Once you've gone through this you may wonder: why bother with Windows System Image?

            <p>That's a different story. If you're moving an image from an Acer laptop to an HP laptop you're going to run into a problem: the Acer image has the Acer's hardware and you want to restore it on HP hardware. Windows may not boot at all, and if it does boot
 you may crash due to the hardware mismatch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To restore an image to different hardware you'll need to buy a third-party image program that can do a hardware-independent restore. This is done by substituting generic drivers which you then update after the restore with the proper drivers. That won't
 be easy because laptops incorporate proprietary hardware for which generic drivers may not work properly (or at all.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>An image is a copy of a partition. You can't restore only a portion of an image, i.e., only Windows.</p>

            Ok ok thank you for letting me know about this. I do have a windows 10 dvd that I created using the media creation tool from Microsoft so I will use that to install Windows 10 on the new hard drive. My HP laptop was activated on the free upgrade to Windows
 10 long before the free upgrade offer ended<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Software Compatibility</h2>
                    <p>I am running MS Works Suite 2006 and Digital Image Suite 2006 on Windows 7 Home Premium (64x). Will this software work on Windows 10? It was not compatible with Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the Windows 8.1 upgrade assistant and checked my PC for compatibility. All my old software was good to go so there must have been some other problem when I first tried to use Windows 8. I plan on upgrading to Windows 10 when it becomes available.</p>

            <p>Hello kevin Kenny bxl, <br />
<br />
You should be able to enable the High Definition Audio Device in device manager. <br />
From the Start Page, type in Device manager. <br />
Click on Settings. <br />
Double click on Device manager. <br />
Scroll to Sound, Video and game controllers. <br />
Find the High Definition Audio Device<br />
Highlight and Right click and it will give options. <br />
It will give an option to Enable. <br />
Click enable and the High Definition Audio Device will now be functioning. <br />
<br />
Let us know if this helped to resolve your issue. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
<br />
<br />
Marilyn </p>

<h2>            Lost all files from going back to Windows 7 from Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>So recently, one of my family members accidently downgraded back to Windows 7 from Windows 10.</p>
<p>When I took a look at the PC, I realized that all the files were gone. Only the default programs were there.</p>
<p>Do I have to upgrade to Windows 10 again to get all my files back? Or is there another solution?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your query to Microsoft forum. I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is&nbsp;unfortunate to&nbsp;hear about the data loss&nbsp;during&nbsp;downgrading process. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check for<strong> Windows.old </strong>folder on the drive where Windows 10 is installed. The Windows.old folder contains a copy of the previous Windows installation, and can be quite large in size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Usually the path is c:\windows.old where is 'c' is the drive on which the previous Windows was installed and you upgraded it to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You&nbsp;may&nbsp;press <strong>Windows + E</strong> on the keyboard and search or the files through the search option in the above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results. Please post back for further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>_______________</p>

Re-build Windows 7
</p><div>
<p>If you are going to do a re-install, you may be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you had or have Windows 10 installed</strong>, you are unlikely to ever get Windows 7 working again satisfactorily unless you do a complete re-install.&nbsp; In this case, a System Repair disk is not going to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you have a corrupted Windows 7 system</strong>, you are trying to recover, you want to try a System Repair disk to boot the PC.&nbsp; It may be more successful in fixing and offer other alternatives.&nbsp; If you do not have one, go to any other PC that
 has windows 7 with the same bitness (32/64).&nbsp; Start globe, All Programs, Maintenance.&nbsp; You need just a blank CD.&nbsp; When you boot, ensure that you are in fact booting on that CD and not the hard drive.&nbsp; Usually pressing F12 will lead you to the option to do
 so.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Factory restore — replaces everything on the hard drive with exactly what it had on it when you bought it.&nbsp; You access this before Windows starts using a special key that can varies by brand.&nbsp; F11 is the most common. This is an option only if the installed
 hard drive is the original.</li><li>“Upgrade” install using the Win7 install disk.&nbsp;(<em>This is not an option when recovering from a Windows 10 installation</em>). You start as if you are re-installing from scratch but when it gets to the point where it offers the Upgrade choice you choose
 that.</li><li>Full Clean install.&nbsp; The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; If you are not using a brand new disk, when it shows the screen to select where you want to put Windows, click on the Advanced link and delete all partitions.&nbsp; Do not install
 any software until after ALL Windows Updates are installed and Device Manager shows all devices installed.</li></ol>
<p>You will need a Win7 install disk for 2 or 3.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code for 3 and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.</p>

            <p>I had window 7 profesional. then I got an upgrade to 10 from microsoft windows. But one day we touch a command on the desktop by mistake when restarting windows. The commands were: start windows 10 or restore windows 7, we touched:" restore 7" by mistake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I lost all programs and wont get any chance to go back to windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I want to know if I can still get back to windows 10 and get back those programs? or Need to re - upgrade windows 10?</p>

<h2>            Wireless works, but wired does not</h2>
                    
<p>My parents got me a 100-foot cat6 ethernet cable for Christmas so i wouldn't have latency issues in shooters/fighting games.</p>
<p>After I checked to see that it worked going from my router to my laptop (though it took a second to be recognized), I did the following:</p>
<p>Hooked it up to my 360, had IP address issues, used a static IP, had DNS issues, used static DNS servers (the same as my computer's and as my xbox's wireless settings), didn't work.&nbsp; Modem connection with automatic settings had IP address issues.</p>
<p>For now I just switched it back to automatic settings and am going wireless.&nbsp; Would like to get wired working soon though.&nbsp; Will hook it up with a different ethernet cable tomorrow to see if it's just the cable?</p>

    <title>No video signal after force restart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> golddragon007  say:</h3>
<h2>            No video signal after force restart</h2>
                    <p>Last night I used my external monitor as usual, then I went to sleep and I put the laptop into sleep mode (as always I do). Today, when I started the computer, I get black screen both on my external and internal monitors, it doesn't responded for anything,
 there wasn't any HDD activity (at least the led indicator said that) So I forced the laptop to turn off (push power button until all lights goes off). Then when I turned on, my PC, my internal monitor worked but my external says "No video signal".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Debugging info:</p>
<p>If I pull out the HDMI cable, the monitor says: "Check the HDMI cable" so it detects, the cable is plugged in, but there's no video signal on it.</p>
<p>If I change the HDMI connection to normal VGA connection, the external monitors starts working.</p>
<p>If I plug into another HDMI device, with another HDMI cable it still says 'No video signal'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fun is, before I started debugging, it wasn't matter I plugged in or not it always said there's a monitor on my PC, but... how?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the question is why stopped working from another day, and what caused this issue?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When 1 and 2 are posted under the Display option, it means that the device is detecting a video input. Concerns related to signal input could be associated with the driver or the hardware component

<ul>
<li><span>Do you see your monitors under Display settings? To check, right-click on the blank area on your desktop and select Display settings.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Well... the story come funny here. Because if the cable is unplugged and I set the projection option to extend or clone, I see here 2 displays, when only the external exist, the monitor is unplugged. If I plug the cable it's the same. I saw
 two screen. And why I click to detect screens, the windows says no new screen detected, and both screens are there in unplugged and with plugged state. (this is strange, I never see this before)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>What projection option did you choose for your monitors? To check, press&nbsp;<span>Windows</span>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<span>P</span>&nbsp;on your keyboard.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>I tried both with extend and with clone mode.</span></p>

<p><span>Monitor: LG DM2350D</span></p>
<p><span>Laptop: ASUS G750JZ</span></p>
<p><span>The mention another HDMI device:</span></p>
<p><span>DENON AVR-X2000</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I want to note, until this time, always when I plugged in an HDMI device, the external monitor went away for a sec or changed the color schema. Not it doesn't do it, like it doesn't detect the plugged device.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>when I turned on, my PC, my internal monitor worked but my external says "No video signal".</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a common problem for users of W10 CU.&nbsp; Try using the "magic bullet"&nbsp; Win+Ctrl+Shift+B.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may hear a sound when it works.&nbsp; You may need to do it more than once.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, even though you see HDMI No Signal on your monitor&nbsp;we can change that by picking
 a different display configuration using Win+P.&nbsp; For example, in my case, after applying the magic bullet I get put back to PC Screen Only and then need to use&nbsp; Win+P, End, Enter to switch to Second Screen Only.&nbsp; An additional problem that I have in this scenario
 is that there is a ridiculously short timed Keep this...? prompt that I need to reply to or it will switch back to the original display configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have enough time to get to that Yes button using my mouse.&nbsp; So, I just press Tab, Enter (appropriately
 timed) as if I had been able to reply to the prompt.&nbsp; (I have no idea where keyboard focus is now; it used to be on the No button so my previous workaround was just CursorLeft, Enter; now fortunately the Tab finds the Yes button from wherever it is.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I imagine that others could have a monitor which would be very slow at rendering from a No Signal state who might have to take the same action.&nbsp; In that case, note that you would still have both the magic bullet and Win+P to play with to try again; however,
 do note that what you would do with Win+P would have to be different than what was already showing.&nbsp; For example, if you were already in the Second Screen Only state using Win+P, End, Enter would not cause a change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Win+Ctrl+Shift+B restarts your graphical driver, but it doesn't matter how much I push, the result is the same.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Another fun fact: as I said previously it doesn't matter if the cable is plugged or not it says always I have two screens... also, if I use WIN + P to set external only, after 10sec (?) it sets back the normal internal
 only state and it says: No attachable external display found... I think this looks like more likely a hardware issue. Also, - I imagine right now - when I plug in the HDMI cable I didn't hear that sound which prompts you plug in something.</span></p>

    <title>Problem with Bluetooth Headsets - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xfedesuper10x  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Bluetooth Headsets</h2>
                    <p>Hi, i'm having issuses in Windows 10 with my new Bluetooth Headphones.</p>
<p>I want to start saying i brought the Sony MDR-XB950B1 and, considering also my PC doesn't have Bluetooth, i brought also an ASUS BT-400 adapter with Broadcom Chipset. I plugged the Bluetooth adapter, and installed it with the drivers directly downloaded
 from the Asus website; than i did the Bluetooth paring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, after the paring i saw that in the output devices the Headphones appears two times: As MDR-XB950B1 Hands Free, and as MDR-XB950B1 Stero, while in the Input devices they just appears like MDR-XB950B1 Hands Free.</p>
<p>The default device for Audio Output is MDR-XB950B1 Stereo, with the MDR-XB950B1 Hands Free as Default Device for Communication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that when i open any app that uses the microphone (like Skype, Discord, TeamSpeak or any game that uses the Microphone also), the audio stops working; the only way to solve is to go to the sound options, in the Output devices, and select the
 MDR-XB950B1 Hands Free as default device. Only in this case i don't have any issues with the output, but the audio quality drops significantly, and it's really bad considering the cost of these Headsets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can i solve this problem?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><br />

            Hi XFedeSuper10X, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />I'll give you two options you can try to fix your Bluetooth audio issue.
<br />
<br />Firstly, I would see if the troubleshooter fixes the issue. Click Start and type "troubleshoot" then select the first result. Scroll down and choose Bluetooth. Run the troubleshooter, and if that doesn't work, try the Playing Audio option.
<br />
<br />You can also try reinstalling your Bluetooth and Audio drivers:
<br />- Press Windows Key+X and choose Device Manager.
<br />- Find your Bluetooth adapter in the list.
<br />- Right-click it and choose Update Driver.
<br />- If that doesn't work, try uninstalling it and then scan for hardware changes to reinstall the driver. You could also do the same steps above for the audio driver.
<br />
<br />Please let me know how you go and I'll provide additional options if you need them! Thanks!       
        </p>

<p>Hi! Thank you for your reply, i just tried both the procedures, but it didn't work, still stopping to work if i use the Stereo one and i open any app that uses the microphone. I also just saw that, if i use the Headsets in Stereo mode, in the Sounds page,
 where i can see al the Output and Input devices, if i switch in the page of the Input devices (where are the microphones options), it stops working also! Then i come back to the Output devices (where i see the two headsets, my TV excetera), and it comes again
 to work.</p>
<p>Any other possibility?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi! Is there a method to see when it has been installed? If i don't remember badly, it has been 2/3 days ago... Windows prompted up a page saying there was an update and that he needed to re-boot the system, i let him done it. But i'm not sure if it was
 about this version or a more general update/different from this.&nbsp;

            Unfortunately no, but since you said it was within the last 2 to 3 days, means you would have ample time to go back to your previous version.
<br />
<br />I would recommend this if your bluetooth was working properly in the previous version.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1809 again. See instructions how to block it:

            I think my computer born with a previous version, and than i just updated it, but surely, when i brought the Headsets, i had the 1809 yet installed. Probably there will be an option to downgrade to the previous version, i can also try it, if you think
 it can help i will.

 and now I have credit cards not to unlimited life funds so you can keep it on, the EQIFAX deal and the bank account issued new cards so why cant I just put up my history' that's the same and pay as before without being forced to change everything due to a
 natural disaster&nbsp; EQIFAX breech that didn't cause my problem,&nbsp; I'm being hijacked by skype to buy a new higher unwanted service???? say it aint so,&nbsp; say it aint so....&nbsp; The answer is to open a real service OVERSkYPE SERVICE,&nbsp; p.s.&nbsp; it can be done,&nbsp; doubt it?????&nbsp;</p>

            In the scan software settings you should be able to adjust down the dpi of the scan, until you get down to an acceptable file size.

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t get in touch with support &#47; get refund for game that isn&#39;t working.</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to get in touch with support for help with a game issue but I keep getting a message to try again later when I try and submit a request to talk to agent in chat or get a call back. This issue has been going on for over 2 years now when
 I use xbox.com support which is why I hate that 1800-4MY-XBOX doesn't work anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried requesting and was denied a refund for Forza Horizon 3 Premium Ed. since it doesn't play at all and when I try to play the game it takes me to the Store and wants me to purchase the game again. I have tried restoring console with and without games,
 deleted my profile and games and reinstalled profile with the game and I am still having the same issue, also tried downloading it on my friends console and it is still having the same issue. Profile is attached to my console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I was denied a refund and the game wont work and I am unable to get in contact with support does anybody have any advice on what I can do to help get the game working ? any help or advice will be greatly appreciated.
</p>

</p><p>I thought that 1800-4MY-XBOX (1800-469-9269) was taken down and that the only way to contact support was through XBOX.com. If it's been brought back up thanks for the information it means a lot and is very helpful.</p>

<p>
</p><p>That is what I thought that it was still down as a direct way to contact support. I am not able to contact support through this way either, when I try here and on XBOX.com I get the same message, that there is a error and to try again later.</p>

<p>Hello Kanna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with trying to get a refund. There is a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/xbox-subscriptions/digital-goods-subscriptions-refund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
website to request a refund</a>. If that doesn't work follow these steps to request a call back, only if unable to request refund on the website.</p>
<p>When you go to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://support.xbox.com/contact-us">
Contact Us</a> to get it to request a callback follow these steps:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1 ----select Xbox One</li><li>Step 2 ----select see more options then subscription changes</li><li>Step 3-----select show contact options<br />
</li><li>Step 4 ----select request a call from support</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Once they call explain the issue and they will be able to help you. Note that these options regularly change so just keep selecting something that gives request a call from support as a contact option.<br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps.<br />

    <title>Question about monetizing&#47;copyright - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coreylitten  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question about monetizing&#47;copyright</h2>
                    After being on support for an hour and getting redirected. A representative basically gave me a link and told me to ask here. I'm trying to monetize a video on YouTube. It's basically gameplay from a video game called "gears of war: ultimate edition."
 I already have a video that's monetized (has over 86k views) and it doesn't deal with gaming. The way the partnership and monetizing works is that if I have one approved I can monetize other videos as well. When it came to my gears videos, it doesn't give
 me the option to monetize them. I was just wondering if Microsoft allows people to monetize a video which contains gameplay from one of their games? I've looked everywhere for this answer. And I hope I came to the right place. The reason I'm also asking this
 is to rule out copyright issues with Microsoft.

<p>Hello DimkaNwebie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you're experiencing an issue concerning&nbsp;an inability to connect within FIFA 19 Ultimate Team on your Xbox One console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you attempt checking your <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/network-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">current network settings</a></strong> to ensure that there is not a restriction based on NAT
 type or other factors:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Test multiplayer connection</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you experience lag, random disconnects, or other game-related network issues, this test helps you identify the issue and works to resolve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Test multiplayer connection</strong> tests anything that might affect your experience while multiplayer gaming on Xbox Live, including IP address, download and upload speeds, packet loss, latency, and MTU (see the Detailed network statistics section
 below for definitions). </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see any error message after you run this test, see the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/multiplayer-connection-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>For more help, see the following pages:</p>

<p>Hey there DimkaNwebie! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for that response! Are you seeing these error messages on the Xbox 360 or on an Xbox One? It sounds like there could be an issue with the network not connecting properly to the servers. Go ahead and click on the following link to troubleshoot this
 problem. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/networking/nat-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">I can't hear my friends online, or I can't join or host a multiplayer game on Xbox Live - Xbox 360</a></li><li><a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/nat-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">I can't hear my friends online, or I can't join a or host a multiplayer game with my Xbox One</a></li></ul>
<p>This will take you through troubleshooting your NAT type and hopefully get you back on&nbsp;Fifa 19 Ultimate Team.

<p>Hey Dimka Nwebie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out. I see you are still unable to connect to FUT even though all other online games modes are working fine. As the connection issue is unique to FUT, we strongly recommend you look into port forwarding.
<a href="https://help.ea.com/help/faq/opening-tcp-or-udp-ports-for-connection-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
EA's Connection Issues</a> page is solely dedicated to providing a breakdown of which ports you will need to open depending on your game and platform. Hope this helps! :D</p>

<h2>            audiosrv causing high cpu ucage Vista HP 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>Hello...The error only occurs only now and then BUT it seems to occur when i plug in my analogue headphones 3.5 mm jack in the front panel of my CM690 tower. I have had a replacement front panel from Cooler Master.</p>
<p>Using Processexplorer/ svchost.exe /&nbsp;&nbsp; Threads:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audiosrv ...(start Address)&nbsp; MMDevAPI.DLL!GetLocalldFromEndpointld+0ox29c</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threads&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Audiosrv.....(start Adress)&nbsp; AudioSrv.dll+0xcaf0</p>
<p>I have noticed that&nbsp;suspending (especially MMDevAPI.DLL!GetLocalldFromEndpointld+0ox29c) results in my CPU usage falling from between 25 to 60 down to 1-5%</p>
<p>Ihave VIA onboard sound VIA high Definition Audio. In an attempt to resolve this I have updated the sound drivers from Via website as apposed to using the Asus M4N72E&nbsp; sound drivers from ASUS.</p>
<p>I am wondering if this could be just a hardware problem ( I have checked connection to mobo and front panel)..I have been able to repeat the high CPU usage using another headset but not with using my sons' headset. I can't remeber this happening with headset
 plugged into the rear port.</p>
<p>I am guessing from what little I have been able to find out, that I plug in the headset and that starts a process where the system continue to search after connected endpoint devices???
</p>
<p>BUT what do I know...Note I am not very computer savy...I saw an article by MagicAndre1981

http://www.msfn.org/board/topic/140263-how-to-get-the-cause-of-high-cpu-usage-by-dpc-interrupt/</a></p>
<p>BUT I am uncertain if I can use this with Vista 64 bit or I need Vista SDK.</p>
<p>Tack..thanks in advance</p>

            <p><span>Hi</span>,</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>You can try performing
</span></span><span><span>a Clean boot and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this
 issue. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may refer the following KB article to put the computer in clean boot:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If your issue is resolved after performing clean Boot, then follow the steps mentioned in the above KB
 article to narrow down the exact source.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also, after resolving the issue, see the section on the clean boot link to how to return your computer
 to a Normal startup mode by following the steps under “Reset the computer to start as usual.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>

    <title>How do I exclude .m4a from Windows Media Player 12 Library&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I exclude .m4a from Windows Media Player 12 Library&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Creative Zen Vision M player that does not play Apple's .m4a files and IPod Nanos that do not play WMA files. On my old Windows XP computer running earlier versions of WMP, it was not a problem because they did not "see" .m4a files and include
 them in my Library. WMP 12 on Windows 7 Pro does. Since I have CD's ripped in both formats, WMP 12 Library lists each ripped song twice, sometimes as separate albums and sometimes mixed together in the same album. If I delete the file form my library (but
 not from my hard drive) the file disappears in my ITunes library as well. When I installed ITunes onto my new PC, it installed itself into "My Music" folder and shows up as a subfolder, in alphabetical order, as if it was a music folder. All my ITunes music
 exist in a subfolder in "ITunes." Can I tell WMP 12 to stop including .m4a files into the Library or do I have to move ITunes out of "My Music" and have to go through the pain of re-associating each song with it's new location (17 gig

<p>To get rid of the M4A files in WMP's library, you will need to reset the library. First note that resetting the library will make you lose all current play counts, and possibly ratings too. Then, follow these steps:</p>
<p>- Reboot the PC.<br />
- Go to Start, type&nbsp; <strong>services.msc</strong> in the Search field, and press Enter. In Services, find the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service</strong> . If its status is&nbsp;<strong>Started</strong> , double-click the service and click&nbsp;
<strong>Stop</strong> .<br />
- Go to Start, type&nbsp; <strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft</strong> in the Search field, and press Enter. This folder will open up in Windows Explorer.<br />
- In this folder, rename the&nbsp; <strong>Media Player</strong> folder to something like&nbsp;<strong>Media Player old</strong> . If you can't see the folder, then it's probably hidden. Set Explorer to show hidden files and folders, and to show protected system files.<br />
- Start WMP, your library will have been reset and will be rebuilt.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You cannot make Windows Media Player exclude .m4a files. You can move your iTunes Media folder to a different location. The default<br />
location is </span><span>\username\My Music\iTunes but it can be moved to a preferred location. When you delete a file from Media Player library, it will<br />
get deleted from the iTunes library as well because the location of the Media folder is same for both the applications. Moving the media folder<br />
will solve the problem. You will not have to re associate the songs with the new location. iTunes will retain all the</span><span>playlists, ratings, and play history<br />
even if you move the media folder to a different hard drive.</span></span></p>
