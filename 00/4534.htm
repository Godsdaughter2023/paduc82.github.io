<h2>            Using same Windows 10 x32 &#47; x64 Activation Key&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Greetings</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like a clarification please, to be sure I'm on the correct path. First a brief history:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a PC that was running Windows 8.1 Pro x64; the main HD began to fail so I took the opportunity to upgrade to Windows 10. Unfortunately, I did a 'clean install' vice an upgrade and loaded Windows 10 Pro 32bit by mistake. Since I did a clean install
 and not an upgrade I ended up having to purchase a new license as the 8.1 install was erased, and Win10 would not activate. My mistake, just moving too fast and not paying attention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main HD still has errors and needs to be reformatted [if not replaced]. I'd like to take the opportunity to do a reformat and install Win10 x64.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, when I sign on with my MSA will the x32bit activation code work for the x64 install. From what I've read it seems the answer is yes, but I want to make sure. I do not want to purchase another copy of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CapWx</p>

            <p>Yes, you can use the same product key to activate either a 32 bit x86 installation or a 64 bit x64 installation of a version of Windows. In fact, at this point if you clean install from the Fall Update version, you can use your Windows 8.1 Pro product key
 to activate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not entirely sure whether the digital entitlement stored with your MSA will work when changing architectures. It should, but if you bought Windows 10 you should have an actual product key to use instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, be sure to use a tool like CrystalDiskInfo to look at the SMART data for the disk before deciding whether to reformat or replace. If SMART is showing a degrading disk, you need to replace it sooner rather than later.</p>

            <p>The computer is already registered for Windows 10 (Home or Pro, whichever you successfully activated). &nbsp;In order to switch to 64bit you would need to use the x64 Media Creation Tool to make a 64bit &nbsp;.iso file. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 &nbsp;(scroll down the page to the 32bit and 64bit links)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make the media. &nbsp;You can use dvd or usb. &nbsp;Insert the x64 media and<strong> restart the computer</strong>. &nbsp;The digital entitledment already registered doesn't care what architecture you install, only that it is Windows 10. &nbsp;It will install the 64bit version
 of the same edition you had before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you see the product key page click SKIP or Continue. &nbsp;Setup will find the digital entitlement and Windows 10 will activate when the computer connects to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: &nbsp;As the result of a Microsoft policy change made yesterday, the current Media Creation Tool is the July 29 release, build 10240. &nbsp;The November Update, build 10586, is no longer available for download. &nbsp;As a result you will be on the
 original release of Windows 10. &nbsp;Windows Update will wait for 30 days before offering you the November Update. &nbsp;It does this to ensure that those upgrading from Window 7 or 8 have the opportunity to decide to go back to their old OS or keep Windows 10. &nbsp;When
 the 30 days are over Windows Update will upgrade you to the November Update.</p>

    <title>A Unified Start Menu with Cortana - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kenfu58  say:</h3>
<h2>            A Unified Start Menu with Cortana</h2>
                    <p>If Cortana want be a part of Windows 10, it should be the heart and soul of machine. Here are some picture to illustrate this idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea is to unify Cortana with Start Menu and notification center.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d27577e-f6d0-4a5a-9a60-73a766a00dcc" /></p>
<p>- Cortana icon at left bottom of the screen, launch it by click it or call her name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Cortana will have a small number badge telling you how many notification you have missed</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Wifi, sound, system settings can be pined and access at the right side of task bar.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c28ff10-ade2-4037-9d73-5617a370c44a" /></p>
<p>- When click on Cortana icon, her icon will vertically flip into your user icon while displaying a chat panel with Cortana and a redesigned Start Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- At launch, Cortana will tell you notification, daily information by the order you choose from the settings. The Start Menu will display the selected categories you have opened last time (in this case is the Modern UI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- In settings, you have the option to mute Cortana when you launch the menu and auto select the chat box to start typing right away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The chat box can also act like a search bar from Windows 7's Start Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The power control is much more closer to the mouse when launching Cortana.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Cortana, notifications, and Start Menu is unified in one window, you can access with just one click.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The Inspiration for this design is drawn from chatting application's UI, in this case your chatting with Cortana.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In Windows 7, Start Menu is usually for launching applications and files from the search box, but if you can also chat with Cortana in the same search box. She can</span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;add
 a new layer of providing information and </span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">by typing or saying instructions to her she can&nbsp;</span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">simplify your workflow strait
 to productivity. It will be better if we group the menu and Cortana together, both serve a&nbsp;perpous of&nbsp;getting things done.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this design can help make Cortana become a fundamental part of the system. What are your thoughts about this idea?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reading. Recommend if you like this.</p>

I like this idea. . . . . . . . would be even more "central to the system" if we didnt have to click on Cortana icon at all.<br />
Either just start typing anywhere or just Hey Cortana. . . and the chat panel / notifications info pops up.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I think the important fact to consider here is the fact that the vast majority of non-enterprise users do just want to consume content (I myself struggle to see how Cortana will fit into an enterprise setting, if at all; however, I love the ideas of having
 an OS that streamlines how I consume content. When not at work, this is what I, and most others, user our OS for). I also agree that no software provider should lock any user into one experience. I believe that with the near ubiquity of Windows, it is important
 for Microsoft to allow users to create an experience that is all their own. We can see hints of this idea in the new customization abilities that Windows 10 is showing already.
<br />
<br />
Context is important, and I believe that Microsoft's biggest challenge is rolling out software that is relevant to as many contexts as possible. They saw the result of locking users into one UI, and I believe they've learned from that. I just hope they can
 deliver to those who do want Cortana to be integrated into the system, but allow users, such as yourself, to omit that integration should they choose. Just as zotack's context is one of 1.5 billion, yours is as well. But each of our contexts can have an OS
 that will merge seamlessly. Nothing should be forced; verily, anything that is forced will not succeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to view SmartArt in a docx file in Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently have an issue with a Document created in Office 2010 and containing a SmartArt object. have upgraded on of my machines to Office 2016 (Build 1805) and the document, even though it's a docx file, always opens in Compatibility mode and the SmartArt
 object does not show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried the following to try and resolve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Converting file</li><li>Saving as and making sure the Maintain compatibility box is unchecked</li><li>Deleting the Normal template</li><li>A completely fresh install of Office2016 on a completely fresh install of Windows</li></ul>
<p>Interestingly, if I export to PDF from the docx in Word 2016 - the SmartArt object still appears in the resulting PDF, so the chart/object is still there - further proved by if I open the doc again on a machine with Office 2010, it also still appears!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be very much appreciated!</p>
<p>Charlie</p>

<p>Hi Charlie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand the situation, I'd like to confirm the following things:</p>
<p>1. Is the issue related to all those old Word documents which have SmartArt object or only one specific document?</p>
<p>2. Open Word&gt;File&gt;Account&gt;capture a screenshot of all info under Product Information (please mask your account info in the screenshot).</p>
<p>3. Capture a screenshot for the document ("SmartArt object does not show"). Capture another screenshot for "the SmartArt object still appears in the resulting PDF".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your reply. Unfortunately, I cannot get my hands on another document with a SmartArt object in at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, please find screesnshots relating to your other points:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/98ac536e-6c94-489e-a82e-e73131b6111c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/98ac536e-6c94-489e-a82e-e73131b6111c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Document in 2016 with SmartArt object missing:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c7be12e-8854-4efd-8d8b-d39e5cda1b58?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c7be12e-8854-4efd-8d8b-d39e5cda1b58?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Image of PDF export of above document:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42c5d7d8-3476-4146-8eb1-2d2809527d9c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42c5d7d8-3476-4146-8eb1-2d2809527d9c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned, simply cannot get the document to open up NOT in Compatibility Mode no matter if I convert or change file type by saving as. And this is what I suspect is causing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>Charlie</p>

<p>Hi Charlie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to recreate this SmartArt object in this document? If yes, you could check if the object will disappear after recreating.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, could you share with us this problematic document in my
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">

</p>

<p>Since the DOCX file was created in Word 2010, opening it in 2016 will always lead to "compatibility mode".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which means that your WordArt, and other freatures, would be limited to what was in 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can get rid of "compatibility mode" by using the "Convert" function to update the underlying file structure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to guess the problem works sometimes, but not this time. Is it possible for you to create a copy of the file and upload it to your onedrive so we can look at it directly.&nbsp; I have both 2010 and 2016.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Looking at the Bluetooth specs of Lumia 950 are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Bluetooth 4.1</li><li>Bluetooth profiles: Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP) 1.2, Audio/Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP) 1.4, Generic Attribute.</li></ul>
<p>It should work perfectly even with the recent update. Check this page on how to<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14170/windows-10-mobile-fix-bluetooth-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Fix Bluetooth problems in Windows 10 Mobile</a>.</p>

<h2>            Cannot use Skype any longer on Macbook Pro on Lion 10.7.5</h2>
                    <p>I am on a macbook pro, the version is 10.7.5 and I cannot update the software so this is the version I'm at.&nbsp; I use skype daily for work and it suddenly stopped working and forced an upgrade but won't upgrade because of the version I'm on.&nbsp; I also cannot
 use the online skype because it insists on installing a plugin that fails for the same reason.&nbsp; Is there a way to use skype on older macs?&nbsp; This is crazy that I cannot do my calls.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

</p><p>To continue using Skype, update your MacBook Pro to at least&nbsp;10.9 or higher.&nbsp;Beginning July 1, 2017, users running older versions of Skype for Windows desktop and Skype for Mac will no longer be able to sign into Skype.</p>

    <title>Recent Windows phone update takes away Xbox Music functionality - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthew-h  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recent Windows phone update takes away Xbox Music functionality</h2>
                    <p>I purchased my wife a Lumia 925 at the beginning of the year which she was happy with. I have an Xbox Music pass which I use on my iPhone and on her Nokia via the Xbox Music app. Her phone had all her playlists and music installed locally on the phone and
 playlists pinned to the start screen. So on Saturday she is prompted to install this Windows Phone update which she does. After the install it has deleted the Xbox music app, all the playlists and the music off the phone. So I take a look and there is no longer
 an Xbox music app on her phone any more or in the store. I opened the Music app on the phone and there is no option for Xbox music or a login option to login to Xbox music with my credentials as there was with the previous Xbox Music App.&nbsp;The pass is attached
 to my MS username but we use this on her phone when we are in the car.</p>
<p>Yesterday I contacted Windows Phone support and after a big on-line chat I am told that I cant use Xbox Music on my wife's phone any more. This update which is supposed to add functionality has actually taken away Xbox music functionality for us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently you can use Xbox Music on 5 devices. So I can have 5 iphones or 5 Android phones all being used by different family members and use the Xbox music pass which has the option to login via my credentials. If I have 5 Windows Phones all being used
 by different family members I can only use it on one Windows Phone. This is absolutely crazy. On top of that no matter what phone I have 5 WPs, 5 iPhones, 5 Androids or a mixture of them then I can use Spotify on all of them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I asked the chat guy if I could get that Xbox Music app back and he said no it was a beta app. I said there must be a way around this and his only response was to buy another music pass. Way to infuriate someone. Delete their, music, playlists etc, take
 away the ability to use Xbox Music and then tell them they should spend another $119 a year for what you already have. I pay for all the bills on these phone, I pay for the xbox music and I bought the phones but I cant play music on the Windows Phone</p>
<p>I made note to the chat that my options really now are to explore non windows phones and or spotify. His response was I can go ahead a cancel your Xbox music subscription now. I would have thought Microsoft would be busting to keep a customer and try to
 fix this with me, not turn me away to the competition.</p>
<p>Ive supported Microsoft over the past year buying an Xbox One, Surface 2, Windows Nokia Phone and a Dell XPS 12 with Windows 8.1 plus Xbox music pass and Xbox Live Gold. I would have thought after spending all this on their products then they'd give me a
 bit more help and assistance. I can see why people get turned off Microsoft.</p>

            <p>The fact that you've purchased other things has no bearing on what support is available.&nbsp; The Pass is built to operate a certain way, the agent can't change that.&nbsp; I've seen that idea before and I always find it puzzling, support agents aren't going to be
 able to re-write the way subscriptions operate just because it doesn't fit the needs of a specific customer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Xbox Music&nbsp;Pass is not a Family Pack and never has been, it's too bad that it doesn't work for you, but it's unreasonable to expect the way it works to be totally re-written just for you.</p>

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Not too sure if you have used the previous Xbox Music app and know its functionality or read my entire post but I don't want anything re-written for me. Up until this update it was working and I just want to be able to do what I was able to do for the last
 8 months.</p>
<p>I dont want to use a family pass or anything like that, I just want to use the pass on one of my 4 allocated devices which up until last week's update I could.</p>
<p>What I find puzzling is how I can do this on the ownership of multiple iphones or androids but not on a Windows Phone. Even spotify will allow me to do this.&nbsp;<br />
When I mention what I've purchased I am doing this just to show that I support MS and don't want to run off to iphones\androids, spotify etc at the drop of a hat. I want to work through this and get it back to the way it was pre the update.</p>

<li>You can only use your Xbox Music Pass on phones that use your Microsoft account.</li></ul>
<p>Unless you don't do the recent update that removes this functionality or if you use non Microsoft phones (which will allow multiple phones)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont understand why Microsoft do this. At work I log onto my work computer using work credentials which I have to. When I start up Xbox music I cant use it there either as the Windows Music app doesn't allow me to login with my account that uses my Xbox
 Music account pass.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not wanting to do anything illegal here, just use my Xbox Music Pass on my devices. All of which I've bought and paid for from my money and which was working ok since last year.</p>

            <p>I'm aware of how it works.&nbsp; The reason it let you do that is the same reason the OneDrive app requires a sign in, apps can't access stored credentials.&nbsp; That's the only way they COULD do the app, that's also why it works that way on Android and iOS, they
 don't have the Microsoft Account stored on the phones to use, so they have to have a login screen.&nbsp; If they had the option of restricting it there as well they likely would.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app was a beta intended for testing until 8.1 was released, 8.1 has been released, they've pulled the app as it's functionality is integrated with the OS now as was the plan, since it's integrated it can pull the credentials from the phone directly.</p>

            <p><span>I know and understand everything you are saying. Problem is the world isn't black and white. Problem is Microsoft give the consumer something, get them to like it and then take it away - case
 in point Windows Start button, all these back flips when they were releasing Xbox One and so on. They dictate and don't think it entirely through what the consumer wants.
</span></p>
<p><span>Wouldn't it be great If everyone just logged into every computer\device with one Microsoft login.? It would be but in the non-black and white, real world this isn't possible. I have to log
 onto my work computer with work domain credentials, so why shouldn't I still be allowed to use my Xbox music pass. I want to use my Xbox music pass while in the car on my wife's phone (which I own and pay for) but cant. Microsoft solution to this - buy three
 music passes. Excellent idea for them.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>If they want to streamline things by default with one account then fine, but give the option to those that don’t want this to do so. If I have to login to another phone or work computer with
 other credentials and use Xbox music then still let me be able to do this. Why can’t they just have the one logon by default which attached to one drive, music etc. If you want to use a different music pass then open the app go to options and untick "use default
 Microsoft account" which then prompts you for other MS credentials in that app? They could do this in a second. These are all my devices so why shouldn't I be able to do this? They haven't thought it through, if I have to log onto&nbsp;a work computer or work Windows
 phone with work credentials then why can’t I use my personal Xbox Music pass?</span></p>
<p><span>When I spoke to a MS tech support guy about a month ago in regards to using Xbox music on a work computer and why I can't do that he said my idea is worthy of discussion and he would suggest
 it. Doubt I’ll ever get a response but he could see reasoning.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft do so many backflips and make changes to their bad ideas when the majority speak out eg Windows 8, Xbox One etc. Problem is that Windows Phone and Xbox Music have such a small following
 in comparison to their competitors in those areas then they don't need to listen. What's Windows phone market share - around 2% and Xbox Music doesn't even make the top 10 of music providers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I'm just annoyed when someone gives you something then takes it away and wants you to pay more for no more benefit than you were receiving from the same product the week before.</span></p>

            You need to insert a new row into the referenced table from which the combo box draws its list.&nbsp; This is done by means of the control's NotInList event procedure.&nbsp; You'll find an example as NotInlist.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file illustrates the use of the NotInlist event procedure in a variety of contexts, both where a value is inserted transparently into the referenced table, and where a form is opened in dialogue mode, passing the new value to it ready for other

            <p>First you have to tell us what is the RowSource type of the combo. The answer is different depending on whether its a Value List or Table/Query. Second, you need to tell us whether you this needs to be done on the fly or just manually.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ken's response refers to a combo that uses a table. You would use a value list only if you have a short, static list of options.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'd go even further than that; the list must be <em>all </em>members of a set immutably fixed in the external world, e.g. days of the week or months of the year.&nbsp; The fact that the OP needs to add a value to the list means this can't be the case, so is data,
 and as such, should only be stored as values in tables, Codd's Rule #1:<br />

<p>Thanks, jramsey, 20v is pretty interesting, that would explain why they can't charge via USB.&nbsp; I will have to check to see if any of my wall warts output that much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>jimmyireland, Nokia does not seem to know much at all regarding these issues, read the thread about finding a correct OTG cable.&nbsp; The "newness" of the device is immaterial, these issues, both the USB connectivity as well as charging, have been well known
 and understood in tablets for years now, just as they are on phones.&nbsp; And if I am correct, Nokia has plently of experience in the phone side of the world.</p>

<p>A link would be nice. I expect it's not going to work. I found numerous chargers with micro USB plugs that list the 2520 as one of the compatible devices.&nbsp;The 2520 does not charge off of USB. As has been mentioned the 2520 charger is 20v, USB is 5 volts.
 Your car incidentally is 12v. Takes a bit of electronics to upvonvert either 5v or 12v to 20v. It can be done, but the market for that is small enough it wouldn't be profitable for a reputable company to do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incidentally the micro-USB 3 socket on the 2520 is not an OTG socket. it is a normal Host USB port with an unusual size. On-The-Go is a feature which allows what is usually a Client port, such as a phone charge/sync port, to also act as a Host, so you can
 attach a client to it, like a USB drive, or keyboard. The port on the 2520 is a host, it does not act as a client. You can grab a USB 3 cable intended for a pocket hard drive and hook the Lumia to a PC. Nothing happens. You are hooking a host to a host. Were
 the Lumia able to act as a client, it should mount as an external device of some sort on the PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge at this point is to find an appropriate adapter cable. The ones with the right ends are typically OTG cables, and they do work fine. You can in fact use any number of USB2 microUSB dongles to hook a USB thumb drive, or a keyboard, or a phone
 to the 2520. You just need a microUSB, 2 or 3, male to USB socket adapter. Typically thos are listed as OTG adapters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back to the auto adpter though. You aren't going to find a generic one of these. It will need to be built specifically for the 2520 and convert 12v to 20v. Or use the inverter and the AC adapter.</p>

<p>The tips on both of those look way too big for the Lumia. You would need to be concernd about the +/- arrangement too. is the center or sleeve + on the connector and the Lumia. Caxial tips are defined by inside and outside diameter, but you don't often find
 those numbers on built units, just if you are buying parts, connectors, sockets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The voltage does seem fine, and the current shouldn't be an issue as long as the charger can deliver more than the Lumia needs. Providing less can lead to overheating the charger, and at the very least slow charging. Can also get into a not-charging, just
 draining slower situation&nbsp;if operating while charging.&nbsp;The iPad was generally noted as not charging from a USB port (500mA), but it actually would overnight if you shut it off while it was charging. &nbsp;Devices overheating is generally the result of a poorly
 regulated charger delivering more voltage than it should, or poorly designed quick charge circuitry in the device. It's not due to more current being available.</p>

<p>Hate to be a killjoy here, but I'd bet against finding an adapter that fits the coaxial plig for the charger and adapts to the Lumia. You'd likeluy have to make one, in which case cutting off the current one and soldering on the right one for Lumia would
 be easier, assuming you have a soldering iron, and a voltmetter to get the polarity right. That's after you acquire the right plug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd suggest an inverter actually. That's a device that turns your car 12v DC into 110 AC. ( I assume 220 ones exist if that's your normal standard.&nbsp; Here's a
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Delectronics&amp;field-keywords=ac%20inverter&amp;sprefix=ac+in%2Celectronics&amp;rh=i%3Aelectronics%2Ck%3Aac%20inverter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
search at Amazon</a>.&nbsp; Mount something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/inverter-adapter-outlets-charging-MRI2011GU/dp/B00EY6RJKA/ref=sr_1_8?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396107725&amp;sr=1-8&amp;keywords=ac+inverter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a> in your car and you should be golden, for about anything. You aren't running your girl friend's hair dryer off it, but you could charge your Lumia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a rough rule of thumb. volts times amps equals watts. ( yes, there are power factors, inductance, yadda yadda, but basically...) So the output for the Lumia charger, 20v * 1.5A is about 30 watts. The input to the charger says 100-240v @ 0.65A&nbsp;, so that
 is 65 to 156 watts. Why the big difference? Well the input is what you need to ensure the source to the charger (the wall outlet) can deliver, so the charger is guaranteed to pull less so you don't run the risk of burning up the source. Typically that is overspec'd
 for safety. (The say they draw more than they expect so if you meet it you are safe)&nbsp;The output of the charger is what it can safely deliver, underspec'd for safety. That is, if you draw every bit of that, you can't hurt it.&nbsp; There are some losses in the conversion
 so what comes out is always less than what goes in. In any case, an inverter that promises 200w is more than enough. I am a little hesitant about the size of the 12v wire on that thing, because to get 200W you'd need to draw 16Amps, and that suggests house
 wiring wire sizes to me, but hey, what do I know, just a BSEE. So, I wouldn't plug three Lumias into it, but one and a Windows Phone or two&nbsp;on the USB, is reasonable. There are lots of options. I would lean towards the ones with one or two AC outlets and a
 metal shell. Better for heat dissapation.</p>

    <title>Challenge Phrase up everytime I take phone out of pocket - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wyowiz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Challenge Phrase up everytime I take phone out of pocket</h2>
                    <p>I always close all windows and touch the power button before putting phone in pocket, but 4 times out of five, the challenge phrase is up when I pull it out.&nbsp; And after I enter the challenge phrase, I have to enter the PIN.&nbsp; While I can imagine the phone
 maybe getting "on" while in the pocket, I can't imagine that the PIN is being entered incorrectly enough times to require the challenge phrase.&nbsp; I've reset the phone several times to no avail.&nbsp; It will allow me to answer calls - that's good - but entering
 that stupid challenge phrase is a pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to change the frequency or modify the settings for it?</p>

            <p>I reset the phone using the phone buttons. &nbsp;I then made sure the OS was updated. &nbsp;Yesterday, it didn't make me do the challenge phrase - it stated that the phone had to be powered off and back up because I had entered a bad PIN too many times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always close all windows and turn the phone "off" - not all the way but use the button to close the screen. &nbsp;The only way the phone is supposed to come back up is by pressing the center button again. &nbsp;I can see that happening - maybe. &nbsp;But the phone worked
 fine for about a year and only recently started all this stuff about challenge phrases. &nbsp;I'm still wearing the same pairs of pants I've been wearing, so nothing should have changed - except the phone software.</p>

            <p>Having the same problem after updating to Windows 10 (and yes, I have reset, restored) on my Lumia 636. I have traced the cause to a notification turning on the screen while in my pocket, and while the screen is on, the phone rubs up against my leg in my
 pants pocket causing the pin pad to come up, random numbers being pressed, and the challenge phrase screen appearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only workaround I have found is to turn off notifications when the screen is locked, but that also disables vibration and sound notifications, so it's not a solution. The only solution may be to make sure that the screen facing is away from your leg
 when putting it your pocket.</p>
<p>

            <p>I didn't have the issue with first few iterations of Windows 10.&nbsp; The most recent is when it started.&nbsp; Possibly they didn't have a challenge phrase lock on older versions.&nbsp; Seems to me older versions notified but didn't activate the screen - just the message
 area.&nbsp; Now they activate the screen so the phone is ready for you to respond - but if you can't respond then the "rubbing" you describe makes sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sounds like a "feature" thats really a "bug" because the developers don't se the phone like "normal" people.</p>

<h2>            Add New Field column in Datasheet View</h2>
                    In Access 2007 there is a new <strong>Add New Field</strong>&nbsp; column in Datasheet view normally. However this doesn't appear on Access tables I have opened from a previous version and saved as 2007 version. how can I get round this?

            Okay, if it works okay in the new database, and you still want to do it, you could open the new database and import everything from the old one. Problem solved.&nbsp; :-)

            <p>I resolved this issue:<br />
<br />
I use Firefox and the problem was an old exception expired certificate that was stored in "the store certificate" so as soon the old certificate was deleted everything was fine. :)<br />
<br />
For Firefox here's how to do it: </p>
:
<ol>
<li>Go to Firefox Menu &gt; Options </li><li>Go to Advanced tab &gt;Certificates &gt; View Certificates </li><li>Go to Authorities tab on the Certificate Manager dialog and look for the Certificate Name
</li><li>Select all the "problematic" certificates (it might have more than one for the same site) and click on Delete or Distrust and confirm. Here is important to make sure no "problematic" certificate is left there.
</li></ol>
<p>Once you followed these steps, close the options dialogs and just access the site and everything should be fine&nbsp; :)</p>

Have you deleted your cookies in your browser ?&nbsp; If you don't try it try it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also if you want to be sure the problem is not on your side try try with a "portable" installation of a browser to log in your account, if you are able it's because the problem is on your side but if you are not able with a portable installation it's because
 the problem is on Microsoft side.</p>
<p>

<h3> tomguruken36  say:</h3>
<h2>            I Forgot Nokia 2320c&#39;s Security Code</h2>
                    
<p>I decided to lend this phone to a friend and they changed the security code without my knowledge. Now when I boot the phone I am prompted to enter in a security code. I don't know this code, and my friend who I lent it to has forgotten the code. I want to
 do a hard reset and get rid of all the information on the phone and return it to its stock form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone has any idea how I can accomplish this without the security code I would be really appreciative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Justin.</p>

<p>Unfortunately it is not possible to remove or reset the code yourself unless you know the original code. It's also not possible to wipe the data without the code.<br />
<br />
To get it removed you will need to visit a nokia care point as they have the tools to do it. They may ask to see proof of ownership before they will perform the procedure and all data will be wiped from the phone. They will also charge for the service so I
 suggest you ask your friend to pay the bill!<br />

<br />
If you have no care points in your country your only hope is to ask for help at a phone repair shop but they may not have the tools to do it.<br />

<p>Sorry..&nbsp;Nokia has provided the ability to Reset, but it requires the code which is currently in use.... If the user forgets the code set by him / her..its not Nokia's fault. ..and if anyone can reset without knowing the once set code then whats the use of
 providing this feature...</p>
