<br />
</span>WOW, THE IRONY EH?</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>This problem is getting worse. It started months ago, when I had the following issue:<br />
<br />
Downloading in general, may it be torrents, http, ftp, anything, causes my internet connection to abort after a variable amount of time, measured in seconds. Ranges from mere seconds to 30 seconds.</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On a previous installation of Windows 7, 64 bit, I diagnosed this problem using the network tab in the taskmanager. At certain points it would spike up all the way to 100%, after which gradually the download speed slowed down as shown in utorrent. This
 is not realistic, as the connection was lost from that point, and downloading isn't possible from then.&nbsp;<br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After about 10 seconds, the connection would restore and I was able to use the internet again, only to find out the same happening when downloading after about 30 seconds, and a little more when just browsing the internet only.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What did I do to resolve the problem, on the previous installation of Windows 7 64 bits?&nbsp;</div>
<div>I downloaded an updated driver from realtek. I rolled back the driver to it's original state, which was the one installed by Windows itself. Then, I restarted. Then, I installed the driver. Then, I restarted.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, what's keeping me from doing that? Nothing. In fact, I tried this about 10 times now. Neither the above method or variations on it work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Rolling back the driver has become an issue too. It rolls back to the latest Realtek driver update, instead of the base driver by Windows.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm out of options.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And before I rage and destroy my network adapter, I'd like a few more shots at trying to fix this thing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions? =[</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
</div>
</strong></span>
<p>Edit: No, I didn't do anything special to the formatting of the above text, Google Chrome is acting up.<br />
The issue isn't malware/virus related, it happens on clean installs with different virus scanners, by previous experience I learned the problem lies within the driver.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>This might be happening due to the proxy servers installed. You may try to uninstall the proxy servers for the browsers and check

    <title>Windows 7 64 bit laptop on wireless network cannot find .inf printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steeljaw65  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 64 bit laptop on wireless network cannot find .inf printer driver for Canon Pixma iP4000 wired to Windows 7 32 bit PC</h2>
                    
<p>First, I have read the thread about the win 7 laptop and win XP PC with IP4000 attached.&nbsp; I just isn't helping me with this.&nbsp; I am computer and network literate, but I must be dumbing down, so please be specific in any answer you may give.&nbsp; Please do not
 assume I know something just because it may be common knowledge.&nbsp; Thank you very much for understanding my situation!</p>
<p>New Win 7 64 bit laptop connected wirelessly in a home network through a Netgear WNDR3700 router.&nbsp; Wired to the router is a PC with a USB attached Canon IP4000 printer.&nbsp; This printer has worked flawlessly with this PC for years.&nbsp; Add the laptop.&nbsp; Attempt
 to access the printer over the network (it is set to share on the PC) results in a failure to find the driver for the printer.&nbsp; At the Canon download site, I have downloaded and installed on both machines the driver add-on "aomwin110ea23us.exe".&nbsp;
 This does nothing to solve the problem.&nbsp; Then, following the suggestions in the above referenced thread, I downloaded 7-zip, installed it, and unpacked the Canon add-on file.&nbsp; Guess what? - There is no, none, nada, stupid ".inf" file in there!&nbsp; I understand
 that I need to set advanced sharing on the PC to both x32 and x64, but without a valid .inf file to point to, I am sunk.&nbsp; And the same thing is true when trying to add the printer to the laptop - no .inf file to point to.&nbsp; The one thing I have not tried is
 installing the printer directly to the laptop via USB, and that is because that is not a useable configuration for me.&nbsp; The printer must be attached to the PC.&nbsp; Is there anyone out there who can help me solve this dilemma?&nbsp; Please do not give me an answer
 that tells me to generally download the driver - you have to tell me specifically what driver, then walk me through the process.&nbsp; Please be assured that I sincerely appreciate any help you all can give me.&nbsp; Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Most likely the driver name you are using on XP to share the printer has not matching 64bit driver name.&nbsp; The driver names need to match in order to add the printer as a connection to the 64bit machine using the normal RPC protocol.&nbsp; You can setup the printer
 on the 64bit Windows 7 as a local printer that will basically copy the printer formatted data to share on the XP machine using SMB protocols.</p>
<p><span>Here's a kb for mismatched drivers when connecting XP to NT4.&nbsp; Substitute your server / client configuration but it's the same process.&nbsp; Make sure you are connected to the internet and select the&nbsp;64bit Canon driver
 available on Windows Update (use the Windows Update button in Add Printer)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/282842" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/282842</span></a></span></p>

<p><span>before ANYTHING else, try this:</span></p>
<p><span>PULL THE POWER ON YOUR MACHINE.</span></p>
<p><span>apparently there is a reset-function and on further investigation this LAST time the ethernet driver knocked out — where didn’t even show in the device manager, so it’s screws-ville.&nbsp; i couldn’t reinstall the driver, because windows didn’t even recognize
 the hardware.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>so&nbsp; just pull the power.&nbsp; pull the power cord out on your computer (i did it while it’s on w/windows up and running).</span></li><li><span>leave router in place, but disconnect the cable and power from the modem.&nbsp; after 5 minutes, reattach.</span></li><li><span>reattach the power cord to computer.</span></li><li><span>start up, and bingo …</span></li></ul>
<p><span>found an article on ubuntu regarding a reset available if you pull the power.&nbsp; plus they say can “hold down” the power button after it’s off, but wasn’t necessary.&nbsp; (some hardware will contain a …. firmware “default-reset”&nbsp; if you hold down the power
 button when powered-off. )</span></p>
<p><em><span>also … is of note that you CAN cause software damage to an operating system by pulling the power.&nbsp; so not something or an answer to apply over and over, and if have continuing problems, is important to contact your computer manufacturer.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>today microsoft did an update on my machine …. and killed the ethernet network driver.</span></p>

<p><span>**************************</span></p>
<p><span>windows update had to be the culprit — it’s the only thing i can think of.&nbsp; did a restore, and it didn’t help.&nbsp; and windows updates are the one thing that don’t come “undone” with a restore (even if they tell you they do).&nbsp; so i had no internet.</span></p>
<p><span>first called the cable company and made a fool out of myself, because while trouble-shooting it with their tech online, found out the internet DID work on my laptop.&nbsp; SO … it’s not the connection or the modem … something specific to the HP machine.</span></p>
<p><span>you don’t want to know all that i tried, but suffice to say spent a good chunk of the afternoon googling and trouble-shooting.&nbsp; the thing that is puzzling is Linux as well as windows no longer had access to the Realtek PCIe GBE family controller.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 since this happened while ethernet cable plugged in, could rule out physical damage to the adapter.</span></p>
<p><span>downloaded the original realtek driver from the HP website …. after going nuts trying to find something to use on the realtek website.&nbsp; holy smokes, for a company that has their hardware in practically every PC … the thing looked like it was designed
 by japanese grade schoolers.&nbsp; add to that a search engine so name-specific that it came back “sorry, we can’t find anything” for every entry i tried.&nbsp; lord help me if ever actually NEED something from realtek that can’t get somewhere else.</span></p>
<p><span>so anyhow, downloaded the driver to my laptop from the HP site, transfer it to a flash stick.&nbsp; then use device manager to completely uninstall the present realtek driver, and that includes checking the box to completely remove the driver.&nbsp; then restart
 windows, get the driver install program off my flash stick and run it.&nbsp; it has you restart the machine when finished.&nbsp; so i restarted.</span></p>
<p><span>shut it down one more time, unplugged all the attachments to the cable modem.&nbsp; (ethernet, cable, power).&nbsp; waited a bit.&nbsp; re-plugged everything in, and then started up the machine.&nbsp; it still had a connection problem, but hallelujah!&nbsp; was at least RECOGNIZING
 the ethernet port.&nbsp; right click the windows internet icon, and start the diagnostic.&nbsp; it needed to assign&nbsp; a new IP.&nbsp; that done, and back in business.</span></p>
<p><span>oh yes, Windows 7 is SO much better than Vista or XP ….. *sarcastic wink inserted here*</span></p>
<p><span>only other thing it might have been, is a problem with the DHCP process …. because today was also the day (24th) that was listed on the network reports as expiration for the IP address from comcast (that’s when they issue a new IP address … done periodically
 for security reasons).&nbsp; it seemed was having trouble before with the wireless connection in getting windows to re-issue a new local IP address when it was needed. &nbsp; SO …. i might get to go through all this fun in another 4 days to a week.</span></p>
<p><span>though if it’s that, we’re talking system recovery time, as in full complete destructive to go back to factory state.&nbsp;&nbsp; eh well …. now that most of the afternoon is shot, i’m going to watch a little TV and pretend it all matters.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">UPDATE:&nbsp; happened again … after THIS months windows update.&nbsp; but hard to point fingers, seeing as how ubuntu updated, too.&nbsp; but something bombed the ethernet driver AGAIN.</span></p>

~~~~sometimes windows won’t allow you to remove a file or folder. that is because of security settings. most of the time, if a file won’t allow you to remove it that means don’t remove it. however, there are some cases where it’s the only way to accomplish
 a goal. in those cases, you will have to </span><a href="http://eebrinker.wordpress.com/2010/10/13/windows-7-vista-gaining-access-to-a-protected-file/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(140, 118, 63, 1)">change the security settings.</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">now ….. you might be asking WHY manually remove the drivers?&nbsp; because fun thing about windows, it will SAY it’s uninstalling them …. and even appear to be taking the time to do so …. and it’s all an act.&nbsp; windows leaves the drivers
 in, and only changes one setting in the registry.&nbsp; it’s one of those “dummy precautions” that screw everybody else.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">so UNLESS you manually take out those BAD drivers …. windows will just reattach the SAME bad drivers.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">also …. if nothing works, you can always resort to a full system recovery or one from a backup system image.&nbsp; i have found that the backup system image DOES maintain and reinstall any drivers.</span></p>

<p><span>either a change in the flash programming from this month’s adobe update, or from the settings by the windows update … there is a connection problem when streaming flash video.&nbsp; keeps cutting out.&nbsp; which means the “limit” on mb/s transfer is being reached.</span></p>
<p><span>for now, i went into the advanced settings on the realtek host controller, and disabled the flow control.</span></p>

<p><span>don’t know as would recommend that, because with no limits, that means any rouge virus or programming can use very LARGE amounts of bandwidth.&nbsp; but the receive and transmit buffers were already at as high as they would go – and short of digging in
 the registry to manually change the number of mb/s allowed to receive, i saw no way around but to disable the flow control.</span></p>
<p><span>just don’t forget you have it disabled – and weigh the benefits vs. risks before doing</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">*********************************************</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Update 12/21/2011</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">windows background transfer service stopped working, which meant no updates were able to process.&nbsp; tried everything, including the instructions from Microsoft to reset the service start-up to automatic (delayed start).&nbsp; and nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 for some reason, the partially installed updates left my machine constantly unable to do a simple system restore.&nbsp; every time the restore finished and went to reboot, it did a failed boot and went right into another restore procedure.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">i booted into the Linux partition, mounted Windows and poked around to see what gives.&nbsp; and somehow the restore i was attempting left the system file for Windows completely empty.&nbsp; so there was no way in heck i was going to get
 this copy of Windows 7 to boot again.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">so using the Linux partition and OS, i saved all my personal files to the back-up drive (external HDD).&nbsp; was going to need to do a full system image recovery.&nbsp; i had one on the back-up drive from July.&nbsp; that’s a “picture” of your
 entire system, often more than a 100 gigs worth —- that Windows can use to fully rewrite the hard drive back to an earlier state.&nbsp; if you haven’t already, it’s important to keep at least one system image on file.&nbsp; this way, you can reset your machine with
 all your extra software intact ………. whereas if do a full system recovery from the D drive, will wipe everything out and have the computer back to its factory state.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp; well, the system image disc (you have to have a CD made to go with the system image— that begins the install process)&nbsp; …. the disc wouldn’t boot right from Bios as it should have.&nbsp; i had to do ANOTHER restore, get Windows 7 limping
 again, have Windows recognize the system image install disc, then restart it to begin the recovery with a system image.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">by that point i was crossing my fingers, and relieved when had my Computer fully back to the functioning state from this last summer.&nbsp; and then upon installing the Windows update, they seemed to all go smoothly with several month’s
 worth all at once.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">have had no further trouble with the Realtek PCI controller …. though i am disturbed that the Bios on the machine does not have the ability to recognize or boot from CD.&nbsp; HP updated (flashed) this Bios remotely without a by-your-leave
 shortly after i bought the computer.&nbsp; even upon using Bios to select the boot device, Windows demented recovery loop continued with no actual boot from the CD. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">which means i still have a vulnerability in the Bios on this machine, caused by a proprietary condition between Windows and the drivers for the DVD.&nbsp; kind of funny that Microsoft worked that proprietary recognition into their software,
 effectively disabling the ability to run a system image restore with their own recovery process.&nbsp; not too bright?&nbsp; you gotta wonder ….</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">so that’s why you keep an EXTERNAL dvd player on hand, just in case.&nbsp; where the drivers go through the USB ports, instead.&nbsp; Windows has so thoroughly messed up the proper function of any and all built-in DVD players ….. though to
 be fair, the actual screw-up involves letting every third-party program out there change the filters and parameters for the drivers. well, it began with that.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">i honestly don’t know how they work —- you have a light that reads a spinning disc and converts that to data streams.&nbsp; i know the discs look very similar to the inside of an eye-ball — the retina has that same “rainbow” patina.&nbsp;
 (we had to dissect sheep’s-eyes in highschool.)&nbsp; other than that, i have no idea on the mechanics of it.&nbsp; just that with as often and as easily as DVD players go south in the PC (AND how often even movie DVD players break), that it’s time you all ditch the
 whole marketing-profit angle keeping consumers inflicted with the things.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">but what did the entertainment industry do?&nbsp; they doubled-down with Blue-Ray players.&nbsp; real smart, there.&nbsp; i have a solution ……… but will save that for another blog.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>am seeing an increase in searches for Realtek PCI controller issues again ……….. and i feel for you, i really do.&nbsp; went back over this blog to see if there was anything i could add.&nbsp; only other advice, might be that to ditch the Realtek board altogether,
 and go with a wireless connection (wifi). &nbsp; the wireless boards are easy to install yourself, and seem to have less trouble with their driver builds.</span></p>

<p><span>PULL THE POWER ON YOUR MACHINE.</span></p>
<p><span>apparently there is a reset-function and on further investigation this LAST time the ethernet driver knocked out — where didn’t even show in the device manager, so it’s screws-ville.&nbsp; i couldn’t reinstall the driver, because windows didn’t even recognize
 the hardware.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>so&nbsp; just pull the power.&nbsp; pull the power cord out on your computer (i did it while it’s on w/windows up and running).</span></li><li><span>leave router in place, but disconnect the cable and power from the modem.&nbsp; after 5 minutes, reattach.</span></li><li><span>reattach the power cord to computer.</span></li><li><span>start up, and bingo …</span></li></ul>
<p><span>found an article on ubuntu regarding a reset available if you pull the power.&nbsp; plus they say can “hold down” the power button after it’s off, but wasn’t necessary.&nbsp; (some hardware will contain a …. firmware “default-reset”&nbsp; if you hold down the power
 button when powered-off. )</span></p>
<p><em><span>also … is of note that you CAN cause software damage to an operating system by pulling the power.&nbsp; so not something or an answer to apply over and over, and if have continuing problems, is important to contact your computer manufacturer.</span></em></p>

~~~~sometimes windows won’t allow you to remove a file or folder. that is because of security settings. most of the time, if a file won’t allow you to remove it that means don’t remove it. however, there are some cases where it’s the only way to accomplish
 a goal. in those cases, you will have to </span><a href="http://eebrinker.wordpress.com/2010/10/13/windows-7-vista-gaining-access-to-a-protected-file/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(140, 118, 63, 1)">change the security settings.</span></a></p>

 in, and only changes one setting in the registry.&nbsp; it’s one of those “dummy precautions” that screw everybody else.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">so UNLESS you manually take out those BAD drivers …. windows will just reattach the SAME bad drivers.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">also …. if nothing works, you can always resort to a full system recovery or one from a backup system image.&nbsp; i have found that the backup system image DOES maintain and reinstall any drivers.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Update 12/21/2011</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">windows background transfer service stopped working, which meant no updates were able to process.&nbsp; tried everything, including the instructions from Microsoft to reset the service start-up to automatic (delayed start).&nbsp; and nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 for some reason, the partially installed updates left my machine constantly unable to do a simple system restore.&nbsp; every time the restore finished and went to reboot, it did a failed boot and went right into another restore procedure.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">i booted into the Linux partition, mounted Windows and poked around to see what gives.&nbsp; and somehow the restore i was attempting left the system file for Windows completely empty.&nbsp; so there was no way in heck i was going to get
 this copy of Windows 7 to boot again.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">so using the Linux partition and OS, i saved all my personal files to the back-up drive (external HDD).&nbsp; was going to need to do a full system image recovery.&nbsp; i had one on the back-up drive from July.&nbsp; that’s a “picture” of your
 entire system, often more than a 100 gigs worth —- that Windows can use to fully rewrite the hard drive back to an earlier state.&nbsp; if you haven’t already, it’s important to keep at least one system image on file.&nbsp; this way, you can reset your machine with
 all your extra software intact ………. whereas if do a full system recovery from the D drive, will wipe everything out and have the computer back to its factory state.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp; well, the system image disc (you have to have a CD made to go with the system image— that begins the install process)&nbsp; …. the disc wouldn’t boot right from Bios as it should have.&nbsp; i had to do ANOTHER restore, get Windows 7 limping
 again, have Windows recognize the system image install disc, then restart it to begin the recovery with a system image.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">by that point i was crossing my fingers, and relieved when had my Computer fully back to the functioning state from this last summer.&nbsp; and then upon installing the Windows update, they seemed to all go smoothly with several month’s
 worth all at once.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">have had no further trouble with the Realtek PCI controller …. though i am disturbed that the Bios on the machine does not have the ability to recognize or boot from CD.&nbsp; HP updated (flashed) this Bios remotely without a by-your-leave
 shortly after i bought the computer.&nbsp; even upon using Bios to select the boot device, Windows demented recovery loop continued with no actual boot from the CD. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">which means i still have a vulnerability in the Bios on this machine, caused by a proprietary condition between Windows and the drivers for the DVD.&nbsp; kind of funny that Microsoft worked that proprietary recognition into their software,
 effectively disabling the ability to run a system image restore with their own recovery process.&nbsp; not too bright?&nbsp; you gotta wonder ….</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">so that’s why you keep an EXTERNAL dvd player on hand, just in case.&nbsp; where the drivers go through the USB ports, instead.&nbsp; Windows has so thoroughly messed up the proper function of any and all built-in DVD players ….. though to
 be fair, the actual screw-up involves letting every third-party program out there change the filters and parameters for the drivers. well, it began with that.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">i honestly don’t know how they work —- you have a light that reads a spinning disc and converts that to data streams.&nbsp; i know the discs look very similar to the inside of an eye-ball — the retina has that same “rainbow” patina.&nbsp;
 (we had to dissect sheep’s-eyes in highschool.)&nbsp; other than that, i have no idea on the mechanics of it.&nbsp; just that with as often and as easily as DVD players go south in the PC (AND how often even movie DVD players break), that it’s time you all ditch the
 whole marketing-profit angle keeping consumers inflicted with the things.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">but what did the entertainment industry do?&nbsp; they doubled-down with Blue-Ray players.&nbsp; real smart, there.&nbsp; i have a solution ……… but will save that for another blog.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>am seeing an increase in searches for Realtek PCI controller issues again ……….. and i feel for you, i really do.&nbsp; went back over this blog to see if there was anything i could add.&nbsp; only other advice, might be that to ditch the Realtek board altogether,
 and go with a wireless connection (wifi). &nbsp; the wireless boards are easy to install yourself, and seem to have less trouble with their driver builds.</span></p>

<p>That is just what I was saying a lot of people have their PC to auto download updates and install I do not. That is reason I know optional do not down but some are not aware that the reason for the post if you read I always check out updates but some do
 not they do not under stand just was hoping this would help&nbsp;them people out. It is kids with pc and old and all they do not understand and I was hoping this post would help someone to always make sure they check I go to&nbsp;OEM also.&nbsp;I did that ten years ago and
 always did our teacher at ITT tell us that I did not download it but this belongs on a lot of sites all not PC smart if it is in Windows they just down

<h2>            Trouble connecting a MacBook to a Windows 7 home wifi network - &#34;no shares available...or access not allowed&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a new Macbook Pro. I have an existing wifi network with several Windows 7 PCs. The Mac has no problems getting on the wifi network. I can connect to the Mac from my Windows 7 PC to read files on the Mac and transfer files from the PC to the
 Mac. But I cannot get the Mac to connect to my Windows 7 PC. I want the Mac to read files on the PC and use the printer that is connected to the PC.</p>
<p>When I try to connect to the PC from the Mac, I get an error message on the Mac saying “there are no shares available or you are not allowed to access them on the server”.

<h3> lintekpc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Buggy Windows 10 Home Network File Explorer</h2>
                    <div>
<p>First my network configuration:<br />
&nbsp;- Windows 10 Home on a Dell Inspiron 13-5368 laptop<br />
&nbsp;- CentOS 6.8 on a Dell Vostro 1000 laptop<br />
&nbsp;- The Vostro is the Samba/Linux server<br />
&nbsp;- The 13-5368 is the Samba/Windows client<br />
&nbsp;- The Vostro is the network's computer browse master<br />
&nbsp;- The Computer Browser service on the 13-5368 is disabled to avoid conflicts</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Working:<br />
&nbsp;- sharing<br />
&nbsp;- printing<br />
&nbsp;- computer names are list in the network file explorers (both PCs)</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Problem scenario:<br />
&nbsp;- shutdown the 13-5368<br />
&nbsp;- the computer's name is removed from the browse list as seen from the Vostro (Samba Server)<br />
&nbsp;- restart the 13-5368<br />
&nbsp;- open the network file explorer on Windows 10<br />
&nbsp;- only the Vostro PC computer name is listed<br />
&nbsp;- enter the Windows 10 \\computer_name, it is found, displayed and the share is accessible<br />
&nbsp;- close the network file explorer on Windows 10<br />
&nbsp;- recheck after an hour, no Windows 10 computer name is displayed<br />
&nbsp;- close the network file explorer on Windows 10<br />
&nbsp;- logout of Windows 10<br />
&nbsp;- sign into Windows 10<br />
&nbsp;- open the network file explorer on Windows 10<br />
&nbsp;*** now all computer names are displayed ***</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Appears to be a buggy Windows 10 Home Network File Explorer. This happens when I used either WSD or NetBIOS<br />
for network discovery. Only the logout/sign-in refreshes the list of computer names. My Windows 7 Pro laptop</p>
<p>in the network does not have the problem after a shutdown and restart.</p>

<h2>            Remove the crazy overlay on the top bar, but HOW&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So there is this new button on top of my windows, on most of them, it is probably useless, says pick up where you left off, It is on top of other interface, making programs unusable! I need to fix this ASAP!!!!</p>
<p>The problem - it overlays on top of tabs of my thinderbird, so as i need to work i really find this offensive, I'm outta my skin I can't work as usual</p>
<p>IT EVEN BRINGS OPTIONS LIKE CLOSE ALL OTHER TABS THAT JUST CLOSES TABS OF THINDERBIRD.</p>
<p>I need to find a way around this useless tab situation today so tomorrow when I go to work people don't get on me to fix this for them when i actually cant!&nbsp;</p>
<p>So please, understand, this crazy stuff is braking my workflow and I never asked for this. There are some crazy lame guides for a "notebook" button that brings a similar option, I DONT HAVE THIS BUTTON, just like the Norway dude that was asked to trouble
 shoot.</p>
<p>I need to get this new top bar (that mostly opens internet browser , which i dont use) removed , permanently, my UI fixed and apps usable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be expecting an answer asap, I cant even work normally NOW. And it just doesn't do anything, just hides half my buttons and that's it, no options to remove it!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The data will be lost when you format the drive, It is not possible to undo quick format., however, you could recover the lost data with the help of a third party software.<br />
<br />
Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party
 Software is at your own risk.<br />

            <p>sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there are all kinds of utilities that can recover formatted files, especially those via a quick format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a quick format doesn't really format the entire drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>instead it works at the master file table level, if i recall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>here is more info on it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.easeus.com/data-recovery/format-recovery-software/free-undo-disk-quick-format.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.easeus.com/data-recovery/format-recovery-software/free-undo-disk-quick-format.htm</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>incidentally, i would only focus of recovering personal files and folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>afterwards, make straight copies or zip them instead of using a backup program.</p>

<h2>            Madden 25 not working&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I was playing Madden earlier today okay. I leave. Take the game out and put it in its case before I leave to go to the store. Come back from the store, pop it in and the game no longer works. Loads up. Gets to the main menu, but when it does the sound stops.
 The EA servers don't recognize my profile, and then when I try to play a game at all the whole thing freezes. Right now I am reinstalling the game to see if it works. Just want to know what the issues could possibly be</p>

<h2>            Cannot delete Skype contacts on Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: how do I delete spurious contact entries which appear to have come from Skype?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a machine crash, I re-downloaded Windows Live mail but found some of my contacts had lost the Address book part of their address.&nbsp;
</p>
<div>These contacts I could not use until I re-entered them. &nbsp;I then found that I was unable to delete the spurious ones. &nbsp;I got over it by over writing them with blank in each case. &nbsp;I still can't delete these 6 items - only option is 'Send to favourite' but
 this still doesn't delete them. &nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for your time. &nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>

            <p>Hi JohnScruby,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can see your level of discomfort of not being able to delete 6 Skype contacts in Windows Live Mail. To isolate the issue, please try deleting these contacts on the People's page by going to
<a href="https://people.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://people.live.com</a>&nbsp;on your web browser.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue perists, please provide us the exact error message received when deleting the email addresses and the screenshot of the scenario being described. This will help us in identifying the possible cause of the issue and in providing you additional
 steps on how to resolve the issue. Instructions on how you can capture and upload the screenshot can be found on the private message tab.</p>

            I have a similar problem. I removed a contact from Skype but cannot remove the linked entry in the People App (running Windows 8.1).<br />
<br />
I also removed the contact from people.live.com, but it still appears in the People App, claiming that it is from Skype (but it isn't, because I removed that).<br />
<br />
The People App aggregates information from various sources. It would make sense to enable it to also manage all of that information from a single place.<br />

            I finally got rid of them with no help from either Skype or Microsoft.<br />
<br />
In Windows Live Mail, rename your email accounts to something very obvious, like KEEP THIS ACCOUNT.<br />
<br />
Then close out Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; Go into where Windows Live Mail is stored on your computer.&nbsp; I believe this is something like&nbsp; C:\your user name\ appdata\local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail<br />
<br />
In there you will probably see multiple folders for your email accounts listed.&nbsp; Delete every single one of them except the one you renamed the obvious thing.&nbsp; Windows Live Mail seems to store backup copies of your settings, emails, contacts, etc.&nbsp; Once you
 delete all but the obvious folder, re-open Windows Live Mail and the Skype contacts will be gone.&nbsp; It worked for me.<br />

<p>well pandagirl you can go into the parental account windows live id and manage child accounts and remove it</p>
<p>however the account will remain a child account</p>
<p>until the age of the gamertag reaches 18 you cannot promote it to an adult account</p>

<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.<br />
<br />
Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.<br />
<br />
Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>

            Hi nuby1,<br />
<br />
<br />
Try the Printer troubleshooter, which will attempt to automatically diagnose and fix your problem. (For more information, see Troubleshooting in Windows‍.)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Open the Printer troubleshooter by clicking the Start button Picture of the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Hardware and Sound, click Use a printer.<br />
<br />
<br />
If that does not work, It's best to let Windows install drivers for your hardware automatically. You should avoid manually updating a driver unless Windows is unable to find a driver for one of your devices but you were able to obtain one some other way, or
 if technical support personnel ask you to install drivers from a disc or from the device manufacturer's website. If you decide to manually update a driver, here's how:<br />
<br />
<strong>Some devices need to be manually installed</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</strong>
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button Picture of the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager.‌ Administrator permission required If you are prompted for an administrator password
 or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. In Device Manager, locate the device you want to update, and then double-click the device name.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Click the Driver tab, and then click Update Driver and follow the instructions.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a>
<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
If updating drivers manually do not help, you may restart the Print Spooler service<br />
</strong><br />
<strong>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</strong>
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open Administrative Tools by clicking the Start button Picture of the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type administrative tools, and then click Administrative Tools.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Double-click Services. Administrator permission required If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Right-click the Print Spooler service, and then click Properties.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. On the General tab, next to Startup type, make sure that Automatic is selected.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. If the service is not already running, under Service status, click Start, and then click OK. Administrator permission required If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
