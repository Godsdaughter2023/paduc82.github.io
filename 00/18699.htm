<h2>            Radio Buttons In MS Word</h2>
                    <p>Good day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question relate to having a Radio Buttons work in MS Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am creating a form in MS Word with several fillable fields. I have already activated the Developer Tab, Some fields are textes, drop downs, check boxes, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one I have having difficulty is the radio button (showing several items but user can only one). Example:</p>
<p>a) Marital Status (Single, Married, Separated, Divorced, Widowed, etc.)</p>
<p>b) Gender (Male, Female)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the purpose of this discussion, let's say I have already selected "Married" in Marital Status. When I go now to Gender and select "Male", the "Married" in Marital Status got UNSELECTED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I define that the Marital Status and Gender are two different fields?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any assistance I can get to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Henry</p>

<h3> bkny917  say:</h3>
<h2>            Merge Skype and Office 365 accounts&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've recently upgraded to Office 365 (trial basis) and I want to use my existing Skype account on it. One of the reasons I finally gave in to 365 was so that I could use the credits for Skype. But it gave me a new Skype account and that's not what I want.
 Is there a way to merge my existing Skype account and the new Office 365 account? Or is it just better to cancel the 365 account? I am not willing to give up my existing Skype account and would rather just cancel Office 365. But the best solution would a merge.&nbsp;</p>

            About  year or so ago they merged skype with microsoft accounts. At the time, you could link a skype account with any outlook.com account. Mnow you can add outlook.com addresses to the account -but you can't use addresses you use on other accounts.

<h2>            Camera on Skype for Mac not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent countless&nbsp;hours trying to fix the issue or to get in touch with Skype customer support center.....Hoping someone can help me to resolve the issue I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My camera on Skype isn't working (using Mac). I tried the built-in camera on Quick time player and it works fine (this means that the camera is fine I suppose).&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go to Skype preferences, audio and video....camera is black screen and it doesn't show anything. In the drop-down manu, there is only option for "Facetime HD camera".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am correct, when I signed into Skype yesterday, there were couple of windows that poped up asking to "allow Skype to use the camera on the computer". I believe I clicked NO, in the rush....and since, I have no camera working for Skype only...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone please guide me what needs to be done to fix this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all in advance</p>

            <p>These are Adware, not viruses. Potentially Unwanted Programs - PUPs.</p>
<p>You threw us with "software publisher" -- I presume you found these listed in&nbsp;Control Panel/&nbsp;Programs and are trying to uninstall them. And you mean that in the Control Panel/Programs list, you see these names in the column for Software Publisher? Am I correct?</p>
<p>This means that the corresponding adware is probably already gone, but the entry in the programs list remains due to a sloppy removal. Are you using a 3rd party scanner or were you prior to upgrading to Windows 10?

                    <p>This is IE - it does this with font-weight:100 in many fonts </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And this is Chrome rendering the same webpage </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happens a lot - also happens in IE 9 - probably 8 as well ... this is using an embedded font called Roboto on google's webfonts - however it also happens with typekit fonts when trying to use the very thin fonts (100 weight)</p>

            What fees are you referring to?&nbsp; If you are referring to My Phone premium services, the fees are incurred on an "as needed" basis, which means, you only purchase the service if and when you need it.&nbsp; When you purchase those services, you are limited to
 a 7 day use of the service (I think that's the time period, but you can <a href="http://sn1-p3.myphone.microsoft.com/mkweb/Help.po?tsid=1274108866891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Outlook 2010 Receiving Error 0x800CC0B - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sorrythecorrectanswerwasjesus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 Receiving Error 0x800CC0B</h2>
                    <p>Our small business uses our ISP as our email provider in stead of an exchange server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm having problems with a users POP3 email not receiving properly in Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last message being received, regardless of the number of messages being received, always hangs and occasionally the message of...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"</p>
<p><strong>Task '</strong>(I'm_Omitting_the_UserName)<strong>@</strong>(&amp;_I'm_Omitting_the_Domain)<strong>.com - Receiving' reported error (0x800CC0B) : 'Unknown Error 0x800CC0B</strong></p>
<p>"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no problem sending emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what I've gathered from reading elsewhere the 0x800CC0B code indicates a busy server.&nbsp; However, no other user on the domain is having the same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've verified the users settings on our ISP's website and I've checked the users incoming and outgoing port and POP3 address settings also, all of which are correct as well and all of which match other users who are not having any receiving problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect the issue is directly related to the users Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions or thoughts on how to fix the receiving issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only things I haven't tried are deleting the users mailbox and resetting it up from scratch, taking a repair option on her Office 2010 installation, and reinstalling Office 2010 in its entirety.&nbsp; As those options are all time consuming and risk creating
 other problems (i.e. installation removal or re-installation errors, lost emails, future and worse Outlook connectivity issues, etc.) I have not tried those options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I so hope Microsoft creates a glitch free version of Outlook one day as I've never had a good experience with any version of Outlook&nbsp;&nbsp; :(</p>

            <p>If you are using pop mail, all data is stored in the pst file, and uninstall/reinstall of Outlook has no impact on that, not that that's likely to do anything that an outlook repair wouldn't do.</p>
<p>You could create a new Outlook Profile, manually, via the mail applet in the control Panel, do not copy the old, add the mail account with its setting, add the original data file, making that the default msg store, set the Profile as default, then re-test</p>

    <title>Excel alphanumeric sorting question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> funkydodel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel alphanumeric sorting question</h2>
                    <p>I've searched around already and couldn't find an answer to this--pardon if it's been asked and answered already!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attached a photo to illustrate the dilemma. So I've sorted the data by call #, title, then serial #, but the volumes aren't sorting properly (i.e, vol. 1, vol. 10, vol. 2, vol. 20, etc.). I think it's because Excel is reading the data as text instead
 of numbers. Short of getting rid of the "vol." before the integers (I have over 9000 rows!!!), is there a way to sort this properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much!</p>

<p>There is no direct formula which can help you to achieve this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there is a workaround by creating 2 helper columns and then sorting the data on the second helper column. Pls follow the steps given below</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step1.&nbsp; Assuming that the "Serial #" is in column-B and assuming that our data starts
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from Row number 2, we shall create our first helper column</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in Column-F. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pls insert the following formula in cell F2</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =MID(B2,FIND(" ",B2)+1,LEN(B2)-FIND(" ",B2))*1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step2.&nbsp; Before dragging the above formula&nbsp;, down below, we need to custom format</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this cell (F2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 00000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (assuming that your numbers are going to be</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from 1 to 99999 max.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (I hope you are aware how to do custom number formatting).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step3.&nbsp; Now drag this formula of cell F2 downward up to the row till where your data</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will extract the numeric part of your content&nbsp; for example&nbsp; 00001&nbsp; or 00525 and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step4. Now in cell H2, we enter the following formula&nbsp;and drag.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =LEFT(B2,5)&amp;TEXT(F2,"00000")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once this is done, you can then select the entire data range and sort your data on this Column-H.&nbsp; You can either "white" paint the text colour of these 2 helper columns&nbsp; OR</p>
<p>Hide these 2 Helper columns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this Helps.</p>

    <title>cropped image data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scipiana  say:</h3>
<h2>            cropped image data</h2>
                    How do I get rid of the cropped out image data in word 2010?<br />
<br />
Things I've already tried: <br />
<br />
1) The compress pictures option but it doesn't seem to work. As soon as I click on the crop button the rest of the image is available again.
<br />
<br />
2) The advanced option settings - 'discard editing data', but that didn't help either.
<br />
<br />
3) The inspect document feature - removing all document properties and personal information which supposedly includes 'picture crop information' but this didn't work either!
<br />
<br />
This is getting very frustrating because my file size is going through the roof.

            <p>I'm not saying that size doesn't matter, it is just not as significant. Except of course when dealing with emails.</p>
<p>In the Compress Pictures dialog there is a delete Cropped areas of Pictures option. I have it checked and yet I too can still see cropped areas even after saving the file.</p>
<p>So if file size is an issue, you will have to consider resizing the images before putting them into the doc. Many image resizing tools can reduce the file size by reducing resolution imperceptibly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just also tried it 2003, it works as expected, the cropped portion is gone after saving the file.</p>
<p>Sounds like a "MS feature" in 2010, as in <em>"... its not a bug, it's a feature..." yabud, it BUGS ME!</em></p>

<p>
</p><p>Every 5 - 10 seconds I get a popup box saying "Mail could not be retrieved at this time" and indicating a bad username or password logon failure. However Outlook *IS* connected and displaying new mail so clearly I am authenticating correctly. But obviously

            <p>We were getting this quite a bit... Outlook starts to download mail then asks for the password (that it already has).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using DirSync (like us) then I think that it's trying to use the domain credentials instead of Office365 credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try quitting Outlook and go into your Keychain. Remove any 'Exchange' entries then open Outlook again and you will be prompted for your password. Try your domain credentials and then the O365 ones if they don't work.&nbsp;</p>

                    In other words, I want to be able to paste text such as 1-1 and prevent Excel from changing it into a date. Changing the cell format into text or else prior to copy/paste (even from copying properly formatted cells) doesn't work. Is there a way to prevent

 in your company. If in US, both of these plans' price is $14.99. See: <a href="https://www.microsofthup.com/hupus/home.aspx?culture=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> ken400  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot delete files even with administrator</h2>
                    <p>Recently I obtained a virus. It came from a fake anti-virus program called "ByteFence". It popped up out of nowhere and said that I had some malware. (I have never seen the program before so I was legitimately confused.)&nbsp; . From what I have researched, I
 know for sure that ByteFence is malicious and that it gave me a virus and I would have to pay to remove it. People recommended to delete every single one of its files. which is what I was doing. I deleted it all, except its program file. It won't let me delete
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It gives me the error of: "File Access Denied, You require permission from Administrators to make changes to this file." I've checked my permissions. I am an admin, It says I that I have full control over that file. But yet, I don't. So that is a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Avast free and I've done a full scan. it didn't find anything. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I not delete it because of this virus? Or is there something I can do to override it and delete it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the virus inside that program file? Or is it now somewhere else?</p>
<p>

    <title>Microsoft phone support is terrible. Who can I talk to in North - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamgault  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft phone support is terrible. Who can I talk to in North America&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've spent more than 8 accumulated hours in phone **** trying to work out activation issues with Microsoft Office 2013 Medialess. Sometimes I wait on hold for an hour and I leave a message when it gives the option and people don't call back, or I get first
 level support and they make so many mistakes they have to transfer me to the second level, and then the line hangs up on me before I get to second level. That's happened twice today alone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First level tech support can only wait on the line for 3 minutes, so after three minutes you're pretty much f#$*(d when the line drops.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; No one at Microsoft calls back. They ask for your phone number and email when giving case numbers, but they never use that phone number when they fail you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worst of all, I'm a partner and after Office 2013, I want nothing to do with Microsoft Office and want nothing more than to invest as much of my personal time to switch every client of ours globally to OpenOffice. I have multiple activation issues with multiple
 clients with this horrible new activation system, but my experience shows I can't pick up the phone and have it resolved. Can anyone confirm that this is correct?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: My <em>Fourth </em>call today, the representative said they'd transfer me to second level support. After 38 minutes I was excited when someone picked up. Unfortunately, this person was also first level. @#(*$*((*#*( I want to break everything around
 me. Basically the first first-level person put me on hold for 38 minutes to talk to another first-level person. Now I'm on hold again...
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit2: When I hit the 1.5 hour mark, I decided to call another Microsoft Partner Support number and spoke with someone in USA who transferred me to somewhere more southern. I relayed my issue and they had to put me on hold to confirm with a colleague...
 "I'm sorry, if you want to use Microsoft Office 2013 32-bit you must purchase volume licensing" Wow.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit3: After 2 hours of hold time I hung up. 10+ hours to solve a simple problem and I can't talk to anyone that can help me. Pre-sales and licensing transfers me to partner support, partner support gives me the wrong information and says to talk to pre-sales
 and licensing. This is brutal. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft is broken. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>William, I know its hard to talk to someone who actually knows more about Office 2013 on the phone. Lets not waste time.. Lets get on&nbsp;and install and activate Office 2013 for you.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;believe that&nbsp;you are in the right place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any error messages while activating Office 2013?</p>
<p>Are you installing on multiple computers at the same time?</p>
<p>Are there any proxy settings or network connections issues in the organization?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let more details about the issue would help the community members to light your way up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Give us these details and more.</p>

<p>Talking about frustration! I have been calling MS tech support for an Office 2013 activation issue. Every time I called, I had to wait a long time to reach 1st line tech support engineer who could not solve my issue. I was told that the case has been escalated
 and that a 2nd line tech support engineer will give me a callback in a 2-hour windows. &nbsp;I had to go home from work early to receive the callback but that 2nd line tech support engineer never call. This has happened 3 times already! Including the time on the
 phone, I have spent more than 10 hours on this issue and all I have now is just a case number.</p>

            <p>Basically there's a <em>huge</em> disconnect at Microsoft between the North American higher ups and how their new system is working, which is basically terrible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The site that receives the redemption product key for our clients often doesn't&nbsp;work, either with an error message or (usually) it just sits there and hangs (tested with two independent ISP's at time of issues), so a customer that purchased a product in
 a store can't redeem their purchased product key for their download. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you call the number listed below for help, you're told by the activation person that the site is fine, they can't help you and you need to talk to technical support to resolve 'your' issue and the hold time will be 5 minutes.
<strong>This results in a one to two hour hold period</strong>. If you opt to leave a message when given the option, they'll call you back one week later or not at all.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you finally get through, an overseas agent will confirm that their lines are so busy and they're overwhelmed by issues with the new system. You'll relay your issue and they'll then try a number of things before they 'activate your product' - whatever
 it is they've done, it doesn't fix anything, you still can't get to the next step to download the product.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you ask for a direct download, like the .img file or 'an ISO', you're told such a thing doesn't exist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you pull some teeth you'll eventually be emailed a link to what they told you doesn't exist and you'll get the holy grail of supporting clients - the installation .img for their product, the disc that should have come with the product that doesn't
 work out of the box. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far we've collected images for most of the products we've had to support so it looks like we're in better shape but Microsoft should really make these images publicly available because their activation system is, as admitted by
<em>many </em>Microsoft representatives, horribly broken. </p>

</p><p>Yeah I've spent the last 2+ weeks with their tech support for DPM, and as is always the case, their outsourced tech support is HORRIBLE, and they are KILLING the company. I actually want nothing to do with MS products any more the support has gotten so bad.
 The only way anything ever gets fixed, is if I'm somehow lucky enough to get transferred to north american support.</p>

            <p>Microsoft is committing fraud and has by far the worst Customer Service departments. The workers at the call center have no problem hanging up on you, there are no checks and balances, they lie and say they don't have supervisors and transfer you to 4 different
 departments, keep you on the phone for hours, all so I can have access to the software I paid for.<br />
</p>
<br />
I paid for 2 office subscriptions from the Microsoft store (Office 2010), both over $100 each. When I first purchased the subscriptions, they said to get a hard copy of the CD I had to pay and extra $10, or I could just use their digital copies at no extra
 cost. I would just have to log into my Microsoft account to access them. Well after 3 years of accessing them online, they are now missing from my account. I call customer service and they are mysteriously missing on their side too. They swear up and down
 I must have used a different account or purchased from a 3rd party. Jokes on them though, lucky for me I know better and I had printed my order number w/ Product key and all and I have it sitting right in front of me, showing that I purchased at the Microsoft
 Store with the only Microsoft Account I have, that they said I "never purchased anything from them". This is all a scam so you buy there new office suite so they can make money. This fraudulent and unacceptable. In the online agreement for the Office suites/subscriptions
 I purchased the software that never expires, and I am granted digital access where I log into my account if I ever need to re-download. Well now my online access to my software is no longer available, and customer service denies ever selling it to me.<br />
<br />
I have printed copies referencing the order numbers and Product Keys for the Microsoft Office software showing I purchased from their site under the account name I gave them.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>normal av charging no issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>where as the charging with usb is taking all the time on the earth to complete. I was playing songs and kep the usb charging it almost took 7 to 8 hours to finish the complete charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is there any technical reason behind this charging time.</p>

            The USB charging has only started coming in these Asha phones since sometime and every phone is experiencing the same effect. The Normal Charging is quite quick than the older phones, but USB charging is like a slow tortoise.<br />
<br />
The good is that it atleast charges, so if you use your phone as a USB modem, you won't be needed to plug in the charger as well.

            I think its the hardware. The software has a little effect over it.<br />
But no problem. You always have the option of using a standard Nokia charges to charge it quicker :)

            Most of the times I spend my time over the system. It would be nice if the USB charging will be done as fast as possible. Hopefully and update can reduce the time taken.

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p><br />
please also keep in mind that USB charging depends a bit on where you want to charge the phone.
<br />
A laptop USB port most likely not provide the same amount of "power" like a dedicated charger or a dedicated USB charging port!<br />
<br />
E.g. You might have experienced that an external HD does not work on a USB port without connecting it to a second one - just to supply more current to the HD.
<br />
Same goes for the phone - it will charge with low power supply but it will take longer time.
<br />
If you use a dedicated charger or dedicated USB charging port with USB cable it will be faster.<br />
<br />
Compare the <a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/products/accessory/dc-18/specifications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia DC-18 </a>universal charger - it has an output current of 600mA - a laptop USB port usually can only supply a few 100mA if it is not designed as a charging port...<br />
<br />

<p>Hello @<strong>MrOxx</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've already tried with a AC - MicroUSB charger, even the one made by Nokia, but there's a big difference when i charge using a MicroUSB cable on the same charger and when I use the nokia small pin cable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there's really some technical issue in the Asha Devices offering both charging options.</p>

<br />
during charging mode, you will see like the sign of signing,,when the ful charge is complete, you will see the "tick" mark sign. it indicates that your battery is fully charged.<br />
<br />
You cannot assign tones to the contacts as of now..<br />
<br />
settings images to contacts:<br />
<br />
just navigate to the contact you want to assign a picture.<br />
Slide in the menu bar from the bottom of the screen and press "edit".<br />
The contact details appear and in the top-left corner are the initials of the contact and a small "+" sign.<br />
Press here (the whole corner is ok, no need to aim for the +) and you can chose a picture from the gallery.

                    <p>I am using Word to update or create technical standards and I am having all sorts of issues with formatting including;</p>
<p>1. When I change the format on a header such as centering text of changing the size of a font, the whole document including the body centers and the font size changes.</p>
<p>2. When I make changes to the formatting within the body to certain highlighted text, all the text is affected.</p>
<p>3. When I try to create a Table of Contents the whole document appears in the TOC.</p>

<p>In Word, formatting is applied by "styles".&nbsp; Even if you don't actively use styles you use the default "normal" style.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a feature in Word that allows you to update the style automatically. But it has the effect you noted.&nbsp; This article should help with the problem</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>@ Making Sure Styles Don’t Update Automatically <br />

</strong>Nancy does a lot of work on templates. She doesn't want the template to "Automatically Update Document Styles." When she unchecks that check box in her templates (including the Normal template) it appears unchecked, but won't stay unchecked—the next
 time she opens the document or the template, it is checked again. Nancy wants users to create a document based on the template, but be able to modify styles without having that "Automatically Update Document Styles" check box enabled.<br />

</span></strong><span>This collection of 4 short articles provides a quick overview into using Styles and Templates in Word 2016 (and earlier). (There are other similar articles for older versions, which are still relevant.)
<br />
The first article reviews the various formatting options in Word. <br />
The second tells and SHOWS you where to find all of these features. <br />

I know talking about styles in Word makes eyes glaze over but they are a really useful part of Word (plus Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook).<br />
In this article we’ll explain the different types of styles including at least one that sneaked in without many people noticing. &nbsp;&nbsp;From just one type in the early days of Word, there’s five different style types in Word 2007, Word 2010 and Word 2013.<br />

Microsoft Word, since 2007, has developed a confusing mish-mash of lists, galleries and dialog boxes to view, select and manage styles.&nbsp; This Office-Watch.com article will try to make sense of it all. It’s a guided tour to the various Style setup, configuration

A style is a collection of formatting choices combined under a single name. Any word or even a single letter has a collection of formatting settings as well. Font: size, color, bold/italic/underline/strikethrough/subscript/superscript, highlighting and more.
 Position: Left, Center, Right, Justified. List: bullet, numbering. Line Spacing, Borders, Background color and a lot more details. Instead of […]<br />

Styles in Microsoft Word would be very cumbersome if you had to set up each one individually. To make it easier, styles have inheritance.<span>&nbsp;
</span>A new style is usually a copy, linked to an existing style with just some changes to selected items. Here’s an example of inheritance in a simple Word document. This is […]<br />

<p>Hi <br />
<br />
<strong>Review Rohn's response. </strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>You are using a<em> heading style</em> for all of your text. This is a big mistake and is why it is all showing up in your TOC.
<br />
<br />
Use a <em>body style</em> like Normal or Body Text for your body. Use Heading styles for things you want in your TOC.
