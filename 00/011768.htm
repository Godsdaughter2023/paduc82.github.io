    <title>Change tab view - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Change tab view</h2>
                    Is there a way to change the way the tabs are viewed? Previously they were up top like browser window tabs and then suddenly on the side. I prefer the up top method which for one reason makes searching more convenient than it is. I'm sure there must be
 some sort of option I'm not seeing to change the way the tabs / sections are displayed.

<p>Outlook Folder pane Problem: </p>
<p>
</p><p>My personal folders keep collapsing under the Sent Items heading as shown below and I am unable to expand it again.

                    Hi Everyone,
<div><br />

<div>I have a report with 4 SubReports, each of the 4 Sub Reports are made a 4 seperate queries that each need the parameter [Enter Festival Year:], now all the subreports and queries run fine&nbsp;individually.</div>

</div>
<div>When I run the Report that has the 4 sub reports I have to enter the festival year 4 times. Since the parameter will be the same for each query or subreport is there a way to enter it one time and pass it to each subreport?</div>

    <title>Excel Video Corruption on EXTERNAL UHD display - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brad thurber  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Video Corruption on EXTERNAL UHD display</h2>
                    <p>I am getting random corruption of the Excel display whenever I use Excel on my external UHD (3840x2160 res) monitor. The corruption is black or grey rectangular boxes...<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a20f09d-b6ff-4a07-aeec-5bbeb1fed578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a20f09d-b6ff-4a07-aeec-5bbeb1fed578" /></a>
</p>
<p>...I use a Lenovo laptop model P50 with a hybrid Intel GPU 530P and Nvidia GPU (quandro k2000k).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried disabling hardware acceleration in Excel</p>
<p>I have tried both Excel 2013 and Excel 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Excel</p>
<p>Excel is fully up-to-date</p>
<p>I have tried different graphics driver versions (both currently as up-to-date as possible).</p>
<p>I've tried forcing the external display to use the NVIDIA card over the Intel card and vice versa with no change</p>
<p>I've tried disabling 3D features in the NVIDIA control panel for Excel. No help.</p>
<p>I have only tried this on Windows 10</p>
<p>I have tried a different Lenovo model W540 with older graphics hardware and the problem is still there.</p>
<p>This problem does NOT occur on my laptop screen (which is also UHD).</p>
<p>I have run OffCAT - and it didn't find anything wrong</p>
<p>
</p><p>A workaround is to resize the window so that it is only taking up half of the screen. When I do that, the random rectangles still show up but then they correct themselves and the display is correct. Of course, I'm only using half the screen which somewhat
 defeats the purpose of the UHD monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A less useful work-around is to scroll the worksheet when it is full screen and the scroll back. Sometimes the corruption will appear in a different place on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that way back in time, someone made a screen buffer in the Excel code that was sufficient to handle the largest screens available at the time but it isn't large enough for some of today's ultra high definition monitors. My guess breaks down a
 bit though because Excel displays fine on my built-in laptop monitor (which again is also UHD).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is 100% reproducible for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm out of ideas to try.</p>

            <p>This is the 3rd time I've seen this problem questioned in the last 2 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In one case the person had an external monitor set to portrait orientation. Switching to Landscape fixed the problem for him</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a similar configuration, new i7 Office 2016 Win 10 with a 4K, 3840x2160, external monitor. I don't run excel full screen and have not been able to recreate your problem. But I have no doubt that it is real.&nbsp; I too had, have a video problems. When
 I first got the computer I had 3 different video related errors plus a video BSOD. These would happen several times a day, every day.&nbsp; When I got it (in March) it was still running the GA release, plus updates.&nbsp; Eventually (3 months later) Windows 10 got around
 to installing the November update on its own.&nbsp; After that the number of video crashes dropped to less than one a day.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As well, I was reading about a complaint about the new Surface Book. It was originally marketed as being able to support 2 external 4K monitors. But several people documented the problem and eventually MS changed their documentation to say that it could
 only handle 1 external monitor. They were having similar video issues. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree, your problem is either with the video driver or with the bandwidth available to drive your monitor.&nbsp; Unfortunately it sounds like you are going to have to wait for MS or the video card maker to provide an updated drive<br />
</p>
<p>You should also cross post to the UserVoice forum. That site is explicitly monitored by MS Staff and project managers for bug reports like this and new feature requests.&nbsp;&nbsp; Create a suggestion there and include a link to this question.&nbsp; Add a reply to this
 question with a link to that suggestion so that other people with this problem can vote for it, to let MS know how much of a problem it is.</p>

<strong><span>"UserVoice.com" - MS Suggestion box sites </span></strong>
</p><div>
<p><span>You can use the Office or Windows 10 "feedback" (**)applets but then your suggestions just fall into a black hole. You get no feedback from MS about your feedback.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A better place to submit this type of feedback the "UserVoice" forum. You can submit suggestions like this to the forum either by "voting" and commenting on a similar existing suggestion or by creating a new suggestion for
 others to vote and comment on.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>It is also a good idea to provide cross posted links.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Put a link back to this answers.com posting on UserVoice, and add a reply here with a link to your specific posting on UserVoice.

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Go to UserVoice, either through specific links I’ve provided below or create your own suggestions there. That is where MS is looking specifically for this type of user feedback to bring them back to reality from what-ever lala-land they are working
 in when they make these "<em>improvements</em>".&nbsp; Comments (and votes) like these in UserVoice helped to convince MS to roll back the "phat QAT" buttons in 2016
</span><span>and to at least partially undo the 2016 changes to the way the Pen input works</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Please do copy the comments you've made here and paste them into comments in UserVoice. If you make a new suggestion, copy the link to your suggestion and post it back on this question so other people with the
 same problem can vote for it and comment on it. (You’ll get faster action that way.) Please get all of your friends and co-workers who use Office to vote for your issue!</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This blog has a picture to show MS really is looking at UserVoice sites:</span></p>

<h3> glennsw507  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t attach a plan created in Planner to TEAMS</h2>
                    <p>TEAMS allows you to add a Planner thread within TEAMS. This is done by creating a new plan through TEAMS, or accessing a plan via "<strong>Use an existing plan from this team"</strong>.</p>
<p>However if a plan has been copied or created within Planner itself and one is trying to add that plan into TEAMS, it can't locate it. It is only able to access plans already created within TEAMS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is limiting as I have created multiple plans within Planner, but cannot add them into any of my channels within TEAMS.</p>

<p>Hi GlennSW507,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in our forum. As far as I know, adding an existing plan to a Team only works if the plan to be added belongs to the current team.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned in the article below, if you want to access the plan created in Planner, you must
<strong>create a new team from an existing O365 Group</strong> in Teams. You can find the plans you created in Planner in the Office 365 group list. After creating the team, you can add the plan to this team.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In versions 15.19 and earlier, pasting an HTML signature including images into the signature window would use linked images. In other words it would paste the HTML img tag in as found, pointing at images on the web server. This meant the email was very lightweight
 and images could be updated on the server and anyone's signature would update (useful for things like instagram's logo update).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In 15.20 the email editor was changed to share code with Word. At this point, pasting in the signature would instead embed a copy of the images into the message. In addition some rather nasty compression was applied to the images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It means when you send an email to certain mobile clients (such as ios mail) and they reply, your signature images come back as lots of nasty attachments rather than just referring to images on the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently on 16.8 (slow) and the issue still occurs. The only way round it was to install 15.19, put on your sig, then run updates to get to the latest version. I believe this is no longer an option as 15.19 won't run on High Sierra.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Peter, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, that's a good explanation, and I see how frustrating that would end up, especially the roughshod compression issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I split this thread off as a discussion. When they shared the code with Word, I can only assume it was thought that this was a better way. It might be on some platforms, but it doesn't sound like the Mac is one. If it was meant as the way to go now, then
 maybe using the <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293343-outlook-for-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
UserVoice&nbsp;suggestion platform </a>would be a way to make it known. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned rolling back to an earlier version and injecting a signature image, and it honors it. Am I reading that correctly?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if it's possible to use an &lt;img&gt; link (or something similar). I haven't played with that yet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the Outlook team uses their in-app support request channel a lot, be sure to report it through that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the explanation. </p>

<p>I can second Pete's issues.&nbsp; It is an issue for any new Outlook installations post 15.19, which is basically our entire organization. I have been following this thread for over a year with no resolution other than to manually install 15.19 on systems and
 then upgrade from there. If using an upgrade path Outlook honors it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, our signature relies (as i suspect Petes as well) on an image hosted on an external, publicly accessible server.&nbsp; With 15.19, each time an email is opened, forwarded or replied to Outlook will go to the URL and pull the image (and set the correct
 height/width) based on the &lt;img&gt; tag used in the signature html. This is important as well for IOS / mobile retina displays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With anything post 15.19 due to the new rendering engine, Outlook will embed the image upon viewing, forwarding or replying. In addition it resize it to 96dpi which makes it appear fuzzy and not sharp, esp. on high dpi screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the present, about 80% of our organization mac users has lost the ability for us to easily upgrade their signature images by updating the hosted graphic since they started on post 15.19 installations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Outlook for Windows, DOES honor &lt;img&gt; tags which is all the more baffling since we were told both use the WORD rendering service.&nbsp; for PC's we install our own certificate in the&nbsp; 'roaming/signatures' folder rather than edit via Outlook's signature
 pane..&nbsp; For Mac's, because it uses it's own format, you HAVE to use the Mac signature pane rather than point to an external HTML file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have users on everything from 15.19 (set to never check for updates) to 15.40.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also looked at this issue for a long time. While MS doesn't appear to have released any updates to fix the problem, neither in Word nor Outlook (even on fast-track updates), there are some solutions out there to help work around the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sigstr, for instance has a downloadable DMG that will manage the Outlook signature on a Mac, which does keep the image from being embedded. You manage the signature in their app and the DMG pulls it into a new signature for the user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that said, I would love to see Microsoft directly address the problem. There are a ton of modern applications for non-embedded images in email these days.</p>

<p>Thanks Sam,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll take a look at Sigstr. We'd love to move to an externally hosted signature company (exclaimer for example) and because we use a hosted 365 through go-daddy for our email, nobody seems to integrate with them. They all require a direct 365 account with
 MS.&nbsp; Maybe Sigstr can.. If not maybe managing their signatures through the app can suffice a bit better than our current situation.&nbsp; I agree, its been well over a year with no official eta, just blanket statements that they are "aware". Most users that have
 followed this thread have given up on an answer I suspect.&nbsp;</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Agreed. This does not appear to have been fixed yet. I suspect most people on this thread have given up expecting a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that it will not load an embedded image makes updating signatures much more difficult.&nbsp; As 3/4 of our company runs Windows which supports loading embedded images changing the hosted image works great, but because Office for Mac caches and then embeds
 these images directly in the email, updating the graphic on the server does not work correctly. In addition, we are still having issues of the embedded images being saved with a different DPI (96) which is frustrating as when viewed on mobile images appear
 fuzzy since they're no longer 'retina'&nbsp;</p>

<br />
Thanks for the updates.<br />
<br />
If you confirmed that you have already set <strong>Arial Regular</strong> for "<strong>Reply or forward</strong>", but it still doesn't work. It is suggest you update the Outlook for mac to the latest version and then restart the Mac machine.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b41c93e-4c69-461e-8d5c-8e4792b75087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b41c93e-4c69-461e-8d5c-8e4792b75087" /></a><br />
<br />
If the issue persists, in order to troubleshoot the issue efficiently, we have a dedicated support channel. Please contact Outlook for mac support on the
<strong>Help</strong> menu in Outlook for Mac client. If you have updated to the latest version, this option should be already available to you. For details, please refer to

            <p>I agree, at least in part, that the previews are frustrating. &nbsp;Its good that they are because more folks are likely to respond with feedback, such as your post and in the Hub. &nbsp;But I don't experience 14393 at the same level of dis-functionality. &nbsp;I certainly
 don't want to characterize it the way I used to characterize release builds of Vista or Windows 8.0. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe what is underway is a substantial re-do of some of the core in order to implement the Creator's Update. &nbsp;At least some of the features that are promised for the CU must require deeper changes (vertically) than just linking (horizontally) the new features
 to 14393. &nbsp;We are probably in for more frequent bug-swat weeks than we have been having up to now.</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Agreed, I don't mind the previews @ all since I have very little added aside from a few MS apps like Translater&nbsp;</span>and Paint3D preview. Most of the builds have run quite well but 14965 is rough, and
 only 3rd build since a clean install. But when 14393.447 loaded on my other laptop it didn't take long to realize that build should have never been released and that laptop actually gets used for real life. Install went well, seemed ok, yet soon experienced
 system freeze, unresponsive input-keyboard &amp; T/P, and several other issues. I did send in several feedbacks with screenshots and record's, and ran across a interesting find with IE &amp; EDGE when Edge locked and IE followed suit when launched. Went to speedof.me
 for a straight HTML5 speed test with Edge and found 1st run normal, 2nd run dropped 10Mbps and 3rd run another 8Mbps and started to freeze. Same with IE. Unconvinced I called the Cable co to run a line test and found normal. Shutdown 14393 laptop and fired
 up 14965 to test. Same results, oh and sent screenshot of all 3 test results graph to Feedback from 14393 and again from 14965 laptop. Since on the preview laptop, I resigned to installing Chrome (never been a fan of), and, Mbps never budged from expected
 line speed. Checked several times even with ublock extension and still normal. I'm also not experiencing any lag in this forum like we do in the reply box, or page loading, freezes,yada yada..... let's see what the MS dev's come up with, since it affects both
 MS browsers.. Hoping 14393 gets another CU soon so I can flash the flight controller on a drone quad x I just built :).&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I also like updates, but have found little changes between them. Must say, apart from install problems with a couple of builds, never had any crashes with any of the installed apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are installed on old and new laptops and PC's. The only gripe is the synaptics touchpad on one laptop, where the new driver is worse than the older one. However, this has been reported several times.</p>
<p>

<p>Hey John Boy - if you are not aware, go to the Store and look for the app called Buildfeed.&nbsp; It is free app.&nbsp; Install and run.&nbsp; The latest build being worked on is 14972, called Canary build.</p>

            A new canary (build) is just a build. &nbsp;About every fifth one flights to Fast Ring insiders. &nbsp;Most never leave the nest. &nbsp;It appears that when it is about time for Fast Ring insiders to get a new build, the latest canary that has been tested and found to
 be reasonably usable is the next one to flight. &nbsp;It looks to me like Slow Ring flights are builds about two weeks old that are especially stable. &nbsp;

<h2>            Can no longer toggle Outlook 2016 Mac Calendar categories off with one click</h2>
                    <p>Using the latest build of Mac Outlook 16.17</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting sometime in the last week or two I can no longer toggle the categories in the calendar by clicking on the check box next to "Calendar". Before when I uncheck it, all the categories below would uncheck. Then I could check one individual category
 to see only those meetings on the calendar that were in that category. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can uncheck the individual category names one at a time (which then unchecks the "Calendar" parent), and then check the "Calendar" to recheck all the ones below it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've deleted and re-added the account and it makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a pain because now if I want to see only meetings in one category, I have to manually turn off about 20 other categories to leave the one, versus just unchecking "Calendar" to turn them all off and then just checking the one I want on.</p>

<p>Hi SwoledGuy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just tested on Outlook for Mac 16.17 (180909) and it worked well for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It initiated with all categories checked and when I unchecked the box next to the parent calendar those categories turned unchecked.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8fcab8dd-3293-4003-858c-667cb38c6d64?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8fcab8dd-3293-4003-858c-667cb38c6d64?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bcc8ac50-c808-401c-b4a6-9d9231998e65?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bcc8ac50-c808-401c-b4a6-9d9231998e65?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try following approach to handle the problem:</p>
<p>1. Quit Outlook for Mac.</p>
<p>2. Locate the following files:"~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Outlook/Data/Library/Preferences”</p>
<p>3. Move these. plist files to Trash, but do not empty Trash and delete the files.</p>
<p>4. Re-open Outlook, check whether the issue is resolved. If yes, you can delete the files mentioned above in Trash. Otherwise, please put the deleted files back to the old location.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If above method doesn’t help, it’s recommended to contact our Outlook for Mac in-app support where our specialized engineers will provide your with dedicated assistance. You can find it at
<strong>Help</strong> &gt; <strong>Contact support</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your understanding is much appreciated.</p>

<h2>            All PDF downloads in IE11 are blocked saying the file has a virus.</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently tried downloading pdf files using IE 11 as my browser (Windows 8.1 Pro, x64). It seems that any pdf from any site is coming is being blocked saying the files contains a virus and has been deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Few things to note:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have tried downloading the same files with Firefox and the files have downloaded with no issue.</li><li>I have scanned the files and they DO NOT contain virus.</li><li>I have tried multiple website with multiple PDF files and all have the same issue.</li><li>I have tried on my colleagues PC and they are having the same issue.</li><li>I have run autoruns on my pc and no image hijacks.</li><li>An example of a PDF I have tried is: <a href="http://investor.apple.com/common/download/download.cfm?companyid=AAPL&amp;fileid=789040&amp;filekey=ED3853DA-2E3F-448D-ADB4-34816C375F5D&amp;filename=2014_Form_10_K_As_Filed.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PDF on Apple's website</a></li></ul>
<p>I suspect this is an IE patch gone wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all your help. After a little debugging I found it was an issue with FEP client 4.7 and not a virus&nbsp;as this is why the restore helped. Looks like MS pulled the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found others had also had the same problem:</p>

<h2>            What does grooveex.dll do exactly&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have strong evidence supporting that Office16/root/grooveex.dll is related to Adobe CreativeCloud Applications repeatedly crashing when trying to open the windows file picker. It is loaded by teh Adobe application via KERNELBASE.dll. When I rename grooveex.dll,
 the problem disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already found out that grooveex.dll is apparently related to former "Groove Virtual Offices" that has been bought by Microsoft and integrated into Onedrive for Business / Sharepoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd now like to know the consequences of renaming grooveex.dll, such that it cannot be loaded anymore by Adobe applications and causing them to crash. Will OneDrive for Business / Sharepoint integration still work as expected? What is grooveex.dll for in
 general? (please, no file.net links and such).</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>The grooveex.dll is an application extension for OneDrive for Business (Groove.exe).

<p><span>The new OneDrive sync client (OneDrive.exe) doesn’t use this file. As you mentioned that the issue is caused by the grooveex.dll, for this situation, we suggest you

<h2>            Emails to Craiglist postings not being sent</h2>
                    This is a different question than other people on here saying they cannot *receive* emails.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My problem is that I have set up my business domain with Outlook.com. Everything has been working great.......except for when I send an email to a Craigslist posting.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I found out that people were not receiving my emails that I was sending to Craigslist posts. So as a test, I sent an email to one of my own Craigslist postings. One with my Outlook account and one with my Gmail account. Guess what happened? ONLY my email
 that was sent via Gmail made it through. I never even got the email from my Outlook account, not even into the Spam folder.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone help me track down why that would be the case? Thanks!</div>
<div><br />

<p>Hi Bolaji,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this up. Let's try to perform a soft reset on your Lumia 650. This method will not remove anything at all from your phone and is completely safe to attempt in any situation. You perform the soft reset by having your phone turned on.

<p>Thank you for updating us. We certainly understand how important this issue needs to be rectified.&nbsp;Resetting your Windows phone will return it to the same state it was in the first time you turned it on. All of your personal content will be erased, and the
 phone will be restored to its factory settings. If you have set up the automatic back up on your device, it will automatically back up your stuff once a day when you're connected to Wi-Fi. With that, you will be able to restore the data on your phone. If the
 automatic backup is disabled, you can try to transfer your files to a computer or laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reset an unresponsive Windows phone, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the <strong>Volume down</strong> and <strong>Power </strong>buttons at the same time until you feel a vibration (about 10 to 15 seconds).
</li><li>When you feel the vibration, release the buttons. Then, immediately press and hold the
<strong>Volume down</strong> button until you see a large exclamation mark. </li><li>Once the exclamation mark appears, press the following four buttons in this order:
<strong>Volume up</strong>, <strong>Volume down</strong>, <strong>Power</strong>,
<strong>Volume down</strong>. Your phone should now reset and restart itself. (It might take a while for the reset to finish.)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any further clarifications, please let us know and we're always here to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Auto maintenance - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spyer231  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto maintenance</h2>
                    How do I disable the feature of auto maintenance waking my computer every time at midnight? I enabled it, thinking it would wake, and then go back to sleep by itself. It doesn't go back top sleep due to it being on high performance plan. So I then realized
 that, and disable the feature to wake my computer for auto wake up maintenance from sleep. So I unchecked the box, then restarted. But I sleep my computer 24/7, and at midnight, it still wakes up to perform auto maintenance even though I unchecked the box
 in maintenance settings. Any help?! Thanks guys.

<h3> needmyipadworking  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook&#47;Hotmail problems with iPad - please escalate urgently</h2>
                    Until a few days ago the email function on my iPad was working fine then out of the blue, the Inbox emptied. I can see all my emails if I go to www.hotmail.com so I know they're there.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For the last three days I have deleted the hotmail account on my iPad as suggested on the forum posts and have recreated it again. I now have emails from last Friday through to today however all previous emails are still missing. My sub folders are still
 empty. I desperately need the mail to be working - arranging treatment overseas for someone with limited options and not much time - using hotmail through the website is painfully slow, sometimes doesn't send at all and won't allow me to attach documents.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't have a home computer and do everything on the iPad. Urgent help needed please. I notice other posts have been given the option to send a private message with their email address so the matter can be escalated.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            Hi, GauravShastri_29. <br />
<br />
Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
You may try to perform a phone soft reset on your Lumia 950 XL . This method will not remove anything at all from your phone, and it is completely safe to attempt in any situation.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To perform a soft reset follow these steps: <br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Make sure your phone is turned on. <br />
2. Press and hold the volume down Image and Power Image buttons until your phone vibrates and restarts.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> You should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears).
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Keep us posted for further assistance. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Regards.

    <title>Opening&#47;Attaching to a PST file in Outlook for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nymaestro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Opening&#47;Attaching to a PST file in Outlook for Mac</h2>
                    On a PC, I am able to keep my mailbox small by moving older messages to a separate PST file which is still accessible in Outlook as a folder. &nbsp;It seems that Office for the Mac cannot open a PST file for use---it can only import it. &nbsp;Am I missing something?
 &nbsp;This is a HUGE oversight if that functionality is missing. &nbsp;Please let me know ASAP. &nbsp;Thanks.

            You're not missing anything. You are correct that Outlook for Mac
    can only import PST files.<br />
    <br />
    FYI, PST files are a feature of Outlook for Windows only. No other
    email application (Mac or Windows) supports using PST files.<br />
    <br />
    Please be sure to let Microsoft know you'd like to see this feature
    in future versions by using the <b>Help</b> --&gt; <i>Send
      Feedback</i> mechanism in any Office application.<br />
    <br />
    Hope this helps!<br />

            Sorry, but importing from a PST file is all you can do with Outlook Mac. If this is a feature that you consider useful, be sure to let Microsoft know by sending them feedback (via the Send Feedback command in Outlook’s Help menu)<br />
<br />
The more reports they get the higher it gets on the list to be fixed.<br />
