            <p><span>Hi Nicholas,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that you are unable to view videos in Video app in Windows 8 computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please answer the questions below, before we proceed with the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the type of video file that you are trying to play?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the screen resolution that you have set in the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What are the apps that you are trying with?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I suggest you to follow the methods given below and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Download and run apps troubleshooter.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: <span>&nbsp;</span>Adjust </span></b><b><span>screen resolution to 1366 x 768</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow these steps and try changing the resolution and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow these steps, check if you can change the size of the Screen Resolution.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a) Press <b>Windows Key +R</b>, type <b>Control Panel</b>, hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click on <b>Appearance and Personalization</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Under <b>Display</b>, click on <b>Adjust Screen Resolution</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Change the resolution to <b>1366 x 768</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 3: Perform clean boot and check if the issue persists.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

    <title>windows 7 64-bit install shows scrambled screen after &#34;completing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom tickler  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 7 64-bit install shows scrambled screen after &#34;completing installation&#34; phase</h2>
                    I am in the process of installing Windows 7 64-bit on a new computer (no previous operating system installed).&nbsp; The installation seems to proceed well until the system reboots, the windows screen (blue) appears, shows status of "completing installation"
 at bottom of paraggraph, and next jusp is to a small "scrambled" display on the screen slowly going up, then down on the monitor.&nbsp; The system stays here and will not complete installation.<br />
<br />
System is:<br />
<br />
AMD Phenom II 955 Quad-core processor (3.2 GHz)<br />
4 GB G.Skill DDR3 1600 PC3-12800 memory<br />
ASUS M4A79XTD EVO motherboard (updated to the latest bios)<br />
ZOTAC GeForce 9800 GTX AMP Edition Graphics card (512 MB)<br />
Western Digital 500 GB Caviar Blue harddrive (SATA)<br />
Lite-On DVD burner<br />
<br />
I have tried swapping memory to 2 GB of OCZ 1300 memory - no difference<br />
Ihave tried swapping to ATI Vision Tek graphics card - no change<br />
<br />
Each attempt to install Windows 7 64-Bit results in same scrambled screen at the same point of installation.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?&nbsp; I've been working on this for two days now and am not able to resolve...

<p>First try running Memtest86+, this runs from a boot disk or CD and should eliminate or
<br />
confirm if your ram is configured properly in the BIOS and is listed in the MOBO's Memory QVL.
<br />
Let it run for as long as you can, 2,4,6,8 or more hours, if no errors by then your ram is OK.</p>
<p>If you have a copy of Windows XP around try installing it and then use the following tools (this assumes the memtest shows no failures)<br />
<br />
Prime 95<br />

It's a stand alone .exe file contained in a .zip archive.<br />
Just choose to run the "stress test" option for 3 hours or more.<br />
If your PC can pass this test both your memory and CPU<br />
are fine (close the case cover to maintain proper ventilation)</p>
<p>Core Temp: Monitor the temperature of each core of your processor. For non overclockers using the stock Intel/AMD heatsink and cooling fan you can expect a temperature of 35 to 40C at idle and up 60C to 65C when running Prime95.<br />
<a href="http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.alcpu.com/CoreTemp/</a></p>
<p>CPU-ID (CPUZ): Shows the clock speed of the CPU under various load conditions (if you are using Intel's EIST speed step technology). Also has two tabs (Memory and SPD) which show the actual memory speed and 'SPD' tab shows the rated speeds for each memory
 slot that is populated.<br />
<a href="http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cpuid.com/cpuz.php</a></p>

    <title>New Skype - No Thank You - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hairy goose  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Skype - No Thank You</h2>
                    <p>Wow - its been a few weeks now since I suffered the shock of the new version of Skype on Android, now I have also to suffer it on iPhone. &nbsp;I have read hundreds of 1 star reviews across google play &amp; App Store and even more damning reviews on microsoft communities.
 &nbsp;I also see a few replies from the 'Skype Team' on communities and they all have two things in common.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. They are all as weak and woolly as the latest update - scripted and lacking sincerity. I am sure no-one is really paying any attention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. They all focus on just one point - viewing which contacts are on line - yes this is annoying but you have many other issues to address too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be a real shame if the Skype team failed to react accordingly to save what was a working, suitable and in a lot of cases a 'lifeline' product of communication that was easy to use across several generations and platforms. &nbsp;I work away from home
 and use skype to talk to my girlfriend, my children, grandchildren and my parents too - the beauty of the old V7 was all of these generations could figure out how to work it - it was just very simple and intuitive - all that has gone now, for some new updated
 modern version that it seems the vast amount of existing users didn't need or want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a 13 year Skype user and now find myself looking for other options and that is sad. &nbsp;Skype always did exactly what I, and I suspect millions of other users, needed. &nbsp;It worked well, with only the occasional glitch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the Skype team know that the modern user will complain but never vote with their feet and close their accounts to move somewhere else. &nbsp;That is exactly why they will get away with this shambolic update and lame gestures to keep people on Skype while
 they pretend to listen and pretend to offer fixes. &nbsp;Know your demographic Skype. &nbsp;I bet the average Skype user is over 30 and not interested in all this tosh you have now added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you need to fix from my perspective -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Keep Skype contacts individual, dont share my other contacts in this platform. &nbsp;Also, when I dial a number in the new skype, there is no way of then saving that number to my skype contacts</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;File share option is missing to share in Skype - Oh Dear, how did you miss this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Yes, I like to see my contacts status, it makes a difference as to whether I call them or IM them</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. &nbsp;Get rid of all this colour and style nonsense - its way too intrusive, having to swipe up to go through the options is mandatory to be able to get rid of them to continue using the product</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would be a good start for me, but you, as developers, probably know better about your customer needs than your customers do right? &nbsp;Thats why we have this latest useless release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please understand how powerful your tool was. &nbsp;I switched to android recently from iphone. &nbsp;when the auto update came down to the android and it was so bad, I switched back to my iphone as my default. &nbsp;When the iPhone updated (my mistake I might add) I looked
 at which phone I could roll back - The android won - and now I choose which phone to take out with me based purely on which version of YOUR app is installed - think about that for a moment Skype Team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will look elsewhere if you dont fix it quickly - the fastest way to do that is to give us the old version back. &nbsp;Food for thought though - your last version was so good for me, I would happily pay an annual subscription to retain it.</p>
<p>

<span>Hello hairy goose</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Skype Community Forum!</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>First, I acknowledged to have read your feedback and the inconvenience that you have experience with the new Skype. I can assure you that this is noted and it is continuously
 being collated along with other feedback of regular or non-regular users of Skype. I understand that there are changes in Skype that did not fit your needs however with Skype, we regularly release update so that we can fix bugs, introduce new features and
 improve the existing one. That is why we always recommend that every Skype user is using the latest version.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>These changes is for Microsoft-Skype not to lose track of our main goal or disrupt anyone from doing their daily things through Skype, but to provide communication more affordable
 for every one and for Skype users to stay connected with their loved ones. </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>So once again, thank you for bringing this up to our attention.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Hope this information helps but feel free to reply back for further questions or clarifications.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Regards,</span></p>
        </p>

<p>But Again Exodus B - a moderator misses the point, addressing absolutely none of my concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its not about always having the latest version to hand. &nbsp;I regularly do keep my software up to date regardless of platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you did with V8 was a quantum shift in the way the product operated, and lets be honest - you got it wrong. &nbsp;You got it so wrong that millions of people across the world will now, just as I have, disable their auto update function which is a complete
 contradiction of your statement above. &nbsp;You want people to run the latest versions but when you offer them something that is such a magnificent step backwards, well, you only have yourselves to blame for the outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it hard to believe your main goal is not to disrupt anyone form doing their daily things &nbsp;through Skype - or is that sentence on your list of official responses that Microsoft ask you to use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it has much more of a roll on effect see. &nbsp;As a Mac user since 2010 I was getting frustrated with Apple's attitude to customer service when it comes to software updates - even laughing at them as they removed the ability to leave feedback in their app
 store on products - a move they did purely because of the amount of negative reviews being left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As my Mac clunks on, I was having serious considerations to move back to a windows system when the Mac finally gives up. &nbsp;Yes, you guessed it, after my Skype experience, I am now holding back on making that return to a windows laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily for me, I am now at home in the UK for a month so using a normal phone connection is not restrictive. &nbsp;Next month I return to Asia for 3 months and will again be relying hard on Skype to keep me in touch with friends and family - that is when I will
 feel the pain of your latest update and most likely vote with my feet and move off. &nbsp;No more hotmail, no more skype, no more xbox and certainly not changing back to a windows laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you strive to link everything together - you also stand to lose more if you get it wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please, stop spinning lines like a well rehearsed politician, tell us what you're going to fix and when - we can then decide if we want to wait for it to come.</p>

<p>I'd like to chime in and say that, this response, is as useless as a chocolate teapot. There hasn't been a useful 'bug-fix' in years. New features have been either rubbish or have left a sour taste behind. I now only keep Skype on one device to limit the
 aggravation factor. And if things continue this way I'll find an alternative. I already have one primed. And if I move away, all my contacts will too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All it takes is one person giving up on the loyalty they've shown Skype and deciding they've had enough of it being so one-sided and organising all those in their contacts group for it to spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you do the math?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say I have 9 contacts on Skype, and we all migrate to a different platform. And all their contacts migrate too. Let's say the average number is 8.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you keeping up so far?</p>
<p>
</p><p>8 9's are 72 plus me it's 73. But start adding the next layer of contacts (using the same average, for simplicity) and the number grows exponentially to 576.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another layer? 4'609.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it starting to frighten you yet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another layer? (5 if your still counting) 36'865.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about a sixth? 294'913.</p>
<p>A seventh? 2'359'297.</p>
<p>Eighth?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All it takes is one to give up and you lose the messaging app of a generation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Think on that before you start cramming the rubbish you've been sending our way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I have three Skype accounts the oldest of which dates from September 2003.)</p>

<p>I am also NOT liking the new skype!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ESPECIALLY the inability to save a phone # when I dial from my iphone. Now all I see in my call history are phone #'s and I have no idea who they are. I thought I must not know how to save a phone # on the new skype until I started reading the forums here
 and realize there is no way to create a contact in the new skype. Does that mean I somehow have to import the over 2000 contacts in my phone to use skype? Seriously? Really really really bad....... I pay a subscription fee specifically so I can call North
 America from overseas and I am not happy at ALL with these changes.....I hope Skype fixes these pressing problems. soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The colours and especially the swiping from the home page are useless, annoying, and also confusing. Clean functionality will be much appreciated moving forward.&nbsp;</p>

            It is awful... So much problems and no answers... Since one month, Skype is useless for my coworkers and I (with devices OK, updated, etc). We are very disapointed. The biggest problem is the loss of alerts/notifications for calls and messages.<br />

<p>Thanks for your well thought out and well written post. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure anyone who is reading it is going to make any changes at Skype.....they may be deluding themselves by thinking "it'll just take a little time for people to get used to the changes then everything will be better."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While they're in denial, I've moved to Google Hangouts....I have a prepaid balance at Skype....I'll forfeit it rather than fight with them over idiotic changes.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Chinese characters suddenly did not show up on screen in Windows 7 Ultimate x64</h2>
                    
<p>I used "Quick" Chinese input method in Windows 7 Ultimate x64 RTM to input Traditional Chinese characters to Notepad or other applications. However, I found that after typing the Chinese characters for some time, suddenly the Chinese characters will *NO*
 longer display on screen but instead showing the English letters on screen. But the "Quick" input method is still in effect in the Language bar.</p>
<p>I need to close that application and restart it in order to resume typing the Traditional Chinese characters. But after some time, this problem will happen again, and I found that it is very annoying to close and restart the application repeatedly.</p>
<p>Could Microsoft investigate this and provide a hotfix to solve the problem ?</p>

            I finally found out the reason of Chinese text did not show up in Windows 7. The "Quick"Chinese input method in the language bar can be toggled to input Chinese or English with the press of the LEFT-SHIFT key. If there is an "A" next to the "Quick" Chinese
 keyword in the language bar, it means only English text can be inputted, to change the input to Chinese text, just press LEFT-SHIFT key once and the "A" icon will turn to a "Chinese" keyword written in Chinese character.

 and Adult content. Instead of entering individual websites on the Allow or Block lists, parents can rely on categories to control what children can see. If the parent chooses a web filtering setting that blocks a website category, the child won't have access
 to sites in that category. </span></span><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">Websites are categorized initially by computer analysis and then the results are verified by human reviewers. If a website is popular and its content is stable, its address will
 be stored on the computer in a content rating list. If a website isn't popular enough to have an entry in this list, or the content on the website changes frequently, Family Safety checks with a content rating service to determine the category of the site.
</span></span></span></p>

    <title>Skype for Business Dial-in Conf. Number - Strange Formatting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype for Business Dial-in Conf. Number - Strange Formatting</h2>
                    <p>Having issues similar to here: </p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_sfb-mso_mac-mso_o365b/skype-for-business-dial-in-conf-number-not-added/62722536-7bcc-4c3d-ac28-21597a478e95?auth=1</p>
<p>
</p><p>But updates to the latest version aren't fixing it. I'm running Outlook for Mac version 15.36.1, Skype for Business for Mac version 16.9.37.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm running into is when Outlook users on Mac include Dial-in Conference numbers, they get formatted very strangely. See below:&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6328f597-257e-420b-82e0-41cb0961fdee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6328f597-257e-420b-82e0-41cb0961fdee" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice how Join by Phone is formatted "+1(-80)1-6-42-1008"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scheduling an online meeting through the Web App does not show this behavior, nor on any Windows Machines. See below:&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c20b2b89-3e5c-4ef5-a52e-f71214bb5d19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c20b2b89-3e5c-4ef5-a52e-f71214bb5d19" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried deleting the dial in access numbers on the server side, and putting them back in. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>~Brayden</p>

<p>Hi Brayden,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>To troubleshoot this issue, I suggest you follow the steps below:<br />
1.&nbsp;To isolate issues with your Mac, please Start up your Mac in safe mode.<br />
2.&nbsp;Change another Mac to see if same issue happens.<br />
3.&nbsp;Does the issue happen in the before version Outlook?<br />
4.&nbsp;Do others in your organization also encounter this issue?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Thanks,<br />
Amanda</div>

<p>
</p><p>1. Verified the issue is still happening in safe mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. This issue happens on several MacBooks across the company.</p>
<p>3. I'm assuming this happens in different versions of Outlook, as it happens on multiple machines that I don't believe are automatically updated.</p>
<p>4. I have verified the issue on my test Mac Mini, and two other MacBooks in the company.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>For Original Xbox games to be playable on an Xbox 360, it needs to be an official Microsoft Hard Drive.</p>
<p>However, there is no official 120GB hard drive for the Slim, only 250GB and 320GB.</p>
<p>There is a 120GB for the original-style Xbox 360 and the later Elite, but not Slim.</p>
<p>If you are using a Slim, the hard drive itself will be the problem and you will need an official one.</p>

 adjusting the sound settings/recording/enable stereo mix/stereo mix properties/listen etc.</p>

<h2>            Escalation&#47;advocacy department please respond&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>SR#<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>, it's been over 2 weeks now. &nbsp;I've had issues since my first preordered one console. &nbsp;Can you please explain your process so all of us just waiting for an answer know what's going on? &nbsp;Why would you send me a console with
 an error code for a advanced exchange? That's 3 now that don't work! &nbsp; I think for us loyal Xbox customers that have supported your brand over these years deserve atleast to be treated better than this. &nbsp;Why don't you guys give us your smart phones for 2 weeks
 and let us know how you feel when you don't know when we are going to give it back and not sure if it will even work when you get it! &nbsp;Might be a bad example but I hope it illustrates some of my frustration. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The whole escalation process is incredibly frustrating, it can take weeks to get a response from the advocacy team. I had an issue with my original console, processed an advanced exchange and was sent a console with a loose front plate and the console couldn't
 stay powered on. Sent it back and eventually processed a new advanced exchange, I was then sent a used Xbox that had a faulty fan. Sent that one back and replaced my original with my retailer.
</p>
<p>I would stay clear of the advanced exchanges from my own experience and unfortunately, all you can do is wait for the advocacy team, an email or phone call will come... eventually. I received an email 3 weeks after confirmed delivery of my 2nd advanced exchange
 back to Xbox from an advocacy team member who didn't even have the tracking number and assumed I hadn't sent it back. The customer service is appalling.</p>

<p>Yes it is- it also doesn't help that you never talk to the same person and sometimes can be given completely different information. &nbsp; I was told I was getting a new replacement and like I said got a used one that already had an error code. &nbsp;Microsoft where
 is your quality control department, customer relations department? &nbsp; Do you not see what's going on or are you just ignoring us? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Generally, a warranty is your promise, as a manufacturer or seller, to stand behind your product. It is a statement about the integrity of your product and about your commitment to correct problems when your product fails.</p>
<p>Doing some research on what the law requires for a warranty-stay tuned</p>

<p>The implied warranty of merchantability is a merchant's basic promise that the goods sold will do what they are supposed to do and that there is nothing significantly wrong with them. In other words, it is an implied promise that the goods are fit to be
 sold. The law says that merchants make this promise automatically every time they sell a product they are in business to sell. For example, if you, as an appliance retailer, sell an oven, you are promising that the oven is in proper condition for sale because
 it will do what ovens are supposed to do—bake food at controlled temperatures selected by the buyer. If the oven does not heat, or if it heats without proper temperature control, then the oven is not fit for sale as an oven, and your implied warranty of merchantability
 would be breached. In such a case, the law requires you to provide a remedy so that the buyer gets a working oven.</p>

<p>thats wonderful to hear. &nbsp;I have been sent to them because I purchased and got billed for an extended service plan, but MS has no record what so ever that I did. &nbsp;It was on my account, its on my credit card, I got a reciept email, but now its gone 100% missing.
 They told me I would hear from them in 3-4 business days......</p>

<p>Yea pretty sure they told me 24-48hrs when I talked to the 1st guy. &nbsp;Then it was 5-7 business days, then 4 business days from the 2nd time I had called, to "they are pretty busy and lets give them 7 more business days and if they don't answer I will do another

<p>well at least in my case its not about not being able to use the console, its just the service plan, which if they don't fix I will just dispute the charge with my credit card company, that MS failed to deliver the product, i.e. attaching it to my account.
 I have all the proof I need for MS to do the right thing, question is will they.</p>

                    <p><i>Anytime upgrade with MSDNAA Key</i></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am currently running a geniune copy of (OEM) Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>As with many OEM installations, it includes programs which normally cost money but are free with the OEM installation.</p>
<p>I have also installed other products, some Microsoft ones (including Office) as well as 3rd party applications which need to be activated. Some of these can only be activated once.</p>
<p>I also have all my files on here and all my settings. It would probably take at least 10 hours of my time to backup and reinstall Windows + all my apps. Let alone the activation and other issues above.</p>
<p>I have an account with MSDNAA and have recently aquired a product key to the *FULL* version of Windows 7 Professional.</p>
<p>I tried upgrading to from Home Premium =&gt; Professional using AnyTime Upgrade accepted the key as valid and then&nbsp;it failed with the message: "The upgrade key&nbsp;you entered is for an edition of Windows that does not work with Windows Anytime Upgrade. Enter a
 different upgrade key."</p>
<p>Surely this is possible as a full license is more expensive than an Upgrade key and I end up with the same result (Windows 7 Professional).</p>
<p>I rang the helpline and they were of no help whatsoever.</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            RGB cable, I have not heard of that term in a long time, the only RGB in recent history is shiny and comes in pretty colors.

            Hi Frank,
<br />
<br />Does the cable you are referring to have a blue plug on both ends?
<br />
<br />If you connect up with that cable, then press Windows key + P the projection panel will open, choose Extend or Duplicate. 
<br />
<br />Do you then get an image on the TV?

            <p>Hello&nbsp;xW4RH0UNDx,</p><p><br /></p><p>Once your pending Credit amount reaches 5000 or more, you are automatically scheduled for a deposit. You can use the deposit dates listed on your MyStatement on the MyRewards page to see when you received a deposit from our program. You can then double check these deposit as actual currency from your commerce page at (<a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://commerce.microsoft.com/</a>), where they will be listed as a refund with a negative amount. We see that the amount you refer to is likely your Rewards deposits. Since these deposits are of a promotional currency, they will expire one year after being deposited. At the current time, there is no plans to end the Xbox&nbsp;Live Rewards program.</p>

<h2>            Remote Assistance &#34;Not Configured to Send Invations&#34;... and windows does not know how to repair it</h2>
                    My elderly grandfather (who lives hundreds of miles away) is having computer issues, and I'm working on trying to fix it.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, his new laptop (which runs Windows 7) is having trouble handling Remote Assistance. &nbsp;When he clicks on "Invite Someone...", he gets a message saying that remote assistance "is not configured to send invitations", and an option to 'repair'. &nbsp;However,
 the automatic repair feature does not know how to fix it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Unfortunately, I can't get any more specific information without knowing very well what to look for - my grandfather is a poor intermediary!<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!<br />

            <p>Windows Movie Maker advertises and technically supports many video formats; but what's not fully disclosed is that users are responsible for making sure the proper codecs are loaded for it to work correctly. If an users doesn't understand what a 'codec'
 is, that could be a serious problem. Windows Movie Maker doesn't advise the user of this loophole and makes no efforts to resolve it. Users are expected to resolve the codec issues themselves and to go so far as to purchase the proper codecs [again with no
 help from Microsoft].<br />

<p>The installation of the K-Lite Codec pack isn't complicated, but the installation package does have some
<em>optional software</em> bundled with it. I have a step-by-step process/article&nbsp;illustrated with the link below, with screenshots, that also show you
<strong>how to avoid the opt out software</strong>.</p>

</p><p>If you haven't tried already, (as a test) try converting the video to WMV before using it in Windows Movie Maker.<br />
WMV is Microsoft's video format, Windows Movie Maker should handle the WMV just fine. Finding a proper codec is optimal because you don't have to do any conversion before using video clips in Windows Movie Maker; saving time— but converting video before using
 it in Windows Movie Maker usually is a logical and stable option.<br />
</p>
<p>Freemake Video Converter is one of the most recommended video converters for assisting users converting their SOURCE videos to WMV. Freemake Video Converter is extremely easy to use, but there's some
<strong>'opt-out'</strong> <strong>software bundled</strong> with the installer that makes user nervous. I've created a post to illustrate the process of the download of the application, the installation
<strong>step-by-step</strong>, explaining which options are <strong>optional</strong>. I have also provided some screenshots on just how easy it is to convert your video(s) to WMV.</p>

            <p>Thank You for your reply. I tried you suggestions but I'm still stuck at a login screen. I know this is a problem that need a format and reinstall of the software but that will remove all the files and programs because the finger print scanner was not working
 due to an install of Windows 10. If there is any other help you can give me my wife would be very thankful.</p>
