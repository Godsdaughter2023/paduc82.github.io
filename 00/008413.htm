    <title>How can I change my hotmail user name to existing outlook account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vivecalane  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I change my hotmail user name to existing outlook account&#63;</h2>
                    I opened a new outlook account and went to change my hotmail username, but since I had already opened the outlook account it said that name was unavailable. So I closed the new outlook account, but found out that it is held for me (in case I want to reactivate)
 for 270 days! I could set a reminder to rename my hotmail in 270 days, but I'm hoping there's an easier way. For now I have reactivated my new outlook account and have the two accounts linked, but that's not the long-term solution I'm looking for. Any help
 would be much appreciated.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you’ve created a new <span>Outlook.com</span> account, there's no way to rename your
<span>Hotmail</span> account with that name. If you delete the new account, it will take
<strong>365</strong> calendar days for that account name to become available again, and at that point, anyone would be able to get that name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, you can automatically forward your <span>Hotmail</span> messages to your new
<span>Outlook.com</span> account. You’ll have all of your email in one place, and can reply to it using your new address. To auto-forward your mail:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Sign in to your <span>Hotmail</span> account.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <span><strong>Options</strong></span>, and then click <span><strong>More options</strong></span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Under <span><strong>Managing your account</strong></span>, click <span><strong>Email forwarding</strong></span>. You might have to sign in again.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select <span><strong>Forward your mail to another email account</strong></span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter the email address for your new <span>Outlook.com</span> account.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you want, select the <span><strong>Keep a copy of forwarded messages in your
<span>Hotmail</span> inbox</strong></span> check box.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <span><strong>Save</strong></span>.</p>
</li></ol>

<p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Lumia 950xl battery availability - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pasq05  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950xl battery availability</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to purchase a replacement battery for my Lumia 950xl and I have contacted Microsoft Store who guided me to B2X and both of which told me to look on the internet at retailers and Amazon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly I am amazed that you cannot purchase a battery from Microsoft whom have been excellent in supporting my Surface products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly after trying many sites I only managed to find one on Amazon asking for £90 for the battery!! Which I find excessive considering retailers were selling the battery for around £27.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will this battery BV-T4D become available again? If so where will I be able to purchase it, and what date approximately would it become available?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My phone is now lasting less than 3 hours and is still under warranty except the battery which is covered for 6 months, I use the phone for work but at the moment this is not possible due to the battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought my wife the same phone at a later date and definitely require to replace my phones battery and my wife's at a later date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been holding out for the possibility of a Surface phone or a new phone from Microsoft as I find the Windows experience very good but it seems I am being slowly forced out of this loyalty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any advise to resolving this battery issue.</p>
<p>

            It sounds like the Help you're looking at is the Help that pertains to Fills for Shapes &amp; other objects. Those Fill Effects features do not apply to formatting of Cells.<br />
<br />
Cells can be filled only with solid colors but the range of shades is virtually unlimited. (The exception is that certain Conditional Formatting features do apply gradient effects.)<br />

            I almost never use parameter prompt queries. They are too limiting. Use a form instead. Have controls to select the company number or name and a button to run the query. Run a different query depending on what control is filled in.

            Using simple parameter prompts:<br />
<br />
SELECT *<br />
FROM [YourTable]<br />
WHERE ([Company Name] = [Enter company name or leave blank:]<br />
AND [Enter company number or leave blank:] IS NULL)<br />
OR ([Company Number] = [Enter company number or leave blank:]<br />
AND [Enter company name or leave blank:] IS NULL);<br />
<br />
But, as the others have pointed out, it would be far better to reference unbound controls in a dialogue form as the parameters.&nbsp; You would then be able to validate that only one parameter value has been entered, which you cannot do with simple parameter prompts.<br />
<br />
You might like to take a look at DatabaseBasics.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file, if you go to the section on <em>Retrieving data from the database</em>, the right part of the form illustrates the use of two unbound controls as optional parameters.&nbsp; The query in my case is a little different from the above as values
 can be entered in one or both controls to restrict the results further, rather than in one or the other of the controls as in your case.<br />

This little demo file is primarily intended to illustrate how to output a report (the invoice) as a PDF file, but includes the facility to send the report as an attachment to an email.&nbsp; In my case the email address is taken from the current record in the form,
 but the body text is largely hard-coded in the event procedure.&nbsp; It would be a simple task to use data from the form's current record in the body text, however.&nbsp; The code is:<br />
<br />
Private Sub cmdEmail_Click()<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strTo As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strSubject As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strMessageText As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.Dirty = False<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strTo = Me.Email<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSubject = "Invoice Number " &amp; Me.InvoiceNumber<br />

</p><p>The SendObject command &nbsp;is a simplified way of sending an e-mail. If you don't want an attachment, the use acNoObject (I think that's the constant) for Object type&nbsp;</p>

<h3> thomas m smith  say:</h3>
<h2>            I gave up.</h2>
                    <p>I've been running Windows 10 TP since the first initial build was released and I've always updated it on the fast track. Honestly, bar a few workarounds, it ran perfectly. I used it as my host OS on my Lenovo Y580 laptop because I'm almost never without
 a desktop to fall back on in worst case scenario. Most of the updates, the worst it did was knock out my VirtualBox's host only network adapter (I ran 4.3.12 because the newer versions are said to have hardened their security and therefore didn't work). The
 start menu was a decent compromise between windows 7 and 8. I was very happy with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then Build 9926 happened. And besides the many many unimprovements to the UI, I encountered a nagging issue with a black screen and cursor on boot. No login, no windows explorer. It seems to have been a result of the VirtualBox installation. Before the
 restart, VirtualBox was working. I could boot into my VMs just fine. Only once I coincidentally restarted, did my machine fail to boot. So I system restored, it rebooted fine. Installed Virtualbox, black screen. I refreshed, booted normal, then installed virtualbox
 and was rewarded with a black screen for my efforts. I wiped clean and installed off of the ISO and it booted fine. Take a wild guess what happened when I installed virtualbox. I'm at a loss of words. Anyway, I'm just documenting my efforts. I always knew
 there was a chance my OS could blow up and I am fine with that. I'm sad my run with Windows 10 TP ended there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I did take a chance to look at the new changes, and you know what? Screw you Microsoft. Microsoft is taking a dump on technical minded consumer like me. The new Windows Update is a joke. No control, no selection. The settings app looks like the Material
 Design JUNK that is getting shoved down our throats despite looking like someone designed it 20 years ago. The general theme of OSes since 8? We can't overwhelm the simpleton with anything that LOOKS remotely technical. Thats why Microsoft is slowly killing
 off the Control Panel in favor of this settings app designed around hiding options and layering them behind a bunch of UI. Thats why any operation, any installation is lacking the usual information that is provided. No progress bar, no download meter, no description
 of what actions the machine is performing. Apparently TEXT BOXES look too technical. Twice during installation of the clean copy of 9926, they asked for me to put in information and all I had was a cursor floating in white space because there was NO TEXT BOX
 OUTLINE. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop pandering to Mac users. We chose Windows not because we wanted Macs but couldn't afford them... no we wanted Windows because we wanted Windows. We wanted something that was functional. We wanted something without a bunch of BS that gets in the way.
 We chose Windows because the operating system was more transparent with us when it came to being informed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But keep pushing these new UIs at us. We have resoundingly rejected your new UIs and you can't get your head out of your *** to see that we don't like it because it hasn't proven itself to be superior in any real way. You are alienating business because
 above all else, business needs consistency over gimmicks. Nobody wants Windows 8 in their business and no one will want anything remotely like Windows 10 Build 9926 either. You release anything close to 9926 and it will be the same story over again as Windows
 8. Everyone will be installing applications to revert new features to a pre W8 format</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its a rant, I know. I'm sorry. But software design in the past 5 years is moving in a direction I can't understand. Am I really so broken that I can't get with the changes? Am I really so broken that I can't see what it is that people like about these ugly,
 poorly functioning UIs? </p>

            Well, in stark contrast to YOUR kind, I LOVE Windows 8 and the Metro approach.&nbsp; I've grown up with MS-DOS and every version of Windows, so I'm not afraid of change if it's going somewhere I want to go.&nbsp; Windows 8 was a HUGE leap in that direction.&nbsp; Windows
 10 is a HUGE leap BACKWARD.&nbsp; Win8 is the new UI I prefer.&nbsp; Windows 10-same-idea-as-Windows 7 is NOT where I want to go anymore.

            <p>I think there is near universal condemnation of the 9926 build for instability and has alienated both Win7 and Win8 users. &nbsp;Hopefully the next build will restore sanity and I hope you give it a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As much as I detest Windows 8's start screen and "all apps", at least it was a coherent effort to do things a certain way, and a third party start menu could make it perfectly functional for me. &nbsp;Perhaps because this is still an "early preview" Win10 is
 mind mindbogglingly haphazard as if there is no clear vision of what they are trying to accomplish and it's all in pieces. &nbsp;Unfortunately if you look at the progression of builds, it's only getting worse, which concerns me.</p>

            Err, Windows 8 was just a faster and more efficient version of Windows 7 with a fancy UI added for touchscreen use that it was very easy to disable with a piece of free software (Classic Shell) or a $5 one (Start8). With one of those installed, most Win7
 users feel right at home in Win8. Now Win10 is still Win8 underneath with a few features added. MS is still working on solving the puzzle of how to integrate touchscreen use into&nbsp;Windows, something that Apple hasn't even begun to address (it has a completely
 separate OS for touchscreen, and it doesn't yet produce touchscreen computers, only the ipad toy thingy).&nbsp;Three of the computers in my household are touchscreen now, and my kids feel right at home using Win8 in tablet mode on their laptop hybrids. So before
 you "give up", try to understand what MS is trying to achieve, and the openness with which they're trying to do it in this development cycle. By all means, provide them with your feedback about what you don't like, using the fe

</p><p>I need my VMs so yeah, I had to revert to Windows 8.1. I think running the preview was well suited to me though. I personally build my own desktop systems and I'm pretty fair at troubleshooting, researching, and implementing workarounds. I've booted Windows
 betas since Vista. And as stated, I always have a desktop to fall back on, even when I'm not at home. I dislike how you infer I'm dissatisfied about getting to run the TP for free.&nbsp; I dislike the direction Microsoft is taking Windows. The technical bugs were
 just me documenting the issue I had in case someone else has the same issue. I was disappointed, but having an issue is not completely unexpected. I got like what... 3 months without a fatal issue? Steam and my steam games worked. So many things worked and
 it was initially very impressive. </p>

<p>The link indicates, "A fix for an issue that could cause virtual machines (VMs) to lose connectivity to virtual hard drives (VHDs)" Unfortunately the problem was that my Levovo Y580 refused to boot Windows 10 TP Build 9926 as my host OS. I run Linux VMs
 as guests. My guest OS would actually boot immediately after I installed VirtualBox without restarting my Windows 10 TP host. Then I would reboot my Windows 10 TP host and fail to boot. I found it bizarre, mostly because I had become spoiled with having no
 issues with all other TP builds.&nbsp; </p>

<p>why should we have to use a 3rd party program to make the UI do whats already designed into the software to do. microsoft just insisits that i need to carry my pc monitor in my pocket like a cellphone!!!</p>
<p>all 3rd party software usually does is unlock hidden settings and allow them the ability to be changed. its been like that since the dawn of the computer age, MS just limits more and more system settings with every new release of the softwareTHE OPTIONS
 ARE ALREADY IN THE SYSTEM, MS windows cellphone programmers just needs to make them available</p>

There is no option to backup or restore partnerships.&nbsp; They can be created and deleted only.<br />
<br />
Was the Treo 750 hard reset?&nbsp; If so then the PC will not recognize the Treo.&nbsp; You will need to delete the existing partnership in WMDC and then setup a new partnership.<br />
<br />
If the Treo was not reset, try looking in WMDC when the Treo is not connected.&nbsp; This is done by clicking on Mobile Device Settngs and click on End a Partnership.&nbsp; Select the partnership and then click the End Partnership icon.<br />
<br />

            The device was not hard reset. For some reason the partnership just disappeared. All the Outlook contacts, calendar, notes, etc., are intact on the Palm but the Outlook email account disappeared. All that remains is the account that I use to download email
 while traveling from the 3G network. I tried restoring the ActiveSync settings from the Sprite backup file. No luck.
<br />
<br />
Is this something that just happens now and then without reason? Whatever I have added to Outlook contacts, etc., since the last sync will be lost when I reconnect as I understand. Is that correct?

            OK, I started over again to establish a new partnership. Why does it take so long to save settings? It seems like WMDC is locked up.
<br />
<br />
I get most of my email through a pop server but some organizational mail through an Exchange Server. I included the Exchange Server settings but then want to set ActiveSync to only sync what is on my computer. That is where it seems to be hanging up.

            Curiously enough, when I went to set the files in Outlook email to sync, they were the same as before the partnership was lost. It acts like it found the original settings someplace.
<br />
<br />
OK, I have to whine a bit here. The idea of having a device like this and syncing data with your PC is to make your life more organized and easier to manage. The idea is not to spend half your life figuring out how to make the thing work. I didn't buy it go
 learn all the details about ActiveSync. I bought it to take Outlook contacts, calendar, notes and email with me.

            So now the Palm locked up on a soft reset. I did a hard reset and the Start menu only shows Today, no programs, no system, no file explorer, nothing. What next?

            <p>Hi Ciriaco,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet Explorer will not appear under Programs and Features in Control Panel. It should be listed &nbsp;under the installed updates in Windows Update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue might occur due to corrupt system files related to Internet Explorer. First of all, run SFC scan to scan and fix corrupt system files on the computer. Follow the methods listed below:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Refer to the link to run SFC scan:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if you still receive the same error message when you open Internet Explorer. If yes, proceed to the next method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>You can refer to the link and follow the instructions to repair Internet Explorer:</p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned under section "<strong>Uninstall Internet Explorer</strong>"</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/install-ie#ie=ie-11-win-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/install-ie#ie=ie-11-win-7&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, Internet Explorer will go back to the previous version. Download and install Internet Explorer 11 from the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/download-ie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/download-ie</a></p>

<h2>            Outraged to the point of consdering legal action against Microsoft for telling the public that the HTC One M8 would support Windows 10 Insider Preview Edition</h2>
                    <p>The HTC One M8 for AT&amp;T quite simply does not support Windows 10. As most of you know, Microsoft told the public a month and a half ago that it did. I have been forced to reset my phone twice, and will soon be resetting it for a 3rd time because I can't
 even make a phone call. THIS IS NOT EXCUSABLE!!!&nbsp;I am a Microsoft Windows Phone developer with 10 years of experience using Microsoft technologies. I intended to develop Windows Phone apps at the time that I purchased the M8. I have wasted so much time reconfiguring
 my phone due to Microsoft's TERRIBLE software developers and QA teams who are part of the Windows Phone 10 project. They are responsible for releasing updates that they could not possibly have tested thoroughly and, thus, I am forced me to drop everything
 else happening in my life to reset my phone which cost $800. HTC support passed me off to AT&amp;T support who blamed Microsoft (and rightly so - they are more responsible for this catastrophe than the other two companies). However, the root cause for this situation
 is a lack of communication between HTC and MS - the hardware clearly is either not compatible with Windows 10, or the time that it would take to develop a working solution just isn't worth the effort. I will NEVER buy a Windows Phone product again. I am considering
 dropping my use of Microsoft technologies for development purposes completely and focusing instead on developing solutions for an operating system that actually works - Mac OS X!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You were warned many times in advance that this is a beta or testing software. I don't understand people getting angry with Microsoft when you know it is a system that is being tested, we are the testers and we provide feedback so the designers (engineers)
 can figure out how to eliminate the bugs.</p>
<p>I bricked my phone 3 times so far but was fortunate to recover the phone, not Microsoft's problem, I knew the chance I was taking. I just happen to like trying out beta software. To me this is fun. I like troubleshooting!&nbsp;:-)</p>

            <p>Perhaps I should take that back. Perhaps they are as disorganized as they appear. I must acknowledge that Windows is a huge project and they have given no firm date except "by the start of school". There is a certain amount of organizational fixed overhead
 in terms of time taken in the mechanics of making the disks, boxing and shipping etc. But overall that seems
<strong>EXTREMELY</strong> loose to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what is this, we hear about two dates? What is committed to by when? And soon after those dates comes "Redstone". If I read correctly, they aren't even planning to shut the Insiders down.</p>

            <p>Renee, please ... do you really think unkind words and accusations are called for in this situation?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a well-meaning person is being pressed hard to make a time commitment, and falls into wishful thinking, but later finds that developmental work being done by others fails to allow his commitment to come to fruition, that doesn't make it a lie. Further,
 when some of the ones who pressured him unmercifully into making that commitment attack him for being unable to fulfill it, reasonable observers might wonder if the attack is justified.

            You are being facetious and I realize that.<br />
<br />
Actually, I did accomplish a lot...and management was not my 'Thang'.<br />
<br />
Digital was the second largest computer company in the world and we invented interactive computing. Every thing else was punch cards. Digital did accomplish a lot. IBM was the largest and that computer and that kind of computing does not count. Digital is why
 we are here today. So Digital did contribute a huge amount to computing.<br />

</p><p>Firstly, thanks for responding.&nbsp; Clearly you are assuming I am totally new to OneNote.&nbsp; However what I would like to understand (and is not addressed by any of the links all of which I have checked out), is the relationship between sharing rules, and memory
 storage, especially at the ineterface between OneNote and OfficeLens.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I can make this clearer&nbsp;if I ask the questions differently - so,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does OfficeLens hold a separate file for&nbsp;every image you create?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so is it by default held in OneNote unless otherwise specified, or are there copies in OneNote and locally to where the image was taken in OfficeLens?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens if you manually tell Office Lens to place a file in a given section of either OneNote or Onedrive?&nbsp; Does OfficeLens still hold a copy of that image locally?&nbsp; Does it have a local name or the name you gave it manually? What happens if that image
 is deleted or changed - does the image always change or sometimes, and under what circumstances?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens when you subsequently manage a file automatically held in OneNote - say moving it or renaming it - does OfficeLens still hold the original?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens when you subsequently manage a file manually&nbsp;stored (for example&nbsp;in a non-default location or with a non-default name) in OneNote or Onedrive - say moving it or renaming it - does OfficeLens still hold the original?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using OfficeLens on my iPhone, and sync with the online version of OneNote (pending a decision on purchasing Office365) and with Onedrive.&nbsp; I have Windows 10 in one location and a Vista PC (!), so upgrade to W10 required for Office 365...</p>

<p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nokia.com/gb-en/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA120750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.com/gb-en/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA120750</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a look at this webpage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It says - "Select <strong>Menu &gt;&nbsp;Settings &gt;&nbsp;Phone &gt;&nbsp;Sensor settings&nbsp;&gt; Turning control &gt; Auto-rotate display</strong>"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trouble is, I cannot find Sensor settings in the Phone part of the menu. My display is permanently portrait, and I would like the option to rotate it around. Why cant I see this option in the location suggested above?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>This FAQ does not relate to Windows Phone. as there is no such option in Settings &gt; Phone. Rotation lock will be introduced in the coming GDR3 update and is not available yet for the Lumia 820.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Screen rotation should always be on right now, it is important to have the phone in a (near) vertical position for this to work properly.</p>

    <title>Outlook in Office 365 and iCloud contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> megwbenn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook in Office 365 and iCloud contacts</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed Office 365.&nbsp; Now my contacts are a complete mess in outlook.&nbsp; I have duplicates contacts in my "outlook" contacts.&nbsp; When I try to type in an email address, the autofill options have my contact information all mixed up.&nbsp; The name and
 email address that appear together do not belong together.&nbsp; And when I look at the contact information, it is not mixed up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example.&nbsp; I might have a contact named Bob Smith and his email is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; And another contact named John Williams and his email is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; But when I start to type Bob Smith in the to box of an email, the auto suggestion pops
 up with Bob Smith (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***).&nbsp; How do I get that straightened out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I would like to combine my Outlook contacts and iCloud contacts.&nbsp; &nbsp;Can I just drag my iCloud contacts into the Outlook contacts folder?&nbsp; Will I have even more duplicates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<br />This is corrupt autocomplete. If just a few are affected, delete those entries, otherwise delete the entire autocomplete (in file, options, mail)
<br />
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;And I would like to combine my Outlook contacts and iCloud contacts.   Can I just drag my iCloud contacts into the Outlook contacts folder?  Will I have even more duplicates?
<br />&gt;&gt;
<br />Yes, you can just drag them. if the contact exists, you'll either get the duplicate warning message (if it is enabled in file, options, people) or duplicates. 
<br />
<br />If you are moving/copying the iCloud contacts  because they don't show when you click To., see <a href="https://www.outlook-tips.net/tips/icloud-contacts-address-book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.outlook-tips.net/tips/icloud-contac...</a>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Delete Phantom Folders in Outlook 2010 IMAP&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a really perplexing time connecting my work's Office365 account to Outlook 2010 in Windows 7 for email. Previously it worked fine, but then last week, it did not register any new emails even though I received them on my Android phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a number of things, before eventually deleting the .pst file associated with it, and removing the entire account from Outlook and the Mail control panel. Afterwards, I went through the Mail control panel and re-added the account details etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the workaround fixes that I came across was that I had to change the root folder, which I did, and promptly changed back as it did nothing to solve the problem. However, since then, I have "ghost" folders appearing on my account - even when I once
 again delete it all entirely from Outlook and Mail and then re-add it. Enclosed is a screenshot of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f6cca3f2-c1b1-4f41-9549-b09b9c0cd963" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, there is an "Inbox" within the actual inbox, containing deleted and sent items folders. Alongside that, there are InboxDeleted Items etc. along the bottom. None of these are moveable, deletable, or otherwise accessible to do anything with,
 and all have no content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I log into my account through Office365, these folders do not appear, so I have no idea why they would remain within Outlook alone, as it's IMAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me fix this problem?<br />
<br />
Much appreciated,</p>
<p>
</p><p>D</p>

            <p>Hello Experts,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears Outlook seems to have some issue with Root Folder config.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure if my problem is solved but it appears I am OK&nbsp;for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I did stumble into a post about root folder advise/config and it appears to have fixed my problem.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>In fact, it looks much organized and better now too, in terms of how the imap folder hierarchy is presented.</p>
<p>
