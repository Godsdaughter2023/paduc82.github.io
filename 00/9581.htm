<h2>            Cannot uninstall apps 5800</h2>
                    
<p>I recently update to v31 fw for my 5800. &nbsp;When I go to Application Mgr - Installed apps. and select a app to delete I get an error message saying "Memory Full". &nbsp;I have about 26mb free memory onboard and 3.1gb memory on the SD card. &nbsp;I also have about 30mb
 free ram. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I figured if that doesn't work I can simply uninstall programs using Nokia PC Suite...I could, so I uninstalled three programs. &nbsp;Now when I go to Application Mgr and click on Installed apps nothing happens...screen goes black for a split second and it goes
 back to the Application Mgr. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas? &nbsp;Please don't say reset...I am sick and tired of resetting my device.</p>

            I was afraid of that...the battery removal option didn't work. &nbsp;I will try a reset once I get home, I am at work and I cannot risk losing my phone or data right now. &nbsp;I will try and then let you know. &nbsp;Thanks.

            Hi Lorena1234,<br />

Due to the nature and sensitivity of your problem, I would suggest visiting your local Nokia Care point and letting them know of your troubles. They will be able to best advise you and inform you if there is any chance of data recovery of your photos and other
 personal data.<br />

    <title>Word 2010 Starter crashes upon opening - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diakoniapublishing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010 Starter crashes upon opening</h2>
                    Upon opening Word 2010 Starter (it happens in Excel too) it closes saying "WINWORD.EXE has stopped working. Windows is checking for a solution." Then after a few seconds, "A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program
 and notify you if a solution is available." This began to happen after Windows was shut down improperly and two recovered docs in the Document Recovery Pane. These docs are on a thumb drive and I have this occur with the thumbdrive plugged and also when it
 is not. <br />
<br />
I've done the repair from control panel and it said the repair had been made and then dowloaded a few things. I have also removed Norton antivirus and this issue still occurs.<br />
<br />
I understand this is an issue with offspon.exe that allows ads and also that either my firewall or Malwarebytes may be preventing the program from opening; however, I get no messages or warnings from Windows or Malwarebytes for such.
<br />
<br />
I booted in Safe mode, but could not open the program. As I said, I've also done the repair through the Control Panel with no success.
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help. <br />

            You have made a good start on the standard trouble shooting techniques.<br />
<br />
Try some of these trouble shooting procedures to see if you can find a cause:<br />

</span>(no %temp% folder)</span></span><span> </span>
<p><b>NOTE:<span>&nbsp;
</span></b>part of this procedure is disabling addins. If you want to take a shortcut, check to see if you have a BlueTooth device driver or addin installed. BlueTooth has been identified as the cause of problems with many different “random” symptoms. If you
 have BlueTooth, disable it in control panel, device manager and possibly as an addin in Office apps.</p>

<p>Alright, well, I found the answer to this final issue: I only needed to disable the Bluetooth add-in on Options. I have no idea why that would have been the problem, but I found it as a suggested fix

<b>Starting point when Word does something unexpected</b>
<p>As a general rule, when something seems to be going wrong, or at least not the way you want it to go, in Word, any version, go to Tools and then Options and study all the settings on all the tabs. You may even find some settings that
 you want to try that have nothing to do with the current problem.</p>
<p>When I was teaching Word and other Microsoft Office programs at a private business college, I had three rules:</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Always check Tools Options</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When in doubt, right-click on something</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If you're wondering how to set up a special kind of material in a document, consider whether Word tables are suitable. The placement officer of the school came to me several times and asked how I thought she should set something up. Each
 time the answer was, "I'd use a Word table." By the fifth time she had stopped asking--she got the point.</p>

<p>Recently a couple readers wrote to me with very similar problems. One was having trouble getting Internet Explorer to run; the other, Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>In other words, a couple of Windows' own built-in tools were broken. (Note to Microsoft: That should
<em><span>not </span></em>happen. Come on!)</p>
<p>Usually, for situations like these, I recommend an end-run around the problem. Internet Explorer won't work? Install Firefox or Chrome and use that instead. Can't load Windows Explorer? Switch to any number of even better
<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/212334/windows_explorer_explained_choosing_a_replacement.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Explorer replacements</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, that doesn't really solve the problem. If you're hoping to fix your broken tool, you'll need to do a little trouble shooting. To start, I recommend switching to (or creating) another user account, then seeing if Explorer runs
 properly. If it does, you've narrowed down the problem significantly (and should consider "moving" to a new user account permanently). If not, well, back to square one.</p>
<p>Either way, it's a simple method of figuring out how deeply rooted into Windows the problem is. And that will help considerably as you Google-search for an actual fix (assuming there is one--sometimes these things can be resolved only

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If that doesn't work, then try this more aggressive uninstall (followed by re-install) procedure:</p>
<p>Also uninstall Office Trial editions and any other Office-related programs such as "Office Activation Assistant" and any Office Viewer programs from the Programs applet in Control Panel. But you don't have to
 uninstall Office Starter if you have it. Then make sure to reboot TWICE (sorry, I don’t know why, but there appears to be some “Voodoo” at play here. We do it because it works!) after completing repair or uninstall.</p>

PS: DON'T EDIT FILES DIRECTLY ON A USB DRIVE! (Yes I am shouting &lt;grin&gt; ) Windows does not actually write files directly to thumb drives due to technical issues in flash based USB devices. Instead, Windows writes to a cache file on the local HD until a full
 "block" worth of data is available to write to the flash drive.&nbsp; If you edit files directly on the USB device and forget to use the windows USB shutdown procedure before pulling the thumb drive you could corrupt the file by leaving part of it behind inthe
 cache on the local HD!<br />

<h3> patrickgnl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change my Skype Name</h2>
                    <p>I hope someone can help me, because it seems near impossible to contact MS about this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I signed up for Skype many years ago before it was owned by Microsoft and my Skype Name includes my surname
<em><strong>which is a unusual one</strong></em>. I use Skype very rarely, up until today I have left privacy on full strength, so folk haven't been able to discover me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA390/who-can-see-my-skype-profile-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;that :</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(43, 43, 48, 1)">The information that is visible to everyone includes your
<strong>Skype name</strong>, location, gender, birthdate, language, and About Me section."</span></p>
<p>For my own reasons (ie. chatting with folk I don't know) I don't always want people to know what my surname is, so I would like to
<em><strong>change my Skype Name</strong></em> to <em><strong>something more anonymous</strong></em>. How do I do that? Of course I can just turn off discover-ability once I've added someone? But this still means the person can see still my surname, which is
 fine if know someone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, do I have to close the account (and lose my Skype Credit which I've had for years) and signup again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely it must be possible...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e3d92857-6e2d-4b6c-b9bc-93f1b62a56c5" title="PatrickGNL">
<p>
</p><p>I definitely understand how important this is for you, unfortunately, it has never been possible to change the Skype name. If you wish to use a different username, I'm afraid that the only option to do so is to create a new account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your credits and contacts, you can transfer it to the new account. You may follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have more than one Skype account, you can send yourself some of your own Skype Credit from any of your accounts as a gift. You'll just need to add yourself as a contact first.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Sign into the account you want to send credit to, and then send a contact request to the account you want to send credit from.
<br />
</li><li>Use this send Skype Credit link to sign into the account you want to send credit from.
<br />
</li><li>Search for the account you are sending credit to, select the amount, choose a gift card design, and then click the Confirm Selection button.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype Credit is sent directly to your other account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that in the new Skype, sending contacts is not yet available. If you have previously installed the classic Skype, you can use that or use Skype for Web then send your contacts from the original account to the new account:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>First, you'll need to make sure both accounts appear in each other's contact list.
</li><li>Use this link to <strong><a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sign in</a></strong> to the account that you want to send contacts to.<br />
</li><li>Select your other account from the chat list, you'll see a list of all the contacts you sent from your other account.<br />
</li><li>Under the name of each contact, select Add to contact, and then select the Add to
</li><li>Contacts button. <br />
</li><li>Your contacts are now added to your contact list, but will appear offline until they accept your request.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>For your reference, here are the FAQ's:</p>

    <title>Corrupted .docx file. Word 2007. Can&#39;t open the document. Tags - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> addictorator  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupted .docx file. Word 2007. Can&#39;t open the document. Tags mismatch. Help&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The Office Open XML file *.docx cannot be opened because there are problems with the contents.</p>
<p>Details: The name at the end tag of the element must match the element type in the start tag.</p>
<p>Location: Part: /word/document.xml, Line: 2, Column: 3487212</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hmm, I guess I should give some background info and what I've tried so far, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The document is in word 2007, Windows 7. Last night, I was in a hurry, and got a lot of things open. I was opening the document to do a few quick spontaneous revisions, but it was so laggy and I was late for an appointment, so I was feeling panicky and frustrated.
 In hindsight, it probably wasn't the best option to just force shut the PC down cause word stopped responding in the middle of opening the document. Still, while I'm no Sherlock, I knew stopping it while it's in the middle of saving the document would be
<em>bad</em>, I didn't think stopping it while <em>opening</em> the document (and not really modifying the document at all, at least that was what I thought before), could have drastic consequences! The document's quite large, a few hundred words, and about
 500 or so pages. It's this really big project I was doing at work, for months now really, and because it's somewhat business confidential in nature, I can't exactly share it freely, or I would've uploaded a copy, sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I woke up this morning and opened it, and the error came up. By the way, the document was saved in a 2TB external hard with a few disk errors in the past, if that helps, even if I'm pretty much sure its not a problem with the hard. The error came
 up... and yeah. I first made a copy, which I've been trying everything on, in case I do end up making things worse. I have no previous versions of it, just a relatively very old backup. Anything less than 80% recovery would set me back weeks with a wage cut.
 The good news is that I was able to open the document in WordPad, managing to recover the first 287 pages (131,543 words), with no errors or data loss, and saved it in a separate file. Apparently, according to information I obtained later, MSWord tends to
 not open at all when it encounters an error, but Wordpad tends to stop reading the rest of the code once it encounters an error. So, naturally, I assumed (so correct me if I'm wrong), that behind a few sentences I might lose due to the error, the rest could
 also be salvageable. I then looked up the problem all over the internet. Read a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/918429/en-us?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
microsoft article</a> on troubleshooting/recovering corrupted documents (Open &amp; Repair, Draft Mode, Creating Link, Recover text from any file converter, etc). No dice. I first saw a similar question over
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-word/the-name-in-the-end-tag-of-the-element-must-match/73a1e1b0-e6cf-43b8-a97f-0b01b5c33da3?page=1&amp;tm=1415335743008">
here</a>, and tried to use Tony Jollan's <a href="http://www.wordarticles.com/temp/Rebuilder.dotm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Rebuilder</a>, macros enabled and all. Sadly, no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to make my first breakthrough when I found out that .docx was just a .zip file, and could be renamed as such, with the document.xml extracted and manually fixed using an XML editor (not that I knew how to do that, but I was desperate and willing
 to learn). So, made another copy, changed extensions, and tried to specifically extract the document.xml. I believe that it is the main body text, right? That is the only thing really necessary for me, since everything I've done so far is entirely spartan,
 with no fancy fonts, formatting, header/footer/notes, media objects, formulas, tables, bullet points, numbered lists, etc. All pure sans-serif text, with some Japanese Kanji thrown in. 500 pages of&nbsp;<em>pure text.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I then hit a snag, when WinRAR encountered an error on extracting document.xml, stating that "CRC failed in word\document.xml. The file is corrupt". So I tried to fix this using several ZIP repair programs and stuff. Nothing worked. At least not so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I decided to give up the manual route for the meantime and focus on readymade solutions. I came across yet another
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2528942/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
microsoft article,</a> but this one was at least more relevant than the last. It had this auto FixMe thing. I ran it, didn't work. Apparently, as I found out
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-word/how-can-i-open-a-document-with-an-end-tagstart-tag/71231b04-6217-4c02-b663-7fce1300fa19">
later</a>, "This fix will work for one specific tag error where there are equations and graphics in the same paragraph AND Office 2010 SP1 has not been applied."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here I am, tearing my hair out in frustration. Whew, I feel like I told you guys my life story. I guess worst case scenario, I report this to my boss, so I personally or from the company, I/we'll hire a team of professionals to deal with it. But that's
 not an ideal scenario. It's gonna be out of my salary either way (the company has a firm policy of 'You reap what you sow'), along with a wage cut for making such an amateurish mistake even with continuous reminders to back it up every two sentences, so I'd
 rather avoid that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently looking to see whether there's a way to recover a previous version of an overwritten document somehow using a third-party software or something. (I didn't have Windows Backup enabled, so no previous version on Windows). So far, no autosaved
 documents on MSWord AutoRecover, even though I have it enabled set to every 3 mins (or maybe I'm just not seeing it since I'm trying to look for it manually?). Or are the temporary files wiped on shutdown? I don't have 'Always save backup copy' option enabled
 on word either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yeah, an auto fix, or a lengthy answer detailing what exactly I should do (from the very very basics), or a link to a site with such info, would be&nbsp;<em>much
</em>appreciated. Seriously :D</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please. Thanks for at least making an effort :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE 1: No backups. Managed to extract an incomplete version of document.xml using WinRAR's 'Keep Broken Files' option when extracting. The extracted document.xml came up to 3.31 MB while the original in archive is 7.53 MB. Viewed it in the Windows XML
 Editor which opened up the text in Internet Explorer, a jumble of text with no line breaks or paragraphs. Still, it actually extracted a few pages less than the open-using-Wordpad method tried earlier. So trying to fix the archive again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE 2: Tried several (read: dozens) corrupt Word recovery software, from freeware to pro trials, to varying degrees of effect, although unsuccessful in goal. Some failed to read it, saying it was too corrupted for them to handle, the best managed to recover
 about three-pages-worth less data compared to the Wordpad method. So yeah, anybody with a similar problem, always open it with wordpad first and recover what you can. That doesn't mean I'm giving up though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE 3: I'm done. Nobody but Palcouk bothered to reply, so I guess nobody else has anything to contribute. Luckily I had emailed the file to a Co-worker of mine just about a few days ago, so I've gotten back most of it, combined with what I've recovered
 from WordPad and then cross-referencing them and cutting off the duplicates, resulting in 305,138 words, 563 pages. It's at least enough to do the rest with a couple of sleepless nights. Palcouk's advice on checking for backups again sorta helped, being the
 only reply notwithstanding. So, thanks Palcouk :D</p>

    <title>Unable to run Windows Defender Offline Scan - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to run Windows Defender Offline Scan</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After performing a scan using Windows Defender, an issue that can be seen in the snap shots at the bottom of this post was found. I have tried for the past month now to follow instructions and 'take action' which goes on to say that an 'offline scan'
 seems to be required. After trying several times to initiate the scan, nothing happens. The system makes no attempt to initiate the 'offline scan' at all. I have performed many offline scans in the past, but this attempt no action is even attempted by the
 system! Has anyone else had similar problems of this sort and willing to offer any advice? The Windows edition is Windows 10 Pro, Version 1703 OS Build 15063.966.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for the time</p>

<p>Hi Vlad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that you are running W10 V1703, and having a problem with Windows</p>
<p>Defender Offline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that when it comes time for WDO to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
run</span>, your machine restarts</p>
<p>again instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem was caused by the Accumulative Update KB4025342. It</p>
<p>continued to occur through several more updates, and was resolved by</p>
<p>W10 V1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>V1803 is due out this month if you can put off your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<span>I have been a user of Microsoft Mobiles since 2012 ( Lumia 820 - A great mobile still running well without any issues). My current mobile (Lumia 950 XL), got a lot of issues with reboots, heating, unexpected continuous vibrations,
 weak&nbsp;</span>WiFi<span>&nbsp;strength all the time and now got a new problem after the latest software update 15043, my phone started heating up severely and battery got swollen in just 10 minutes and Phone is getting restarted. This is completely
 an issue with the device, by this time my device is 8 months old and i got&nbsp;</span>warranty<span>&nbsp;on it. Service center&nbsp;guys saying this is an issue with the battery and accessories warranty is just for 6&nbsp;months and they cant replace
 it, but the battery got swollen just because of the device itself. Device is faulty so that the battery got swollen. The worst case is i'm not able to find any online store/Physical store who sells original Battery's. I am completely not satisfied with your
 service. I request you guys to replace my phone including the battery.&nbsp;</span><br />

<p>
Please let me know, where to complain on this</p>

            So I am not the only one here. Exactly same thing has happened to my Lumia 950xl. After the software upgrade my battery got swollen. I replaced it and after two months, another software upgrade and my second battery has got swollen. This is such a poor
 stuff by Microsoft. I am never ever gonna buy any Microsoft product in future. Such a waste of money .

<h2>            Error 4248 each time I open Word 365.</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed Office 365. Each time I open Word, a visual basic window displays with the error 4248, this command is not available because no document is open - except I am not trying to open a file yet, only the program. I tried reinstalling Office,
 and it did not correct the problem. </p>
<p>I tried disabling my add-ons, and it did not work.</p>
<p>Any ideas how to fix this problem? Thank you. </p>

<p>Thanks!... but it doesn't help. I'm not trying to open Visual Basic or change any properties in a document. I'm simply opening Word by clicking on its icon... and I get this each time:</p>

<p>I have tried disabling add-ins, as suggested in another post, but that did not help either. Anything else I can try? Merci.</p>

            Hi Shirley,
<br />Are you trying to delete from <a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/owa/</a> or from an outlook program on your computer? 
<br />I would start with restarting my computer not a shutdown and restart but actually click restart. This clears all you computer Cache and clears up any Memory leaks. 
<br />If you are on <a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/owa/</a> then clear your internet cache and reopen and try again. 
<br />I usually if I want to delete everything in a folder open folder hold down the CTRL Key and while holding hit the A button this will highlight everything in this folder and delete. Either right click and select Delete or click the delete on your keyboard. 
<br />Hope this helps! 
<br />Linnell

                    <p>Sent message re: the above title. Nov. 13 2015. There was a reply asking for more info. From a Parth P. Patel. sent reply with requested information. Received a "non-deliverable (NDR)" Message that "Microsoft Community" &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt; either
 did not exist or was incorrect. 'Microsoft Press' who produced "Step by Step Word 2013" was not much help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then was instructed to use Outlook to resend. I am not familiar with how Outlook works, even had to change my password. This is a lot of trouble to go through for something so simple. Unless there is a way to get the un-corrupted or unreadable practice files
 for this book (I purchased to learn more about Word 2013) this book is useless to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this problem and is there a solution?</p>

<h2>            Word 2016 64 bit  paste object pdf displays as icon only</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>we have an access 2016 report that outputs to a word document, and then inserts as objects some pdf tables. &nbsp;All works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, upgraded to 64bit from 32 bit office 365 and it only appears as an icon. Only way to see it in word is to double click it, copy a picture of it in acrobat, then paste this back into word. Anybody have any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It really does seem to be a problem with 64 bit, and it works fine with 32 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we all in our office converted to 64 bit excel due to too many large spreadsheets, &nbsp;it looks as though this is simply an example of why MS recommend 32 bit office by default - The code fro this sort of thing never got written for 64 bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plan to abandon export to word and make whole system print in access to pdf. &nbsp;Not our favoured option but there's simply no reliable alternative.</p>

            Hi Aaron,<br />
<br />
This issue has something&nbsp; to do with the overall path length to the installation files that's why you're getting the error message you encounter. For us to install your Office to your computer, you can copy all the files in the installation folder to your hard
 drive first. In this way, you can shorten the length of installation into C:\MSOffice 2016. Once done, try to install Office from there to see if that works. You may also refer to this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-office_install/i-cant-install-office-2013-error-setup-cant-find/6de6f3fa-9d1f-4776-b1a0-39675dc94674">link</a></strong> that discuss about
 the error message you encounter and how other customer fix the issue.<br />
<br />
We look forward to your update.

    <title>Timely warning about Paragon HFS&#43; drivers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Timely warning about Paragon HFS&#43; drivers</h2>
                    <p>For those used to having access on Windows to their Mac volumes via Paragon's HFS+ solution, don't be tempted. While it appears that all is working as before, some kind of anomalous behavior is produced in Windows 10 TP (10041 at least) that will, and I
 do mean will, corrupt those Mac drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If bootable, they will lose that ability, the B-Tree will lose track of files, folders and volume size, and the disk will become read-only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a faint possibility that the paid software Disk Warrior may be able to restore things, but I can't guarantee that. The safest solution is to avoid the situation entirely by not installing Paragon HFS+ in the first place.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MacDrive, another HFS+ enabler for Windows, will simply refuse to work, erroring with a message that the drivers can't be loaded, so for the time being anyway, there are no safe solutions for accessing the Mac volumes from Win 10 TP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully my experience will help others avoid the potential trashing of their Mac disks/partitions with these historically useful but potentially destructive utilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Andy.</p>

<p>I can confirm this too after having a triple boot system end up with corrupt HFS+ boot drive several times and having to do full restores from Time machine my first suspicion was Linux access to the HFS disk as I'd previously booted into Linux before seeing
 the problems described. &nbsp;However after deliberately not loading Linux for a week or so the problem came back so I figured it must be the Paragon HFS+ drivers in Windows corrupting the volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled Paragon HFS+ 12 and the problem has gone away. &nbsp;I generally like the Paragon software but this particular piece of software is buggy.</p>

            Same here. My HFS+ partition's B-Tree slowly became corrupt when I started writing to it from Windows using Paragon HFS+.

<h2>            New Computer&#58; Want to Transfer Microsoft Office 2013</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I am wanting to wipe my computer clean and start afresh. I currently have Office 2013 Professional installed on it. I purchased Office a while ago over the internet and have no record of the serial number.
</p>
<p>Is there any way to extract the serial number for Office before I wipe my computer so that I can re-install after the wipe?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise can I re-install just by logging into my Windows account (my Office is currently logged into my account)?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Vannessa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description, it looks like you have purchased Office 2013 online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that is correct, then for online purchases product keys are not provided. To re-install Office 2013 on the computer you may sign into the My Account page at Office.com with the Microsoft Account that was used to purchase Office 2013.</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/myaccount</a></p>

<p>#2 - Any of those accounts would need to be setup up in Outlook or any other email client installed on your system (and set to be the &lt;default&gt; email client) in order for any other program to invoke sending via email - can't set a WebMail URL as a default
 for sending email</p>

<p>I guess you mean the Auto macros, there are only 2 left that works on today's Excel versions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub Auto_Open()<br />
&nbsp; MsgBox "Auto_Open"<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Sub Auto_Close()<br />
&nbsp; MsgBox "Auto_Close"<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recommend way is to use the Event routines in code module Thisworkbook.</p>

<p>Hi GeoffreyRobbins7379,</p>
<p>I understand it's a poor experience. I hope you can work on this issue with us.</p>
<p>Firstly, please check all the files especially those un-synced or stuck files referring to the KB article below, we need to remove or rename those unsupported files.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2933738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2933738</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, since sync issue can&nbsp;also be&nbsp;caused by the corrupted cache, I recommend you clear the OneDrive for Business cache using the "<strong>Fix it</strong>" tool in
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">this article,</span></a> then restart OneDrive for Business client and resync the files to see if it works in this way.<br />
Note: <strong>Backup</strong> all the local documents &amp; files to another place <strong>
before</strong> clearing cache to avoid any loss.</p>
<p>Moreover, if you only sync your OneDrive for Business library, we suggest you use the OneDrive for Business<b> Next Generation sync client
</b>which&nbsp;is fast and reliable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can configure the <b>Next Generation sync client</b>&nbsp;by referring to the steps in the following articles:</p>
<p>For Windows: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-the-OneDrive-for-Business-Next-Generation-Sync-Client-in-Windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Get started with the OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client in Windows</a></p>
<p>For Mac: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-started-with-the-OneDrive-for-Business-Next-Generation-Sync-Client-on-Mac-OS-X-d11b9f29-00bb-4172-be39-997da46f913f?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Get started with the OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client on Mac OS X</a></p>
<p>Windows 8.1 support: This release is currently not supported on Windows 8.1, this support will be added in the first quarter of 2016.</p>
<p>The SharePoint Document Library sync: This capability will be added in future releases; we will communicate timelines for this support in the first quarter of 2016</p>

                    I have a one sheet document. &nbsp;I run a macro which creates 10+ sheets with different names. &nbsp;I want to have cells in the base sheet equal to the cells in these newly created sheets, ideally independent of the sheet name &nbsp;

<div>I start with a only one worksheet on my excel file, call "base".
<div><br />
<div>I run a macro every morning and have a base sheet and 9 other sheets. &nbsp;These sheets might be named 1400, 1445, town155. &nbsp;The names are not consistent from one day to another. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>On the base sheet I wish to link cell A2 to cell a1 on 1400, cell A3 to cell a1 1445 and cell A4 to cell a1 on town155 sheet.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So I wish to have this links in place so they reference the sheet by its position rather than by its name. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

That didn't work just pasted 223, 223 and 232 into A1 of the sheets. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>At the moment I am working on a work around to go to a sheet(2) and past the results in to the base sheet, but it means the data isn't updated without running the macro, which is not ideal.</div>

            Why not modify the subroutine that makes the new sheets to add formulas to be Base sheet - the subroutine will know the name of the sheets it has just added. best wishes

<h2>            Which versions of Office include VBA</h2>
                    It is time for me to think about upgrading my Microsoft Office. &nbsp;I went to a Microsoft Store and called the Sales number, and no one could tell me which version of Microsoft Office for Mac or Windows also contains Microsoft VBA. &nbsp;In fact, none of the Microsoft
 representatives I talked to knew what VBA is. &nbsp;Is there somewhere a complete list of the current Office packages (i.e.: Home edition, Business edition, etc) which contain VBA? &nbsp;

<h2>            error 0xc004f01f office 2013</h2>
                    <p>help please! i've been trying for hours now to resolve a microsoft error issue when re-installing office 2013 home &amp; student (purchased &amp; installed April 2013). &nbsp;It was a reinstall tonight per the on line forum when i looked at FAQ. &nbsp;When the error below
 kept coming up and would not fix or help, i called microsoft. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>the first guy in microsoft tech support "Julien" said it was too hard for him to fix. &nbsp;2nd guy was a joke - "Andrew". He was so rude. I gave the reference # that Julien provided, per his instruction and Andrew ignored. He asked me to review everything again
 &amp; then his resolution - to sell me a tech. support plan to move forward to fix this issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i asked for a supervisor &amp; he said i had to buy a plan if i wanted help. &nbsp;he said he could have tech person email me self help tips .. and then put me back into the line as if I were a brand new call with wait of up to 20 minutes. &nbsp;the customer no service
 is very frustrating. &nbsp;microsoft is top of the worst company list with customer service. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>can anyone suggest what I need to do to repair this issue? &nbsp;also, where i can post to microsoft as bad service rating?</p>
<p>
</p><p>the error issue after the on-line accepts and authorizes my log in and product key. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Sorry we ran into a problem while trying to install the product key. If this keeps happening, you should try repairing your office product. System error 0xc004f01f"</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you</p>
