    <title>3rd Party Backup Programs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> creacontech  say:</h3>
<h2>            3rd Party Backup Programs</h2>
                    <p>Are there any 3rd Party backup programs that will back up programs as well as data (NOT a System Image), so that for disaster recovery, to&nbsp;be able to&nbsp; restore my programs and data&nbsp;to a different/new computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have an online background screening business, and maintain sensitive client data as well as numerous programs.&nbsp; I currently use Windows Backup to create System Images, but that will only restore my programs to the SAME computer&nbsp;(e.g. following&nbsp;a hard
 drive crash), but will not help if the current computer is destroyed&nbsp;in a disaster such as a&nbsp;fire, storm, flood etc.&nbsp; In the event of such a disaster, I need to be able to quickly restore all my programs and data to a replacement computer.</p>

            <p>No you can't do that directly. The program installer may run several different processes as well as loading the individual&nbsp; program directory, it can install libraries and register them, generate the menus and make numerous modifications to the registry.
 If the program requires C libraries or .net framework it will check if they exist or add them as required.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If that critical I would look at virtualising the system as this would not be hardware dependant. I had somebody with an old Borland database customer management system which would not even run on 7, I was able to virtualise the XP PC and run it in Microsoft
 Virtual PC. System images are not entirely tied to the same computer however if the platform is significantly different then you would have problems. Some of the paid for Acronis tools will help to modify an image to support different hardware.</p>

            <p>Thanks HairyFool, I was afraid of that, and I understand what you've said about the program installation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure, however, that&nbsp;I understand your description of the virtualization.&nbsp; I sounds like you did it with a single computer.&nbsp; I was under the impression virtualization required two or more computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either way, I don't think that will solve the problem.&nbsp; Since the virtualization happens in one place, that wouldn't help me in the case of a fire, storm, flood etc., since I'd still have to replace the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please tell me more about those Acronis tools you mentioned.&nbsp; I'm not at all familiar with them.</p>

            <p>Thanks Palcouk, I appreciate the information.&nbsp; In fact I followed your link to Acronis,, got on a chat session, and one of their product specialists called me back.&nbsp; We had a good productive conversation, and I'm going to order the Acronis IT Premium today.&nbsp;
 It's on sale through the end of December for $49.99; a $30 discount from the regular price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The product specialist told me that the product could restore the entire image - INCLUDING THE OS - to any other computer.&nbsp; That's the kind of product that I've been looking for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for the information.</p>

            <p>Palcouk has covered the Acronis as you have found.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Virtualisation involves using a host program such as Virtual PC (Microsoft) or VirtualBox (Oracle) to build and run an entire PC as a program on the host PC. It emulates the hardware of a computer and stores the disk drive of that computer as a file. Because
 the PC hardware is virtualised it will be exactly the same no matter what the physical host PC has in it. So if you are running the host on a 965 initially if you then have to import the virtual drive on to a host built on a H67 it makes no difference.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The emulated hardware is relatively basic and is mostly supported by Windows without additional drivers. Sysinternals provide a tool to extract a working PC into a virtual disk&nbsp;
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/static/images/icon_editorLink.png">here</a>&nbsp;which then can be used to create an absolute copy but as Virtual PC.</p>

    <title>Web Folders and Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> confusedbrit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Web Folders and Windows 7</h2>
                    At my college we can access our documents folder from home over the internet. They provide access using Web Folders managed by RM Easylink. Im just a student so this is all the information i am able to access.<br />
<br />
I found out how to map it to a networked drive, but I can only access it to the folder level - I cannot see individual files.<br />
<br />
Can you help me correct this problem?<br />
<br />
I'm currently running the RC of Win7 though plan to upgrade to Win7 pro as soon as I can afford it, but this could be a dealbreaker.

That is doubtful.&nbsp; usually firewalls will check for others and disable them or un-install them.<br />

            <p>Your brother did a custom install of Windows 7 32 bit over Windows Vista 64 bit. If you need 64 bit Windows 7, you will need to download it and use the product key that was used to install Windows 7 32 bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To retrieve the product key:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are four utilities, all of which will may display your product keys if they are still there:<br />

http://www.majorgeeks.com/download4138.html</a> which has additional features</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.</p>
<p>Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.</p>
<p>Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>

<p>Windows 7 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 7 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than
 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 7 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 7.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 7 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers. Also, if
 you decide to move to Windows 7 64 bit in the future, there is no upgrade path from 32 bit Windows, clean install only. Because you have 4 GBs of RAM in your system, as JW recommends, its best you work with 64 bit Windows 7, since you would be underutilizing
 the system with 32 bit Windows 7.</p>
<p><br />
Boot from the Windows 7 DVD<br />
Click Install Now<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 7 Click Next.</p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>(At all cost, do NOT click anything named Format or Delete or Partition. So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. Click OK</p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers.</p>
<p>You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.</p>

            <blockquote>I loaned it to my brother inlaw , before he had it ,it was a Hp Vista 64 bits ,upgrade too 7 and now it says it's a&nbsp;7 32 bits operating system ?</blockquote>
<br />
<br />
He did a custom install of Windows 7 32 bit. You can keep 32 bit installed, or if you want to install Windows 7 64 bit:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1) You'll need to use the correct bit install disk - 32 and 64bit come on a separate DVD.
<br />
--If you bought the retail copy of Windows 7 you should have gotten both 32 and 64bit disks.
<br />
<br />
2) You must completely reinstall Windows when switching bit types (32/64 bit). You'll have to backup your files and reinstall all your programs.<br />
<br />
﻿3) Upgrading or simply switching between Windows 7 32/64 bit is not possible.<br />
<br />
4) If you are moving to 64 bit make sure your computer can run 64 bit - you can use the Upgrade Advisor to check:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor</a><br />
<br />
5) Make sure 32/64 bit drivers are available for your computer - check with the manufacturer.<br />
<br />
6) The Windows 7 key will work with both 32 and 64 bit, but only one can be installed at a time.
<br />
<br />
7) If you want both 32 and 64 bit installed at the same time you will need two product keys.
<br />
<br />
8) Installing the bit type you want (with a retail disk):<br />
A. Insert the install disk, restart and boot from the DVD <br />
B. Click Install Now <br />
C. At the setup screen, click Custom (Advanced) <br />
D. Choose the partition to install Windows on<br />
E. Continue with the install<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless you have 4GB+ of RAM, or have programs written in 64bit, you won't notice much of a difference performance wise by installing 64bit. Make sure the computer has 32 or 64 bit drivers before installing the bit type you chose. Most 32 bit programs will run
 in Windows 64 bit.<br />

    <title>Day One Xbox w&#47;Broken Disc Drive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Day One Xbox w&#47;Broken Disc Drive</h2>
                    
<p><span>March 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2015</span></p>



<p><span>Microsoft, I have been an avid user of the Microsoft Xbox consoles since the original console released in 2002. I am on my third-generation Xbox One console, and was a “day one” purchaser. I have never
 had a problem with support from Microsoft in the time that I have used it's products. It wasn't until my Xbox One optical disc drive began to malfunction that the previous statement changed. I followed all the steps on the Microsoft support website to remedy
 my Xbox One, nothing worked. The hard reset, the power being removed from the wall, and the manual eject all failed in helping my situation. I proceeded to go to the online service repair forms, it was there that I started a chat with a representative named
 Calvin. Calvin was polite in his text and seemed like he wanted to help. When my serial number for my Xbox One console was looked up, it showed that it had expired on February 15<sup>th</sup>, 2015. It was then that I asked to be contacted by someone from
 the customer support, he took my best available number and I received a call within minutes. When I was speaking with the lady from customer support she informed me that Microsoft gives its customers a twelve month warranty and a thirty day grace period. The
 representative then informed me that I was six days out of my grace period and it would cost me $135.00 to send my Xbox One console in for repair. At this point I disagreed with my requirement to pay for my Xbox One console to be repaired, as I have no responsibility
 in the malfunction of the system. I asked to speak to a manager, she told me that she could connect me with her floor manager but he will not be able to change anything. I explained, again, my situation to the floor manager Edgar. Edgar reemphasized the fact
 that my warranty was good for one year and an extra thirty day grace period. He also explained that I was six days past any period that would allow me to get my Xbox One console repaired without a charge of $135.00. It was then that I explained to Edgar that
 his information on my Xbox One console was incorrect. He showed my purchase date being in February of 2014. I clearly own a Xbox One “Day One” edition console. Attached you will see my receipt from the Microsoft store showing an order date of June 11<sup>th</sup>,
 2013. I understand the benefit of my information being inaccurate, as I would gain additional warranty time from the February purchase date. However, my console came on the verified street delivery date that was stated, which was the release in November. The
 fact that the information is run on a system of serial numbers and somehow my serial did not match up with the date in which mine was purchased baffles me. After explaining to him my belief that the repercussions should not fall on me, as I have no control
 over how the internal hardware of the Microsoft Xbox One should properly function, he politely danced around the fact that there was nothing he could do to change it. At this time I asked to speak to his superior, which of course he or she was not on site.
 Edgar then took down my call back number and stated he would give it to his supervisor and there would be a twenty-four hour turn around on the call back. Before I could say that was fine, Edgar was sure to emphasize that his supervisor could not help my case
 at all.</span></p>
<p><span>Now that its clear the steps I have taken, I would like to get in contact with someone who can explain how my Xbox One console does not show the correct date of purchase, and date of expiration on warranty.
 Lastly, someone to explain to me how it is my responsibility to fix internal problems that the Microsoft Xbox One console has been going through. Warranty or not, the product failed one year and three months after it was produced. That lifespan is not acceptable
 for an item that I paid $534.99 dollars of my hard earned money. And to now tell me that I have to pay another $135.00 dollars to send it off to Microsoft Xbox for repairs that may or may not be fixed is also unacceptable. The situation might be understandable
 to me if it were four to five years old. To sell a product that malfunctions within the first year and a half, and then require customers to pay what is now more than a quarter of an entirely new Xbox One console really makes me think about the commitment
 I've given to Microsoft and Xbox in its entirety. </span></p>

<p>^ I guess loyalty doesn't mean much to Microsoft. Maybe Sony will treat us better if/when we have problems. &nbsp;This kind of "customer service" is exactly the type of response that would trigger a brand swing in my opinion. Unbelievable.</p>

<p>Yep, my roommate's Xbox One (Day One Edition) disc drive broke a few weeks ago. Mine broke today. Currently, we can't register the consoles on the website (generic error message: "Call customer support"), so we can't even start a repair that way, but when
 my roommate called last week, customer service told him even though the disc drive issue is a known problem among Day One editions, they are no longer offering repairs for free. It seems we weren't lucky enough to get total lemons, so now not only did we pay
 $150 more (we didn't want a kinetic) for being early adopters, but we have to pay $100+ because (once again) Xbox didn't design their console properly.</p>
<p>Sony was my secondary console for the last couple generations, but now that's it's the more powerful console, Microsoft is making this an easy decision. I'm jumping ship.

<p>I am experiencing the exact same issue with my disc drive. &nbsp;I preordered mine in June of the launch year as well. &nbsp;Now, none of my discs work in the Xbox One I paid the premium price for. &nbsp;When I insert a disc, it does not even register with the console.
 &nbsp;It keeps telling me to insert a disc. &nbsp;DVD movies don't work either. &nbsp;I spoke with chat customer service and the end result is I need to pay $125 to have this fixed. &nbsp;I thought the days of the Xbox 360 repair issues was in the past. &nbsp;I had to sent that thing
 in 3 times getting fixed. &nbsp;Come on Microsoft. I have had all Xboxes, I use a Surface and a Windows Phone, I also pay for an xbox music subscription and an office 365 subscription. &nbsp;Not enough money out of me yet?</p>

<p>I have this same problem, but ONLY with DVD's (so far). Sadly, I was a fan of our PS4, but it was getting old and Halo was coming out, so XBOX One sounded fantastic. Aside from Halo being a lost cause, about 70% of the DVD's I put in the drive say "Error"
 or "Insert Disc". It's been about 7 months now and every time I try to contact Microsoft they don't help at all. This along with their awful XBOX Live services truly makes me regret my decision to leave Sony. I honestly did not have ONE problem with my PS4
 in the 4+ years I owned it. </p>

 Community can be used for online identity theft or possible fraud. In order to protect users from such scenarios, we highly advice to not post any related personal information.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards to your inquiry, Skype Names are user names that people use to sign in to Skype. The option to create a custom Skype Name is
<strong>no longer available</strong> when Skype migrated to Microsoft. As the account creation process has been shortened, new users will have the option to create their account using either an<strong> email address
</strong>or a <strong>phone number</strong>. Users with these type of accounts will have a
<strong>Microsoft account</strong> and not a Skype Name.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Accounts created using a phone number or an email will have a system-generated Skype user name
<em>(which cannot be changed) </em>that will show as <strong>live:whatevercomesbefore@</strong> for email-created accounts and
<strong>live:randomalphanumericcharacters </strong>for phone number-created accounts. You can locate it by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Sign in to your account on the Skype website. </li><li>Scroll down to <strong>Account details</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Purchase history</strong>. </li><li>Your Skype ID (username) will show on the upper right side of the webpage beside
<strong>Sign out. </strong></li></ul>

    <title>The drivers loading time of Win7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hugo mai  say:</h3>
<h2>            The drivers loading time of Win7</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use the stress tool "reboot test" to reboot the Win7 circular.</p>
<p>The "reboot test"&nbsp; setting is: wait 5 seconds after enter desktop then auto reboot.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, the Win7 will BSOD, the failure rate is about 1/20.</p>
<p>If change the "reboot test" setting time to wait 30 seconds, the system will not BSOD for over 500 times reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I want to know how long the Win7 require for the OS&nbsp;to&nbsp;complete the drivers loading&nbsp;after enter to desktop? Is there any definition from Microsoft?</p>
<p>My Win7 is pure OS, just install the&nbsp; basic drivers.</p>

            <p>Hi Hugo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This seems to be the Reboot test wait time issue. When you set it for 5 seconds, all the drivers do not get loaded and as result of which you get the Blue screen errors. This looks normal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally, there is a initial time frame set for the computer for Windows to boot. Any settings made below the boot up time frame can cause problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To check the initial boot up time, I would suggest you to place the computer in Clean Boot state so that only the Microsoft services are started when the computer is started. This will be boot time set for your computer. However, with the other programs
 and device drivers enabled in startup will hamper the startup time of the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So you may try this test on your computer and check the difference in the Boot time with and without the third party device driver services. You will see a difference. Use the wait time for reboot tests accordingly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean boot: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796</a></p>
<p>Note: Once done troubleshooting, place the computer in normal state by following the steps mentioned in "How to return Windows to a normal startup mode".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hope this information helps. If you have any concerns, let us know.</p>

            Loading time of drivers depends with the hardware configuration present. Although basic drivers will be used, the number of devices as well as the capacity differs and so the loading time differs. Normally, it's less than 30 seconds.

<h2>            How can I re-install Windows 10 directly from DVD with data&#47;settings saved&#63;</h2>
                    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
                    <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
<p>
&nbsp; 
</p><p><span>I just had my very first WTF (what the f…) moment with Windows Pro 10 (version 1703) x64.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I have a legitimate copy.</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>I have a legitimate copy.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Background:<span>&nbsp; </span>
My motherboard (ASUS Sabertooth Z170 Mark 1) released a new revision of BIOS firmware.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As always, I upgraded my motherboard, then at the restart went directly into BIOS settings, loaded Default Optimized Settings and then after another restart, went again back directly into BIOS to manually enter my custom settings manually.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Only then did I reboot to allow my Windows 10 to start.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>Well, low and behold, about 3 seconds into the Windows boot, I got a screen telling me that I have a CRITICAL PROCESS DIED error.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>For the next 2 two hours, I tried everything to get my system to successfully repair/ boot into Windows but nope.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Although I had 3 recent System Restore Points, I was not allowed to select any of them.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I also have a clean Windows 10 Pro DVD (Creator Edition 1703), but it would not allow me to re-Install Windows with my DATA/SETTINGS
<span>&nbsp;</span>I also have a clean Windows 10 Pro DVD (Creator Edition 1703), but it would not allow me to re-Install Windows with my DATA/SETTINGS
<span>&nbsp;</span>SAVED (meaning, selecting UPGRADE) because I booted from a DVD drive, and it requires that I do this from within working Windows.
<span>&nbsp;</span>SAVED (meaning, selecting UPGRADE) because I booted from a DVD drive, and it requires that I do this from within working Windows.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Finally, I called Microsoft out of desperation. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span>Finally, I called Microsoft out of desperation. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>They explained to me that the reason System Restore points don’t work (cannot be selected) because Windows thinks that I have a new machine since the BIOS revisions are now different (again, I did
 not swap or replace any motherboards, just flashed newer BIOS revision, which I have done probably 3-4 times before and never had issues).<span>&nbsp;
</span>To further disprove this theory, I decided to re-FLASH my motherboard to the previous version of my BIOS (meaning the exact same one as I had when I created those System Restore points), but it would not work either!<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I then had Microsoft tell me that there is no way to have Windows 10 re-install over itself without having to lose all of my data/settings and my only option is to make a clean install and then copy over the data.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Luckily, I had cloned my C: drive just 4 days ago, and upon again re-flashing my motherboard BIOS to the latest version, I was able to clone the backup drive over the actual drive (that would no longer boot), and now everything works just fine.</span></p>

<p><span>Just only took 10 hours of my time!</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>So my question is this:<span>&nbsp;
</span>How / what can I do be able to have a DVD or a FLASH drive in the future that would allow me to re-install Windows without losing my data/settings?<span>&nbsp;
</span>So we are clear, no matter what I did with the official DVD (entering my serial number or not), it was not able to Repair my system (Windows told me it’s unfixable), nor allowed me to “UPGRADE” (which is in essence, re-installed Windows, without loosing
 data/settings.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Also, should I enable UEFI Mode or keep legacy mode in BIOS?<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am not booting my PC in some network, as it’s a standalone system:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Very frustrated a looking for some help!<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Sounds like a nightmare *AND* I am only going to address one small part out of it all (sorry): get out of LEGACY if at all possible, go full UEFI.&nbsp; That has nothing to do with whether your system is connected to a corporate domain and/or never connected
 to the Internet.&nbsp; UEFI replaced the old BIOS for a reason, you'd be better off in the long run not trying to hold back.&nbsp; :-)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just as a jab at the other part: no - you cannot install Windows 10 from DVD/USB and repair the in-place OS in such a manner where all data is saved.&nbsp; You can backup your stuff and copy it back, you can make a
<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5495-create-system-image-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
full system image</a> periodically in step with your normal backups and be able to restore that full system image and then your own individual file/folder backups to get back to a closer state than a clean install will get you...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8/8.1 let you create a custom "Refresh" image, that was nice.&nbsp; Windows 10 took that away.</p>

<p>Well, your options are, create a thorough system image of the drive before flashing the drive, so, in case you end up in a similar situation; you can just restore the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UEFI is advantageous if your motherboard supports Secure Boot and also using drives larger than 3 TBs with the GPT partitioning scheme.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
You may perform a clean boot and check if any third party software is causing this issue.<br />
<div>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<br />
Note: After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above Knowledge Base article.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Run System File Checker (SFC) scan to fix any corrupt system files. To do this, follow the steps mentioned in the link :<br />
How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a><br />
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
You may also run a Microsoft safety scanner to make sure computer is free from virus infection:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
Disclaimer:<br />
If you run the virus scan the program that is infected with virus will get deleted. So you have to reinstall the program. Also if the files and folders are affected with virus then they might even get deleted<br />

<span>Dell Dimension 3000, Desktop, Intel Pentium 4, Windows XP sp3 Home edition. Bought in 2005.</span>
<span>I have added&nbsp;GB&nbsp;of memory.</span>
<span>When I start the Computer I push the button on the Tower, sometime is working and sometime is not.</span>
<span>When is not working I hear the fan working in the tower but the Monitor is not turning on. The light on the monitor, on the right&nbsp;bottom&nbsp;corner, turns on but is like orange. When the Monitor is working
 the light is Green. We know that the monitor is working. I am not holding down&nbsp;the&nbsp;Power button.</span>
<span>If I kick, strike out the Tower the Computer starts OK.</span>
<p><span>When I must shot off the Computer manually, this is when I hold the button down until the PC shots off. Sometimes when I hold down the power button the PC shots off and start by it
 self.</span></p>
<span>No I am not aware of having made any change to the PC.</span>
<span>Yes I can boot up on safe mode.</span>
Now I have another problem. When I start the Computer I have black windows with Dell’s LOGO. The second black windows ask me if I want to start with&nbsp;<span>Windows</span>&nbsp;Professional or Windows 2000 Professional
<p><b>I can click either one and the Windows boots up normally.</b></p>
<p><b>My Microsoft Word is acting up but is working.I will repair it.</b></p>
<p><b>Before I had problem with the BOOT.INI File.It would read Invalid Boot.Ini files.I think I removed the Boot.ini and now is not showing up anymore,but it shows Windows xp Professional or Windows 2000.</b></p>

<p>Thank you for replying the status. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this issue occur randomly? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue could be due to the physical wires that is connected to the monitor from CPU. You&nbsp;may double check if the physcial wires are proper.

            Hi
<div>It happens every time I start the Computer</div>
<div>
<p>Something very unusual is happening to my computer.Refuses to start and when it does sometime I receive a White window and now I receive a yellow window.While restarting the E tray&nbsp; opens.Restart again until the Tower emits a loud sound
 and a black windows tell me to ask for Support.I believe this is a window command.There are too many info that I don't have the time to read all.Then I have a black window that ask me to choose between a windows Professional and a windows 2000.My windows is
 windows XP home edition.After the desktop is loaded, sometime the computer hangs and I have to start all over again.All the wire are connected and secure.The only thing that I believe is not normal is the ON-OFF Switch.The computer turn on even if I don't
 fully depress the switch.I own this computer for 7 years and never I did experience anything like this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your help</p>

            Please start the Windows Explorer and go to the folder C:\Windows\Minidump. Next, copy the dmp files to your desktop, zip all dmp into 1 zip file and upload the zip file to your Skydrive [1] and post a link here, so that I can look at the dumps with the
 debugger and to to see the cause of the crash.<br />

            Hi Kataria ... if you do not have the option for 5ghz then i would recommend to reinstall the wifi drivers.  
<br />See link for the drivers.

            Hi Kataria
<br />
<br />The Dell Wireless 1702 is based on the Atheros AR5B195 architecture and does not support dual band (2.4GHz and 5GHz) it only supports 2.4GHz . . .
<br />
<br />You would need to upgrade (costs maybe $10.00) your WiFi card to an 802.11a or 802.11ac card

<p>Dell does not approve the N5110 for upgrading to windows 10. There are no win 10 drivers for that model so you are stuck with MS generic drivers that might or might not work. Many users have reported problems with windows 10 on that model. Dell recommends
 reinstalling your previous operating system. Don't waste money on upgrading any hardware on this old model. The best solution IMO is to buy a new computer.</p>

<h2>            Playing Xbox 360E on a PC Monitor while using headphones, is this possible&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, everyone. New Xbox owner here. ;-)</p>
<p>Here's my problem. I've discovered that I can't really play my Xbox 360 on my standard definition television. My old games from two generations ago look alright, but Xbox 360 games are unplayable. Yeah, I could just go get an HDTV for 100+ dollars. But I
 pretty much exhausted my budget with the xbox itself.</p>
<p>Here's the solution I'm considering:</p>
<p>Using an HDMI to DVI cable, I'll use my PC monitor to display the xbox's video output.</p>
<p>For audio, I'll plug my stereo headphones in the Xbox's 3.5mm analog port.</p>
<p>Would this combination work, though? Can headphones be used with the analog port while the xbox displays through HDMI?</p>

<p>You'd need a headphone amp or a pair of computer speakers with a headphone output between the AV output and the headphones. Connecting them straight to a line level output like the AV output on the Xbox 360 would not only lose the ability to control volume
 and be extremely loud, but could kill the headphones.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I'm a bit unsure of how they've set up the AV output though. Given that it's a four-pole type to also output composite video, it might not be wired to be used for audio only (though it should be).</p>

<p>The factory restore process does return Windows to the state it was in when you bought it. Depending on the manufacturer, all partitions will be erased or only partition C:. You need to read the manual that came with your laptop to see how to start the recovery
 process. I you cannot locate the manual the you will find one on-line at the manufacturer's site.</p>
<p>You do not need to buy another copy of Windows but you <strong>must</strong> back up your data, inlcuding your EMail files. When finished, you<strong>must</strong> load a virus scanner. This one is free: Microsoft Security Essentials - http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Calendar not syncing all icloud calendars - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jennyslr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Calendar not syncing all icloud calendars</h2>
                    <p>My iCloud calendars used to show up in the Calendar app, but now only one does. I have a few icloud calendars, one of which is a shared calendar with my partner and until last week all calendars were visible in the Calendar app on my desktop, but now only
 one is, not the shared calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried deleting and re-adding the account. Updating windows. Restarting my computer etc. If I add an event to the shared calendar on the desktop it shows up for a second then vanishes, but is in the calendar on my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't seem to get this sorted and it's really frustrating!</p>

            Hi there,
<br />
<br />My name is Ryan, I am an independent advisor here.
<br />
<br />I would suggest installing ICloud for Windows to manage this, as it makes it easy to sync your calendars with Outlook.

<p>Thanks for your help, I and others are experiencing this at the moment and it seems to be after the recent update. Everything worked fine until then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled icloud for windows and signed in and out of accounts etc. but to no avail. I also went through the rigmarole of re-sharing all my icloud calendars which worked ok for a day, then failed later with no calendars data showing, deleting account
 in win 10 calendar app and renewing the account ( with app password) showed only one account again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A great deal of advice is about icloud for windows and outlook from the office suite, but icloud for windows only offers access to icloud drive photos and bookmarks as far as I can see.</p>
<p>

<p>Ryan, you're on the wrong track. We're talking about the Windows 10 Calendar app which doesn't rely on iCloud for windows for syncing calendars.&nbsp; I also had everything working perfectly but it now doesn't work anymore.&nbsp; I was happy because the iCloud for
 Windows/Outlook combo has always been unstable and this was working perfectly but it doesn't anymore!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10, you broke something on a recent update, please fix it!</p>

<p>Some Windows Update seems to have broken this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>iCloud events are not showing up anymore in the Windows 10 calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the connection is working because when you create a new appointment the events might show up (at least for a while) AND the new appointment is visible in the iPhone calendar app.</p>

            It worked fine for years, and someone in MS broke it in the newest update. It should not be hard to fix.

<p><span>I accidentally erased My Documents Folder under Libraries&gt;Documents&gt;My Documents. The next folder under Documents is Public Documents. I have tried to insert My Documents into
 the Documents folder but it keeps going into Public Documents. It changes all my program structure that goes:</span></p>
<p><span>\user\documents\my documents...etc. Now it goes:
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">users\Public\Public Documents\My documents</span>...Can you, please, tell me how I can fix that?</span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Hi gersito,</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Let's first&nbsp;delete the Public documents folder in the&nbsp;Library&nbsp;and then try to add the My Documents Folder back in the Library.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click on Start, select the Username (that is your personal folder)</span></p>
<p><span>b. Now you will see the My Documents folder.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Right click on it and select ‘Include in Library’.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this should help you get back My Documents Folder.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, try System Restore.</span></p>
<p><span>Before you start System Restore, save any open files and close all programs. Once you confirm your restore point, System Restore restarts your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>To open System Restore, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Open System Restore by clicking the Start button . In the search box, type System Restore, and then, in the list of results, click System Restore.‍
</span></p>
<p><span>b. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
