<p>LogMeIn is a tool that a microsoft customer support rep would use, correct? I just want to make sure I'm not being scammed or anything bad.</p>

<p>My entirely personal view is that I would have serious reservations about the relationship of your "support contact" to Microsoft.&nbsp; A quick search found me this -
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LogMeIn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LogMeIn</a>&nbsp; and I have to wonder why Microsoft personnel would use a third party software to provide support.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Anyone wanting to use LogMeIn is not from Microsoft. What's more important is how you were contacted. Microsoft wouldn't contact you about viruses or errors that your computer is supposedly sending out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the contact was through a pop-up while browsing, a phone call or an email, it's not genuine. It's a scam attempt.</p>

<p>I was the one who contacted Microsoft in the first place. I went through their support site and was connected to one of their representatives. Then they used LogMeIn to help fix my issue. It seems like this is something they do,</p>

    <title>Final Fantasy XV Windows Edition game hub is showing up under Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rob&#39;s xboxonex  say:</h3>
<h2>            Final Fantasy XV Windows Edition game hub is showing up under Xbox One X Console from royal edition disc game</h2>
                    <p>their seems to be a bug on my Xbox one system, where my copy of Final Fantasy XV Royal Edition (Xbox one Physical Disc)&nbsp; is loading the game hub for Windows Edition, instead of Xbox Edition for its game hub to add to home page, this problem has existed for
 month still on new xbox one x, if theirs going to be a fix, I guess it will be a few more months before a patch fixes this error, also I reported it to the makers of this games website a few weeks ago, just wanted to update it with that info. bug effect both
 Day one edition and Royal edition, just updating my old posts to include new info a bit, anyway this game has not been updated since 2018 I think, so I don't think that add to home feature for this one game is being worked on as a fix, since again it launches
 fine, and plays fine, its only its game hub that loading the wrong info, all other xbox one console games are loading the correct add to home features, so ya , maybe it will be a few years until add to home is no longer used for games, we just have to wait
 and see, since I don't think the game will see a fix, no reset and keep games and apps doesn't fix it, also my xbox one x is updated fully since march of 2019, so its not an OS version bug, either an bug with just this one game and my xbox one x console account
 bug, or its not related to either not really sure what caused it, I just noticed it happened around the same time that windows edition was released in the Microsoft store in my windows 10 system. that's when the add to home was broken for just this one video
 game, all the rest of my xbox one games still work correctly, and I did try and reinstall the game from royal edition and removed day one edition, and applied that 39GB sized update again, all of royal edition addons install fine, so again I don't think its
 a bug on my end but some how online something went wrong with this games data info disc game version still but sync save files online so maybe or something like that, also my save for this game synced fine, which I am on a new game+ mode since I did beat this
 game already to its end.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Automatic repair loop. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pcserverdude  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Automatic repair loop.</h2>
                    This infinite loop just started happening to me today after about 2 months of using Windows 10, I had to do a whole reset of my computer, and completely clean it out, thinking this would work, I restarted my PC again, thinking the problem was fixed, but
 it simply was doing the same thing, right now I just wiped my PC again, and until I find a fix, I can't and won't turn off my PC, if anyone knows any ways or tutorials of fixing this problem It would be much appreciated.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 is much appreciated.　</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the below methods and check if that helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><span><span>Try to boot into <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong> and perform the Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p>Press and hold the <strong>shift key </strong>while clicking on <strong>Restart
</strong>at the login Screen (Bottom right corner).</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><li><span>1. Select <strong>T</strong></span><strong><span><span>roubleshoot</span></span></strong><span><span>and click on
</span></span><strong><span><span>Advanced Options</span></span></strong><span><span>.</span></span>
<p><span><span>2. Select </span></span><strong><span><span>Startup Settings</span></span></strong><span><span>and click on
</span></span><strong><span><span>Restart</span></span></strong><span><span>.</span></span>
</p>
<p><span><span>3. After restarting, choose </span></span><strong><span><span>Enable Safe mode</span></span><span><span>with networking</span></span></strong><span><span>.</span></span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<span><span>
</span></span></p><p>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode, then perform a Clean Boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as Clean Boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>Put the computer in Clean Boot and check if it helps.</p>
<p>By setting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />

<p><strong>Note:</strong> After Clean Boot troubleshooting step, refer to "<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with Clean Boot</strong>" from the article.</p>
<p>

<p>Once the Windows Setup window appears, follow these steps:</p>
<p>c) Click <strong>Next </strong>and select <strong>Repair your computer</strong>.
</p>
<p>d) You will then see a blue screen and an option to choose. Choose the option <strong>
Troubleshoot</strong> and select <strong>Advanced options</strong>.</p>
<p>e) You may choose <strong>Startup Repair</strong> from Advanced boot option. </p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 7 suddenly not genuine, KB971033 Error Mistake, uninstalled but still not genuine&#63;</h2>
                    So apparently I've hit the KB971033 update error that Microsoft accidentally pushed out back in January, but decided to affect my computer now in April. Read online to quickly just uninstall 1033 update from the installed updates window in Windows 7. Did
 it, right click uninstall, saw it was uninstalled, rebooted, but Windows still claims it's non-genuine despite KB971033 not showing up anywhere as installed anymore.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I DID read the official Microsoft solution to this and apparently, I have to go through some CMD commands first instead of just simple "uninstall"ing the easy way.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
SO my question is, if I already uninstalled 1033 the easy way, how to I go about making Windows freaking genuine? Reinstall KB971033 again, then uninstall it the CMD recommended way? Or just proceed with the CMD method anyways despite 1033 not being present
 anymore? Thanks.

            Wow, so I was able to get windows activation window to act properly where it prompts me for a key without disappearing randomly. However, not it's telling me my product key I've used for over 3 years "has been blocked by Microsoft". People online theorize
 this happens because my PC tries to activate my current key 4 times a month or something which triggers Microsoft to think it's illegitimate or something.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When running Magical Jelly Bean to compare the actual key against the one I have all I get is BBBBB-BBBBB-BBBBB-BBBBB-BBBBB, which people also say is a "volume licnese"? How did my product key magically go to a volume license from a legit three-year old key??

                    <p>Hi, i have added 2 accounts for my children on 3 pcs that we have. My oldest son can browse the internet and download from store exactly as it was setup to. Nevertheless the second account for my youngest son cannot access the internet and on one of the
 pcs (our gaming pc) it pushes the processor to over 50% (Family safety monitor process). Nothing is blocked on his account and there is nothing that i can change. I removed the account and re created it but nothing changed. The account is verified.
</p>

            <p>Thanks for replying. The link you've sent me was not so useful because I've already read all of that when I was setting up the family accounts.
</p>
<p>What type of information you would like to give you?&nbsp;Below are screen captures from the specific child account that cannot access the internet.</p>
<p>As you can see below there is nothing blocked except adult content and in private browsing. Also there are several attempts to go on the web--google which is the defined home page for the child. The account cannot search or visit anything on the web. (used
 Edge, Ms Explorer 11, Google Chrome and tried from 3 Pcs.)</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have just installed the windows 10 upgrade to windows 7, and then&nbsp;also installed windows essentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have imported my contacts from my windows xp computer via the wab file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a lot of duplicates so I have clicked "clean up contacts".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, every time I try this, a window pops up saying my username or password for my Microsoft account is wrong, and the "clean up contacts" process never begins. I can assure you, neither my username or password is incorrect. Indeed if I hover over the
 account button, it states quite clearly that I am signed in.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello jFiredog,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. Sadly it has not helped at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Visit your <a href="https://people.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em>Clean up contacts</em> option on the <em>Manage</em> menu to clean up.<br />
<br />
I logged in to people page. I clicked clean up. It suggested some duplicates. I clicked OK (or whatever it said) and the browser froze.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Back in Windows Live Mail, click the 'account button' and select <em>Sign out of Windows Live Mail</em>. Wait a few moments for the default contacts list to load (it may be empty), then click the same button again and
<em>Sign in</em>. This time, clear the password box, then re-enter the password you just used successfully at people.live.com. The updated list should now download. Does it?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I signed out OK. I signed in OK, clearing the password box. I clicked "clean up", and just as before a popup window stated that my username / password was wrong and no action occurred. Looking at the contacts list, it is now even worse. Most entries are triplicated.</li></ul>

<p>The browser? Or did the page just stop responding? You'll probably find that the function worked nonetheless - did you check by returning to the People page? You might find it a bit more reliable if you use Internet Explorer's InPrivate mode.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>

<p>... and waited for the updated list to download, I hope. Was there any improvement?</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I clicked "clean up" ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? That option is only a re-direct to the People page where you were earlier, but because it was hard-coded many years ago, it can't be relied upon, especially if your browser has stored a cookie for a different account. That's why it might help to use
 InPrivate, because there are no cookies to confuse the issue then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you seeing discrepancies between the contacts list you see on the People page and in Windows Live Mail? Could it be that some of the duplicates you're seeing in fact come from some other source, like Yahoo or Facebook or Google? In the Windows Live Mail
 contacts window, select <em>View as &gt; List</em> and click on <em>Preview </em>to disable it. You can now right-click on column headings to add, change and remove columns. Arrange to see at least
<em>Name</em>, <em>Personal email address </em>and <em>From</em>. Windows Live contacts will have
<em>Address book</em> in the <em>From</em> field. Any other entry comes from somewhere else, which may not be readily identifiable in that list. The source will be given on the People page, however.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The browser? Or did the page just stop responding?</span> I'm not sure, I only had the one tab open. It got stuck showing a message "saving". Everything else was greyed out. After 10 minutes I closed the browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">You'll probably find that the function worked nonetheless - did you check by returning to the People page?</span> It didn't appear to. All the triplicates were still there. HOWEVER, they had derived from a file import
 of my winxp wab file. I don't think they existed on my people contacts list at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">You might find it a bit more reliable if you use Internet Explorer's InPrivate mode.</span> Didn't know about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">... and waited for the updated list to download, I hope. Was there any improvement?</span> Not that I could see.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Why? That option is only a re-direct to the People page where you were earlier, but because it was hard-coded many years ago, it can't be relied upon, especially if your browser has stored a cookie for a different

</span>Because this was the action that originally prompted the "wrong username or password" message &amp; I wanted to see if it had cleared. I didn't know the button caused a redirect. I thought it generated an internal process.
<strong>Would clearing cookies from IE help? </strong>Also, I assumed this function would tidy up my whole contacts list - not just the "people" part of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Are you seeing discrepancies between the contacts list you see on the People page and in Windows Live Mail? Could it be that some of the duplicates you're seeing in fact come from some other source, like Yahoo or Facebook
 or Google?</span> Oh yes, I certainly am. I was unaware of this feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">In the Windows Live Mail contacts window, select
<em>View as &gt; List</em> and click on <em>Preview </em>to disable it. You can now right-click on column headings to add, change and remove columns. Arrange to see at least
<em>Name</em>, <em>Personal email address </em>and <em>From</em>. Windows Live contacts will have
<em>Address book</em> in the <em>From</em> field. Any other entry comes from somewhere else, which may not be readily identifiable in that list. The source will be given on the People page, however
</span>Not sure how to respond here. There is a truly horrible lack of pattern between what I see in this view and what I see on the people page. Some entries are in one but not the other and vice versa. Some in both. Some are triplicated in one but not the
 other. Almost all say "address book" in the WLM view, whilst the others are blank in the from column. Many, but not all, are listed in the people view, generally as "outlook" or "gmail".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have learnt a lot from this, but sadly do not have a clear idea of how to sort it out. There are around 300 or so entries in each of the various lists we have discussed. I guess they all need to be put in one place so they can be edited, but I'm not sure
 where the best place would be. Before I got this windows 10 computer, most of my contacts were in my winxp outlook express address book file (wab). My more important ones were copied to my gmail account so that I can use them on my android tablet. I guess
 many are now on microsoft's people database as well. But hey, what a shambles!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any quick advice?</p>

<p>Hey there Deadly ! Sorry to hear you are having these frustrating freezing issues. Please give this a try:</p>
<p>Move your console</p>
<p>It's important to keep your console in a cool, dry, well-ventilated area.</p>
<p>1. Turn off the console.</p>
<p>2. Move the console to an open, well-ventilated area, away from all other electronic devices.</p>
<p>Tips for positioning your console</p>
<p>Do not put your console in an enclosed space. Put the console in an open area with lots of ventilation.</p>
<p>Do not stack electronic devices on top of or below your console. Make sure the console and its power supply are on a hard surface.</p>
<p>Do not put your console on something soft (like a bed, sofa or rug).</p>
<p>Keep the console away from heat sources, such as ventilation openings on televisions and electronic devices. Also, keep the console away from heating vents and direct sunlight.
</p>
<p>3. Turn on the console.</p>
<p>Good luck hope this helps!</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Mica</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error that you’ve encountered is most likely caused by a corrupted system file. Since you’ve already performed the command
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and provided you the same result, you can use also use the
<strong>DISM </strong>tool command. This tool can repair possible corruptions with Windows system files. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>Command Prompt</strong> in the <strong>Search </strong>box, right-click on the result and select
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</li><li>Type these command and press <strong>Enter</strong>. Wait for it to process and then proceed with the next command:<br />
<br />
<strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth</strong>, press <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
<strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /checkhealth</strong>, press <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
<strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong>, press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We’ll wait for your update after trying the steps.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Again you're asking about Seagate software in a MS software forum, so you're asking in the wrong place.&nbsp; If I remember (it's been a good while) all that program does is install an interface to their utilities.&nbsp; But you really need to ask Seagate.&nbsp; You wouldn't
 ask Ford about a Chevy part would you?</p>

<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

<h2>            Trying to connect laptop to tv via hdmi</h2>
                    I have an HP Probook and a Panasonic Viera tv. I have recently purchased an hdmi lead to allow me to watch movies on laptop on tv. I have tried different hdmi ports on the tv, rebooting laptop, etc. When I go in to change screen resolution and press "detect"
 I just get the laptop info and nothing about the tv. Pressing F4 does nothing. Don't really know where to go from here, as I can watch the movies on the laptop no problem.<br />
Please help<br />

The graphics card is "standard vga graphics adapter" how do I go about updating this.<br />

when I plug the lead into the laptop on tv, I get nothing at all on the tv, just a blank black screen, and the laptop is normal, nothing changes.<br />

            Have looked at that and it just says the Standard VGA graphics adapter. At the bottom of the screen where the Direct X options are, they are all saying Not Available.<br />
Does this mean that there is no graphic card installed and I need to buy one?<br />

    <title>How can I use Samsung wifi&#47;bluetooth speakers with windows 8&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom_dc  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I use Samsung wifi&#47;bluetooth speakers with windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    I have Samsung Da-E670 wi-fi/bluetooth speakers and an ACER Aspire V5 laptop.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Originally I had the speakers automatically connected through bluetooth and everything was wonderful and incredibly easy. But as a result of a Windows Update (sometime this month - June 2013) that was no longer capable (WTH?). &nbsp;I can still connect through
 bluetooth - but I now have to go through a few different windows, and manually "connect" to the speakers each time. When I play music it only works for about 45 seconds then the sound completely stops. The device is still green/connected in the Bluetooth settings
 screen, but no sound.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I gave up and connected the speakers to my wireless network - successfully. I can go to the devices internal webpage and can see it listed in my network devices.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, I have no idea how to get my laptop's sound to actually go to the speakers. From the network screen I "added device" and the computer found the speakers, installed software (drivers?). I still have no idea how to USE my speakers. I don't see the
 speaker in device manager, or anything.&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I have resolved my problem. I suspect that either an update changed the "startup" value for Bluetooth, or I inadvertently changed the setting when trying to improve my start up time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't realize, but the drivers for the Bluetooth&nbsp;connection in my laptop&nbsp;were the generic MS drivers. I went to the Acer website and downloaded the appropriate drivers for my laptop, which fixed my performance problems.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next I had to go to Task Manager&nbsp; (ctrl+alt+del&nbsp; &gt;&gt; Task Manager) and opened the "Start Up" folder, and enabled the
<strong>BTPreLoad</strong> tool. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now when I boot up my laptop automatically connects to the Bluetooth speakers when in range, and my performance is better.

    <title>Massive FPS Drop in Video Games for strange unknown reason. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> juggersugerguper  say:</h3>
<h2>            Massive FPS Drop in Video Games for strange unknown reason.</h2>
                    <p>Alright, I tried contacting live agents, they were trying to help me, but their methods were different, but didn't work, anyones, this issue broke out in January 20, around 12 PM after I came back from college, I started to play my favorite video game, then,
 suddenly, I was away from computer, and I see this 1/4 black screen, I come back, and try to launch the game, but it shows that I have 10 FPS! what the ****, I used to have 60 FPS before the issue, anyways, I used malwarebytes, only found 2 threats, and deleted,
 but it wasn't the case for the fix, unfortunately, I used Driver Booster 3 Pro, I updated as many drivers as possible, but it still didn't fix my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please, I want a fix to this, i'm tired, this problem is extremely annoying, now I cannot stream. Please help, end my PC's suffering. It's soo annoying, I'd rather have Microsoft Engineer respond. Keep in mind that for some strange reason, I do not have
 Recovery files, so i'm very unlucky to recovery my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways the OS is Windows 8.1, made from HP.</p>
<p><br />
And please be advanced and go easy on me, i'm not good at english.</p>

    <title>Credit Card Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> austerberry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Credit Card Problems</h2>
                    
<p>I currently am on Xbox Live Gold but can no longer connect to Xbox Live via my main account due to an invalid credit card. I am curious when I re-enter it for update information that the message "This credit card is not valid" appears. This card is perfectly
 fine, has sufficient funds to pay for the monthly subscription and nothing interms of credit checks or problems with the card is known. I can currently use it on any paypal or any other way to access it's money.</p>
<p>Now while trying to enter a second debit card so to temporarily restore my Xbox Live (as currently it doesn't register even a silver account) and this was also declined because the credit card number was incorrect. Now I retried this and triple checked upon
 entering the card number to the point where I am positive that there are no error's in account or card information.</p>
<p>I want to be able to access Xbox Live Silver account atleast but it keeps denying credit cards which allow me to do this, even a setup paypal account linked into the card without change to credit card information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help anyone, I'd like to be able to access Xbox Live, if not gold, then atleast silver so I can purchase some DLC for some games.</p>

<p>1. What kind of&nbsp;network are you referring to? Are you referring to Domain network or sharing files through Homegroup?</p>
<p>2. Have you tried&nbsp;the device to&nbsp;add to the network? Do you get any error message?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You are describing 2 problems here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it is just the task bar in the wrong place and all the desktop icons are correctly orientated with the text underneath the icons then&nbsp;just click and hold approximately in the middle of the taskbar itself and drag away from the right and down to the bottom
 of the screen and let go. The taskbar should jump down to its normal place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the icons themselves are rotated then the screen has been rotated to portrait mode. This is a function of the graphics chip based on&nbsp;shortcut keys. It varies by chipset but the most common is the&nbsp;Intel set which uses Ctrl+Alt+Arrow key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to the extra width of a wide screen I actually run my taskbar vertically to make use of the extra space</p>

Almost certainly you accidentally pressed Ctrl-Alt, and<br />some arrow key.</p><p>Rotate it back using those keys.</p>

<p>I found that I should change the owner, but I can't do that. It gives the message "Unable to set new owner on &lt;"filename&gt;". I am administrator on that computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried to rename the file, but that also results in the same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried to create a new file with the same name and copy that to the original. But when I used the word "emule" in it, I get the same error. I named the file "emul", and it worked. But when I renamed it to "emule", the same error.</p>
<p>I have the same issue for a file containing the word "limewire".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not about these programms, because I don't use them. But these are normal Word-documents about these programms.</p>

            <p>Look online for a freeware program called Lockhunter.&nbsp; Lockhunter will delete just about any file or directory regardless of permissions.&nbsp; Of course, be careful what you delete (grin).<br />

            <p>Thanks for the tip, but unfortunately it didn't work.</p>
<p>The tool said that it's not locked by another process, but it can't delete it anyway.</p>
<p>I also ran the virus scanner, and my computer is not infected.</p>
<p>It's a computer from my work, so it could be that applications as Emule and Limewire are blocked somehow. Could it be that this blocking also applies to files with these words in the name?</p>
<p>That should explain why I can rename it to "emul" but not to "emule".</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I see that this is blocked? And how can I remove them anyway?</p>

            <p>OK.&nbsp; For the moment, I'm going to assume your computer came with a drive that can burn CDs (and possibly DVDs).&nbsp; If so, download the following "Linux" utility from my site (PartedMagic.iso), burn it to a CD, and leave the CD in your drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://novelhost.net/PartedMagic.iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Parted Magic</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The next step depends on whether or not your BIOS is set up to boot from a CD first (if one is present in the drive).&nbsp; If it is, then reboot.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, reboot ... but be sure to press the F2 key quickly (and repeatedly) so it will take you to the BIOS utility instead of rebooting Windows.&nbsp; Note that it's "usually" F2 but, with your machine, it could be something different.&nbsp; In the BIOS menu, reset
 your BIOS "boot order" scenario to look for a boot CD first.&nbsp; Then, save your settings and restart your system.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Parted Magic puts nothing on your hard drive (it works in ROM only).&nbsp; When the Parted Magic GUI screen finally comes up, you'll see an icon in the upper-left part of the screen.&nbsp; It's the File Manager icon.&nbsp; Double-click on it, choose the drive that looks
 like your hard drive, and go the the directory where the offending file is located.&nbsp; Linux has no respect for Microsoft permission scenarios (grin).&nbsp; Right-click on the filename and choose "Delete" from the dropdown menu.&nbsp; It absolutely WILL delete it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On second thought, since this is a computer "from work," not your own "personal" computer, check with your boss before you do anything.&nbsp; The file might be there for a reason.</p>

            1. Runtime components of Visual C++ Libraries are missing.
<div>2. Software problem. </div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong> If the issue is caused by #1, you can reinstall the Runtime components of Visual C++ Libraries to resolve the problem.</div>
<div><br />
If you are using 32 bit Operating System, use the following link to download Visual C++ Package.<br />
<strong>Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x86): <br />
</strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=29</a></div>
<div><br />
If you are using 64 bit Operating System, use the following link to download Visual C++ Package.<br />
<strong>Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x64): <br />
</strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=15336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=15336</a></div>
<div>If the issue still persists after installing above package, the issue should be a software problem. I suggest you to perform a clean boot check whether it is a software conflict issue. If not, it is still recommended to address the problem with manufacturer
 support</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2: </strong>Boot your system in clean boot mode. Check if you face the similar issue in that mode as well.<br />
Try following the KB article to perform Clean Boot.<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista and Windows 7:</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>After you used the clean boot to resolve your problem follow Step 7 to reset the computer to start as usual.<br />
<div>----------------</div>
<div><strong>Windows Update issues:</strong></div>
<div>
<p>You can reset Windows Update components by running the Fixit on this page. But, if there's malware present, it will continue to reset the connection to the update servers:</p>

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</a></p>
<p>Suggest you download and save the Fixit. Then configure the system to Clean boot prior to running it:</p>

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>Once the Fixit has been downloaded and the system booted to the Clean state, check to see that the native Windows firewall is now On if a 3rd party firewall was being used previously. Now run the Fixit and choose the Default mode. Restart once it's done
 and see if the system can connect to the update servers. If it can not, then run the Fixit again and choose the Aggressive mode. Restart when it's finished running and check for updates.</p>
<p>I suggest before shutting down and installing any updates, disconnect from the Internet first.</p>

    <title>3D Builder for use in an educational environment - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            3D Builder for use in an educational environment</h2>
                    The EULA for 3D builder indicates there is no provision for educational use in a virtual environment and that each student would be required to their own copy of 3D builder installed on their own system.&nbsp; Because 3D builder is a free app, is it possible
 to install 3D builder in a university controlled virtual computer lab without violating the EULA?
