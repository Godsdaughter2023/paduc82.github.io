            I'm having the same problem with Nokia MM.<br />
<br />
Fresh install of XP SP2 and PC Suite 6.8.21.<br />
<br />
Tried converting MP3s to 48kbps M4A. The sound is tinny and distorted. This is true on the playing on the PC and on the phone.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like you are trying to open an incomplete downloaded file. Either way, the file needs to be deleted and downloaded again.</p>
<p>Where are you downloading the file? Use the following thread for links to the Office 2011 download if different:</p>

</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having the same problems on my ASUS laptop, and none of these solutions have fixed the problem. I had Office 2007, but then switched to 2016 using my University's access and now the Solver Add-in crashes Excel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see any available updates, I've done the quick repair and online repair, and I have yet to find a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Lan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better understand the issue, I need to confirm if you click Ok, then the issue occurs as below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eea56eb1-08ab-439f-9db8-1c05a36b1db9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eea56eb1-08ab-439f-9db8-1c05a36b1db9" /></a></p>
<p>If not, please provide the screenshot about “enable the Solver Add-in”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, please provide the detailed version of Office. You can refer to the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Open Excel&gt;select File.</p>
<p>2. Click Account.</p>
<p>3. You can find the detailed version under Product information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>The equation tools tab does not appear when I add an equation to a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> datrinko  say:</h3>
<h2>            The equation tools tab does not appear when I add an equation to a document.  Where is the tab supposed to appear&#63;</h2>
                    I open a new document in Word 2011.&nbsp; I use the math pull down menu to insert either a new equation or a prebuilt one.&nbsp; In neither case can I find the Equation Tools tab anywhere.&nbsp; I may just be missing it so if you could tell me where it is supposed to
 show up it would be helpful.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
There is no equation tools tab in the ribbon and there doesn't seem to be a new top level menu item or anything in the home or layout tabs in the ribbon.&nbsp; Also the equation itself doesn't have any box surrounding it as i've seen in some screen shots. Right
 clicking on the equation does give me a pop up menu with the long or professional option.
<br />
<br />
Word recognizes the equation in that it will reformat it if i use the professional option and the right font is being used.&nbsp; But I can't find the Equation Tools tab!<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm running Mac OS X 10.6.8 and Word 14.1.2<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!<br />

<h2>            allowing images in an email</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>I have been looking online for a solution and I haven't found one yet.
</span></p>
<p><span>We are using Office 365, and we send out a newsletter every week to staff and the newsletter contains images.</span></p>
<p>When staff open the newsletter the images are block and they have to&nbsp;allow them every time. Most staff are using OWA and the message
<span>that is displayed is:<span> "To help protect your privacy, some content in this message has been blocked. If you're sure this message is from a trusted sender and you want to re-enable the blocked
<span>that is displayed is:<span> "To help protect your privacy, some content in this message has been blocked. If you're sure this message is from a trusted sender and you want to re-enable the blocked

<p><span><span>Is there a way using the admin exchange in O365&nbsp;to allow either a domain or an IP range to allow images to come through at a global level</span></span><span><span>?<br />

<p>hello alex,</p>
<p>i see what you mean and yes it will be cool if there is a setting like that. however, here's what i have found.</p>
<p>i sent an email with image. it blocked it and i have to use the "click here" button to view it.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=3ff2a8e5-8faa-433c-b048-32ef3db352fc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d3ff2a8e5-8faa-433c-b048-32ef3db352fc" /></a></p>
<p>i tried adding that user email address to safe senders list in owa. and it worked, it didn't show up.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=c79378f8-16b4-4a38-a100-401608671d2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dc79378f8-16b4-4a38-a100-401608671d2d" /></a></p>
<p>how to add to safe senders. here's the screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=b95b3927-a88a-4653-9033-7792c60b7fe6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3db95b3927-a88a-4653-9033-7792c60b7fe6" /></a></p>
<p>once i removed the email from safe senders list, it switched back to doing the same "click here" thing...</p>
<p>i tried adding the email address to "allow list" in spam filter policy. it did not work. so this is what we have so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Sathish,</p>
<p>Thank you for this, however I would like to apply this at a global level (in the exchange centre) for everybody rather than all users having to do this individually. Is that possible?

<p>hi alex,</p>
<p>as far as i searched, it can't be done on the exchange admin centre.</p>
<p>but it can be done via power shell. i tried it and its working fine.</p>
<p>firstly to test this on one user, try these commands,</p>
<p><strong>power shell login:</strong></p>
<p>$livecred = get-credential<br />
connect-msolservice –credential $livecred<br />
$session = new-pssession -configurationname microsoft.exchange -connectionuri <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/-credential" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
outlook.office365.com/.../-credential</a> $livecred -authentication basic –allowredirection<br />
import-pssession $session</p>
<p><strong>to add the safe senders:</strong></p>
<p>set-mailboxjunkemailconfiguration -identity *** Email address is removed for privacy *** -trustedsendersanddomains "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***","*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"</p>
<p>after running this command, you will see that the emails were added as trusted senders in the below location. once verified, please see the attached document to add list of email addresses as safe senders to all the users in the organization.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a74098a2-780d-4cc2-a4f9-8ff21e7659c7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3da74098a2-780d-4cc2-a4f9-8ff21e7659c7" /></a></p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>The answer is no, we cannot apply this in the Exchange Admin Center (EAC) for everybody. I have run a test, I added the sender in to the Allow list of the spam filter under protection in the EAC, but the message “To help protect your privacy, some content
 in this message has been blocked. To re-enable the blocked features, click here” still comes up.</p>
<p>If you have this kind of request, it's recommended you submit <a href="http://office365.uservoice.com/forums/299916-office-365-service-updates-and-changes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Alex,</p>
<p>As far as I searched there is no option to achieve that in Exchange Admin Centre.
</p>
<p>But there is a work around using power shell. If you are interested in the below work around, let me know and we can set it up.
</p>
<p>Work around: TESTED and working.</p>
<p>1. Add the list of email addresses to a CSV file</p>
<p>2. Using powershell, Add the email addresses from the CSV file as SAFE SENDERS to All the users in the organization.</p>
<p>Another work around: NOT TESTED yet, just an idea.</p>
<p>1. Add the users to contacts in the organization (EAC)</p>
<p>2. Create a security. group and add the contacts as members</p>
<p>3. Add this security group as safe sender to all the users in the organization.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Alex, </p>
<p>Adding/Allowing sender's IP addresses or ranges is domain-wide or organization level. It happens on the Connection Filter.</p>
<p>For end users, we have to use either sender's email or sender's domain.</p>
<p>Even trying to add IP ranges to Domain-wide does not guarantee the solution we seek.
</p>
<p>Because, IP filtering blocks the entire email or connection from those IP ranges. It does not block content from emails. So logically I don't think allowing IP ranges will work for our requirement.</p>
<p>But you can give a try. but adding only one sender's IP address to connection filter in EAC and check.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            How can I change the Load Behavior of a COM Add-In to Load at Startup&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been using the Team Foundation Add-in for Excel 2013 since day 1, and it's worked perfectly. I had some problems recently--I can't remember if Excel crashed or I didn't have connectivity to the TFS server or what--and I lost the TEAM tab. I found that
 this was because the Team Foundation Add-in was unloaded. If I start it back up (Options &gt; Add-Ins &gt; Manage: COM Add-Ins &gt; Go... &gt; check box) it works okay, but I have to manually load the add-in each time I open Excel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In looking at the other add-ins, I see some of them have <em>Load Behavior: Load at Startup</em>. I can't for the life of me figure out how to change the Load Behavior for the Team Foundation Add-In, though!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I change the Load Behavior of the Team Foundation Add-in to Load at Startup?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Fixed it! Here's what I did. Some of these steps may not be necessary. Note that I have 32-bit Office 2013 on my 64-bit machine with Visual Studio 2012.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Started Office as Administrator&nbsp;(Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office15\EXCEL.EXE)</li><li>Opened COM Add-Ins and deleted three entries for Team Foundation Add-in</li><li>Re-added the add-in (C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Team Foundation Server\11.0\x86\TFSOfficeAdd-in.dll)</li></ul>
<p>Once I re-added the add-in, its Load Behavior was correctly showing as Load at Startup. I closed Excel and re-launched from the usual, non-administrator start menu shortcut, and the add-in was correctly loaded.</p>

    <title>Right-to-Left Language Texts Disappear in .pdf Conversion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james david audlin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Right-to-Left Language Texts Disappear in .pdf Conversion</h2>
                    <p>My publisher requires me to submit my books in pdf. I prepare my books in Word 2013. The text is mostly in English, but there are a lot of quotations in Hebrew, Aramaic, Arabic, and other right-to-left languages. When I convert to pdf, these texts disappear,
 except for one word (which seems to be the first word the conversion program encounters going left-to-right, so the program doesn't "see" the rest of the Hebrew or whatever quotations).<br />
<br />
The above problem is with the ISO 19005-1 compliant (PDF/A) switch checked. If I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
uncheck </span>it, this problem goes away, but the entire book is thrown off such that pages don't match up - this renders my Table of Contents and Indices useless.<br />
<br />
Yes, the fonts are TruType (the Hebrew font is standard Times New Roman, in fact), and yes, they are fully embedded. I've tried doing a test, using a file in Word consisting of a single paragraph in English with some Hebrew text within the paragraph - most
 of the Hebrew disappears, as noted above.<br />
<br />
The problem is in Word. When Word (or anything else, because as noted I've tried other conversion programs) converts the Word files into .pdf, it keeps going left-to-right, so it takes the first word it finds in Aramaic (or Hebrew, etc.), and doesn't "see"
 the other words. If I convert the Aramaic phrase into right-to-left, that makes the ENTIRE PARAGRAPH right-to-left, even though most of the paragraph is in English; i.e., it is not fit for book printing. So I have to keep the Aramaic tagged as left-to-right
 or the English paragraph turns to hash. Again, as noted, this problem vanishes when I uncheck the PDF/A switch, but that creates a new problem, that the page lengths in the entire book get thrown off, rendering the Table of Contents and Indices totally useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've called Adobe Customer Service, and talked on line with Adobe experts. The problem is with Word, not Adobe.</p>

            <p>Greetings, Elemantal, and thank you for your concern. :-)<br />
<br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I have a file prepared that shows exactly what happens in Word and .pdf, but I do not see anywhere in this reply screen where I can upload a file. So I will copy in an example...<br />
<br />
Following is a paragraph of the original text of the work I am translating. (In the book, the original text goes on left-hand pages, and the translation on the right-hand pages.) You should be able to&nbsp;see that most of this paragraph is in Greek, which of course
 is a LTR language, but there is one sentence in Aramaic, which is a RTL language.
<br />

<p>As you can see, in the second, the Aramaic got chewed down to one word. In this example, some of the Greek (and the English word identifying the change of language) also got eaten. In most instances throughout the three books in this series of translations,
 any RTL language gets cut down to just a word. The exception is, sometimes but not always, when the quotation of the RTL language is only one or two words.<br />
<br />
The exact steps are -- I type the document in Word. I edit in word. All of the RTL texts are typed in or sometimes pasted in. All of the fonts are fully embedded. In fact, the Hebrew font is Times New Roman. I keep the switch set at LTR, because when I flip
 it to RTL, it throws the ENTIRE PARAGRAPH into right-justified with the Greek (or English or whatever) going RTL; in short, it makes a big mess.
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Once the document is properly prepared in Word, I go to "Save As" and save it as a .pdf file. That's where words and phrases in the RTL languages disappear.</p>
<p>

            P.S. As to .pdf creators.... I tried the creator in the Foxit .pdf package. I tried several .pdf creators online and through freeware downloads. I can't try the Adobe one because that costs money I don't have. Every single one of the several programs I
 tried wound up with the same results. That's why, as I say above, I think the problem is in Word.

            <p>Greetings, Mohan --</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, thank you for being so kind as to reply. I was starting to despair whether I'd even receive a reply here, let alone a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, I have tried this basic procedure you outline before in various permutations, including by the .xps approach, and they did not work. I tried your procedure nevertheless, exactly as you stated it. It did not work. Furthermore, it lost my setting of
 6"x9" page size, with the .pdf appearing as 8 1/2"x11", with the 6"x9" text in the middle, surrounded by gigantic margins.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>PLEASE PLEASE, if you have further thoughts, please let me know. My books have had to be pulled off the market as defective, the publisher has to replace sold copies (when this issue is straightened out), and I have to come up with a proper .pdf of the books
 SOON, because I'm in huge issues with the publisher. Thank you!</p>

<p>Greetings, Barkoosh, and thank you for your reply.<br />
<br />
I don't know, of course, but I suspect things are fine on your end because you don't have right-to-left languages in your sample.<br />
<br />
Here is the link to a sample in Word, which of course shows what this text SHOULD look like:<br />

<br />
And here is the link to the same sample in .pdf, which of course shows the same text with chunks of the Aramaic (right-to-left) missing:<br />

<p>Good morning, Doug Robbins --<br />

</p>
<p>I have tried, PrimoPDF too, and it gets exactly the same unfortunate results. The Primo results look identical to the second (.pdf) test page I linked above to "Barkoosh". But thanks anyway.</p>

    <title>Background Image in Custom Theming No Longer Fits - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lucinda_wa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Background Image in Custom Theming No Longer Fits</h2>
                    About a year ago I worked with our public affairs folks to get a background image for the banner piece located in the Office Admin Center &gt; Settings &gt; Organizational Profile &gt; Manage custom themes for your organization &gt; Custom Theming &gt; Select Background
 Image. It looked great when I loaded it. However, it no longer fits correctly in the place holder. The text is being cut off on the bottom. I have double checked the properties of the image and verified it is 1366 x 50 and 4.39 KB. I can resize this, but this
 was customized to fit the requirements as specified on the upload page: Image requirements: 1366 x 50 pixels or less in JPG, PNG, or GIF format, and no larger than 15 KB. The image is a JPG. This is the banner seen across the entire tenant. Any suggestions?

<p>Hi Lucinda_WA,<br />
<br />
It appears the banner's ratio of length to width (1366 : 50) doesn't fit your screen any more. We'd suggest you modify its size.</p>
<p>I've modified the picture by increasing length from both sides. Please read your PM and check if it is suitable for you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still need assistance, please share the resolutions of the screen in your organization for our reference.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Jim</p>

            <p>This is happening on two computers, both with the latest Windows 10 OS.&nbsp; I am using Outlook 2003, which I understand is no longer supported, but until recently, I had no problem with Outlook saving the "safe senders" and downloading the content once I had
 put the sender on the list.&nbsp; Now the sender is not saved once I exit Outlook. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            bitlocker recovery key</h2>
                    Over the last several updates, I have been occasionally getting the message preparing for BitLocker Recovery on start up.&nbsp; There appears to be no problems when shutting down, and when this happens even though it displays a BitLocker Key in the message
 below the field to enter it does not allow any entry.&nbsp; I simply choose Skip This Step and on the next screen Select the option to continue.&nbsp; Every thing appears to be working properly.&nbsp; This does not happen every time I start up my Surface Pro 4.

            There are 2 diff adapters--a wireless adapter and a wired one. The Ethernet one is the wired connection. That works when you plug in an ethernet cable from the broadband modem from your provider to the computer's ethernet port. The wireless connects without
 cables but you must have a wireless adapter installed in or added to the computer. You might need to update the wireless adapter drivers and check the wireless network setup in Network and Settings Center. Also check the network connections for both adapters.

    <title>Office slow with Google Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prohatk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office slow with Google Drive</h2>
                    <p>Office 2011 used to work like a breeze on my iMac late 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few months ago I made two major changes to my computer = I installed Google Drive (our company's new file server) and upgraded my OS X to 10.12. (I think I used to be on 10.9 or something)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since then Office 2011 has slowed to a crawl. It takes forever to do anything (open a file, print a file, make edits, etc...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea on how I can speed things up? I need to continue to use the Google Drive sync app, not too keen on upgrading to Office 365 due to cost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>The issue is not with Google Drive. I'm it's afraid it with the switch to 10.12. It's tuned to use&nbsp;SSD &nbsp;instead of standard Hard Drives. And if you have an old machine that uses a standard&nbsp;hard drive, you will have to get used to slow operation. If you using
 straight&nbsp;up 10.12 you would do well to upgrade to12.3. Which does speed things up some, I recently replaced my aging 17" MacBook Pro with the new 15" with 1 TB SSD and the&nbsp;OLED F-Key replacement&nbsp;strip. And both 2011 and 2016 open like greased lightning.</p>

    <title>Best Way to Remove Outlook Users and Forward New Emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulcurtin3882  say:</h3>
<h2>            Best Way to Remove Outlook Users and Forward New Emails</h2>
                    
<p>We have an employee who just left the company, this user will no longer need their email, so we'd like to set all future emails to be forwarded to another user.</p>
<p>Since we don't want to pay for the old employees email, the best solution seems to be to create this ex-employee as a distribution list and remove the license from their account. Is this right?</p>
<p>I see that if I remove and then add a license back to this user then I once again have access to all of their emails. How long does this stay? At some point are unlicensed user's emails deleted from the server?</p>

<p>hi paul,</p>
<p>i think <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj966275(v=exchg.150).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
a shared mailbox </a>is a better solution than distribution group for you.</p>
<p>you can convert a user mailbox into a shared mailbox. unlike distribution group, the shared mailbox has a valid exchange online mailbox and&nbsp;can keep the emails, contacts and calendar, but doesn’t require any exchange licenses. meanwhile, you can set up a
 forwarding rule to forward the incoming emails to other recipients in <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
exchange admin center</a>-&gt; recipients-&gt; shared-&gt; select the shared mailbox-&gt; mailbox feature-&gt; mail flow-&gt; enable forwarding.</p>
<p>to convert the user mailbox to a shared mailbox, you can run the following cmdlet after<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> connecting powershell to exchange online</a>:
<strong>set-mailbox user -type shared</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d7657fd6-9ff3-4b5e-b44d-ecbe1db7d790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd7657fd6-9ff3-4b5e-b44d-ecbe1db7d790" /></a></p>
<p><br />
then, remove the license from the user in office 365 admin center-&gt; user list-&gt; edit license.</p>
<p>if anything is unclear or you run into any problems, please let us know.</p>
<p>thanks,<br />

<p>Also, how do I select which Mailbox user I want to set to shared? There was a popup asking me to login, so I just entered my admin account info, but I don't want to set that account to shared.</p>

<p>hi paul,</p>
<p>it is required to login to powershell with your admin credential to run the cmdlet. in the cmdlet<em> set-mailbox
<strong>username</strong> -type shared</em>, you need to specify the user mailbox by replacing the user name with the valid display name or full primary address, like&nbsp;<em> set-mailbox
<strong>alexsun</strong> -type shared</em> or <em>set-mailbox <strong>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</strong> -type shared</em>.</p>
<p>to my experience, the probable cause of the error you got is your ps script policy allows only signed script.&nbsp;please try to set up the policy to unrestricted by running the following cmdlet:
<em>set-executionpolicy unrestricted</em>.</p>
<p>meanwhile, i strongly suggest you check your <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
exchange admin center </a>to see if you have the <strong>convert to shared mailbox</strong> button. if yes, you can click it to convert the user mailbox to a shared mailbox. it is much easier than using powershell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7a6728ac-a4f8-4b3f-b01f-5832041dd3cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d7a6728ac-a4f8-4b3f-b01f-5832041dd3cb" /></a></p>

    <title>Unable to switch primary Microsoft alias from Sympatico to Outlook. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donaldb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to switch primary Microsoft alias from Sympatico to Outlook.</h2>
                    <p>I didn't really get any traction on this issue when I posted it as a reply in another thread so I thought that maybe I should post it as a new question. &nbsp;I know this has come up before, but it never seems to be clearly resolved for people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really wish that a Microsoft Customer Service Rep &nbsp;or technical expert of some sort could investigate this issue. I'm sure there are a lot of people in this situation who would like to be able to change their primary alias away from Sympatico.ca, but neither
 Microsoft or Bell Canada seems to be able to solve the problem. &nbsp;I've seen numerous threads talking about this issue, but no resolution. &nbsp;The last time I asked on this forum I was told to let my Outlook.com account expire for 3 months and then try to add it
 again and that would solve the problem. &nbsp;I knew that was not really a good solution, but I did it just so I could say "I told you so". &nbsp; I sent in a service request to Microsoft about a year ago, and never received a response other than a ticket number. I've
 emailed Bell Canada about this problem as well and have received no reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try to explain again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At some point in the past, Bell Canada's internet service, Sympatico was linked to Microsoft and MSN. &nbsp;At the time, our Sympatico.ca addresses where used as our Microsoft UserID. &nbsp;Bell was using the original Hotmail.com and then Outlook.com as our online
 email client. &nbsp;This was great because we could use this account for everything Microsoft or Xbox related. &nbsp;My email, Windows login, Xbox, &nbsp;Skype, Office 365 and Windows phone all use my Sympatico.ca address as my primary alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, Bell seems to have ended the partnership with Microsoft/MSN. &nbsp;Bell has switched over to an inferior POP3 email client. &nbsp;I have no interest in using this email client so I'm trying to switch everything over to my Oulook.com account. &nbsp;But because I'm
 not allowed to switch my primary alias away from Sympatico to Outlook this is becoming quite problematic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I cancel my Sympatico account altogether, what happens to my Windows, Xbox, Groove music pass, Office 365 subscription? &nbsp;All of these accounts are set up with my Sympatico primary alias which will no longer exist. &nbsp;I don't really want to cancel that Sympatico
 account right away because I've been using that email address since 1999 and it's going to take time to switch over to Outlook.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it so hard to separate these accounts? &nbsp;Why doesn't anyone seem to understand what we are talking about? &nbsp;Please don't just point us to another thread that doesn't really apply to this situation. &nbsp;Please find a true resolution. It feels like this
 should just be an easy setting in a Microsoft Active Directory somewhere on the Microsoft or Bell end but nobody seems to be able to figure it out. &nbsp;Why?</p>

 that level. &nbsp;If you had even done a quick search on this forum on the word 'sympatico' you would have seen that this is not the first time that this issue has come up. &nbsp;But nobody every investigates or solves the problem. &nbsp;Here are a few examples below.</p>

<p>I don't really understand why this seems to be so difficult to investigate and resolve. &nbsp;I understand how customer service works, and I suspect that this problem doesn't really fit any of the scripted answers. &nbsp;I think that this needs to be bumped up to
 someone who can really investigate and give me and other people with this issue a solid resolution.</p>

            <p>I am having the same problem, and also find it very frustrating that no-one from Microsoft has taken the slightest bit of time to actually read and understand this issue that has been reported in numerous threads going back as far as 2013.&nbsp; It appears that
 the CSRs are simply scanning the question for keywords and directing everyone somewhere else.
</p>
<p>
Most of the "solutions" in the other threads point to another forum and then lock the thread.&nbsp; The other forum has similar questions that points back to this forum and thread immediately locked so no-one can post that the solution was useless.&nbsp; Not surprising,
 Juzar Ali's solution was just as useless as any of the ones in other threads.

</p><p>Microsoft, please take a few minutes to read the original post and explain how we can switch our primary alias away from a *** Email address is removed for privacy *** email account.&nbsp; We've all read the other threads/forums and they don't do anything to help us with this issue.&nbsp; We
 don't want to create a new account that loses our purchase history.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Now I'm just curious as to what would happen if I cancelled my Sympatico account with Bell Canada. &nbsp;What would happen to all of the services that I access using the Microsoft approved sympatico.ca userid? &nbsp;What happens to my Office 365, Groove Music, and
 Xbox Live subscriptions that are tied to that account. &nbsp;I know that I have an Outlook.com alias to sign in to, but if the Sympatico.ca account is the primary account I'm not really sure what would happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is so frustrating. &nbsp;You would think that with all of the money I have spent over the years on Microsoft products and services, that I could at least get someone to acknowledge the issue and maybe bump it up the ladder to someone who could help.</p>

            It looks like this issue can be extended further with little hope for a resolution. I was a happy user of couple&nbsp;Bell email accounts, which were running fine on my Nokia Windows phone. But when Bell fully &nbsp;switched to their own mail server about a month
 ago, which I guess was a final divorce from MS outlook.com, my email stopped working on the phone, but still worked on a PC running Outlook or Live Mail. I was searching for answers how to fix it for days, and even did a factory reset on&nbsp;my phone to no avail.
 Finally, after chatting with Bell tech support, and after considerable struggle and some initial BS answers, they admitted that Bell email&nbsp;(sympatico.ca or bell.net) is no longer going to work on any Windows phone. As my wife is using a Android phone and also
 has a&nbsp;Bell email address,&nbsp; which did&nbsp;continue to work after so called Bell "migration" I concluded that the only option I have&nbsp;is to change phone to Android. The Bell rep assured me that I&nbsp;c

            I'm still accessing my Sympatico.ca account on my Windows phone. &nbsp;I just changed that account to the new pophm and smtphm server settings and everything worked ok. &nbsp;I had to make sure that I was using 995 for the pop server port and 25 for the smtp server
 port. &nbsp;There are some other settings as well that are listed on the Bell mail setup web page. &nbsp;But it's been working fine. &nbsp;I hate using a pop address after using an Exchange ActiveSync account for so long. &nbsp;I'm also still accessing my Outlook.com account
 on my Windows phone, which unfortunately still lists my Sympatico.ca account as the primary.

            <p>I see that you have already had several people answer who have the same problem. &nbsp;I do too. &nbsp;I am also not a tech idiot, so have tried many work-arounds and have spent about 15-20 hours either in person or on the phone with the Microsoft help personnel.
 &nbsp;The problem has been escalated through the levels (this was painfully slow, involving a few hours with one level before they decided they couldn't solve the problem and were going to escalate it to the next level) and I am now at the top level of support.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main problem started when the Exchange Active Sync services from Microsoft ended, about two weeks ago. &nbsp;Until then, I had been able to sync my Outlook 2016 with my online outlook.com account. &nbsp;I had set up an outlook.com alias and forwarded all my Sympatico
 emails to it. &nbsp;When they stopped the EAS service, I was no longer able to sync the account with Outlook on my computer or to successfully set up a new Exchange account. &nbsp;Strangely enough, I have not encountered any problems with the new Exchange service on
 my iPhone or my iPad, only on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My level 3 support service person at Microsoft has promised to look into this and try to work with Bell on the issue. &nbsp;Meanwhile, I am going to see if I can get the issue escalated at Bell and let the guy at Microsoft know what they say. &nbsp;Between Bell's
 disassociation from outlook and outlook's migration, this is a total nightmare!</p>
<p>
</p><p>i will try to keep you informed if I get an answer.</p>

<h2>            Office iPad and OneDrive Issues - Missing Folders</h2>
                    <p>After trying out Office Word, Excel and Powerpoint on my iPad it seems to me that OneDrive integration is broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main problem is that various folders do not show up in the Office Apps on the iPad. These missing folders though do show up in the OneDrive app for iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also had the Office Apps lock up when trying to refresh a folder. Either the program locks up and I have to restart it or, the refresh icon just spins forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To troubleshoot the issue I've removed the Word app, reinstalled and reconnected my OneDrive account. I've done this a couple of times and each time when I try to view one of my folders, the app hangs. After restarting the app the folder I was trying to
 view has missing subfolders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I add a subfolder after I've viewed the folder in Word (for example) the new folder shows up. However, none of the folders that are missing will ever appear, no matter how many times I try to refresh the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly enough the missing folders are different between Word, Excel and Powerpoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My "Mac Docs" folder should have 25 folders. Word shows 16 folders, Excel shows 9 and PowerPoint shows all 25. However, PowerPoint also has trouble refreshing the folder, and after I've removed some folders, its still displaying the removed folders.</p>

            <p>I am not sure if this helps you, but it has fixed the problem for me.&nbsp; I found that the folder types in my OneDrive were set to Picture folders, not Document folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By selecting the folder in Onedrive web application, the properties have a "Folder Type" when you click on the change hyperlink it gives you the ability to chnage the type from Pictures to Documents via radio button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I performed this task all of my folders appeared. in the iOS Office Apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems that OneDrive determines the Folder type, from the content placed into the folder.</p>

    <title>Blank Message Body after moving to Exchange 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lizrosario  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blank Message Body after moving to Exchange 2013</h2>
                    <p>We recently moved several mailboxes from Exchange 2010 to Exchange 2013.&nbsp; All client machines are running Office 2010.&nbsp; We have two users who are receiving some emails where the body of the message is blank.&nbsp; If they preview the email they can see the message.&nbsp;
 If they Forwad the email as an Attachment then doubl-click on it, the message is visible.&nbsp; If they go into Citrix or OWA the message is visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have had the user login to a different PC with the same configuration and the messages are visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have removed the user's local cached profile and the result is the same on that PC (no message body).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see many posts with Office 2003, 2007 and 2010/Exchange 2007 or 2010 but nothing for Exchange 2013.&nbsp; Also, almost all of the post refer to disabling AV (which have already tried) or renaming .dat files (of which none of the referenced .dat files are present).</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have narrowed it down to certain internal emails that are in Rich Text Format.&nbsp; When the user opens the email, Outlook is converting to HTML and they are blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody have any ideas?</p>

<h2>            How bad is build 14279 on Surface Pro 3&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there is a known issue with this build that can cause the Surface Pro 3, Pro 4 and Book to hang and need to be force-rebooted by holding the power button but I want to know from people that have already updated their device how bad it is and how often
 their device hangs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My SP3 is a secondary machine and can be broken so no problem but if I won't be able to test much in this latest build on that device then I won't bother installing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            How bad is build14279? I can only say that I have uninstalled it and gone back to&nbsp; 14271 ; at least you can do some thing with this build . I had problems a while back with getting preview builds ( the unfixable fix this button) well we have gone back
 to that but with a new twist. If you want to go to the insidrs hub you will be told " you are almost there" and then you will be asked to sign in with a Microsoft account&nbsp; to access it . When you do you will be denied access and told to go to the insiders
 hub to "gain access" ? How cookie is that?&nbsp;This is just one of the many&nbsp; reasons why I uninstalled this dork of a build. Recommend it I would not . I found the whole mess unfathomable; anyou ask 2how bad is it ? The answer is&nbsp; do not go there.&nbsp;

<p>This is definitely not the answer for my question. I have been an insider for ages (even though I don't have the badge, heck knows why) and I have ran most builds. I also read release notes carefully for each build and my question was because of the known
 issues published by Microsoft for this flight. To quote the release notes:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>We’re investigating an issue in which some Surface Pro 3, Surface Pro 4, and Surface Book devices experience a freeze or hang and all input such as keyboard/trackpad and touch do not work. The workaround is to hold down the power
 button to force the device to hard-reboot.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>The statement above does not quantify how bad the issue is and hence my question. I wanted to hear from people with Surface Pro 3/4/Book to understand how often they have problems. So thank you for your answer but that is not the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>vhovan, BillTeasdale1, thanks for your input. That is helpful and I shall steer clear from 14279.</p>

            <p>Build 14279 is the worst I've had. My SP3 continually freezes and restarts showing error message SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION(Win32kfull.sys). After restart the build MAY allow normal use for a few minutes but any pressure i.e. more than 1 tab use or gralphic
 intro will trigger the above error message and BSOD. Event viewer shows differing causes dependant on the particular tab use at that time.</p>
<p>I have other PC outlets without that build so it does not give me personally any difficulty.</p>
<p>It remains however the worst bug related build that I've ever seen during the Insider programme.</p>

            <p>Hi had build 14279 on a SP4 CoreM with all the recent firmware and driver updates from 17 Feb.&nbsp; I've noticed the issues are mainly take place with either mouse click or finger tap events on either the touchpad or the touchscreen.&nbsp; I've seen them mostly when
 using MS Edge and IE11.&nbsp; Not noticed them with either Firefox or Chrome, but I don't use them as much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the event 'strikes' the device freezes for about 30-60 seconds and then starts to respond again. You have no keyboard or mouse in this time. you just have to it and be patient until it frees itself up</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>On one occasion I was typing a search term in a search box and the device 'froze', except it didn't completely freeze as I could see the insertion point icon in the search box still flashing away.&nbsp; So my conclusion is that this is a keyboard and touch event.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a bit irritating, but not to the point I've reverted to the 14271 build yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully MS resolve it soon.</p>
<p>

            <p>Build 14279 seems to be very unstable for me. I'm on a Surface Pro 3 i5, 256. On my system the problems come on slowly, starting with a general problem reading taps on the trackpad...starts by only accepting double taps and progresses downhill from there.
 At a certain point the Settings / Update will stop opening, a tap (either on screen, or using the track pad) will result in the icon for updates freezing without opening the updates screen. After a bit longer accessing any of the Settings through the control
 panel becomes progressively harder. The only fix that I've found has been to do a complete PC reset. (which just reinstalls build 14279).</p>
<p>
