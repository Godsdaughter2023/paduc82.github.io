<h3> johnnyk444  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connection problem with one specific contact</h2>
                    <p>since yesterday, I can't make video/call&nbsp; with one specific contact. both mine and contact's status is Online (green). on my side skype is ringing the contact for some time then drops the call and asks to leave a video/message which is not working either.
 on the contact's side also - skype doesn't ring when i call him. when he tries to call - I get nothing on my skype. only after restarting skype it shows missed calls in the IM box.
</p>
<p>we'r not blocked by each other. both have latest skype ver. 7.37. echo/audio test is working fine. other contacts connect just fine. same happening on Win10 Lap and smartphones. what's going on?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>done all that with the latest version 7.38.0.101 , didn't help. only able to send messages and files to each other.
</p>
<p>still can't make video/audio call&nbsp; with one and ONLY ONE specific contact. and what's even more weird - it's not working only from his home location. when he went to friend's house with the same laptop, we were finally able to video chat perfectly!
</p>
<p>AND both of us have no problem&nbsp;making video/audio calls to any other contacts, no matter from our homes or not.</p>

                    <p>Hi, I just installed 2010 office professional &nbsp;on my 2 computers. Laptop which has Windows 7 64 bit and desktop Windows 8 64 bit. Both office versions are installed as 32bit. The problem is with ms access. It runs good on laptop,but on desktop i get this
 blue separation line moved up across menu. It happens on every template from the access library that is preinstalled and even on some that i downloaded from other sources. &nbsp;Why is this happening?<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/457ef4d3-7c58-4e67-b2ff-3c0a38802143" /></p>

<p>Hi Beej2209,</p>
<p>
</p><p>These error messages could appear if the same email address has been used on your Office 365 or OneDrive account. You just need to choose which one to use. Since you mentioned that you have no idea where did the work or school account came from, I suggest
 deleting them. Refer to this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/deleting-an-user-account-in-windows-10/d4ff4984-f279-4818-ba9a-699b057bd038">thread</a></strong> to delete a user
 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you continue to have this issue even after performing the above steps, please reply
 to this thread. The system will notify me so I can get back to you and provide you more answers.</span></p>

            <p>This is a bit confusing in that it appears that you're mixing Forms with Tables.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Form is <em>just a window</em> - a tool to display and edit data. Forms do not have primary keys or foreign keys or relationships; only Tables do.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forms with Subforms do have Master and Child Link Fields which can be used to automate the updating of foreign keys; i.e. if your mainform is based on a table with a primary key, and you use that primary key as the Master Link Field to a subform with a foreign
 key as the Child Link Field, Access will (at least try to) assign the value of the current record's autonumber to the foreign key on the child table. If you want the relationship to be optional, allowing orphans, then you cannot use the master/child feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are the actual table (not form!) relationships in the Relationships window? Are you using forms and subforms, or are Form A to D independent freestanding forms? Could you post a sample of the code which triggers the runtime error?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More basically, what real-life entities are modeled by these very nonstandard relationships?</p>

            Thanks for the quick reply!<br />
<br />
I do apologize, I did indeed manage to get forms and tables mixed up while creating this post.<br />
I'm referring to the table relationships and not the forms, sorry!
<div><br />
Ok, I realized what i've said was a very confusing way to explain things, let me give it another go.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Probably a better way to explain it:<br />
<p>- Table A has a primary key that exists as a foreign key in Table B.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Table&nbsp;A has a many-many relationship with&nbsp;Table&nbsp;C</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Table&nbsp;B has a primary key that exists as a foreign key in&nbsp;Table&nbsp;D</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Table&nbsp;C has a primary key that exists as another foreign key in&nbsp;Table&nbsp;D</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Table&nbsp;D has its own primary key with no relationship attached</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Form A</b> has a Subform which displays the contents of <b>Form B</b> that automatically updates records based on the many-many relationship. Form B is also an independent form.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><u>What I want:</u><br />
<br />
Form D to have a similar Subform situation as between Form A-B..&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where if either of the two foreign keys in Table D are entered with data that match the primaries in Table C or Table D, then a subform on Form D containing Form B and C will update. However this data is not required as the data is not always related to
 Table B or C (Orphan?).<br />
<br />
Because only one of the foreign keys is allowed to be filled in, I've got 2 radio buttons which let the user choose between them (If at all). I have some vba code embedded in Form D which attempts to make the field that is NOT used, Null, when the user selects
 the other radio button.</p>
<p><br />
This is when the run-time errors are thrown.<br />
Both the foreign keys are of data type 'Number' as both their primary keys have the 'Autonumber' data type.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The code simply states that upon changes made to the form, check the value of both radio buttons, depending on which one is selected by stating "ID = Null"<br />
<br />
I'm currently away from the project and didn't expect such a quick reply (Thank you!) so if this issue remains unresolved i'll post the code, values and relationships to help solve this frustrating issue!</p>

<p><br />
Well... that's the problem. A basic principle of normalization is that a value in the table should depend on that table's primary key and nothing else. Here, you have two fields in your table which are dependent both on the primary key of the table,
<em>and also</em> on what's in the other foreign key field! This is a violation of normal form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you get a chance, perhaps you could step back a bit and explain what real-life situation this table is modeling?</p>

<div>Above is the basic relationship structure i'm using.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The database is to track hardware, hardware faults, hardware maintenance and hardware specifications.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The main table is the hardware table, where the user starts. This form contains a user select (Which is used throughout the database), 3 Subforms; Preventative Maintenance, Contacts and a third subform which changes form source, based on the "Category"
 field in the Hardware table.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Each table is individual and can be loaded up, but it's designed so the user can do almost everything off the one form through subform views.</div>

            <p>All I can suggest is that you appear to have a good example of "Subclassing" - every HardwareID has zero, one, or many Models, but each Model may be one of a whole lot of classes: Converters, Amplifiers, Microphones, and so on. Each class of models has its
 own distinct attributes, mostly not shared with other models; it's not clear to me whether all Models share any attributes in common other than their existance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One suggestion would be to have a table of Models with a ModelID primary key; a ModelType field (indicating that this model is a Converter, this next one is a Microphone, and so on); and any other fields that are in common to all models, if any. This table
 could have a one-to-one relationship to each of your existing Model tables (joining primary key ModelID to primary key ModelID), and related one to many to the Hardware table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's tough to build a really clean and simple user interface, in my view, because it's not a clean or easy problem! Good luck!</p>

<h2>            My file takes too long to process</h2>
                    <p><span>I am highly perplexed by this file I have.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Because it takes extremely long in performing simple calculations.<span>&nbsp; </span>
One reason I’m sure of is that majority of the contents of this file are sourced from a website and copied via Internet Explorer (I discovered that I would have to paste it in Word first since I don’t get the ‘match destination formatting’ choice when going
 directly to Excel, and doing so that copying from Word to Excel that I would get the selection in the ‘Paste’).</span></p>

<p><span>The dates in columns C &amp; D are manually typed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And because the processing of the file is slow, and it will slow down further with the additional data for the coming weeks, I figured that I would instead create a base file that I would use for starting again, and the past data is to be saved in a
 different file.<span>&nbsp; </span>However whenever I copy this column to a different file, it would take so long to process.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I tried copying just the range instead of the entire column, but it’s still taking so long.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I wonder if there is another thing I can do to solve this.<span>&nbsp; </span>And maybe someone can help me with this.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Here is the zipped file.</span></p>

</p><p>This seems to be caused by a faulty Norton update.</p>
<p>Try to disable all Norton add-ons in IE and re-enable <em>64-bit processes for enhanced protection.</em></p>
<p>This is a temporary workaround.</p>

    <title>Sync Loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sync Loop</h2>
                    I have had my Nokia 822 from Verizon for a little more than a week now. Things seem to work great for a couple of days and then all of a sudden my notifications stop and my live tiles (for my email and text accounts) stop updating and they show messages
 even if I have read them. Then it gets to the point to where I no longer receive emails or text messages anymore. I have found that when this activity happens, my accounts are stuck in a sync loop and never finish. The first time this happened it was almost
 all of my accounts that were stuck. Once they get into that state, there is nothing you can do as you cannot force a stop on it or anything. At least that I can view. My first thought was that I had too many things set to sync as new items come in. These are
 all of my accounts:&nbsp;
<div>Microsoft&nbsp;</div>
<div>Nokia Backup</div>
<div>&nbsp;Assistant&nbsp;</div>
<div>Facebook&nbsp;</div>
<div>Personal Google email account&nbsp;</div>
<div>My cable providers email account&nbsp;</div>
<div>My work Google email account&nbsp;</div>
<div>My work Outlook account&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had all of these (at least the ones that would let me change the settings) set to sync as new items arrived. I thought that maybe that was too much so I made sure things were backed up to the cloud and I did a hard reset. Once my phone was restored,
 I then went into my accounts and I told only my work Outlook to sync as new items came in and setup a time for each of the other accounts as I felt the priority was needed.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This worked great until this morning when I found that my phone would no longer update the account live tiles again. I checked my accounts and my Microsoft account and my Facebook account were stuck in a sync loop again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did figure out that if I turned on Airplane mode, it will kill the syncs and allow me to actually go into the account and do something with it. So, I turned on airplane mode, killed the syncs, and then turned airplane mode off. My theory was that perhaps
 my Facebook was causing the issue since my work blocks Facebook traffic. When I turned airplane mode off, it just notified me that a couple of my accounts were out of date and immediately tried syncing my Microsoft account again. This went on for a couple
 minutes and then my other accounts decided to try to sync and once again, I am in sync loop heck.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am starting to believe that there is something wrong with my Microsoft account as that seems to be the main account that hangs. This is really frustrating considering I love my Windows 8 laptop and I love my Windows 8 Phone. I love the fact that my phone
 and computer now know each other without wires. It is great. But if I have to do a hard reset once a week to make sure that things stay working, this is not acceptable. I am hoping that someone out there has an idea. I have seen sync loop issues popping up
 on the net here and there, but there is never a good fix besides resetting the device or going back to an Android based phone. I don't want to make the move back so please help! I have tried to trouble shoot as much as I can to hopefully help in coming up
 with a solution to this mess. So sorry for the LONG post but thanks to all for reading it and for any feedback or suggestions that can be tried!&nbsp;</div>

            I got my phone back for now. I ended up doing a battery pull on it and that seemed to work this time. It did not work the first time I had this issue though.
<div><br />
<div>There still is evidently an issue somewhere here that needs to be addressed as pulling the battery every two days or even every week is not a viable solution.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here are my thoughts. I believe that the issue is still somewhere in the accounts. I have a feeling it is something to do with WiFi and 4G. I know that when I remove the Ethernet cable from my laptop and it switches over to WiFi, if I have a program that
 is trying to draw data, it makes that program hang. (depending on where the data is at and the connection I am using to draw it)</div>
<div><br />
<div>So just using that logic, when I walk out of work today and I leave my work WiFi and the phone switches its data connection to 4G, what happens if one of my accounts is in the middle of syncing? If it is anything like my laptop above, it hangs the program.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also something to ponder. My Facebook syncs fine at home on WiFi and on 4G because it can. When I move to my work WiFi, that site is blocked by our network here. So, I get to work, Facebook decides to sync, and it seems to hang because it can't get through.
 In MOST cases, it will eventually error out and let me know that it is no longer up to date, but what happens when another account decides to sync while Facebook is having issues?</div>
<div><br />
<div>All of these things I don't have answers to or even know how to fully test them, but I am hoping that with this being a Windows site, someone smarter than me can help to troubleshoot this.&nbsp;</div>

            Phone went back into sync loop AGAIN and now it is looking like a hard reset is going to be the only way to get it out. Soft reset, nothing. Battery pull, nothing. Airplane mode, nothing. This is the 2nd time now already today that the loop has happened!
 This is getting to the point to where I am fed up. I have missed multiple work emails already due to this and now it appears like it is only the Microsoft account that is having an issue this time. Everything else finishes fine.
<div><br />
<div>I don't know what else to try. Ideas?</div>

            It appears like I am my own tech. :) I convinced my girlfriend to get the same phone even with the issues I have been having. We didn't even get out of the store before hers started acting up. Hers would stop letting us into settings and other Windows
 options.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>After watching the tech at Verizon fumble with it and not being impressed with his knowledge, I said that I would work with it at home and if I couldn't figure it out, they would be getting both phones back.</div>
<div><br />
<div>At home I tried everything and finally decided to start from scratch as I was not totally sure that the Verizon tech didn't screw something up. I did a hard reset and then pulled everything from the phone. Battery, sim card, and microSD. I left the phone
 sit for about 15 minutes and then I put the sim and battery back in and powered it on. Set all the accounts back up and worked with it for 30 minutes with no issues. I was baffled, but pleased that it started working. Then I realized that I forgot to put the
 microSD back in.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I immediately grabbed my phone, powered it down, pulled the battery, and yanked the microSD out. This was Friday of last week (Currently is Wed) and I have had 0 problems. Everything works exactly the way it should. No sync loop issues, nothing! It just
 works.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sooooo.......the issue may be the cards. These are both 16GB HD class 4 cards. I am going to give the phone a workout for a good week before I start looking at buying a new microSD and seeing if all of my problems stay away. But so far, this seems to have
 been the issue!</div>

            A little over a month now and I can positively state that the microSD was the culprit. I gave my phone a good work out with no card at all. I then saw a deal at BestBuy during the holidays so I picked up 2 of them. The first thing I did was popped it into
 my phone and made sure that the phone did what it needed to recognize the new media. I worked with the phone for a week with just a blank card in there. With no issues arising, &nbsp;I took the time to copy all my pictures off from the old card (using my laptop
 and a microSD to SD converter) onto the new card. I then popped in the new card, made sure the phone saw it again, looked at some of my pictures, and then just used my phone as normal.
<div><br />
<div>My issues have disappeared and the phone has been working strong. I still can't explain why my Microsoft account appeared to be stuck during this time as well unless something got stuck trying to sync with sky drive from the phone. But, both phones have
 been working well for the last 2 weeks now.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Moral of the story, I may just buy new media when I get a new phone and go through the work of copying it all over.</div>

    <title>Visio 2010 Org Charts - changing supervisors in shape properties - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mjpcc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Visio 2010 Org Charts - changing supervisors in shape properties</h2>
                    Does anyone know how to change Org Chart supervisor graphically ?<br />
<br />
I have an Org Chart structure - many people reporting to others - I need to change a person reporting to Supervisor A now to Supervisor B.<br />
<br />
Picking up the person and their structure and "dropping" him ontop of Supervisor B does graphically move him and his structure, however, it
<strong>does not</strong>&nbsp;change the supervisor captured in the properties data.&nbsp; It seems cumbersome that if you can physically move a person into a different reporting structure, the associated properties with that block do not update accordingly.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help ?<br />
<br />

<p>Hello Karen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recharged using NZD account as suggested, the Order No is 8072000005624900068.</p>
<p>The amount got debited from my account but the 800 rs india calling pack is not activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never faced any issue with skype for past few years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please check the above issue and let me know asap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also in my account my new master card (india account) has been blocked for some reason and so I tried to pay via NZD and it is causing so much of confusion now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. check why for&nbsp; Order No is 8072000005624900068. the skype minutes is not added to my account</p>
<p>2. Also if possible remove the master card block which is made by skype.</p>

<p>Upon checking here, it seems that you still have an existing 800 India minutes that is currently active, this is the reason why the newly purchased 800 India minutes is not yet active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The old India 800 minutes subscription will expire on 4/18/2018 at exactly 5:51 GMT, as soon as this subscription expires, you can then use the second 800 minutes.</p>

</p><p>And as for your card, we do not have option to delete it on our end. However, I can provide you the steps on how to remove the card on your account, please refer to the steps below:</p>

</p><p>I have exactly the same problem with Word for Mac 2016! All the captions are listed in the navigation pane while the outline level for the caption style is the Body Text!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened the same file in Word 2016 for Windows and everything is fine. The extra fields on the navigation pane are shown only in the Word for Mac version. Therefore it is a bug that still exist in the Word for Mac 2016 but not in the Word for Windows anymore.</p>
<p>

<br />
I understand what you mean. However, I assume those who use Onetastic visit this forum more frequently than Onetastic forum.
<br />
I hope I do not break any rule of this forum since Onetastic is specifically made for OneNote only.<br />
<br />
<br />
Back to my question:<br />
I still can not "modify" the properties spaceBetween, spaceAfter, spaceBefore.<br />
I have tried by direct way and by using variable. Still, for "modify", those property do not appear.<br />
I am stuck on this line:<br />
" <b>Modify &lt;select-property-or-variable&gt;</b>&nbsp; --&gt;&nbsp; &lt;select-operator&gt; &lt;enter-value&gt; "<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<p>I just upgraded my primary desktop PC to 18362.1, but mine is running better than it was on version 1809.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try a clean boot. Use msconfig to disable all Services except Microsoft ones (you can hide the Microsoft ones to make it easy to select all else).&nbsp; Also use the Startup tab in Task Manager to disable everything that runs during startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your PC now boots and runs a lot faster, you can go through and use msconfig to enable things one at a time to see what is having the negative impact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, check for firmware/BIOS upgrades for your PC, driver updates for your display adapter and do a thorough scan for malware, to make sure nothing has compromised your system.&nbsp; There is a Windows Defender offline scan that you can initiate. It scans Windows
 prior to Windows launching, as some malware is difficult to remove when Windows is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am probably going to do a complete clean install of Windows myself, even though mine is running better. I will delete all partitions from my SSD and install Windows 10 to the unallocated space. I have not done that for around a year or 18 months and I
 like to get a fresh start, usually with each new Windows 10 version.&nbsp; But I have all my data on separate hard drives, so it is not too inconvenient for me to do a clean install.</p>

            Tried most things you suggested but will do some more digging.Same thing was happening on clean install of 1809.Another insider with a i5 5200 processor is having the same problems so it could be a bug with this one processor.

            The freezing only happens in chromium based browsers the worst being chrome which will lock up sometimes requiring a reboot.Firefox works fine as far as I have seen.

            Chrome is up to date and I tried several new and&nbsp; old graphics drivers already.I wonder if the reptoline patch is having odd effects with certain processors.This issue does not occur in Firefox.Chrome will freeze pointer and lock up needing a reboot when
 on You Tube.

            I ran driver verifier and it pointed me to a Realtek Audio Driver so I updated it with Snappy.Also updated the Intel Graphics Driver from Intel's site.Do not do bulk installs with Snappy Driver Installer because it will break windows.I will follow up if
 this solves it.Running 1809 currently.

<h2>            Excel 365 - Stops working while opening csv files</h2>
                    <p>Since last week I cannot open csv-files in Excel neither by clicking on the file nor by opening the file from Excel. Excel diretly stops working and closes. It has never been a problem before.&nbsp; The only way to open the file is via Data-&gt; Get data-&gt; from
 text files, but this is quite time consuming if you work a lot with csv files. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thaks for the suggestion. There seem to be two solutions for the problem: i) if I use the R function write.csv instead of the write.table (sep=",") function, R produced a csv file thast I can directly open by double clicking, ii) disabling the ChemDraw Add-in
 in Excel solves the problem for all csv-files.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help. problem solved ;-)!</p>

<h2>            Exchange Online Plan 2 uses Basic or advanced archiving</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Team,</p>

<p>I wanted to know if I can reduce the mailbox size for the mailboxes in Exchange Online Plan2 as I am moving them to Kiosk Plan.</p>
<p>If I set up archiving for a mailbox will the mailbox size reduce or the archive will be part of that 50 GB mailbox size?</p>

<p>Hi MiteshJain,</p>
<p>In-Place Archive isn’t included in Exchange Online Kiosk. However, it can be purchased as an add-on through Exchange Online Archiving.</p>
<p>If you purchase add-on Exchange online archiving for Kiosk users, the mailboxes size for each one will not be reduced. It is 50GB.</p>
<p>If anything is unclear, please feel free to let me know.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Erick</p>

If you don't have the media or product key, you have nothing.</p>
<p>You will have to buy it again.</p>

            <p>I know this is old, but I did this 11.2014. I found the link provided by my employer and proceeded as if I were purchasing again. I was then able to create an account as a FIRST TIME USER using the address I purchased the software with the first time. This
 gave me access to the account and I was able to download Office using the product key from the original purchase. Hope this helps!</p>
