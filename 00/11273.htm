<h2>            Sync Safe&#47;Blocked Senders in Outlook 2013 Between Computers</h2>
                    <p>I have my junk filter for Outlook.com set to exclusive. When I set a junk email's domain or address to safe on my desktop computer, I sometime still see it in my junk box. I believe this is because I also have Outlook 2013 installed on my laptop and the
 Safe/Blocked lists are not syncing between each other or even with the website. There have been times when I had to reset my computer and re-install Outlook. When I do so, I notice that my Safe/Blocked lists are COMPLETELY EMPTY and I have to populate them
 all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to sync these lists?</p>

            No, there is not a way to sync the lists. You need to add the addresses to the lists at Outlook.com.

            <p>Windows Live Mail stopped support in April 2012 and that is why switched to Outlook 2013. Windows Live Mail was able to sync the lists, but I guess Outlook failed to integrate that feature when they forced everyone to stop using Live Mail; not really stop
 using it, but if you need help, we won't help you, you need to purchase the new product in order for us to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a bit inconvenient to look at my junk email then need to open the website to "update" my junk filters in order to keep my email from going to the junk folder.</p>

            You can use live mail if you want - it still works - but honestly,&nbsp;blocked senders is not a good&nbsp;way to fight spam.&nbsp;spammers don't use the addresses long and then you end up with a list full of addresses that are never&nbsp;found. &nbsp;&nbsp;If the message is in the
 junk folder there is no need to add the sender to the blocked list - the junk filter worked.

            Junk filters referring to my Junk Filter Settings being set to Exclusive then adding a filter to ALLOW an email address or domain through the filter. Window Live Mail used to be able to sync these filters between computers and the website.

            <p>When they upgraded the servers, redesigned the Hotmail/live service and rebranded it outlook.com (because they like to confuse people :)). With the upgrade, some features were changed. If live mail no longer syncs these lists, then its one of the things
 they changed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook 2013 doesn't sync the lists.&nbsp; Try setting Outlook's junk filter on high or exclusive and use it's safe list.

<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">That's exactly what I'm doing, it would just be nice if I didn't have to do it on EVERY computer that I install Outlook 2013 on.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have found that even though I have a filter set on the website, BECAUSE the Program and the Website DO NOT SYNC their lists, Outlook 2013 overrides the filter BECAUSE the filter IS NOT
 SET in its own FILTER LIST.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>For Example, lets say I add the domain "@e-mail.microsoft.com" to the Outlook Website but DO NOT Add it to the Outlook 2013 Program, Outlook 2013 will catch it as Junk because it is not set in its own filter list. Then I have to add the domain to my Desktop
 computer. Guess What? I ALSO have to add the domain to my LAPTOP computer or else it will STILL go to the Junk Folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If there was a way even to Export the lists then Import them on another computer would be&nbsp;convenient&nbsp;enough for me.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use the blocked lists, but someone else may. If you do it for the safe senders list, why limit to just the safe list and not the blocked list. That is the ONLY reason why I include the blocked list in my discussion.</p>

<p>Ok, let me give you an example. When I checked my email, the email from Microsoft notifying me that comments were made to this forum was sent to my junk email box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went to the outlook website to add the "@microsoft.com" domain to my safe senders list and it was ALREADY THERE. Why is mail being sent to my junk email box when it is on my safe senders list? My only guess is that it is acting like a firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The domain may be on my safe sender's list ON THE WEBSITE, but because the domain is not in the Safe Senders List on my Outlook 2013 program, the program sees it as junk and sends it there. Going back to my firewall example, the email makes it through the
 first firewall (the website) but does not make it through the second firewall (the program). If these lists would sync like RIP on a router then there wouldn't be a problem.</p>

<p>I am connecting to Outlook.com via EAS yet the lists are not syncing. For example, on the Outlook.com website I have the "@norton.com" domain in my Safe Senders List. However, when I look at the Safe Senders List on my Outlook 2013 program, the domain is
 not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very inconvenient that EVERY TIME I want to add an email address or domain to my safe senders list, I have to stop what I'm doing to log into the Outlook.com website, then go to the safe senders list, then copy either the email address or the domain
 to the list, then I have to do the SAME EXACT thing to the program, then if I have ANOTHER computer with Outlook 2013, I have to do it AGAIN to THAT COMPUTER.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If these lists would sync like RIP on a router then there wouldn't be a problem. Then if I made a change to one of the lists on my laptop, it would update the list on the server as well as my desktop

    <title>Cannot Validate activation build 10166 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aomega001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Validate activation build 10166</h2>
                    <p>When I opened the insider hub for the first time in quite a while after FINALLY gettting the insider hub to install. &nbsp;I noticed under announcements "Help us Validate Activation on Windows 10 Desktop preview" was listed.</p>
<p>I followed the instructions to complete the task, even though I know how to do it. &nbsp;I go to settings, update and security, activation and then click change product key. &nbsp;An input window does not appear and when I try to move the settings window to see if
 the input page has popped up underneath it I get a critical error sound and the settings page does not respond.</p>
<p>The only way to close the settings page is to close it via the taskbar or Ctrl, Alt, Del task manager close task.</p>
<p>I noticed on the previous build 10159 that this occured when trying to install a printer update through Windows Update.</p>
<p>It looks very much like the window that should appear is registering as if it has but is not visible. &nbsp;It has more than likely popped up under the settings window and seeing as the settings page then cannot be moved until the hidden window has been populated
 by a valid product key I cannot complete the task.</p>
<p>This a classic vicious circle I cannot move the setings window to enter a product code and I cannot enter a product code because I cannot move the the settings window.</p>
<p>Hopefully the MS team can remove the "NOT" from all the Cans as we are now VERY close to release and there will be a lot of EXTREMELY unhappy bunnies out there who CANNOT validate their installations.</p>

<h2>            My bad experience with My Phone</h2>
                    Well, 2 days ago i sync everything.. I checked in the site hola ... all my Contacts are in the site, great, so I decided to "format" my phone, and so I did, after formatting.. I installed Microsoft My Phone, and Pressed Sync, in order to restore all my
 contacts and OOPS! all the contacts are GONE from the site. I realized I should go to the site, select all the contacts and press "Restore to phone" but i realized it TOO LATE unfortunately ..
<br />
so I have a suggestion, maybe before something like this happen the application should Warn us about this ? or a simple question "Do you want to override the contacts in the site, or restore .. or something like this". ... hope this get improved.

BlacKICce,<br />
<br />
first of all thanks for trying out My Phone service.<br />
<br />
Can you please explain better your use case?<br />
<br />
You had some contacts on device and did a sync with server. Those contents were in both sides, right? Web and client.<br />
After that you did a "format". What is "format"? Soft reset, hard resert? My Phone application was totally removed from the device?<br />
<br />
Your feedback is very important to us to allow figure out if there is some issue.<br />
<br />

            Hello&nbsp; Lopes, <br />
thanks for your reply, I had a hard reset, and reinstalled MyPhone, all my contacts where on the Phone (not SIM) so after installing MyPhone I pressed Sync, in order to restore the contacts back to my phone, but unfortunately, sync removed all the contacts
 from the Website (myphone.microsoft.com), Apparently, I had to go to the site, select all contacts and press "Restore to phone", I didn't knew that, so I lost all my contacts, my suggestion is, before doing such a dramatic move, the app should warn me or something,
 or there should be an option to restore the contacts. not going to the web and select the contacts.<br />
other than that, It's a great software :)<br />
<br />
another suggestion is MyPhone should be connected with SkyDrive, in order to store more data (200MB isn't enough..)

BlacKICcE.<br />
<br />
First of all, can you please go Recycle Bin -&gt; Contacts and see if your contacts are there? If yes, you can restore the contacts back to your storage and after that if you sync with the device your contacts will back to it.<br />
<br />
Regarding the delete of contacts in the web portal that you're not expected, we need to understand why that happened. Based on your feedback, what happened to you is not the behavior that we were expecting.<br />
Can you please explain with more detail what is your use case?<br />
<br />
1 - You have the contacts on the device<br />
2 - Install My Phone in device<br />
3 - Sync your contacts with portal: contacts are in both sides (phone and webportal).<br />
4 - Hard reset device<br />
5&nbsp;- Install My Phone in device<br />
6 - Sync your contacts with portal: the contats that were in portal were deleted.<br />
<br />
Was that your use case? If this is true, we need to follow up internally why this happened.<br />
<br />
Also, the option "Restore to phone" is not to be used as you refered.<br />
Let me explain. Imagine that you've 1 music sync'd with portal (it is in both sides). If you hit "Archive to Web" the music will be kept in portal but will be deleted in the phone. In any moment, if you want to bring back your music to device you just need
 to select the content and press "Restore to phone" in the portal. After that, the music will be sync'd to the phone, and will appear in both sides.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
Lopes<br />

<p>Same thing happened to me. Idiotic ActiveSync blew away all my contacts on first sync with my PC after I had restored all my contacts to my new phone using MyPhone!</p>
<p>And then I synced with MyPhone again and then it still had no contacts but the MyPhone contacts were also all gone on the website.</p>
<p>Thankfully, they were in the archived folder.</p>
<p>Not sure what to do now.....</p>

    <title>How do I pin websites to Internet Explorer icon in taskbar, using IE9 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thecolster123  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I pin websites to Internet Explorer icon in taskbar, using IE9 beta&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've just recently got a new computer, which is running Windows 7 Home Premium. My old laptop was also running Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>I was using IE8 on my laptop, and I had Internet Explorer pinned to the taskbar. I was able to pin other websites to the taskbar, so when I right-clicked the IE icon it displayed my pinned websites above my frequent websites. I could do this just by dragging
 the favicon to the IE icon.</p>
<p>However, on my computer I now have IE9.beta, and I cannot seem to pin websites to the IE icon anymore. I've tried going back to IE8, but it seems that I cannot pin websites to the IE icon on that, either.</p>
<p>Just to clarify, pinning websites to the IE icon in the taskbar isn't the same as IE9.b's new feature of pinning websites to the taskbar. The pinned websites appear when you right-click the IE icon in the taskbar, above the Frequent websites visited.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how I can pin websites to the IE icon, whilst using IE9 beta, without cluttering up my taskbar?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>The links provided by Mohan will describe how to get links to other web pages to open in a new window. It won't necessarily work in making PDF or Word files open in a new window or tab. The user has control over whether they want to download those files
 to their local computer or whether they have installed the plug-ins that allow them to be opened in the browser. You only have so much control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One way you can force the download is to put the PDF or Word files in a ZIP file. When clicking a link to the zip file the user will be asked if they want to download the file...it will not open in the browser regardless of the plug-ins or user settings.
 This is probably you easiest solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more note. MS started deprecating the web building functionality of Publisher as of Pub 2010. Unless you are using a web publication from a previous version of Publisher some of the web functionality is hidden from you. If you open an old web file in
 Pub 2010 you will be given a Web tab. It is on that web tab that you have the ability to insert a html code fragment.&nbsp; For the methods described in my referenced threads to work you must be able to insert code fragments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reference: Web functionality Pub 2010:<br />
<a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/publisher-help/web-functionality-HA101877287.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/publisher-help/web-functionality-HA101877287.aspx</a><br />

<p>
</p><p>If you are not using an old Web publication file then you don't have the code fragment option. If not there is one web publication template file still available on-line. For some reason MS has removed the ability to peruse their templates site for all Publisher
 templates (<a href="https://templates.office.com/Templates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://templates.office.com/Templates)&nbsp;
</a>but you can still download it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to File &gt; New &gt; Online Templates &gt; More templates &gt; More Categories &gt; All Business &gt; at the bottom of that group of templates click &gt; More Office.com Templates (152) &gt; scroll to the bottom and find the
<strong>Web site (tabs design)</strong> template and download it. If you open that web publication template you will see the Web tab on Pub 2010 and be able to access the Insert HTML Code Fragment feature. You could test your ability to link and open a Word
 or PDF file in a new window using this web template. If it works then edit this template/copy all your content to this template and you will be good to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general I would suggest you start finding an alternative to using Publisher for web building. As of Pub 2013 MS has further hobbled the web functionality be removing the insert html code fragment tool altogether. Look at MS ExpressionWeb, Serif WebPlus,
 Word Press for free versions. WebPlus is where I wish MS had taken Publisher.</p>

            <p>Thanks guys.&nbsp; I actually figured it out.&nbsp; I opened the HTML file in Notepad and inserted
<em>target</em>="<em>_blank</em>" after each line of code with a link.&nbsp; For example,</p>
<p>
</p><p>href="GMS%20CD%20Portal%20Library%20v2/Tier%201-GMS/GMS.PDF"target="_blank"&gt;&lt;span</p>
<p>
</p><p>I inserted that target="_blank" after I saw the .pdf or .docx.&nbsp; This opened all of these docs (pdf and word) in a new window.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I had to laugh at myself after reading your simple solution. In the past we worked hard to avoid editing the code directly as it needs to be done every time you edit and change the Publisher file. However it is a great choice in this case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also good to hear that this coding still works with the newer browsers. </p>

            Haha, yeah I wanted to avoid looking at code too but this seemed easy enough.&nbsp; Oh, I'm still using an old browser.&nbsp; Internet Explorer 9. This is my work computer so I'm not sure if it works on new browsers.&nbsp;

            <p>FWIW in general if you can get your Publisher websites to work with both IE and FireFox then you will enjoy good cross browser compatibility. You might want to install and test with FF. Just opt out of it to becoming your default browser during installation.
 You can right click the index.htm and other .htm files and Open With FF. If all the links work and the pages render correctly your pages should work well in Chrome, Opera, &amp; Safari.</p>

<h2>            tips for migrating from office 2008 to 2011&#43;Entourage</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm going to install Office 2011 and need guidance on setting up Outlook and migrating from Entourage 2008.<br />
<br />
not sure if this makes a difference - I also will be setting up exchange accounts for synching with a new iphone.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I'd really appreciate any tips/instructions.&nbsp; I had a forum page with notes, but it seems to have disappeared.
<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Robert<br />

            I suggest first exporting your mail as .rge file under File &gt; Export. Save as "Only Messages.rge". If you get Done at the end, your data is good. If you get one or more items failed to export there is some corruption in your data.<br />
<br />
Next, export the remaining items one item at a time. Archive these in case you need them for a recovery at a later time.<br />
<br />
When you open Outlook select to import from a previous version of Entourage. Uncheck importing messages but let Outlook import all your other files. Import the "only messages.rge" file. Move items into the local folders.<br />
<br />
Outlook has Auto Discovery so setting up your new Exchange should be fairly painless. Just be sure it's an Exchange 2007 or higher account.<br />
<br />
If Outlook has problems, do not rebuild until you delete the Exchange account. Rebuild then you can add Exchange after you are satisfied with the rebuild.<br />
<br />
It's best not to put subfolders under the Exchange Inbox.<br />
Keep the Exchange Inbox as clean as possible for best sync results.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps! <br />

            The installation is pretty much automatic. If you take all the defaults, Outlook will have all your contacts, messages, mail server settings, etc. from Entourage. Projects will not be carried forward, but few people used Project Center. Exchange accounts
 can be added to Outlook using the Tools menu &gt; Accounts feature in Outlook. Click the little + sign in the lower left corner to add an Exchange account.<br />

    <title>Microsoft Account Device Limit 10 for Upgrades - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harolditd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Account Device Limit 10 for Upgrades</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a Microsoft Account at work <em>(using my work email)</em> which is used for purchasing Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro Upgrades on newly purchased computers for Domain addition purposes. This morning when attempting to utilize this account to
 purchase another Windows 10 Pro upgrade for a new laptop it informed me that i have reached my 10 Device Limit and would have to remove a device in order to purchase the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 1: Is it possible to increase this 10 device limit?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 2: If i remove a device from my account, what are all the repercussions / effects of doing this? If i have to factory reset the unit to Win 10 Home will i have issues using the purchased upgrade? If i have to download a store app for the specific
 user i remove will that cause any potential issues etc..?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know i can create another domain email account and using that another Microsoft Account but i was hoping to keep all my Win 10 Home to Pro upgrades on the same account. Given the fact that there are potentially 15 upgrades this coming fiscal year i don't
 want to be creating a new email / Microsoft account every few month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Hello Harold,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device limit for a Microsoft account to install an app or a game on a Windows 10 device is set to a maximum of 10 devices, however, you will still be able to use the Microsoft account to login on multiple devices. Since you've reached the limit and wished
 to add another device, you'd need to remove one to make way for the new device. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To address your second query, we suggest checking the answer from <strong>Andre Da Costa</strong> on this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-10-digital-licence-and-microsoft-account/31f2a058-12ce-4a50-a2c2-3188bdfbb1a0">thread</a></strong>. Furthermore, as suggested

    <title>odbc linked table data type error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tedgriffin  say:</h3>
<h2>            odbc linked table data type error</h2>
                    <p><span>We are working in Access 2003 I think with SP 3 and object library 11, and 2007 with library 12.</span></p>
<p><span>We have come across a problem with the way MS Access through Oracle DBC interprets some Oracle Numeric data types which are interpreted as Decimal instead of
 long integer &nbsp;or integer. It recognises those equivalent to double OK.</span></p>
<p><span>At first it was annoying for joins in queries but I recently realised that it is causing some VBA code to fail by not recognising the data type. Apparently VBA
 does not support decimal.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I need the code to create Access tables equivalent to the Oracle tables the structure of which changes automatically as they are similar in nature to pivot tables.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can get around the error in code but would prefer that the linked table structure was correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas on fixing the linking errors?</p>

            <p>VBA can recognize the Decimal data type trough a VARIANT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dim x As Variant </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x = CDec(4 ) / 3</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note that a Decimal is NOT a DOUBLE. Indeed, a Double is a double precision FLOATing point number, while a Decimal is a SCALED integer. While VBA Decimal&nbsp;as a scale which can adjust itself, Decimal from databases work generally with a fixed scale that you
 define when you create the field.</p>

<p>Hi ufg,</p>
<p>Based on my experience, the migration issue could be related to multiple factors. To better understand the situation, may I collect some information?</p>
<p>1. Is it Exchange 2010 or 2013 based hybrid?</p>
<p>2. Based on your description, do you mean you manually complete the batch (by clicking the "Complete this migration batch" link on the right pane, after the link becomes active)? After that, this issue occurs.</p>
<p>If not, please correct me.</p>
<p>3. What is the current status of your migration batch? Could you provide a screenshot (click
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> in the forum, and then click insert image button&nbsp;post the screenshot)?</p>
<p>4. About the error log, where do you see it? Could you provide the entire one?</p>
<p>5. Connect PowerShell to Exchange Online: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj984289(v=exchg.160).aspx</a></p>
<p>And then run the follow command to view the migration batch information:</p>
<p><strong>Get-MigrationBatch | fl</strong></p>
<p>The logs contain your personal information. To protect your privacy, I have sent a private message to request it (Click
<strong>Private messages</strong> on the right side of the community site -&gt; Click the subject to view the message -&gt; reply to the message).</p>
<p>With the detailed information, we will do further troubleshooting.</p>

For us to better assist you, we need to identify first as to why some of your emails are deselected automatically when you deselect an email in your account. Kindly provide us the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you access your account using the Outlook app on your computer or do you sign in online through Outlook.com?</li><li>Can you tell us when did you notice the issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>

<h3> dead1nside  say:</h3>
<h2>            N82 Always Connected To Internet</h2>
                    
<p>My N82 is always connected to my Orange Internet access point using the packet data connection. If you try and close it with Connection Manager or holding down the red end call key and closing it, it just pops right back up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It all happened after I was having problems connecting to the internet and was sent some new settings by Orange. Now I can connect to the internet but it persists, and is always connected. I fear this is using data that I don't need, and also eating my battery
 life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate some help. Would perhaps upgrading to v31 help, as I'm on v30. Will I lose my data and saved applications?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks very much for your help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Failing that, how would I do a hard reset? Does this wipe the phone and the memory card?</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually it´s not the phone itself that wants to connect to the internet, but an application that wants to do so. You should check if there is any application running, that might want to connect to the internet. Press the menu button for 2 seconds and you´ll
 all applications that are running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this fails, you can still do a hard or a soft reset. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could try make a soft reset of your phone by pressing the following keys:<br />
<br />
<strong>*#7780#</strong><br />
<br />
If this doesn´t work out try a hard reset, which deletes all data on the phone and restores factory settings:<br />
<br />
<strong>*#7370#</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck and let us know what solved your problem! :=</p>

    <title>Win 10 1511 upgrade blew away my PC that had a VirtualBox I used for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pbug  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 1511 upgrade blew away my PC that had a VirtualBox I used for the build previews.</h2>
                    <p>My home built I7-2600k (not overclocked) tower ran Win 10 really well, and on it I had a VirtualBox installation running the build previews long before RTM. &nbsp;After 10 was official, I kept running build previews including 1511, which ran well. &nbsp;When 1511
 came out officially, I first upgraded a laptop with no issues. &nbsp;I then did the upgrade on my tower, leaving that system unstable and unusable with explorer.exe crashing and restarting about once per second. &nbsp;After numerous fix and rollback attempts, I finally
 used an rtm DVD to do a clean reinstall of 10 on the tower, and later ran the 1511 upgrade, this time without any problems except a broken Windows Update. &nbsp;However, I got hit with a few issues. &nbsp;I did get help from an MS tech in getting WU working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My 2 Win 10 1511 pc's have trouble seeing each other. &nbsp;That has now been mostly cleared up by opening ports in the firewall and adding "<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">AllowInsecureGuestAuth</span>"
 value 1 dword to "<span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters</span>", though it is still a bit flaky. &nbsp;It is my understanding that this is
 a fairly serious bug in 1511 that one hopes MS is working on. &nbsp;Even now, my laptop can see my homegroup connections on the tower, but it doesn't show in Network. &nbsp;Other way works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Network MAP is missing from 10; that was a nice tool. &nbsp;Really would like it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. My virtual pc in virtualbox started with the insider preview, which needed no license or activation. &nbsp;I lost it in the attempts to fix Win 10 1511, and don't have any spare Win 10 licenses to use for it. &nbsp;I still want to use Vbox to test new Windows builds
 and third party betas. &nbsp;How can I handle this problem? &nbsp;This is a serious problem for me, as I can't afford to buy a license to do this testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Virfranz Man</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a document in Word2016 (outlook365) on 2-25-2018 on my pc. It had 12 pages.<br />
I copied this document to my laptop while travelling to the USA. In the USA I made changes to this document almost daily. No problems were noticed.<br />
To be safe I sent the docment (now about 30 pages) after a few days with my gmail-account to my own mailbox.&nbsp;<br />
Yesterday I came home and moved (not copied!)&nbsp; the document (now 50 pages) to an USB-stick and copied it to my harddrive.&nbsp;<br />
The document was now only 12 pages!<br />
I opened my e-mailbox to restore the document I made when it was 30 pages: and that file has also just 12 pages. In both cases the date is set on 2-25-2018. That was the document I made at first!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both my laptop and PC runs on WIndows 10. My laptop has Word 2007.</p>
<p>On my laptop I saved my document under /documents.<br />
On my PC I save the document on a WD My Cloud Mirror.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course: I should have saved it directly in the cloud, but unfortunatly I didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is reason that the changes in my doc-files have disappeared?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Virfranz Man</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had not check my OneDrive Account before you asked, so I did now. But unfortunatly the wordfiles aren't there.&nbsp; I did not save my edited files on a different folder ( I already checked that). I saved it in the Documents folder.</p>
<p>The other options you mention doesn't work either. I did not save the file with the 'save as...' option</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it rather strange that Word does not store the processed files as they should</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help</p>

<p>Thank you for the information you provided. For us to further isolate your concern, I suggest that you try to use the Word application on the device you used when you edited the file.<em><strong>After opening the application, click File &gt; at the bottom part
 of the screen, you will see the Recover Unsaved Documents &gt; click the option and see if the files are visible</strong></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try opening the <em><strong>File Explorer &gt; search for ".asd</strong></em>". The extension will provide you all the unsaved documents on File Explorer.
</p>

            Hi Marielle
<p>
Thanks for your reply. I only want to know how this is possible. The document was stored correctly on my laptop. The full 50 pages. I opened en closed it several times succesfully. Only when I send the file to my e-mailadress it contained only 12 pages. And
 when I moved it to my usb-drive it also contained 12 pages. Where did my laptop store these pages then???

<p>This is a totally random observation that may help explain, or not.&nbsp; I've had the same issue (seemingly lost edits to documents) recently where I will be working on a document, but will do a "save as" (because I sometimes save each revision) and am prompted
 to select a folder.&nbsp; I select the folder and when it opens, where ever my curser is in the window, it will highlight whatever file it is pointing at and that same file name is auto-populated in the file name field at the bottom of the window.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If I'm not
 careful and I hit "save" before scrolling to the correct file in the list or typing in the name of the file I'm saving instead of what is in the auto-populated field,&nbsp; the file will save and overwrite whatever file that the curser was on.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have the same scenario when you save, one suggestion is open the folder and open other files that are shown to be updated around the dates you were working on the document.&nbsp; It may have saved as a different file.&nbsp; &nbsp;It happened to me a couple times.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Marcel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've been experiencing similar problems this summer. Students have been coming into the library at the university where I work and editing their dissertations, returning the following day and finding all changes have been rolled back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We assumed this was a USB issue as these are the cases that have been reported to us, but you example is so close to ours but on a hard drive that I'm inclined to think that it may be more widespread than first thought.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a nutshell, this is our experience:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>User creates a document, saves it</li><li>User works on document (often at a later date)</li><li>User says they do regular saves</li><li>User exits with save</li><li>User goes to edit document later (same machine or different), all changes rolled back</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I'm <strong>very</strong> experienced recovering lost documents and have found no file fragments or autorecovery files. We enable autorecovery every 10 minutes as well as the 'make a backup copy if user exits without saving' option. I've checked the file
 locations and there's no files there. I've tested the functionality and both are working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is interesting (and may be of some help to you) is I ran a data recovery tool on the USBs and found copies of the modified file that have been deleted. I.e., if the user worked on the file from 12:00 to 16:00 and hit Ctrl-S every hour after adding a
 page we found a deleted copy at 13:00 with +1 page, 14:00 with +2, etc., yet Word seemed to revert all changes back to the original on exit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect a couple of things: first, Word 'manage versions' is rolling back randomly. I don't know why. Second, users automatically connect to OneDrive (although they rarely use it) and although the files are not stored there, I wonder if one of the synchronisation
 settings is causing it to roll back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had no solution to this and can find no information online. It's a <em>critical</em> issue that will
<em>massive </em>problems if it's repeated when the students return. I've had four cases in the last month and suspect there were more earlier that were misdiagnosed but we've only had up to 30 or so students using the library during the summer break. In 2
 weeks users return and we'd expect traffic of upwards of 2,000 per day. And if we're experiencing this problem then our sister campuses (8 more - we support 3 universities) will be experiencing exactly the same as their setup mirrors ours closely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the thread I started. If you get any solutions, workarounds or clues to the issue I'd be obliged if you could post them:&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_word-mso_win10-mso_2016/word-2016-usb-file-recovery-questions/a6cfb14e-6a53-4c69-a41a-54e4067e34b3">Lost
 changes to documents after saving</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>* Edit - quick query Marcel. When you say you saved your document on your laptop over a period, did you fully close the document each time or did you save it then 'shut the lid'? I only ask because I wondered if the Word session remained open the whole time
 or it was several sessions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

<h2>            Word 2007&#58; Need help with wildcard search macro - pattern might or might not have &#34;&#40;&#34;</h2>
                    I'm trying to find a string of spaces followed by one or more numbers contained in a set of parentheses:<br />
" (1)"<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, sometimes the open parenthesis gets left off:<br />
" 1)"<br />
<br />
[NOTE: I keep trying to put 12 spaces before each of the examples above, but the editing program won't take them for some reason??]<br />
<br />
My current search pattern is:<br />
str(3) = "([ ]{11,14})([\(][0-9]{1,2}[\)])([ ]{1,})([A-Z0-9])"<br />
<br />
How can I adjust this to take into account the possibly missing parenthesis?<br />

            Unfortunately, you can't use {0,} to search for 0 or more occurrences of a character. I guess you'll have to perform two separate searches, one for the expression WITH a closing parenthesis, and one for the expression WITHOUT a closing parenthesis.

            I tried adjusting it to search for ["space" or "parenthesis"]{one or more of these}, but that didn't work:<br />
str(3) = "([ ]{11,13})([ \(]{1,}[0-9]{1,2}[\)])([ ]{1,})([A-Z0-9])"<br />

It seems like it should .... is that a misunderstanding of how that works?<br />

<p>The bracketing doesn't allow that, but try this:</p>
<p>str3 = "([ ]{11,14})([\(][0-9]{1,2}[\) ])([ ]{1,})([A-Z0-9])"</p>

            If I understand what you're looking for, the reporting options are not presented until you actually solve. IOW, the reports aren't "<span style="font-style: italic">pre</span>-selectable" in the
Answer</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">Sensitivity</span> &amp; <span style="font-style: italic">
Limits</span> Reports are then available in the <span style="font-weight: bold">Solver Results</span> dialog window.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't address your issue you'll need to provide at least some degree of descriptive detail. Unless you indicate what specific steps you're taking, exactly what is/isn't happening relative to your expectations, etc. there's no way anyone can offer
 meaningful corrective measures. It's also helpful to indicate your specific update level of Office.<br />
<br />

    <title>How to stop AutoFormating when making lists&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to stop AutoFormating when making lists&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Everytime I get to a point in the list where I have to bold and underline the first word, any bullet after that ends up formatting automatically to be bold and underlined, which I definitely do not want on every single bullet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this problem yesterday as well and was able to stop it temporarily by going to&nbsp;<strong>File</strong> &gt;
<strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Proofing</strong> &gt; <strong>AutoCorrect Options...</strong> &gt;
<strong>AutoFormat As You Type</strong> and unchecked the box saying “<strong>Format beginning of list item like the one before it</strong>”. Like I said it worked temporarily until I got done with my work yesterday. I started back up this morning and now it’s
 doing it again and the box is still unchecked so I have no idea what else I can do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone please help me out cause I am getting truly annoyed by this and by having to turn off Bold and Underline every new bullet.</p>

    <title>Exporting to .pst from online archiving office 365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exporting to .pst from online archiving office 365</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have enabled for some of my company users online archiving from office 365, after using this service I started to face a lot of hangs and delays while trying to access the archived emails from Outlook, and I don't want to say how bad the situation is when
 I try to search for an email, the Outlook just stuck and the only way to get it back is by closing the Outlook and reopen it again.</p>
<p>I have discussed this issue with office 365 support but its hopeless as they said this technology has limited features and they couldn't help me with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now one of my users and happen to be our Deputy CEO who receives around 40K emails yearly had enough with it and i'm trying to find solution which I would like to have your support guys with it if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First the retention policy for this user is the default one, which is any email older than 1 year will be moved to online archive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after checking the amount of emails moved to the archive I found that he have around 22 GB size of emails, I tried to export the emails to .pst file from the outlook but due to the emails size whenever I try to export them the process start but after some
 time is hangs and never finish till the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to use the eDiscovery tool from the Security &amp; Compliance portal but I couldn't figure out how to export only the archived emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My question is:</strong> Can anyone help me on how to export the archived emails to .pst file so I can disable the online archiving after that and just connect the file to the user Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>another point is the current emails in the user Inbox for only last year is around 30K so i'm having issues most of the times with the user .ost file as sometime this file reaches to more that 200 GB of size and after than decrease and sometime the Outlook
 just stops receiving emails without any reason and even with office 365 support the only solution is to delete the profile and create a new one and download the whole emails from beginning which is a really hard task to do with this amount of emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly advice me on how to target these issues with the .ost file and even if you can suggest a third party tools which are reliable and can help to better manage these users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hi Shyamal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your responses, currently I have no further questions, Microsoft support didn't support with this problem but thank you guys in the community, I have found a third party tool which can export the emails form the In-Place Archive but yet didn't
 try it for large mailbox sizes to know if it going to work. Also there is the manual way to do the job, I have stopped the archiving for now and I will manually move the emails from the In-Place archive folder to the user's mailbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope if anyone else has better methods to provide, or hope my methods can help someone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your effort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Azzawi</p>

<p>Skype does not keep a record of your Skype-to-Skype calls. The record of your Skype-to-Skype calls are in the conversation window of the contact.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot export this individually because the Skype calls data are inside the conversation. When you export your conversation into a CSV file
<em>(available on the classic Skype for Windows desktop) </em>only the history saved on your hard drive, according to your 'keep history for' setting, is exported.</p>
