    <title>activation is being a jerk all of a sudden... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            activation is being a jerk all of a sudden...</h2>
                    Greetings people of the microsoft community. I have recently been having quite the problem with windows activation.<br />
At the end of 2014, my parents bought me this computer, an HP beats 15 notebook, with a copy of windows 8.1 on it. It was pre activated with what I can only guess is an OEM key.<br />
In July 2016, I upgraded the computer to windows 10 by downloading an image via the media creation tool, running the setup.exe file inside the image on my windows, and upgrading the system.<br />
I have since reinstalled and formatted to attempt to correct various problems such as unbootable system, all the while preserving my activation.<br />
Recently, probably the last few days of December 2016 on into 2017, I noticed a watermark on my screen saying windows wasn't activated. Checked in settings and that was indeed the case.<br />
Settings would give me this error right off the bat in the screen.<br />
0xC004F012<br />
The activity I did before I suddenly noticed this error, though I can't remember if it was there before, was changing the ownership on the windows directory and subs to myself, so I could install some SAPI5 voices that were throwing access denied errors upon
 copying files to that directory.<br />
I have since changed it back to TrustedInstaller, thinking that could have been the case.<br />
Nope, still errors out. I used a utility by nirsoft to find my OEM bios key, and attempted entering that into the change product key dialog box. I get the next button, so I think it's a valid key. Hit next? I get this.<br />
0xc0000022<br />
If anybody could tell me what these errors mean and how I would go about fixing them that would be great! Because this computer was expensive and I don't think we can afford a reactivation payment...

            well, as I don't check my email often, I called up microsoft tech support and had them remote into my machine using mdt. They tried various system repair tasks, only finding that windows itself wouldn't actually execute upgrade. Oops? So they installed
 malwarebytes on my machine and found 16 threats, I guess they screwed up the windows folder while the ownership was off TrustedInstaller. Anyways, they installed something called "tweaking.com, windows repair tool," let it repair everything, and the next day
 after reboot the activation system immediately recognized my digital license.

                    <p>Skype for business desktop client always prompt and ask for password and verify Authenticator App when user out side office network and reboot the machine. Is here any way to prevent the client keep ask for the verification again unless user sign out the
 client manually?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, can Skype for business desktop client enjoy the SSO if user have signed in Office 365 service (e.g. SharePoint online) already? I my testing environment, it was failed but I am not sure is caused by misconfiguration.</p>

<p><span>Hi Duty Tse,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Based on your description, if you have enabled the MFA for your office 365 account, when you sign into the skype for business client, it would always ask for password until you entered the authentication password. As far
 as I know there is no other way to prevent the client asking for the verification unless you try to disable the MFA for the specific office 365 account.
<strong>However, we don’t recommended customers to disable the MFA in order to protecting your office 365 accounts</strong>. For how to disable the MFA, please refer to
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, if this cannot meet your requirements, it is recommended that please give a feedback and post your good ideas on
<a href="https://office365.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://office365.uservoice.com/</span></a>. Microsoft will always focus on customers feedback and some new features would be added to our products and services based on customers feedback
 and their good ideas in the future, your good ideas will be very helpful for us to improve our products and services, thanks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On another hand, for your last question, the Answer is Yes. As one thread focus on one question, If you need the further assistance with the SSO, the recommendation for you is that please post a new thread about your SSO
 related issues on Office 365 for Business category in this forum. When you post the new thread, please provide some related screenshots, the dedicate engineer would give you some further assistance regarding to your problems, thanks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your time and patience will be highly appreciated.</span></p>

            There are different kinds of blue screen errors depending on what's causing it. For some users, there are specific actiosn or activities that trigger certain drivers to not work how they're supposed to, hence, causing the blue screen errors. In your case,

</p><p>I can be busy browsing, typing an email, or even not doing anything and it happens... very strange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely Windows should be more stable than this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very frustrating and irritating as I can then not use my laptop for a day or so until it eventually works again...</p>

            <p>At the bottom of the page are several items to try. Have you tried any of them? If you are unable to do those then PLEASE before trying the below answer Bruce's questions. The below should only be used as a last effort as you
<strong>may</strong> lose old eMails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get the Windows XP disc handy...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Then go to <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; On the left select <strong>Add/Remove Windows Components</strong></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Scroll down the list till you see <strong>Outlook Express</strong> and remove the check mark</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Repeat steps 1 thru 3</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Scroll down the list till you see <strong>Outlook Express</strong> and put the check mark back</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will also suggest you <strong>uninstall</strong> CCleaner.&nbsp; That particular program should be used under the direction of a computer tech or someone who is
<strong>very</strong> computer savvy.&nbsp; As Bruce pointed out, they usually cause more harm then good and are only used when your machine is in really bad shape.&nbsp; Stick to something safe like MalwarBytes...</p>

            Your server has unexpectedly terminated the connection. Possible causes for this include server problems, network problems, or a long period of inactivity. Subject 'Good morning Stitch tidbits fans', Account: 'POP3', Server: 'smtp.att.yahoo.com', Protocol:

<br />
Oh I don't think I added that I am on DSL<br />
<br />
What I have done and what I have got--<br />
Changed FW to Zone Alarm from Windows firewall.<br />
Avast free is my AV I have tried to check to see if it was the problem but I can seem to I have tried turning it off with no success. I don't think it messes with the emails.<br />
Malwarebytes&nbsp;&nbsp; have had this for a while as well as the two programs listed below - and ran it on occasion - have run this<br />
Spyblaster -have this I think this just runs in the background and there is nothing more to do with this? correct?<br />
Spybot search and destroy. -have run this<br />
I have tried the OE Mail recovery - don't know how to use this so I just looked at it and sighed!<br />
<br />
CCleaner - this has been&nbsp; removed - I agree it was a very confusing program - I was always afraid to wipe out something I was not supposed but as I have said I am getting desparate - which in itself is not good because I do things that should not be done.
<br />
Windows Registry repair.&nbsp; It has been now removed form my computer and will never be used again -<br />
<br />
Settings are great because I can send emails but I can not send my newsletter - it has about 1,000 emails - I list them in the bcc they are in 6 folders separated by(semicolon). I have even tried to send just one folder thinking that- oh I don't what I was
 thinking except desperation. <br />
I have tried to recreate a new newsletter instead of using my old one and typing over it. I have checked the size it is 71MB -
<br />
I have even thought of recovery only to find there are no recovery points.<br />
I have been sending this newsletter for 1 year on this computer and about 8 months on this drive. I have 3 drives on this computer only one is accessible at one time. I could go back to the other drive - this would require going thru the bios and the other
 drive is slower than the ace of spades and the address book would not be up to date!<br />
<br />
I think this answers the questions in the above postings.<br />
<br />
"At the bottom of the page are several items to try. Have you tried any of them?"<br />
Gina - I guess I am (#$%^&amp;) because I am not seeing what you are referring&nbsp; TIA!!!!!<br />

<p>AT&amp;T Yahoo has a e-mail size limit of 20MB after encoding. It will never send and I sure wouldn't want someone sending me an e-mail that size even it it were possible.</p>

<p>I'm having the same problems. I just spent an hour with Xbox support who had me to a hard reset on my console which didn't make any difference at all. Now I have to reinstall all my apps and games and Skype still doesn't hear me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Kinect microphone works perfectly for voice commands and even recording video with the Camera app. But the other side in Skype calls cannot hear me at all. I even tried connecting a headset in the controller, but that didn't work, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There doesn't appear to be a way to select the audio device, just a video device. This is three months now and nobody seems to be working on it. Just put the old app back out there until the new one is ready for prime time.</p>

<p>The free Win10 upgrade offered expired on 29 July 2016 - but you could <em>purchase
</em>Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you could purchase <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/office-365-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 Home</a> ($99.00 USD/year or $9.99 USD/month!) and install it on your Windows 7 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, purchasing a brand-new compute with Windows 10 and MS Office 2016 preinstalled would probably be more economical in the long run (since Win7 won't be supported forever).</p>

    <title>Realtek driver won&#39;t load with ATI Radeon HD5670 - defaults to - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Realtek driver won&#39;t load with ATI Radeon HD5670 - defaults to HDMI - No Sound</h2>
                    
<p>I built a system using an Intel DX58SO motherboard and Gigabyte ATI HD5670 1GB. The motherboard has on board audio, and it is enabled in the BIOS (checked multiple times on many reboots).</p>
<p>Sound was working fine for a week (system was built last week) but suddenly went out. On reboot, device manager shows High Definition Audio Device only. Clicking the volume icon shows Digital Audio (HDMI). I do not have an HDMI ready monitor, and I do not
 have an HDMI cable plugged into the video card. I found previous solutions online that mentioned ATI's HDMI driver tries to take over as default and have implemented the solutions to no avail.</p>
<p>I have tried installing the latest Realtek drivers (5/15/2010), but doing so does not install the audio manager console. Realtek is also not listed in device manager. I have previously uninstalled and disabled (separate reboots) the HDMI driver to see if
 then rebooting would cause Windows to default to the on board audio with no success. Either the HDMI driver gets reinstalled automatically (Microsoft driver version 6.1.7600.16385), or I end up with a "No audio devices" message.</p>
<p>The operating system is Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>Any ideas would be very much appreciated.</p>

 installing printer, the wizard said device sharing was turned off.&nbsp; Could that be the problem with my phone and if so how do I turn it on.</p>

            Just recently got this desktop(refurbished).&nbsp; Installed the router.&nbsp; My internet comes from tower on my roof, wire to my modem, modem connected to router, router connected to PC.&nbsp; Wizard said the router was installed successfully.&nbsp; Tried my smart phone
 (android).&nbsp; Recognized my wifi, but after I entered password, wouldn't connect.&nbsp; My phone has always connected with other wifi.&nbsp; I've never had wifi in my home before. &nbsp; &nbsp; ANYWAY&nbsp; so then I installed wireless printer on my computer and tried it and it works
 fine off the wifi.&nbsp; When I was installing printer, a msg popped up saying something to effect that sharing with other devices was turned off.&nbsp; It asked me if Iwanted to share wifi and I clicked yes.&nbsp; My question is, Did I maybe only allow the PC to share with
 the printer and is there something I should enable to share with my phone??

<h2>            Xbox One not showing up on Monitor</h2>
                    
<p>Hey all!</p>
<p>2 days ago, my Xbox One was not showing up on my monitor that I use to game. However, when I tried my Xbox 360 to see if it was a HDMI port issue, it booted up perfectly. I then tried my Xbox One on my TV, and it booted up fine. I really don't understand
 the issue going on and I have tried many troubleshooting solutions but none have worked (Cold reboot, restore, reset on monitor, etc.)</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<p>TV: Both 360 and One works fine</p>
<p>Monitor: 360 works fine, One does not show up</p>

<p>What is the issue?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry you are having this issue.</p>
<p>Do you know by any chance if the Monitor you are using supports HDCP protocol? If it does not the Xbox One will not output to it. The reason the Xbox 360 would display if the monitor lacks supports for this feature is that the Xbox 360 only turns it on while
 playing protected content (Netflix or a DVD). On the Xbox One I believe it is always on.</p>
<p>That is my best guess as you said the Xbox One displays just fine on your TV.</p>

            <p>HDD passwords are normally set in the BIOS and can only be unset using the same utility [not Windows 7 itself].&nbsp; The arrangements vary between PC brands so you'll need to check in your BIOS, PC manual &amp; PC maker's support site.</p>
<p>In some PCs, such as many Dells, the BIOS "setup password" overrides the HDD password so you can use that to unset the HDD password - but only if your BIOS has this ability.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In others, the HDD password is completely independent so if there is no advice from the PC maker you have probably lost the HDD concerned &amp; any replacement you put on the same system.&nbsp; In this case, a specialist data recovery firm might be able to help you
 at a price.</p>

            <p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums where you can find answers to all your Windows related queries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have mentioned that some of the apps like Photos, messaging and calendar are not opening. We’ll help you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a few questions first, to get a clear picture of the issue;</p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When did this issue start? Did you make any recent changes to the computer before this issue started?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Did you get any error message when you tried to open these apps?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What steps did you follow to troubleshoot?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue could be caused due to some incorrect app settings or due to some corrupted system files. I would suggest you to try these steps and check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Modern app troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue could also be caused due to an app error. So, I would suggest you to download and run the Modern app troubleshooter to fix any app errors. You can download
 it here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the troubleshooter couldn’t detect any errors, then I would suggest you to try the troubleshooting steps mentioned in this link:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Clean boot</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.
 This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts. I would suggest you to perform a clean boot procedure to find out which service is causing this issue. Refer this link to perform a clean boot:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Note</b>: After troubleshooting, reset the computer to start as usual. Refer step 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3: Disable security software and check</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, security software like Antivirus and firewall can block certain services. If you have installed any third party security software, I would suggest you
 to disable them and check. </p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Important Note:</b> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable
 your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable
 to attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 4: SFC scan</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System File checker (SFC) scan is done to check if there are any corrupted system files that could be causing this issue. Refer to these steps to perform a SFC
 scan:</p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press Windows key + X, select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated command prompt</p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the command prompt type the following command: “sfc/scannow” and press enter</p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Now, restart the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we’d be happy to help.</p>
        </p>

            I was having the exact same problem&nbsp;- same apps - Calendar, Photos, Messaging, SkyDrive...all these apps access the internet when you open them.&nbsp; I finally figured out it was because of my Kaspersky Firewall.&nbsp;I first tested this by disabling Kaspersky
 altogether and was able to open all of my apps.&nbsp; Then I changed the Firewall settings&nbsp;and re-enabled Kaspersky.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you run Kaspersky, open the app, go to Settings, then Firewall, then Settings, then scroll all the way down to see the list of Untrusted Apps.&nbsp;
 I had 4 in the list - one was SkyDrive and the other three were Windows apps that you couldn't really tell what they were specifically.&nbsp; I right clicked on each and under Add to Group, chose Trusted.&nbsp; After saving these changes, I can now open all of my apps
 without issue.&nbsp; I'm not sure if this exposes me to risk, but...anyways, thank you for leading me in the right direction with #3 in this post.

            Hello Ralf, <br />
<br />
We'd like to get more information regarding this so we could further check and provide a more established workaround:<br />
<br />
• Confirm the current build your Windows 10 is running. <br />
&nbsp; <br />
• Any changes made prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
This error code is triggered when you try to set an external hard disk as your backup location. The issue can also occur when you're trying to install a major update to your Windows 10. The update relies on files that can be accessed from a direct download
 from Microsoft or&nbsp; an automatic update through the Windows Update. The error code 0x80070032 arises when you are trying to activate the Automatic File Backups setting. This option is located in the settings menu under the backup option. When you restart your
 PC to accept the changes made, the update fails to activate, thus the error code 0x80070032 appears.<br />
<br />
Moreover, run the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/512a5183-ffab-40c5-8a68-021e32467565/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update troubleshooter</a></strong> to scan and resolve issues,
 the error code should disappear once the troubleshooter finds it. <br />
<br />
We look forward to your update on this. <br />
<br />
Regards.

<p><span>Dear Jane,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>on this Laptop Windows 10 Creator is running. There was the same Problem with the earlier 1607.</span></p>
<p><span>I tried all USB ports and even without any USB Connection, always the same error.</span></p>
<p><span>I do not have any backups on this PC, there is a SSD and a HDD for Software and temp data only</span></p>
<p><span>My Music photos and so on are on two external USB drives with WD Red HDDs. I store all there twice manually.</span></p>
<p><span>Once a month I Transfer all this to a third HDD, a WD Green which I connect to the PC just for this Transfer and then I disconnect it to be safe from Ransomware.</span></p>
<p><span>So, there is no automatic backup in my Software. Also, the Troubleshooter did not solve the Problem.</span></p>
<p><span>And, I did not acvtivate the automatic file backups.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Best Regards, and have a nice day, Ralf from Germany</span></p>

<p>Error code 0x80070032 is usually related to signing in to your device and sometimes has to do with PIN issues. Can you confirm if this is the case? Are you able to get to the sign-in screen but is unable to input your PIN for some reason?</p>

<strong>Continue</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">3. Enter your Microsoft account password and then set up the new
<strong>Pin</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>If the error would still appear, the next method I suggest is to delete the NGC folder which is a proven in fully resolving this issue. Make sure that you're account has full administrator privileges and follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>File Explorer</strong> by pressing <strong>Windows key + E</strong> on your keyboard. Copy and paste this command on the address bar:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\NGC</strong></li><li>Delete everything within that folder.</li><li>Go to <strong>Settings-&gt; Accounts-&gt;Sign-in Options.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Add a PIN </strong>again and set your <strong>PIN.</strong></li><li>PIN sign in should work going forward</li></ol>

<p>Have you tried using the AVG Remover tool? <a href="http://www.avg.com/ww-en/utilities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.avg.com/ww-en/utilities</a>&nbsp;This should remove the AVG application. Remember that it is important that you have some sort of anti virus application on your PC. A good free one is Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE)&nbsp;

            <p><b><span>Hi Jtiburzi,</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><br />
1) Is this a <b>laptop or a desktop</b>?<br />
2) Have you made <b>any changes</b> on the computer apart from installing the <b>
Graphics Card</b>?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The <b>Graphics Card</b> might be interfering with the proper functioning of the Windows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><br />
<b>Method 1 –</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You need to <b>disconnect any external devices</b> connected to the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Restart the computer and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><br />
<b>Method 2-</b></p>
</span>&nbsp;
<p><span>You need to try <b>booting into the Low Resolution Mode</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>To do so, you need to follow the step “<b>Enable low-resolution video</b>” from the article mentioned below –</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you are able to boot into the low resolution mode then, you need to <b>
update the</b> <b>Graphic Card driver software</b>.</span></p>
<p>To do so, you need to follow the steps mentioned below –</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on “<b>Start</b>”, <b>Right Click</b> on “<b>Computer</b>” and select “<b>Manage</b>”.</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Open “<b>Device Manager</b>” and expand “<b>Display Adapters</b>”.</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><b>Right Click</b> on your driver and select “<b>Update driver software</b>”.</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Select “<b>Search automatically for updated driver software</b>”.</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><br />
<b>Method 3-</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The <b>graphics card</b> could not have been connected properly. You may try to remove and reconnect the graphics card and check if that helps.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may contact the <b>computers manufacturer</b> for assistance if you are not comfortable making hardware changes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><br />
<b>Hope this helps!!</b></span></p>

You also might want to check the BIOS settings, is the new card id'ed by the BIOS?.&nbsp; If you can only go to the start screen you should not have a problem getting into your BIOS.&nbsp; While you're there you might also check how the graphics card is using sys memory.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Does it use onboard card mem and then go to sys mem, just use card mem, just use sys mem?&nbsp; It sound like you're left hanging at the gate..if this, or the other advice don't help Create a profile within your bios for the NEW card installed.&nbsp; Re-install the
 old one, that wouild allow you to use Safe Mode, uncheck all of your programs that you can start manually, using "msconfig"&gt;"start-up".&nbsp; Reinstall new card, apply the "OTHER" profile, new card profile.&nbsp; Give 'er a whirl...i.e. reboot, see what happens.</p>

    <title>USB Drivers Suddenly Stopped Working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB Drivers Suddenly Stopped Working</h2>
                    <p>Windows 8.1 64 bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of 15/12/2015 all of my&nbsp;standard enhanced PCI to USB host controllers and USB root hubs drivers have all stopped working.</p>
<p>I discovered this when both my mouse and phone adapter failed to trigger any kind of response. I then checked my device manager to find that all of my USB drivers had yellow warning signs against them. I've tried updating them to no prevail and get an error
 messaging saying it was unable to update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reading several help forms I've attempted to reinstall just the USB root hubs, but after uninstalling both, and restarting my laptop they still have the error sign, are read as "Unknown device" and all fail to install/ updated when prompt. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was perhaps thinking of downloading the drivers manually, but I'm unsure of where to download them from officially.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me?</p>

<h2>            Apps couldn&#39;t be updated 80070002  Windows 8.1 store broken</h2>
                    This question seems to come up a lot, but none of the proposed solutions have helped me.
<div>Windows 8.1 update installed just fine from the windows store.</div>
<div>Since then no modern apps have updated in the windows store. Each time i gio there i get</div>
<div>29 apps couldn't be updated. &nbsp;If i click on the link i can watch all the modern apps fail to update with the error 80070002.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In order of most suggested solutions in various web sites:</div>
<div>1. I have trued to clear the windows store cache with a wsreset.exe. &nbsp;It does start the update process off fresh, but all the updates fail.&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. I tried to re register the windows update dlls, using a batch file . looked promising. did not work.</div>
<div>3. The windows store and windows 8 trouble shooter thingy (downloadable executable thing from links at microsoft support) told me:</div>
<div>&nbsp; problem installing recent updates - not fixed - (red X)</div>
<div>&nbsp; check for missing or corrupt files - detected (yellow !)</div>
<div>Great. How do i resolve those?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>4. plenty of reboots, in safe mode, etc. &nbsp;Can a $1,500 consumer device really require you to follow 3 pages or specific instructions in reconfiguring the boot sequence, trouble shooting, then undoing all that?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>From the windows desktop the usual windows update says i have no updates to install. Last installed updates were jan 11th 2014.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All help and suggestions appreciated. &nbsp;JF.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Aside: I notice that I try and avoid using my Win8 computer and end up doing less computer work now, compared to when i find a free windows 7 machine. I just want to work. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

            Hi Jonny,<br />
<br />
Are you able to install Windows Updates?<br />
<br />
If you receive Windows Update error 80070002 while checking for updates, you need to remove the temporary update files that Windows uses to identify updates for your computer. To remove the temporary files, stop the Windows Update service, delete the temporary
 update files, restart the Windows Update service.<br />
<br />
<p>Rest the Windows Update components, restart the computer, and install the Windows updates and check</p>
<p>How do I reset Windows Update components?</p>

            Thank you Ganesh. Here's what happened (still broken, new error code 0x80246007 for every app in the windows store)...&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Resetting windows update. Using the Fix It tool http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058/en-us&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Problems installing recent updates .... not fixed (red X)&nbsp;</div>
<div>Check for missing or currupt files... Detected (yellow !)&nbsp;</div>

<div><br />
<div>Windows Restart&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the windows store, "27 apps were not installed" (top right) clicked that link to get to "Installs" All say "this **** wasn't installed - view details" err code 0x80070002 I clicked "try again", get "Pending", "Installing", "This app wasn't installed"&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>PC is suddenly very slow and sliggish to respond. 2 second to 16 second lag from click to response. Maybe somehting is happening in the background? .. i went to the store to check. 16 seconds to get from the desktop to the tiles home page after clicking
 the window. 13 seconds to open the store. 13 to get to the updates. All the apps are updating. All are failing.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\WinStore \AppxManifest.xml Executed successfully (well no errors)&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Computer Restart&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Windows update says i am up to date. no hidden updates. only the Bing bar not installed. The windows store says 30 on the tile, and 27 apps updating in the store. click on that and see 27 apps all "Pending" All fail with a different error code. "This app
 wasn't installed - view details" "Something happened and this app couldn't be installed. Please try again. Error Code: 0x80246007"&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Progesss of sorts. Thank you for your help, what do you suggest next?</div>

            Hi Jonny,
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ignore the thread title, refer to the EwanD’s post <span>&nbsp;</span>replied on January 12, 2014 and check.</p>

<p>As a work around, create a user account and check the issue status in the new user account. This will help us to analyze the issue<br />

            I cannot download apps, with the error code 80070002 appearing. Furthermore, when I click on existing apps, I am returned with a blank blue screen. Can Microsoft send us a patch which resolves this? Consumers like myself who are not IT-savvy don't feel
 comfortable fiddling with the engine and it's not like we are supposed to encounter such problems.&nbsp;

            Not much happend today.
<div><br />
<div>

<div>Suggestion to install another app. &nbsp;</div>
<div>i can click on suggested apps, and a box appears arround them. but nothing happens. 30 seconds later i get dumped back to the desktop.</div>
<div>I can type in an app name into the search box, nothing happens. after hitting return the search box becomes unresponsive.</div>
<div>Repeat. click on a free app. get a search box and empty screen with a spinning circle. 2 minutes later no change, just the spinning circle.</div>
<div>The store is now stuck here. go back to desktop, then tile home page, open store, get the blank screen with a search box and spinning circle.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Add another user:</div>
<div>Following the video, typed "user", and clicked on "dd ... or delete other user accounts." Nothing happens. &nbsp;This is a work PC were user accounts are managed.</div>
<div>I can get the desktop windows user accounts window open if that helps you.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>So, the windows store is still broken. all app updates fail. the store does not install new apps. does not search. the live tile on the front seems to work. though reports 30 and in the store says installing 27 updates.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Stupid question - but why don';t you help me just re-install the windows store?</div>
<div>How can a mass-market main-stream operating system like Windows 8 be so fragile?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Edited to be more positive. But modern apps are still broken so your help is appreciated, cheers, J.</div>
