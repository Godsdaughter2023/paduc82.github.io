<h2>            Amount of time to Sync</h2>
                    I just signed up for the service yesterday. I will admit, I'm fairly new to the WinMo world and am working off a HTC Touch Diamond from Sprint. I started a sync up yesterday and everything went fairly quickly except the text messages. I had about 5k texts
 to upload and each took about 5 seconds. One, I didn't even know my phone saved all the texts I've sent and received so I was a bit surprised at that. The question though, should it take over seven hours to sync 5k texts? Sending over 50mbs worth of pictures
 went fairly quickly so I can't see why texts should take this long. <br />
Also, if I shut the phone, data and wifi off...why does it continue to sync? <br />

            Hi ZKoscica,<br />
<br />
First of all thank you for trying out the service. There's a known issue that we're working on while synchronizing a large amount of text messages. This will be addressed in future updates/releases.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

<h2>            Internet Explorer toolbars - view</h2>
                    I have IE 7 - with windows XP - My problem is with a particular toolbar. For some reason I just cannot show the toolbar (ALOT) when I click the toolbar in the dropdown menu view - "show toolbars". When I downloaded an updated version, I got a dialogue
 box - "you already have ALOT toolbar installed - update?" - this I did but still cannot show the toolbar. I tried to find the toolbar's location using search - and found it in C/windows/ prefetch - the others are all in their individual folders in the Programmes
 folder. I moved the ALOT toolbar into the ALOT folder in Programme files - still no success. Any ideas please? Just a footnote - I used to be able to access this toolbar, but about a month ago I hid it, to make room for something else - and haven't been able
 to show it since. Thanks for any assistance you may be able to provide <br />

<br />
Why should you run the McAfee removal tool? Because McAfee applications do <strong>
not</strong> uninstall cleanly and the "leftovers" may be affecting your computer performance. Trust me on this and just do it. ;)</p>

            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Where to begin?<br />
<br />
[You will want to print the following instructions for offline reference]<br />
<br />
McAfee (and Norton)&nbsp;applications are <em>notorious</em> for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly.</p>
<p>1. Download the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:
<a href="http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>3. Double-click on the file you saved in #1 above to run the utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.<br />
<br />
4. Uninstall AVG Free 9.0 &amp; reboot, then do a fresh install of AVG Free 9.0: This time select the CUSTOM install option and do NOT install (i.e., uncheck) Linkscanner, Search-Shield, Active Surf-Shield, Security toolbar, or any of the email scanning components.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • Why you don't need your anti-virus to scan your email&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://thundercloud.net/infoave/tutorials/email-scanning/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://thundercloud.net/infoave/tutorials/email-scanning/index.htm</a>
<br />
<br />
[Comment: I do not consider AVG to be a "decent antivirus" application but it's your computer.]<br />
<br />
5. Ad-Aware SE hasn't been supported for several years now. Uninstall it &amp; reboot again.<br />
<br />
NB: Please do NOT install the current version of Ad-Aware (v8.2.x)&nbsp;yet! (Trust me.)</p>
<p>6. Uninstall all third-party toolbars except Yahoo (Companion) Toolbar. (Trust me: When we're done, you can reinstall ALOT toolbar if you want.)<br />
<br />
Assuming all is well (i.e., Yahoo Toolbar is behaving itself and stays where you want it in the IE toolbar),&nbsp;we must now turn our&nbsp;attention to getting WinXP SP3 installed and here's why:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; • Extended Support for WinXP SP2 ends on 10 July 2010. After that date,&nbsp;your WinXP SP2 computer&nbsp;will NOT be offered any further critical security updates, Automatic Updates will not work, and Windows Update website will not be accessible until SP3 is installed.<br />
<br />
7. Here's an archived post of mine from WinXP General newsgroup to guide you:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; • HOW TO get a computer running WinXP SP2 fully patched<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.windowsxp.general/msg/a066ae41add7dd2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/microsoft.public.windowsxp.general/msg/a066ae41add7dd2b</a>
<br />
NB: You will probably be able to skip Step #4 in the above link.<br />
<br />
NB: I would NOT recommend that you install IE8 right now, be it manually or via Windows Update. (Again, trust me.)&nbsp;After you get SP3 installed, you will go to Windows Update website to install any critical security updates your computer may need. IE8 will be
 offered but I want you to <em>uncheck</em> it and then hide it ("Don't show me this update again").<br />
<br />
NB: If a Root Certificates update is listed in the Optional Software updates category on the left-hand side of the scan-for-updates results window, install it to take full advantage of IE7's enhanced security.<br />
<br />
Read &amp; heed:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • WinXP SP3 - Read all prerequisites for a successful installation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/harrywaldron/archive/2008/05/08/windows-xp-sp3-read-all-prerequisites-for-a-successful-installation.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
&lt;whew&gt;<br />
<br />
After you've gotten all of the above taken care of, post a reply to this thread &amp; let me know how you're doing.</p>

<h2>            Win 10 Pro Re-Install of Ver 1024, will not activate</h2>
                    <p>I run Win 10 Pro via Parallels on a Macbook, due to a lot of applications testing I decided to reinstall Parallels and Win 10?.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removed Win 10 Pro from my online account/profile and then re-installed Win 10 Pro from Ver 1024 ISO, all installs fine but Win 10 Pro will not Activate, seems the activation server see's the Re-install as an install on a different computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error code: 0xC004C003</p>
<p>Error Description: The activation server determined the specified product key has been blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would have hoped the activation server would have cleared me as I have ben a member of the INSIDER PROGRAM for a long while.</p>

            <p>If I understand it right, Parallels is like a VM running Windows.&nbsp; Each VM will have it's own device signature, because Windows licensing is per device, whether virtual or physical.&nbsp; This is how it works in Hyper-V also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you have a copy of the original Parallels VM, running on the same hardware, you could replace or&nbsp;clean the partitions from&nbsp;the hard disk of that Parallels VM and clean install Windows 10 and be activated.&nbsp; However, a new install of a Parallels VM is
 seen as a unique new device and has no registered device signature on the Microsoft Activation servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any backup that would contain an image of the original activated Parallels VM?&nbsp; If you have a copy of that activated Parallels "device" Windows 10 should clean install and auto-activate on it.&nbsp; If the original device has been deleted, there is
 no way to recreate the exact same virtual device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other way that was still working, to activate a new Windows Insider device, is to install and activate a build between 9926 and 10130, using the Windows 10074 product key.&nbsp; You need an ESD or ISO of one of those old builds.</p>

<p>
</p><p>thankyou, I fully appreciate that reinstalling parallels would make windows 10 believe it is on another machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, being a member of windows insider, I logged in to my profile, removed the reference to the existing win 10 install, removed the win 10 virtual machine from parallels, then removed parallels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>clean fresh new install of parallels, clean install win 10 from ISO 1024, checked my insider account and I see the appropriate entry showing win 10 via parallels, this should be seen by the activation server as a clean build by an insider with no other installs
 - so should activate, strange thing though it allows me to auto update on the fast track to 10525.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i can only assume that the activation servers are a slight overloaded and will catch up and activate ???..</p>
<p>
</p><p>no point in installing from anything lower than 1024, due to the date lock on the activation servers.</p>

</p><p>What I believe will work for you is to install and activate an Insider Pro Build between 9926 and 10130.&nbsp; The product key for 10074 still works for these old builds (or activate Windows 7 or 8 with a product key).&nbsp; Then use the official Windows 10 Pro ISO
 to upgrade to 10240 by mounting the ISO in Windows 10 Insider Preview, running setup.exe, choosing to keep Windows settings and files and not entering any product key during or after the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can still download ESD files for the old builds from Microsoft if you have a
<a href="http://ms-vnext.net/Win10esds/urls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a> for them.&nbsp; ESD files can be turned into ISO's for installation of the old Builds (search ESD Decrypter in these forums). Build 10074 product key is also searchable in these
 forums and still will activate several old builds, unless there has been a very recent change.</p>

            You are correct.&nbsp; It does say that.&nbsp; Yet I have tested very recently&nbsp;that this one Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview product key still works on several older Builds.&nbsp; You can try it in Hyper-V if you want first, but you need to have or to be able to create
 one of those old Build ISO's to do this.&nbsp; This is not to suggest that this could provide a free, permanent Windows 10 license to any device that does not have a Windows 7 or 8 license.&nbsp; We have been told that any install that did not upgrade from a Windows
 7 or 8 license and leaves the Insider Program&nbsp;will eventually expire.&nbsp; But as long as this product key remains working, it allows a new device to activate Windows Insider Pro and upgrade to activated Windows 10 build 10240 and/or 10525.&nbsp; I have done this several
 times, using a Build 9926 ISO in Hyper-V and once on my daughter's old Vista laptop.&nbsp; Unfortunately the laptop has since quit working, as it has a faulty video adapter and happened to w

<h2>            Strange issue with inline images in Word 2013, Compatibility Mode</h2>
                    <p>There are times when I need to use Compatibility Mode in Word 2013 (there is a very convoluted, but real reason, and another topic for another day).&nbsp; When I paste inline images with a border, the top border is cut off both onscreen and in print.&nbsp; The same
 image looks fine when the document is saved with the new file format (but, as alluded to earlier, I have other problems).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is more of a curiosity thing:&nbsp; has anyone else seen this happen?&nbsp; Aside from moving to the new format, can you think of a workaround?</p>

            Since the image is "In line with text," look at the value for Line Spacing (Paragraph dialog box). Try increasing the value. In particular, make sure the spacing isn't set to an exact amount which is too small for the height of the image.

            <p>Thanks Stefan (and I apologize for posting this in the wrong forum!).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that isn't it.&nbsp; I can set the line spacing to something ridiculous like Multiple: 4 and still that top border is chopped off.&nbsp; (Below is a screenshot - which I hope comes through).&nbsp; The image is on the second line and the top border doesn't
 show.&nbsp; If the image is on the first line of a paragraph, it seems to work.&nbsp; As I said, the same image/text renders correctly in Word 2010 OR if I convert the document to Word 2013 format.&nbsp; It's just in Compatibility Mode where it doesn't work.&nbsp; All ideas and
 suggestions are appreciated.</p>

            My experience in Word 2003 is that, for some reason, when a bordered graphic lands at the top of a page, where its Spacing Before is suppressed, the top border is (sometimes) cut off. The only way I have found to remedy this is to remove the Spacing Before
 and format the image as "Page break before."

<p>Well...., it's not at the top of a page.&nbsp; The image above (which I really hope comes through this time) is a standard paragraph in which I increased the line spacing to Multiple: 5 to make sure the image had enough room to print.&nbsp; As you can see, there's
 plenty of white space between lines.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I convert to Word 2013 format, the text doesn't actually move - the image is in exactly the same place... but, the top border prints.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It's not the end of the world, but it's odd behavior for sure.</p>

<h2>            How to indent first line of paragraph in outlook.com &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>How to indent first line of paragraph in outlook.com ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In GMail you can simply use the "TAB" key exacly like you would do it in a word document. How can you manage to do this in outlook.com ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the increase indent but it moves the whole paragraphe and not only the first line. Also, when using the indent, it adds like 2-3 lines of space between my paragraphe once sent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks so much,</p>
<p />

            One way to do it is to click the "Increase Indent" icon before typing your first line, ending that line with an explicit Enter, then clicking the "Decrease Indent" icon. for the second line.&nbsp; The drawback to that is the receiving mail system may treat
 the explicit newline as a paragraph mark and provide too much white space between the first and second line.

            Seems like the only work around is the old method of type 5 spaces at the beginning of each paragraph.

<p>Hey guys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acer recovery didn't work. Neither did booting from my recovery dvd. The pc was useless, going through the boot up process which took about 20 min each try and I must've rebooted 50 times yesterday with no luck. No WiFi, no Bluetooth no control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually I just went into damage control mode, used task manager to kill explorer.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then restarted Explorer.exe&nbsp;</p>
<p>My desktop icons showed up.</p>
<p>But nothing else, no settings, or start.</p>
<p>Then I doubled checked my last back up for integrity on my portable hdd. Luckily it connected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logged into bios, changed from Eufi to legacy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Held alt + f10 and power button&nbsp;</p>
<p>While booting I hit f8</p>
<p>Entered safe mode acer recovery</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then, with the burden of defeat weighing heavily , I reset my pc to factory .</p>
<p>
</p><p>It returned to life after about 4 hours, with cortana singing me a song and fully functioning 17672. What a pleasure .</p>
<p>Restored my back up from the hdd. And I'm back on the fast ring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gosh, I love windows. Hahaha!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never a dull day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope my information helps guys,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Hey Tony. Sorry to hear that things are not working out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried the ffg to get your files back? Basically create a new back up of your files and folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will work your if pc is booting into factory recovery mode and giving you options to rollback or reset.</p>
<p>It usually starts with asking you which keyboard settings you want, like you are installing Windows for the first time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Choose to refresh this PC. </p>
<p>It will show you 3 options to boot with. Win 10 Volume 4, Win RollBack and Win 10 volume 4 again.
</p>
<p>The second Win 10 is 17672.</p>
<p>Choose it and you will boot into windows. But it will look as if you are doing a fresh install.
</p>
<p>It will greet you.."Hi" and tell you not to worry, and they are getting you ready for an online world. Just let it play out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you will presented with a blank desktop and a non functional task bar.</p>
<p>But all your cmd run commands are fully functional. Just type Win + R and if you are good at command line, you can do anything you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not good at cmd line then press Ctrl+Alt+Del and open task manager.
</p>
<p>Try killing and restarting explorer.exe. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If it works, great. If not then just click File then Run new task. </p>
<p>You are not actually going to run a new task. The aim here is to get a functioning file explorer window that you can use to get access to all your pics and files and folders.</p>
<p>Click browse and browse to folder that you want to back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plug in your HDD and copy and paste should work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will take ages. But hey, at least when you do reset to factory, you still have all your lovely memories.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>A.J</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply, the issue I had, the computer would not start up, hence I could do nothing with the F-Keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did was, get the windows 8 disk, out, put in the cd-rom, open the boot options up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot the computer using the windows 8 disk, reload windows 8, but keep all the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked. and installed windows 10 again, all files were ok, the only issue is that it removed about 130 apps from the computer, so now just installing the apps again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>question I asked, is why is it hard to speak with anyone at Microsoft when you have issues, and the tech staff, do not support the inside updates,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its crazy :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the help :-)</p>

<p>Hey Tony. I am glad that you managed to get your files back. From now on, please remember to use a backup program for
<p>
</p><p>Also, now please remember to create <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>recovery disc for your current Win install! Important!</strong></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing about the Fast ring insider program that I learned is that it is not really supported by MS. It is community driven. And we all are part of that community.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not meant for you to get the "inside scoop" on new releases, so to speak. For this you must be on the slow ring. I actually put my gf's pc on the fast ring, knowing it will break at some point. And she uses it for business. LOL! Shes the perfect beta
 tester. Totally unaware of whats going on with it. But I hear about every single hang or error on a daily basis. Perfect anonymous testing. LOL!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Fast ring is really meant for devs/debuggers. Meaning, that if you are not comfortable with cmd, safe mode, error reporting and recreation and those kinds of things then the Fast ring is really not meant for you. Basically, if you are on the Fast ring
 with a PC that you are sentimental about...you are asking for trouble. Hehehehe!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a coder/debugger like myself, In have no real problems with doing a hard reset, reverting to Win 7 or vista, or 8.1, fiddling with the reg, cmd commands...I think you know where I am going here. I also do not use a pc that I am not willing to hard reset
 if i fail.</p>

<h2>            Why do some websites look different in IE as compared to other browsers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if this is the correct place to post this, but as per the title, I'm wondering why some websites render differently in IE as compared to other browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed that sometimes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The font size is different</p>
<p>2. Certain object[?] shapes are different i.e. it would appear as a square in IE whereas the same object would be a circle in other browsers.</p>
<p>3. The resolution of the website appears different i.e. the website would appear narrower in IE as compared to other browsers, or objects that would be on the same line in other browsers appears on different lines in IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, does this occurrence happen with Microsoft Edge as well? I hope I make sense. I mean to say that, like IE, will websites look different in Microsoft Edge as compared to other browsers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>It depends on many thing including version of IE which you are using and standards which websites are being followed. One common mistake of most web developer is they won't test their website properly and ideal website would be the one which work great in
 all browsers.</p>
<p>In recent version of IE and Microsoft Edge more standards are being supported, in addition, you could always use feedback option in IE11 and Microsoft Edge to report these issues.</p>

<h2>            Unable to locate mailbox after converting to shared</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently migrated a user mailbox from on-prem to the cloud through remote move migration. The user was assigned a license before the move.</p>
<p>The move was completed successfully. After the move I removed the users license and then converted the mailbox to a shared.</p>
<p>Since that I am unable to find this mailbox. Any advice on how I can recover this mailbox.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Rizni,</p>
<p>This is the problem. Although you didn't see any error when converting the mailbox to shared, the mailbox is already disabled at that moment.</p>
<p>For this situation, you can assign a license to the user to restore the mailbox. Then check whether it's converted to shared correctly. If yes, then it's ok to remove the license.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

    <title>MS Project... linking custom finish field with start field and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeremy bautista  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Project... linking custom finish field with start field and predecessor field</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recently started using MS Project at work for large project tracking. At the beginning of the project we enter Work hours Start date, set up the predecessors and everything is good. As we update the % complete column, the system automatically updates
 the Remaining Work field. The finish date field did not update accordingly so I created&nbsp;a custom Finish field that basically added the Remaining Work value to today's date. It provides us with a way of only having to update the % complete field and getting
 a real time completion date update based on our progress. (If there is a better way to do this without a custom field, I'm open to that too.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I now need to link my custom Finish field to the predecessors because we want the start dates of future tasks to automatically fluctuate with the new real-time custom finish date field. I hope that is a clear enough explanation!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would really solve my problem if the original finish date field would update based off % complete and remaining work hours. If there is a way to make that happen please let me know!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. thank you!</p>

            <p>Jeremy,</p>
<p>First of all what version of Project are you using? Is it updated with the latest service pack?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the description of your process, there are some items missing. You indicate you enter work, start date and predecessors. What about resources, do you assign any? How about the duration of your tasks? Note that work and duration in Project are two different
 things. Duration is the working time span from start to finish. Percent complete is a duration based measure. Work on the other hand is the amount of effort one or more resources need to complete a task. Percent work complete is a work based measure. If a
 single resource is assigned to a task full time, then work and duration will be the same. Normally that is not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you update your tasks, unless you tell it otherwise, Project assumes you are executing on plan, so why would you expect the finish date to change? If the task is not on plan, then you need to perform your update such that the finish date is pulled in
 or pushed out to reflect the current plan. Saving a baseline at the onset, allows you to compare how your plan is unfolding compared to how it was initially planned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you jumped into Project without really understanding how it works and how to best use it. Project is not particularly intuitive and does have a learning curve but once you understand the basics, it can be a powerful tool. You might want to
 consider getting some training. You might want to check out this source:</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We do eventually enter resources but on this project we haven't yet because I wanted to get everything else set up correctly first. We also use duration but are still a little confused how duration relates to work... I know the % complete is duration based
 but, if % work is hidden and untouched, % complete actually affects both equally.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are correct about my project experience. We have a need to use it at work but no one has experience with it... because of my computer literacy and high level of experience with other Office products, such as Excel, I've been tasked with "figuring it
 out". Basically, here is how I want Project to work for me..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be able to set up tasks, start dates, work hours, and predecessors once we start a project then update the % complete (or % work complete) as the project progresses and have the dates auto-update based off what Remaining Work hours it is currently
 at from the current date. Do you know what I mean? I guess my first question would be.. is Project capable of doing that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>So I was doing more reading and I think&nbsp;I am understanding how to use Project more. I have one question though.. see the screenshot below</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0a448a1b-7f30-42d1-a9f6-7c16531ddb7c" /></p>
<p>I set Fixed Work and assigned two resources so that is why the duration is 150 hours, not 300. I put 50% complete and the Remaining Duration and Remaining Work adjust accordingly... but why doesn't the Remaining Duration play a role in establishing a new
 finish date? Shouldn't the finish date automatically pull in?</p>

            <p>Jeremy,</p>
<p>Why would the finish date pull in? As far as Project is concerned, everything is on track. I think the best way to see what is happening is to look at the Task Usage view. When you set up the task, you will see that Project automatically linearly spreads
 the 300 hrs of work over the 150 hrs of duration. By setting the percent complete to 50%, you have simply said that the task is half done and Project is showing you that it will continue as planned up to the finish date, unless, you edit the task by upping
 the assignment level of either or both resources, or assign more resources or something else that will alter the finish date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't wish the work to be linearly spread over the full duration, you can set a different work contour either by selecting one of the choices in the Work Contour field, (assignment field), or manually contouring the work in the beginning to be what
 you want/intend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Project calculates a schedule using what is called the work equation:</p>
<p>Duration = Work/Units</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as your desire to have Project dates "auto-update", it doesn't work that way. Project has zero intelligence, it doesn't not "know" what you want to do, it only can respond to your inputs. But as I said previously, once you understand how it works,
 it can be an invaluable tool.</p>

            As I've been thinking about this, I think I framed the question incorrectly... is there a way to have all finish dates update based off either Remaining Duration or Remaining Work from today's date? That is ultimately what I want it to do.

            <p>Jeremy,</p>
<p>We're not quite on the same page. Why would the finish date change if no work content has been removed or no additional resources assigned?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take an example. Let's say you have a task that is estimated to take 40 hrs effort to complete. It starts on Monday. You assign one resource full time. From the work equation, the duration will be 5 days, (assuming the standard calendar), so the task will
 finish on Friday. The status date is Wednesday 5:00 pm. You update the project through the status date, so the task is 60% complete. The remaining work is 16 hrs. Since the resource works full time, that means he has two days work left so the finish date is
 still Friday. The task is on track. However, if you set the percent complete at 75% (i.e. the task is ahead of schedule and remaining work is 8 hours), then Project will recalculate the finish date as Thrusday. So yes, Project will update the finish date but
 only if you tell it that something has changed.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help thus far. I agree that we were not on the same page.. and I accept blame for that... I wasn't very clear from the get go. I think we are starting to get on the same page though. Your example was&nbsp;half of&nbsp;what I was talking about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to recreate&nbsp;your example and it didn't work. I set the above task 1 to 80% and 90% but the finish date did not pull in. Am I doing something wrong? Do I need to change something in the settings?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also created another example in which task 2 was to start ASAP after task 1. When I put task 1 to 100%, why wouldn't the finish date pull in to today and task 2 begin immediately?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did both hit calculate project and update project to the status date. For the status date, I tried both yesterday and today.</p>
<p>

            <p>Jeremy,</p>
<p>Let's see, did I mention earlier that Project is not particularly intuitive? Yes, I did, so I can appreciate why you are struggling. I also told you that Project is not intelligent, it is only a sophisticated schedule calculator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinforcing those statements, let's try a very simple approach. I have a 5 day task that starts on Monday of next week. It has one resource assigned full time so the work is 40 hrs. Now it is Monday and I declared the task is 100% complete. You are thinking,
 so why doesn't the finish date slide back to Monday? Because lacking any other input, 40 hrs of work does not fit into one day, so all Project can do is to show that the task was completed exactly as planned (i.e. start on Monday and finish on Friday). Remember
 it is just a "dumb" calculator. If Project had intelligence it would probably say, "wait a minute, you told me you have a 5 day task that will take 40 hours to complete, but then you tell me you got it all done in one day. How you do dat?" Great question,
 right? You would either need to tell Project that the task didn't really take 40 hours (i.e. it only took 8 hours), or maybe the task started last week and it really did finish today [Monday], so the original plan wasn't quite accurate. Wow, that's a lot of
 intelligence to reconcile our "simple" task. So how do you "tell" Project what to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To provide Project with data to reschedule the task as it really happened, Project has multiple actual fields (e.g. Actual Start, Actual Finish, Actual Work, etc.). If a task is on plan, Project will automatically transfer the start date into the Actual
 Start field. And when the task is 100% complete, Project will automatically transfer the finish date into the Actual Finish field. In our first scenario wherein the task really only took 8 hours work to complete and not the 40 originally estimated, after setting
 the percent compete to 100%, we can enter Monday into the Actual Finish field. We have just told Project that the task was in fact only a one day task, so it adjusts the work to be 8 hours. But what if the work really was 40 hours. Well, the task obviously
 didn't start on Monday, it probably started last week, Tuesday perhaps. So before saying it is 100% complete, we enter last Tuesday into the Actual Start field. Note that when we do that Project recognizes the plan is changed and therefore the finish date
 is moved up. There's that finish date change you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we are doing in all this is actively managing the schedule. We have an initial plan. Project calculates all our dates based on the inputs we have given it. We baseline that schedule to preserve out original plan for later comparison (e.g. Tracking Gantt,
 various variance field, earned value metrics, etc.). Now we start executing our plan. As we do, we need to inject reality into the plan (e.g. actual values, remaining values, etc.), so our schedule calculator [Project] can show us how our plan is unfolding
 and how it is likely to complete based on original inputs modified by reality as it occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the mud clearing?</p>

            <p>Hello John and all,</p>
<p>we Project users are so acccustomed to This Logic (100% is done as planned) that we think it is the only logical way. But recently I got into a discussion with top Primavera specialists and This is the one and only feature They not just questioned, They
 conside it idiotic and totally unacceptable. 100% &nbsp;means finished today, and other values will adapt. Of course we have to defend Project's views but They are not the one and only "belief"!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have almost the exact situation as Jeremy&nbsp;using MS Project 2010 Version 14.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to relay my understanding.&nbsp; You're telling us that Project does not have the functunality to automatically reschedule a task when its predecessor has been completed ahead of schedule.&nbsp; Is that correct?&nbsp; In other words, it is not a schedule calculator
 so much as it is a baseline calculator and a schedule representer.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>It would, if you use the format Custom [h]:mm .&nbsp; The "[h]" displays more than 23 hours, unlike "h".&nbsp; I would use that format for all time calculations (column G, H and I) as a matter of "good practice", even if "h" might suffice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you said you want decimal hours.&nbsp; The following formulas allow for spanning across midnight.&nbsp; They also avoid misleading and zero calculations when input is incomplete.</p>
<p>

<p>Total Hours, I14: =IF(G14="", "", G14+H14)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Format cells as Number with 0 or more decimal places (your choice).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Note a correction to my previous formula:&nbsp; the "midnight factor" should be of the form
<span>C14<strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&lt;=</span></strong>B14</span>, not just <span>
C14<strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&lt;</span></strong>B14</span>, so that the result is 24 hr when C14=B14, not zero.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;Excel stores numbers in a binary form.&nbsp; Binary arithmetic can introduce infinitesimal "errors".&nbsp; It is prudent to explicitly round calculations&nbsp;to the precision that you want to be accurate.&nbsp; For example,</p>
<p>MATCH(("5:00"-"4:00")*24,{1},0) returns #N/A (not a binary match), whereas</p>
<p><span>MATCH(<strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">ROUND(</span></strong>("5:00"-"4:00")*24<strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">,0)</span></strong>,{1},0)</span> returns 1 (exact match).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Likewise, if you want fractional decimal hours accurate to the minute, it is prudent to use the following paradigm.</p>
<p>MATCH(("5:23"-"5:08")*24,{0.25},0) returns #N/A (not a binary match), but</p>
<p><span>MATCH(<strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">ROUND(</span></strong>("5:23"-"5:08")*<strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">1440,0)/60</span></strong>,{0.25},0) returns 1 (exact match).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>4. The explicit rounding in #2 and #3&nbsp;might not be necessary if you only intend to display the results, not reference them in other formulas, especially&nbsp;lookup tables.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Why did the SE icon in the notification area disappear&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I turned on the computer and at some point today noticed the icon for securtity essentials was missing from the notification area on my desktop. The program is still installed and the shortcut is still listed in the program list. I clicked on it and it ran
 but the little icon is stilll missing from the notification area. Is this normal for it to disappear? Is this a problem or something I shouldn't be concerned about?</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, especially if activating Mail for Exchange also includes setting up a required lock password a full reset is required to return to the state before the Mail for Exchange mailbox was set up;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a full backup in <a href="http://nokia.com/nokiasuite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Nokia Suite</a> (Tools/Backup), but deselect the option to include settings when asked.
</li><li>When complete reset by dialing *#7370# and entering the security code 12345 when asked.
</li><li>After the reset is complete go through the device first use setup making sure time and date are correct.
</li><li>Check for and install any available updates in Nokia Suite, consider re-installing the latest system software.
</li><li>After the updates are complete restore the backup if required. (Tools/Restore in Nokia Suite)
</li><li>Install used maps as required through Nokia suite where applicable. </li><li>Download previously used apps again as required. Paid apps can be found in your
<a href="http://store.ovi.com/mystuff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">personal section</a> in <a href="http://store.nokia.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Having separate app for email and calendar in Outlook app on Android - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Having separate app for email and calendar in Outlook app on Android phones</h2>
                    Hi, I am forced to use Outlook app in my Android 8.1.0 phone as the Gmail app is not compatible with Office365.&nbsp; Many times the outgoing emails get stuck in Outbox and it say No Connection. They have a separate Calendar app and GMail app for emails, which
 is very convenient as we can kepp both apps running. With Outlook app, emails and calendars are separate tabs. So we can be only on one at a time and cant keep both open. Is there a way to do it or to have the Calendar app on Android sync with my calendar
 entries in Office365. One way is to add my Office365 account to GMail so that the calendar entries show up on the Calendar app but use the GMail app just for my GMail account and Outlook app for my Office365 emails. Thanks

<p>Hi GLP59,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The emails and calendars are separate tabs in Outlook for Android, it's by design. So, you just can see one at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For having Calendar app on Android sync with your calendar items in Office 365 account, the only way is to add your account to Calendar app (Gmail app) as you mentioned. If you don't want to add your Office 365 account into Gmail app (also we don't support
 this), there is no other option to perform. Default calendar app just can show up your calendar item but cannot show up emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your requirement, you can submit your feedback about Outlook for Android via

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding,</p>

    <title>The microsoft reader for pdf files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bpczod  say:</h3>
<h2>            The microsoft reader for pdf files</h2>
                    <p>Ok first off I have to say that it is very functional and works as it should. I can edit pdf files and open them with no problem. The issue is that it doesn't print from the reader program. All other programs print just fine. My HP printer is the default
 printer and all other programs see It. Reader does not see it and will not print from it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also there is no way to right click&nbsp;any pdf and print. I'm sure it just needs a little tweaking keep up the good work. My quick fix was to install Adobe Acrobat Reader but I think a lightweight app from Microsoft would be a better alternative.</p>

<p>How long have you been running it?&nbsp; Keep in mind that archive works off the MODIFIED date of the items so even if you received an e-mail 6 months ago, if you moved it to a folder last week then the modified date is last week for archive purposes.</p>

<h3> rjungers  say:</h3>
<h2>            This whole NEVER ABLE TO REUSE a password is CRAP.</h2>
                    If that cannot be changed in the future you lost at least one person...not that you care because you are Microsoft....but I at least have to say my peace. what person will NEVER re-use a password. That is insanity. Do you know how many times a person will
 forget their own password? I forget mine like...monthly. so that is like 12 times a year. You really expect a person to come up with that many new passwords in their lifetime. You are very misinformed. You are making it so that now I want to make my passwords
 easier to remember...which in turn would make them easier for others to get. Instead, you could allow the re-use of a password like every 10 times and my password would always be super secure. Whatever...this isn't going to change anything but know that it
 is the one thing that will make me stop using your service over someone else's....ie: Gmail.

            I will probably be looking to change to a different email client for personal use as well. &nbsp; The never reuse old password is not very practical.&nbsp; As an IT professional, I think this policy is definitely the first time I've seen it.

<p>Oh I do feel your pain. Microsoft security is an illusion, and this oppressive Password policy reveals a true lack of understanding as to what do real world users actually need to function, especially if some of them are Microsoft professionals with obvious
 multi-systems field work needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after 25 Years of being a die hard Microsoft professional fanatic, I gave up in 2016 and switched entirely to Linux and retired Outlook just to escape the drudgery of the constant OS upgrades (or dare I say the ever increasing control freak policies &amp;
 bloatware). Since then I started switching my multiple Outlook accounts to Gmail until I go live with my own IRedMail Server to end this "Blocked" accounts torture just because I dare to work remotely on my Client's Sites, but Hey; Apparently I need to be
 stopped from hacking my own accounts!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another example of MS Security lunacy, the Windows 10 Four digit pin code policy, Well MS has banned using repetitive or sequential pins (1111, 1234...etc), So it has become tempting for some users to use their 4 pin ATM code because they can remember that
 code which if hacked; could risk their bank balance too, Was that policy really wise? It would have been better to increase the code to 6 digits and add a detailed advisory note.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It really is no surprise that a substantial number of IT professional (All my work friends to say the least) have switched to Linux with Thunderbird and LibreOffice as their primary SECURE environment, I have also long ceased to recommend MS OS to anyone,
 Not unless it is absolutely unavoidable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Must Allow Users To OPT OUT OF THIS OPPRESSIVE POLICIES!!!</p>

<p>We were notified that Windows Live Hotmail Plus service(s) email is trying to bill our credit card - which recently changed.&nbsp; However, it is requiring we get a code and/or update the security in order to go on to the billing.&nbsp; SO, we did - only the email
 it goes to no longer exists.&nbsp; How can we get someone to help us get this fixed.&nbsp; When we went in to update the email it says there is a 30 day period before you can do anything - in the meantime our service won't be able to get billed.&nbsp;

 account shouldn’t run into this error message. Take a look at the link before for step by step instruction to create a new user account. Then test the new user account to see if the same error occurs. If not continue with the steps provided in the link below
 to transfer your user data over to the new user profile.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows Defender problem on recent Insider Preview update</h2>
                    <p>Windows Defender is showing a problem with it's settings and after hitting the restore many times and rebooting after doing so, the program still shows that a settings restore to default&nbsp; is needed.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d707ccb-7e7b-4321-aa41-e2366e3fe646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d707ccb-7e7b-4321-aa41-e2366e3fe646" /></a></p>
<p>This pix shows the warning but does not give text as to the problem.</p>

            I had voted up a Feedback Hub posting two days ago about seeing yellow warning icon around Windows Defender but no actual problem. Then yesterday I got Feedback Hub notification from MS that they&nbsp;were&nbsp;aware of this problem. MS said that this problem should
 be fixed by next insider build and if all 4 monitor points have green check marks then Defender is actually okay
