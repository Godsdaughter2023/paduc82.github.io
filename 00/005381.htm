<h2>            Excel opens multiple instances on PC startup</h2>
                    <p>I'm having this strange problem with my work PC. Whenever I log in after shutting the computer down (weekends) Excel opens about 15 instances of itself with blank pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can close them and they don't re-open, it's just really annoying. Running Office 365 with the latest updates. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Will,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please firstly check the Startup list of your Windows 10 referring to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/4026268/windows-change-startup-apps-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>. If Excel is in the list, disable it to see the outcome. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If Excel is not in the list, I'd like to confirm the following things:</p>
<p>1. Do you encounter this behavior after some Office or Windows updates? In Excel, click File&gt;Account&gt;capture a screenshot of all info under Product Information (please mask your account info in the screenshot). Click Start button&gt;settings&gt;System&gt;About&gt;let
 us know your Windows 10 version and OS build. </p>
<p>2. Does Excel itself work well except this behavior?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>
        </p>

<h3> doctor-who  say:</h3>
<h2>            I don&#39;t understand why the Family Calendar feature has stopped working&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an Office 365 Home&nbsp; Edition license. Love it. One features that was introduced over a year ago, was having a shared calendar for all one's family members. I totally loved that feature! I went through the process of defining my family members using
 the Office 365 portal. Then I could get into Outlook.com, go to the link to the calendar, add something (like seeing a movie) into that calendar, and everyone whose in my Family in the Office 365 portal, and thus in the
<strong>Family calendar</strong>, would be able to see that appointment on their phones, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No more. It's all gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, we're all planning on going to see a movie tomorrow afternoon. I got into Outlook.com, went to the calendar, created a new event, made certain that
<strong>Family calendar</strong> was selected, entered the details, but when I went to add a reminder, then only option was me. Huh?? Why's that??? Why has this functionality gone away? This is for all intents and purposes, useless as a way of scheduling anything
 for multiple people. I might as well just schedule it for myself. No one whose identified in my Family in Office 365 portal can see that event, let alone be notified by reminder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, someone tell me why this functionality is gone. Please tell me why its gone. And if it is possible, please tell me how in heck to get it back.</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answering your questions in order:</p>
<ol>
<li>When did the issue start? Oh gosh, I don't remember. Over a year ago it was working fine. Between now and then, it stopped.</li><li>Am I getting any error messages? No. I get no error messages when I create an event. I don't get any error messages when the time comes for the reminder to appear. It just doesn't appear. No emails. No reminders. No notifications. Nothing. At this point
 it is only an exercise in setting up events with reminders, that don't work.</li></ol>

<div>Yes there are people who are unaffected, I am one of them, but I am only unaffected with the two window focus issue in PowerPoint. In Word, the problem exists. If you read this thread you will see responses and supplied workarounds.</div>
<div><br />

<p>trouble shooting steps I took were:</p>
<p>I could always go into Safe mode with Network connection and no issues.</p>
<p>Installed Blue Screen Viewer by Nirsoft, this indicated ntoskrnl.exe&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installed Driver Easy and checked for driver updates</p>
<p>Updated drivers for Audio, Ethernet and logitech kbd/mouse</p>
<p>Still had the same Green screen issues.</p>
<p>Replaced the wireless kbd/mouse with wired</p>
<p>Replaces the Ethernet connection with a Realtek wifi</p>
<p>Disabled Audio drivers, then various others.</p>
<p>After trying all this I finally reluctantly rolled back to a previous build 17025 and since build 17040 was available and has a fix for the Green Screen Reboot issue.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 address book display name</h2>
                    In the Outlook 2016 address book, by default it displays the person's name as their email address, and when adding multiple names to an email, I often can't tell who it's addressed to by seeing their email address.&nbsp; How can I change a setting so that it
 displays the person's name and not the email address.&nbsp; I know how to change them one at a time with the person's properties, but with over 300 names, I would like to change a setting and have them change all at once and make that the default.&nbsp; In the Peoples
 folder they are all sorted and displayed by the person's first name - last name.

<p>If the name is selected from the AddressBook then the contact's &lt;Email DisplayName&gt; is what's shown - whatever that may be. If all your contacts only have an email address as the EDN, then suspect those were imported.</p>

<h2>            OneNote Class Notebook - Creating section groups</h2>
                    <p>We are 3 teachers sharing a class notebook as our subjects (biology, chemestry and geography) have been bundled in one course called "Naturvidenskabelig faggruppe". The class notebooks have been created by the school through SharePoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We want to have a separate section group for each subject and one for projects in the root of the class notebook:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c2d98bd8-04ef-4d51-aa6c-b02f09f175c3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c2d98bd8-04ef-4d51-aa6c-b02f09f175c3" /></a></p>
<p>We named the section groups "_ Biologi", "_ Geografi" etc. to make them appear first in the list of section groups. However these section groups are not visible for our students. How do we create and name these section groups&nbsp;in a way&nbsp;that gives our students
 read-only access to them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of my colleges tried naming then "- Biology" etc. This made&nbsp;them visible for the students, however when distributing pages to the students&nbsp;they were also&nbsp;distributed to these section groups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best regards, Morten Sigby-Clausen</p>

<p>Hi Morten,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s possible to create section groups in Class Notebook add-in, just like the image you showed. However, to narrow down the issue that these sections don’t show up for students, please make sure the changes has been synced to the online. &nbsp;You can refresh
 to open the notebook online to check that. As for my test, the “ _ Geografi” shows correctly.</p>
<p>After it shows up in the cloud, the students should be able to see the section group directly in read-only mode.
</p>
<p>About the issue when distributing pages to the students they were also distributed to these section groups. You can use the workaround to delete it from the distribute group, in this way, the page is still distributed to students successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rena&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Internet KEEPS CRASHING CONSTANTLY. GETTING VERY FRUSTRATING</h2>
                    
<p>I currently own a Lumia 635 and it CONSTANTLY crashes back to the start screen when using the internet. I have&nbsp;tried using a number of browsers and all of them -- especially IE -- CONSTANTLY crash repeatedly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I previously owned a Lumia 520 and had the same issue. I eventually threw that phone against a wall and replaced it with my current Lumia 635, which is no better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This phone is completely useless unless I can remain online with it. I have already backed up, reset, and restored my phone a number of times. I have also already contacted my carrier's tech support regarding the issue and it's not on their end. The problem
 still persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a serious issue and needs to be resolved asap. I've endured internet crashing issues using Windows products FOR YEARS now and I'm getting fed up. I've given MSFT more than enough chances to get their act together. This is ridiculous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please provide a fix because this phone is about to be next to meeting the wall. At that point, I'm just going to finally&nbsp;give up on these garbage Windows products and switch to an iPhone.</p>

            I've contacted Support in this. They advised to use the software recovery tool, soft and hard resets. WHen I advised I had done all of this, they said to send it in for repair. I don't remember this being an issue with windows 8 before the update to 8.1.
 This is a real problem which they are not addressing. I have been a Nokia user since my N8, and Nokia always addressed software issues. MS seems to not want to address this. You can only hope a windows 10 update solves this. I know if I send it in for repair,
 I will get charged and it will not fix the issue. They must want people to go to another company<br />

<p>I am also having this same issue!!! I've tried everything from software updates, factory reset, soft reset etc, etc. &amp; I see that I'm not the only one having this issue as well. I dont even care for Microsoft devices for one, &amp; I decided to give them a chance,
 pffft!!!! Worst decision I ever made&amp; yet Microsoft just says to send the device in for repairs. For what!? to get charged an additional fee, waiting2-3 weeks for them to send a similar devices as a replacement?! I dont think so!!!! All Microsoft wants is
 your your money. They charge you basically for everything, 3rd party apps that charges an app fee that aren't even the actual apps to the link, the Xbox charges for online play, lets not forget all the rest of the bs problems the Xbox comes w/, &amp; most files
 dont even show up on Microsoft Windows phones/ other devices, I can go on &amp; on but If they make up pay for all this S***, I guarantee you that their system is running like a whistle. Nobody has replied on this issues via tech support either. If something isn't
 done to fix this problem soon this will be the 1st time &amp;LAST time I'm ever using their products &amp; would NOT recommend this company to anyone for that matter...

            <p>Though I agree with ahaap that it's not likely this will cause an otherwise&nbsp;good drive to fail, the very fact that it takes more time means that it does cause more wear and tear.</p>
<p>I personally only run quick scans for this reason, since it's not really necessary to run a full scan unless you believe malware is present, so why overwork the drive if there's no real purpose?</p>

<h2>            Oracle Java 8 creates and destroys javaws.exe</h2>
                    I had Java 8 functioning in the last&nbsp;Win10TechPreview. Upon updating to build 9926, javaws.exe processes are repeatedly created and destroyed consuming nearly half of my CPU capability because it was causing Windows Defender (MsMpEng.exe) to go crazy.
 Uninstalling Java 8 immediately stops the issue. Haven't tried older versions of Java yet...<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e3d45b8f-153a-40bb-9e42-c8586a428d02" />

    <title>Bonus quizzes not rewarding points - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#58;&#65533;&#65533;drew&#65533;&#65533;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bonus quizzes not rewarding points</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, lemme explain the issue I've been dealing with for the past couple weeks that no one seems to be able to resolve quickly enough through Microsoft Support revolving around the lack of receiving Rewards points for doing bonus quizzes:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the weekday, the Rewards panel offers a Daily Poll. After doing the poll we are presented with bonus quizzes such as the Turbocharged, Supersonic, Lightning, Warpspeed quizzes, and sometimes a 7 question brain test. All of these appear in the same
 popup at the bottom of the browser window where the Daily Poll was completed, and none of them reward me with the points that they advertise. I've asked a couple friends to pay attention to their points and they have the same issue, so I'm not the only one
 with this problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on MacOS 10.9.5, running Firefox 64.0.2. After contacting Support, they had me go through a few steps to 'optimize' my browser and told me to retry the quizzes, which didn't help. Then they asked me to make a screen recording that demonstrates the issue...
 which I did, sent off to them, and then received and email reply stating that it was handed off to the Product Support team for investigation. It took 10 days for a reply to be made, and only after I had sent them a message asking for an update. Once I received
 an update, I was appalled to read that they were putting the blame on me, saying that I've been doing quizzes from other regions other than my own (CA), and that I had been receiving points for doing quizzes. Here's the quote:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(89, 89, 89, 1)">After further review, we have confirmed that you’ve been normally earning bonus points from quiz. Our record indicates that your account is created in CA (Canada) Region. Also, we confirmed
 that there were instances wherein, you are trying to complete quiz offers from the US market.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(89, 89, 89, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(89, 89, 89, 1)">Keep in mind that by design, you are not eligible to earn points from US quiz offers. The offers for Microsoft Rewards is region dependent, changing region will cause offers to be different and
 a tendency for the account to be ineligible for the offer your are trying to complete. Trying to earn points from different markets is against
<a href="https://rewards.microsoft.com/terms?mkt=EN-CA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TOU</a> and can result in a permanent suspension.</span>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen recording I sent them clearly illustrates that I was not receiving points for the bonus quizzes offered as a "Complete next offer" in the popup that appears after the Daily Poll is finished. Yes, I am receiving points for the normal quizzes offered
 from the Rewards page, but not these bonus ones. Also, to be told that I've been doing quizzes from other regions is a fallacy, and most likely a reporting or programmatical error on MS' end. I've never changed my region, browser, ISP, nor other preferences
 for my account. The settings have remained the same ever since I signed up. I've only ever clicked on the quizzes delivered/offered to me directly through the Rewards panel, Bing popups, and email, so to be blamed for what seems like questionable programming
 and reporting on Microsofts end, is absolutely absurd... needless to say, I was extremely offended by that. Mostly because I may unwittingly be headed for a permanent suspension of my account for doing quizzes that are delivered to my browser/account... ridiculous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each weekday that passes, I, and probably many others are denied about 150 reward points from wasted time on these quizzes (and for that matter, my be unknowingly headed towards a breach of the TOU resulting in a permanent suspension), and for the benefit
 of the community, I would appreciate that someone takes this a bit more seriously and tries to sort this problem out faster than it has been though the regular support system. I'm fully aware that MS is making money off of the Rewards Program, and where money
 is involved, there's most likely an individual out there who is ready and willing to pursue this in court - rest assured I am not one of them, but it's an ugly fact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the Product Support team does their thing and moderators here do theirs, it'd be nice to hear others chime in concerning this.</p>

<p>I apologize to hear that you are going through peer pressure to just being easily rewarded.</p>
<p>But things tend to happen, especially on the MacOS (since I myself am using it too).</p>
<p>You just have to simply make sure to allow all cookies, and unblock all sources and have
<a href="https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Adobe Flash Player</a> downloaded (just in case any macromedia flashes up, you can play it)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, other cases can be easily solved by simply&nbsp;<em><strong>refreshing</strong></em> your browser.</p>
<p>If the situation persists, I suggest you head directly to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft's Live Support</a> page, so they can figure out if there is <em>really</em>&nbsp;something with your account.</p>

<p>Xemness, I can't tell whether you're being snarky/sarcastic with me or confrontational with your first 2 sentences, so I'll just ignore the troll-like nature of it and reply as if you were trying to be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you try to do the quizzes that pop up after doing the Daily Poll yourself to see if you get points. I assure you, it's not account related. If you do receive rewards for the bonus quizzes, I'd like to see a screen recording that proves it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my post, I've asked several (19 to be exact) friends on different platforms (Xbox, Windows 10, MacOS, and Android) and in different regions (UK, CA, US, and different parts of the EU) to do the quizzes after the daily poll, and they too are having
 the same issue. This isn't my browser, flash, or cookies. Let me be clear, I'm a web developer, so these low-level tier 1 solutions you're providing have been looked into in detail. Stating that "things tend to happen, especially on the MacOS" is really a
 poor excuse and defeatist attitude to take in a time when 99.9% of the platform related incompatibilities with the web have been cleared up using complex APIs and other tactics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that using the bing popup to do offers that appear on the Rewards page work, yet the bonus quizzes don't, is a problem with coding on MS' end in my opinion. It's also misleading. People think they're getting rewarded, yet they aren't. As an example,
 yesterday I clicked a doubleshot quiz from the rewards page... afterward, the bing popup showed the Daily Poll, so I clicked it, did it, and was rewarded for doing so. Immediately afterwards, the same bing popup delivered the Test Your Smarts and Turbocharged
 offer which, after doing one, did not reward the advertised points. Explain that.</p>

    <title>Bug report &#58; Unable to switch camera in Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gjs8400  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bug report &#58; Unable to switch camera in Skype</h2>
                    <p>Device in use: Lumia 950 (all O/S updates installed: Version 1709, O/S Build 10.0.15254.124, firmware rev 01078.00053.16236.35026)</p>
<p>Skype Version 12.10.572.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Not possible to switch from webcam (front) to rear camera&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Start video call</p>
<p>&nbsp; Tap icon to switch cameras from front to rear camera </p>
<p>&nbsp; This produces message that the webcam is in use by another application.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Video portion of call is stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; No other apps are open. Power off/on and retry same call : no improvement, still not possible to swap cameras.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Reproducibility 10/10 attempts</p>
<p>&nbsp; Was possible in earlier versions of Skype client on DUT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Attempting camera swap from webcam (front) stops video portion being sent until phone is power cycled&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; OR : How do I get video calling back after doing (1)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Start video call<br />
&nbsp; Tap icon to switch cameras from front to rear camera&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; This produces message that the webcam is in use by another application.</p>
<p>&nbsp; It is not possible switch back to the front(webcam) camera. The switch camera icon is no longer displayed and the call continues without any outgoing video portion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>--&gt; Turning the video off using the camera icon (next to the mute // divert audio to loud speaker // end buttons) does not permit video to be re-started during the call. The error messsage about webcam being in use by another application message is displayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Terminating call, closing and re-opening the client does not clear the error condition. A power cycle is required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reproducibility 10/10 attempts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was possible to do this in earlier versions of Skype client on DUT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Probable cause : Skype client attempts and fails to use rear camera and is unable to switch back to front camera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

                    I'm running Win 7 Professional 64-bit with Excel 2013. It is crashing every time I try to format a cell (e.g. bold or underline). It crashes in Safe Mode. All Add On's have been disabled, and I am using Microsoft XPS Document Writer as the default printer.
 Other Office 2013 applications seem to work fine. This is a brand new computer.

<h2>            Problems in &#8216;App&#8217; &#8220;Call Recorder &#124; Total Recall 5&#8221; for Nokia E63.</h2>
                    
<p><font>Hey guys first of all I am very new to this, but as per the guidelines I have done the following:-</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>1) I searched for the topic I am looking for in “Our Communities &gt; Discussions” &amp; “Our Communities &gt; Discussions &gt; Software &gt; Phone Applications”.</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>2) I could not find it &amp; hence I am posting a ‘New Message’.</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>I have a Nokia E-63. It was hanging quite frequently, so I Flashed it &amp; installed the version 510.21.010, 28-03-2011, RM-437, © Nokia E63-1 (27) from the Professionals.</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>Before Flashing I had taken the Full backup of the contents through OVI Suite on my PC.</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>Now, my query is:-</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>1)&nbsp;&nbsp; After restoring the Back-up, the ‘App’ “Call Recorder | Total Recall 5” which I had purchased from Nokia Officially on 12 February, 2013 3:56:53 PM IST, DID NOT GET RE-INSTALLED AUTOMATICALLY.</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>Is this O.K. or Unusual (since I had taken a Full Backup &amp; other ‘Apps’ etc. did get re-installed)</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>2)&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the Nokia Store from my E63 Phone browser &amp; did re-install the ‘App’ “Call Recorder | Total Recall 5”, but, I am facing the following problems now:-</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>2.1) The call recording is getting stopped automatically, sometimes after 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 calls.</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>2.2) If the phone is switched off, battery taken out &amp; switched On again, 1 or 2 calls get recorded &amp; than again it stops recording.</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font>2.3) I am very well versed with the setting of the ‘App’ since I had been using it &amp; this never happened before. In fact, it did not miss recording a single call once I had installed it for the first time.</font></p>
<p><font>&nbsp;</font></p>
<div>
<p><font>Kindly help.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) As regards the <strong>Phones Software/ Firmware, it is the same as it was before formatting</strong> (Flashing) the C: Drive {i.e. version 510.21.010, 28-03-2011, RM-437, © Nokia E63-1 (27)} and as mentioned before the entire process of formatting, installation
 etc. was done by professionals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) The <strong>“App” is installed in the Phone Memory presently as well as before formatting also</strong>. No settings etc. of the “App” have been changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it clears your doubts.</p>

    <title>Cortona Saying I Need Subscription To Play My Own Music - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> albert1764  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortona Saying I Need Subscription To Play My Own Music</h2>
                    <p>When I ask Cortana to play album Hellbilly Deluxe by Rob Zombie she thinks for a little bit and then tells me I need a subscription to play.&nbsp;</p>
<p>the album. I ripped that album myself and most of my collection. About half of my collection she will play and the other she won't &nbsp;but like the album Hellbilly Deluxe if I tell her to play artist Rob Zombie she will play all of his music plus that album.
 Does anyone have a clue?</p>

<h2>            bulk messages upload and custom messages</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys, I need a way to import a bulk of messages into Nokia Pc Suite, &nbsp;and for the suite to send them for me with a custom message</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so lets say I have an excel sheet, &nbsp; in row A, &nbsp;I have 200&nbsp;mobile numbers, &nbsp;Row B I have 200 Ref numbers, I would like to import that into the suite so it send a text to all 200 numbers, &nbsp;and it will insert the Ref number out of Row B with the message</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so I have a custom message like this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi, Please call us on xxxxxxxxxxx please quote your order number&nbsp;[rowb] to get an extra 15% off!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would then send the texts for me to all 200 mobile numbers and the ref out of row B ( which I want to be whatever I put in</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does nokia support this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi john2001<br />
<br />
At it's simplest it may be printed on the homehub, or it may be in the user guide.<br />
<br />
You need to find out if it is in ASCII or in HEX and you will also need to find out the length.<br />
<br />
You can search posts in more detail by entering "WEP KEY" in SEARCH DISCUSSIONS top right of your screen

            WEP = Wireless Equivalent Privacy<br />
<br />
It is used to encrypt/decrypt wireless (WLAN/Wi-Fi) data communications.<br />
<br />
How to set or change it, check your Wi-Fi router's user guide (manual).<br />
<br />
Note, more secure protection than WEP is provided by WPA/WPA2 mechanisms. If your router supports that, use WPA rather than WEP.

            Wep key is the 'password' that is set on your router / access point that you must enter to connect to the router / access point, on most routers / access points you can use the web interface to change the wep key to whatever you want, some others like
 the retarded orange home hub things, have a fixed wep key that you cant change that is usually on a label on the bottom of the home hub.

 failure to run like it should. Does anyone know what the issue might be?&nbsp;

            <p>I have the same problem and I have tried every suggestion I've come across in this forum including full repair and disabling graphics accelerator and addons. At first, I could run the program but It crashed when I used specific tools. Then it started crashing
 when I ran videos in slide show mode. Now I can't even run the program. I need this for work and it is really affecting my productivity.<br />
</p>
<p>I can add that I can open the program in safe mode but it crashes as soon as I open a file, and yes, my updates are up to date.</p>

    <title>Migrating data from Palm OS without Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Migrating data from Palm OS without Outlook</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to migrate my data (calendar, contacts, etc.) from my old Treo 600 with Palm OS to my new Treo 700wx with Windows Mobile, but I do not have Outlook on my pc.&nbsp; I only have the home version of
 Microsoft Office with Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.&nbsp; Will I have to buy Outlook separately just to be able to migrate my data or is there some other solution?</p>

<p>You will need to buy Outlook/Office before you can make the transfer. Palm offers Outlook Conduit on the companion CD that lets you sync your Treo 600 to Outlook. As you can see, you will definitely need Outlook to
 be able to do the transfer.</p>

<p>You should ask that person <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.microsoft.com%2fMSDN%2femoticons%2femotion-1.gif" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that you'll need to have Outlook Conduit to sync the Treo 600 to the PC. If you don't have it, download it on Palm's website.
</p>
<p>You will also need to download Activesync to synchronize the Treo 700.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My colleague has installed Teams on her computer and can therefore arrange meetings from there. I don't have that button and cannot figure out how to arrange a meeting directly from Teams as she can do. I can't find this options under settings or under apps
 and I feel I have looked all logical places where such a settings could hide.</p>

<p>Hi Kyrre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your update in Private Message. I have checked that you have a hybrid environment and your mailbox is hosted on-premises. This is the root cause why you cannot find the Calendar tab in Teams.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How to remove a previously added email account. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffery stephenson  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to remove a previously added email account.</h2>
                    <p>I had added my gmail account into my outlook.com account but have since changed my mind and wish to delete this connection.&nbsp; Getting two notices from two different accounts for the same email in my phone is driving me insane.&nbsp; Adding the gmail account was
 easy as pie, I can't for the life of me figure out how to delete it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my research I was finding some confusion between importing, adding, and aliases.&nbsp; So to be clear:&nbsp; I have outlook.com set up to download emails from my gmail.com inbox. When you go to Inbox - Options - Your email accounts it shows my outlook account in
 the "Microsoft accounts" box and my gmail account in the "Account's you've added" box.&nbsp; There are further options on this page to add another account, Create an outlook.com alias, and to edit the default "from" address. There is also a "details" link in the
 "Account's you've added" box. Clicking this link opens a popup window that gives you an option to "edit".&nbsp; This opens the page titled "Edit your account" Inbox &gt; Options &gt; Your email accounts. At this point one would think Eureka! there you have it.&nbsp; All the
 information is right there for the gmail account.&nbsp; My name, the email address, the pop and smtp servers, user name, password, everything.&nbsp; But alas ... search hard as I might I can not find a button or link that says "delete".&nbsp; The box that contains the gmail
 address is grayed out and not editable.&nbsp; So ... here I am.&nbsp; I always thought I could figure this kind of thing out for myself, but I'm stymied.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help</p>

</p><p>Upon checking to simulate the issue on my end, I was able to see the remove option when clicking on the details options. Have you tried checking with other browser? If you really can't find this option, I've created area&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">where
 you can put your affected account. Please make sure that you're signed in to this forum in order to view the notification link which states, "You have a private reply to this message".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you.</span></p>

<p>"Remove *** Email address is removed for privacy ***"</p>
<p>When I confirm that I want the account removed I get the error...</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Teams</h2>
                    When holding a Microsoft Teams meeting, how can you promote an external attendee to a presenter?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can try to create Microsoft Teams meeting policy to open the option "&nbsp;Allow an external participant to give or request control".&nbsp; For your reference&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/configure-desktop-sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/configure-desktop-sharing</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note, if you are the Teams admin, when you create the policy, it may need some time to take effect, thanks.</p>
        </p>
