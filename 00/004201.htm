<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you mentioned that you are trying to access a personal account, I would suggest that you log into this
<a href="https://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a> using your correct username and password. If the same issue occurs, you can try to optimize the browser that you are currently using. Take note that it will delete the password that you
 have saved and browsing history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try to use different browsers, devices or try it in In-Private browsing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to have this issue even after performing the above steps, please reply to this thread. The system will notify me so I can get back to you and provide you more answers.</p>

    <title>Publisher Doc Info Panel help&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattdages  say:</h3>
<h2>            Publisher Doc Info Panel help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Forum,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a sharepoint doc library with a content type that has Publisher as the template.&nbsp; When a user opens the document to edit/read, I would like them to automatically see the doc info panel and be able to manipulate the controls.&nbsp; When the document is
 opened, however, the panel doesn't show up and when I go into properties through "file" and change any of the custom properties, no choices are presented, and nothing entered triggers associated workflows.&nbsp; Is there a way to have&nbsp;the DIP open as it does in
 word?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use Word as the template, the doc info panel opens automatically when the document opens, and everything works correctly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is quite frustrating, and I can't imagine Microsoft would design all the office programs to function the same way with a sharepoint DIP but not publisher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions/comments/help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Matt</p>

<p>Publisher is not available as a 'web app'. Only Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote are available as a web app. See this for more info about using web apps with sharepoint:

<h2>            Function keys in Excel do not work</h2>
                    I recently bought a Macbook Air and installed Microsoft Office - for Mac - on it. In Excel, none of the function keys work. I use F2 for editing and F4 for absolute references. The help function states I should use command + T for the latter, but that
 does not work either. Anyone any idea?Function&nbsp;

            Additional to what Phillip pointed out, the 2 keys you specifically mentioned are some of the changes made in the Windows version when the program was first adapted from the original Mac version. On the Mac:<br />
<b><br />
Ctrl+U</b> = <b>F2</b><br />
<b>Cmd+T</b> = <b>F4</b><br />
<br />
I cannot replicate the failure you described for Cmd+T -- Works fine here &amp; I've not seen any similar reports. I'd suggest that you confirm the update level [14.3.4 is current] then repair disk permissions using Disk Utility &amp; restart your Mac... Lack of restarts
 is the most common cause of keystroke glitches.<br />
<br />
If you continue to have a problem see what happens in a new User Account.<br />

            <p>Availability of keyboard shortcuts is dictated by the Operating System for which the software is designed. When Excel was migrated to the Windows OS [yes, Excel originated on a Mac :-)] quite a few of the built-in keyboard shortcuts were remapped based on
 the requirements of that operating system. Consequently, those keyboard shortcuts either do not work in OS X or are mapped to different commands. Please see my reply in this thread which is marked as the
<strong><em>Answer</em></strong> for the specific keystroke you're asking about. I'm afraid the one reply you seem to be reading is completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>

<h2>            IE 11 not supporting certain web pages</h2>
                    I recently reset IE to its original state and it has upgraded me without my permission to IE 11; now when I try to go to certain sites, IE will not open them, one being my security camera that I can watch, it says error every time, but I can load it on
 Firefox; and the other would be my banking site; always saying the site is down but if I go to Google Chrome, there is nothing wrong with the site.&nbsp; Anyone else have same issues? Anyone know how to fix?

<p>This is&nbsp; nothing more than some defective JavaScript on the page, probably ad-related.&nbsp; I'm seeing it recently at Yahoo. Cancel is one of the options on the pop-up message, isn't it? When I click on cancel, I don't see it again in that session.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An ad-blocker like Adblock Plus (there are others) would probably block this.</p>

<br />
I doubt i will be able to fix your problem, seeing that i'm using a desktop and you are using a tablet with a different logon screen/methodology, and i have no idea if you still have the problem, have tried or checked this already but i'll try helping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that my local security policy for not requiring the SAS was <strong>disabled</strong> (by default!) on my machine. Check your<strong> local security policy (run&nbsp;</strong><strong>secpol.msc</strong> or found in
<strong>Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Administrative Tools</strong>&nbsp;and see what it says, it will be under "<strong>Security Settings</strong> -&gt;
<strong>Security Options</strong> -&gt; <strong>Interactive logon: Do not require CTRL+ALT+DEL</strong>".
<strong>Enable</strong> the option if it is disabled, ok, and then exit the policy editor. Run<strong> gpupdate</strong>&nbsp;to refresh your computer security settings. Try locking and unlocking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next step to try is to disable the lock screen in the <strong>group policy editor</strong> (run
<strong>gpedit.msc</strong>). This setting is found under "<strong>Local Computer Policy</strong> -&gt;
<strong>Computer Configuration</strong> -&gt; <strong>Administrative Templates</strong> -&gt;
<strong>Control Panel</strong> -&gt; <strong>Personalization </strong>-&gt;<strong> Do not display the lock screen</strong>". Set this to
<strong>enabled</strong>, ok, exit and then run <strong>gpupdate</strong> again to refresh the policy settings. Hopefully you will not have to unlock your tablet with weird key combos or with
<strong>SAS,</strong> and will be presented straight to any login screen. Again, try the unlock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, revert "<strong>Do not display the lock screen</strong>" back to "<strong>not configured</strong>", but keep
<strong>"Do not require CTRL+ALT+DEL</strong>" <strong>enabled</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point i wonder if you can spoof Windows to <em>believe</em> you have a desktop with touch, rather than a tablet. To me it seems like it could be a bug with winlogin on tablets only. I might look further into spoofing part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">finger gymnastics"&nbsp;</span>may seem like it's only there to harass you, but it does have a reason. It's called the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_attention_key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Secure
 Attention Sequence</a>&nbsp;(<strong>SAS</strong>) or Secure Attention Key (<strong>SA</strong><strong>K</strong>) and prevents login spoofing. However it is normally only enabled on computers connected to a windows domain network (Think enterprise and business
 environments) and if enabled in the local or group security policy (Like how mine was on default, when it shouldn't). It's been with Windows NT for a long time, and it works.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I do have to agree with you that support and MVP members will often&nbsp;give the most useless, out of context answers possible while other members have provided real empathy, support, and normally the correct answer. Unpaid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this was of some help.</p>
<p />

            <p>Thank you for the reply, MattTheGeek.&nbsp; I currently only experience the issue when I allow the machine to sit in stand-by, which I seldom do.&nbsp; I don't believe the drain on my battery is worth the few seconds it takes to boot.</p>

 were create to be difficult enough that they would not likely be hit by accident.&nbsp; Once hit, they are detected and cause a redirection of processing to some location in memory.&nbsp; Originally, that location was 0, in order to force a reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When added to windows and repurposed a few times, they typically kept the intent of overriding all activity and where defined to be difficult to hit by accident.&nbsp; They were not present in Windows 7, perhaps Vista but I've used too many versions to remember
 where they got dropped.&nbsp; My desktop Windows 7 machine does not require it because it truly serves no valuable purpose that cannot be accomplished via a more simplified means.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further, in order to reach the login screen from this SAS screen&nbsp;is the primary function of the gatekeeper, so it should at least be as easy as "Press any key to continue." if it cannot be automatic.&nbsp; Why should a key sequence be used that has been contrived
 to be difficult to hit by accident?&nbsp;Don't we want people to proceed rapidly onward?&nbsp;Shouldn't it be a quick "Please hit the SAS button to get to where you wanted to go when you turned on the machine."&nbsp; Why stop and ask for a key at all?&nbsp; Is it to be assumed
 that the computer cannot reach a specific location in memory if a person does not hold down two keys and then presses another?&nbsp; Beyond that, it takes one to the Login screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; A user ID and password is required to get past that point.&nbsp;How many hoops should
 we jump through to get some functional value from our hardware? &nbsp;Which do you suppose is more difficult to guess:&nbsp; Ctrl-Alt-Del? Or my user id and password?&nbsp; If the magical location makes the machine so much more impenetrable, why not jump there after the
 correct password?&nbsp; Or jump there during the bot process?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line&nbsp;Finger Gymnastics are not necessary and do nothing more than harass the legitimate user of the device.&nbsp; There is nothing magical about Ctrl-Alt-Del that either makes a machine more secure or perform anything that could not have been done in a
 more customer focused manner.&nbsp; Whatever Kool-Aid Microsoft is passing out on this topic is not worth the paper cup in which it is served.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I do appreciate the information on the policies.&nbsp; Since the check box that is supposed to prevent the CAD screen when coming out of stand-by does not prevent, perhaps there will be a better response there.</p>

            <p>The power draw shouldn't be that much anyway, even while active, but idle. The power management on the processor and related systems should be excellent. The problem has always been with the backlight on the screen. And It looks like i didn't need to explain
 in that much detail for the policy settings than i did, and thank you for better information on SAS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My inbox has not been receiving e-mail since 18.05.2018. I have tested the account by sending e-mails from my work account but all are not received. The account can only receive junk e-mails. I suspect that the account was hacked during the week ending 18.05.2018
 as l received calls from some of my contacts about strange e-mails which l didn't send them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have since changed my password but l still cant receive e-mails on my inbox.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Barbara, you will not need to enter a product key to do that, you can use your version of Office on up to 5 PC's  . . .
<br />
<br />On the other PC, go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in.
<br />
<br />Sign in with the account you associated with this version of Office. 
<br />
<br />On the Office home page, select Install Office - Install

<h2>            Visio service in Sharpoint online plan 2</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I am using Office 365 Business Premium Subscription in my Company (only 5 users). I am the administrator and I want to use the Visio service in SharePoint. Therefor I have upgraded to SharePoint Plan 2 in order to get Access to this service. I have disable
 the SharePoint 1 plan in the Office 365 Business Premium Subscription. But I dont get Access to the Visio service when I edit my SharePoint sites? Please advice?</p>
<p>I want to insert a WebPart with Visio service (so I can show a Visio drawing directly on my site/page), but under the section Business Data, there is no Visio services.
</p>
<p>Do I need a Enterprise Plan 3 or 4 to use this services?</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>

<p>Hi Tom, I think the Visio webparts only get activated if you enable the SharePoint server Enterprise site Features. This means that you ll (more than likely) need to get an enterprise license.

<p>hi tom,</p>
<p>we would like to have a few quick checks to initially look into the situation.</p>
<p><br />
#1</p>
<p>check whether you have enabled <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/turn-scripting-capabilities-on-or-off-1f2c515f-5d7e-448a-9fd7-835da935584f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
scripting capabilities</a>.</p>
<p>as the admin, go to sharepoint admin center &gt; settings tab &gt; scroll down the custom script section &gt; make sure you have set allow users to run custom script on self-service created sites.</p>
<p>please note that visio web access webpart is by default unavailable when scripting capabilities are turned off,&nbsp; and if you modify the settings, it may take up to 24 hrs to take effect.</p>
<p>#2</p>
<p>please try create a new site collection and see if the webpart is available.</p>
<p>#3</p>
<p>sign in at <a href="https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions</a> and share a screenshot of your assigned licenses.</p>
<p>to insert a screenshot, please click use rich formatting &gt;&nbsp;<a href="http://community.office365.com/tiny_mce/plugins/insertmedia/img/insert_image.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcommunity.office365.com%2ftiny_mce%2fplugins%2finsertmedia%2fimg%2finsert_image.gif" /></a>
 insert/edit media &gt; browse... &gt; insert.</p>
<p><br />
feel free to get back at convenience.</p>
<p>best regards,<br />

            <p>In that case, it is best to start with a new mail profile as it sounds your original held some corruptions already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do this via the Mail applet in Control Panel. Press the Show Profiles button to create a new one and set it as the default. Once you've verified that it works as expected, you could remove the old mail profile.</p>

                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>I have been away working for 6 weeks.</p>
<p>When I come home again. A window pops up saying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Install a new build of Windows now.</p>
<p>This build of windows has expired, so your PC will restart every few hours, and eventually will fail to start. Go online for more information."</p>
<p>
</p><p>And so I did. </p>
<p>Got Window 10 Insider Preview 14393 and Windows 10 insider Preview, version 1606,14366</p>
<p>Update went ok. But when restarting.</p>
<p>The updating during shutdown of PC goes ok.</p>
<p>But the update during startup fails. It does not take much time. I see 0% then it jumps to 17% and the window shifts and I see the PC rebooting back to previous version "Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 14342.rs1_release.160506-1708"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This PC is a Dell Alienware X51</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me before this build fails me.</p>

<p>Yes, that's it exactly. Start&nbsp;with the MCRT and create that bootable USB stick,

<h2>            Notes field of Contacts and Sceduled Calendar events do not sync from PC to Mobile</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Vista PC running Office 2007 and a HTC S710 mobile phone running Windows Mobile 6 standard (CE OS&nbsp;5.2.16622, Build&nbsp;18128.0.4.4) and have an issue with syncing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Outlook Contacts and Scheduled Calendar events DO&nbsp;sync to my mobile phone but anything in the 'Notes' field of each contact or each calendar entry&nbsp;no longer is sync'd from my desk pc to my mobile. It USED to until around 6 months ago when
 I upgraded from Outlook 2003 to Outlook 2007, but the notes fields have&nbsp;not sync'd once since using Outlook 2007.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Could this be a compatibility issue between Outlook 2007 and Windows Mobile 6 standard?</p>
<p>Can anyone out there test this on their systems and advise their results please?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Neil.</p>

<h2>            How To Rotate the virtual keyboard to landscape</h2>
                    I used a new samsung omnia II.&nbsp; Initially the virtual keyboard is able to rotate to landscape and portrait according to the position of the device.&nbsp; On the third day of use, the device failed, sent for repair and was told the motherboard was spoilt and
 replaced.&nbsp; After that, the virtual keyboard refused to rotate.&nbsp; Please advise on any solutions.&nbsp; Thanks.

    <title>Pen lags on external display presenting Powerpoint presentation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timo.niedermeyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pen lags on external display presenting Powerpoint presentation</h2>
                    <p>This question is in reference to two closed threads: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2016-powerpoint/surface-pen-lags-on-external-display-presenting/11416ed6-8d40-4728-94e7-fe6ec6492698">
Thread 1 </a>and <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-powerpoint/pen-lagsfails-in-slide-show-view-in-powerpoint/a8e214d2-a0fe-4237-960e-2b0234a0f983">
Thread 2</a></p>
<br />
<p>I have the same problem as described in the first link: The stroke only appears on the second screen after I stop holding down the mose button or after taking the pen off the screen.</p>
<p>Turning off hardware acceleration did not help, as in the last reply to the second thread. The presentation view has still this delay (I would not call it lag, as it is not lagging but simply not appearing before the stroke is released) in the writing and
 shows only stroke-by-stroke while the presenter's view shows smooth writing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also using Powerpoint 2016 on Windows 10.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;timo.niedermeyer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For us to have a better understanding of your concern, we’d like to know more details about your issue. Kindly provide us the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Does the issue occurs on all of your PowerPoint presentation?</li><li>When had the issue first occurred?</li><li><a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=12&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiDorbE8dLhAhXFaN4KHY-JDuIQFjALegQIARAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.office.com%2Fen-us%2Farticle%2Fabout-office-what-version-of-office-am-i-using-932788b8-a3ce-44bf-bb09-e334518b8b19&amp;usg=AOvVaw2GSVHbIj9d77ykStK0V9Co" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What
 is the exact build and version of Office that you have</a>?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, make sure that the pen is also up-to-date. This will help us ensure that it will work effectively and it will get the updated features that it should have.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>- Yes, the issue occurs in all presentations, old and fresh ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The issue has been there ever since I first tried this feature (about 4 weeks ago), but from the first thread I linked to it is obvious that the issue has been occurring since at least three years for others, as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- My software version: Microsoft PowerPoint 2016 MSO (16.0.4738.1000) 64-Bit, Product ID: 00339-10000-00000-AA548.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- This issue is NOT related to the pen. As described above, it also occurs with a mouse.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The issue occurs also in safe mode.</p>
<p>- I do not have ANY add-ins. </p>
<p>
</p><p>- As soon as I have two displays attached (either two LCD displays, or the internal display and an external disply, or the internal display and a projector and extend the display: When I write in the presenter view, the stroke is smooth on the referent view,
 but only appears on the slide show view after releasing the mouse button. When I write on the slide show view, the stroke is smooth in the same view, but on the presenter view only appears after releasing the mouse button.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- When I do not extend the display, but have slide show view on both: The stroke is smooth on both displays (as expected, becaus there is only "one" display).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus this issue is somehow related to the communication between the two views, ot between the two displays - it must not necessarily be a PowerPoint issue, but could also be due to display settings or the way Windows 10 handler extended displays?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we continue this discussion, could YOU please make sure how PowerPoint/Windows behave on YOUR computer?
</p>
<p>Please attach two displays to your computer, start powerpoint and open an empty presentation, hit F5, make sure you see presenter view on one display and slide show view on the other, activate the pen tool, draw something on the empty slide in there presenter
 view while holding down your left mouse button. Before releasing the mosue button, look at the display with the slide show view. Do you see your drawing while you draw it? Release the left mouse button - does your drawing only appear after you release the
 mouse button?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be good to know if it works on your computer...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, TN</p>

<p>Hello&nbsp;timo.niedermeyer - I'm a Program Manager at Microsoft working on inking in PowerPoint. Can you share with me what the "presenter view" looks like in your 2 display scenario? Can you take&nbsp;a look at this help article:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Start-the-presentation-and-see-your-notes-in-Presenter-view-4de90e28-487e-435c-9401-eb49a3801257" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Start-the-presentation-and-see-your-notes-in-Presenter-view-4de90e28-487e-435c-9401-eb49a3801257</a>&nbsp;and
 let know if your primary display is showing the Presenter View ?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>do you have access to the screen recording I already provided via the cloud, or the screen recording that has been done while discussing this issue by the Microsoft support team? If not, I can of course provide additional recordings or screenshots...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not matter whether the presenter view is on primary or secondary screen. No difference.</p>
<p>You can simply reproduce the issue if you use two displays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MS support team has already reproduced the issue, and they said after discussing it with the PowerPoint development team that this is the intended behaviour, and if I do not like it I should raise it at the User Voice forum, which I have done... ;-)</p>
