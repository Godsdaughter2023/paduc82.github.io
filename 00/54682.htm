            Hi BerylPayton 
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with your no boot situation.
<br />
<br />Try
<br />1.  Completely shut down your computer.
<br />2.  Power on the system. As soon as the first logo screen appears, immediately press F2 for notebooks or Delete for desktops to enter UEFI.
<br />3.  Press F9 and then Enter to load the default configuration.
<br />4.  Press F10 and then Enter to save and exit.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask me any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

            Hi Beryl.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This most often means the hard drive has failed, but it could be misreading it or have just suffered faults to the file system which resides on the drive that could be corrected by Disk Check.  
<br />
<br />Try this first:  Unplug PC, remove battery, press and hold power button 20 seconds, plug cord back in, try again.  Any change?
<br />
<br />If not run bootable diagnostics long test from Seatools created here:  <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>
<br />There are also diagnostics built into HP and Dell by powering up while pressing the ESC and F12 keys respectively.  Other testing tools here:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>
<br />
<br />Follow this by running a full Disk Check from the booted Windows 10 installation or repair media:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then Command Prompt to run Disk Check.
<br />
<br />If the drive has failed I'd replace it with an SSD which is the best Upgrade one can have - lightning fast, faster than a new higher-end PC without one, especially if you do the gold standard Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If the drive is good then everything possible is here for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>
</p><p>I can access my Yahoo mail and can read the messages.&nbsp; However, I cannot delete any as when I try to tick them the hand comes up instead of the arrow and the same when I try to delete an email I am reading by clicking delete along the top.&nbsp; Everything else
 works in yahoo mail and I can look at all the folders but cannot delete.&nbsp; I have tried to ask the community on Yahoo as their help pages do not cover this but although I can type a question it will not let me send it.</p>

            Hello and good day, Helen:
<br />How are you?
<br />My name is Franklin. I am a community member just like yourself.
<br />I chime in from time to time.
<br />
<br />Ok, First of all, Yahoo Mail would be considered off-limits or out-of-scope as it is not a Microsoft product.
<br />
<br />However, in the gist of trying to be social, I would think out loud and ask myself:
<br />Hmmm...
<br />
<br />First of all how and where are you accessing your Yahoo mail?
<br />I ask, because we have quite a few possibilities available to us.
<br />Are you using the main YAHOO portal?
<br />I believe that would be <a href="https://www.mail.yahoo.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mail.yahoo.com</a>
<br />From there enter your credentials and login.
<br />
<br />What browser are you using to get to your mail?
<br />If browser-based, try accessing the same website using an alternate or different browser.
<br />It could be a (temporary) issue with one browser.
<br />So, we try a second browser to see if the problem is consistent across the board.
<br />If using your smart-phone, try to logout of Yahoo (if open).
<br />Maybe you are logged in at more than one device.
<br />That is a possibility.
<br />
<br />So, bottom line is:
<br />Logout from all devices where you may be logged on to Yahoo mail.
<br />Use an alternate web browser to reach the same destination.
<br />That destination being <a href="https://www.mail.yahoo.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mail.yahoo.com</a>
<br />
<br />If the problem persists across browsers, check your settings for Yahoo Mail. You may have changed the Preferences. I believe you can reset the preferences back to their default settings.
<br />
<br />Best of luck!

<p>Hi Franklin</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for replying. I know that Yahoo is not a Microsoft product but came upon a similar problem which they put on this site and there was a reply. Could not find anything on the Yahoo web site about this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am only having this problem on my desktop and my browser is Firefox. My laptop, tablet and Samsung phone are all okay and let me delete messages.&nbsp; I will do as you suggest and try another browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Again I would like to thank you for your help and will try everything you suggest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a great evening.</p>

            Well then how the (bleep) do I get my three Windows 10 machines to share files?!&nbsp; You can't seriously expect everyone to just start using thumb drives.&nbsp; (And before you even think it, cloud storage like One Drive is NOT an acceptable solution.&nbsp; The files
 need to go <em>directly </em>between machines on the same network.)

<h2>            WinUSB Driver Not Available</h2>
                    I am (still) trying to connect my phone. The WinUSB driver does not appear as an option in my list of available drivers. The necessary files (finally) seem to be there but the driver does come up in my list. I had to do a factory restore on my laptop the
 other day and it's been fouled up ever since. How can I get the WinUSB driver to be visible in the list of drivers? Any help would be appreciated.

            <p>The phone is a Nokia Lumia 920 and I had tried all the uninstall/reinstall driver things and looked for drivers in C:\\Windows\inf. Other USB devices worked fine and the phone had previously been installed on this computer and is also installed on my work
 computer. I took every piece of advice everyone gave me and NOTHING worked. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last night in desperation (just before tearing all of my hair out)&nbsp;I just kept swapping the phone around to different USB ports. No, no, no... yes! All of a sudden one of the ports recognized the phone (on the second circuit around the ports) and installed
 the driver. Interestingly now that the driver is installed the phone works on all of the ports including all those that wouldn't install a driver before.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still confused as to why the WinUSB driver doesn't show up in my list of available drivers though. I understood that to be a basic standard driver.</p>

<h2>            My sixth xbox 360 system I&#39;ve bought</h2>
                    
<p>I am a die-hard microsoft fan with loyalty to my xbox 360. But I just recently bought the system for the sixth time now. Not even after a month of usage, it has stopped reading my games AGAIN! I am tired of re-buying this system. This is the last Xbox i
 will ever purchase. I have never owned a piece of hardware that just craps out like the xbox 360. I will recommened to all my friends that the xbox 360 is no longer the best system to buy, simply because of your hardware. I own over 150 games or the xbox 360
 and im actually willing to give them all up and never get this system (or microsoft's next gaming system) ever again. I've spent thousands just re-buying the console over, over, and over again.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Connect to Home Network</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to connect my computer to my home network, but I'm having some problems. The computer used to be connected to the network and the Internet and had no problems, but then I had to reinstall the operating system, and now I can't get it to connect.
 I have Windows XP Media Center Edition SP2 Version 2002&nbsp;installed on it. I've connected the computer directly to the modem using an ethernet cable, and I've tried all the different options in the Create a Connection (or whatever it's called) wizard, and I
 still can't connect to the network. When I look at the lights on the ethernet port on the computer, one is green and the other is orange, and the light on the modem is green. The computer has a 1394 Net Adapter installed, as well as a Linksys Wireless-G card.
 Using the Wireless card, I was able to connect to the network but it would disconnect after about 2 seconds, then it would reconnect again after maybe 5 seconds, before disconnecting again. This cycle kept repeating. I've removed the antenna from the wireless
 card and uninstalled it's driver&nbsp;so that there's no conflict between the wireless card and the cable connection. There are four other computers connected to the modem, 3 are wireless, and one is connected with an ethernet cable.</p>
<p>Am I missing something here? What do I need to do to connect the computer to my home network and then the internet?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h3> sephrobert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Apps and Game Storage Doesn&#39;t Add Up</h2>
                    <p>I got my computer a couple months ago with 238gb SSD hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially I had no problems downloading files and the games that I wanted (I do play on Steam a good bit, however I couldn't find any help there). Recently though I uninstalled a few games I hadn't been playing, which should have totaled up to around 90gb
 of storage freed up. With even fewer things installed now I'm being told by windows that I only have 48.6gb of storage remaining, half of what I should have minimum.</p>
<p>When I look at the storage specifically Windows tells me that Apps and Games takes up 152gb of storage, however when I actually open that up and sort by size, the largest item there is only 3.69gb and everything together should not exceed 10gb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is Windows telling me so much more storage is being used under Apps and Games than is listed?</p>

            <pre>I don't have any specific suggestions for your problem. Here are some tips on doing generic cleanup, including some apps that help you visually identify space used
10 BEST FREE TOOLS TO ANALYZE HARD DRIVE SPACE ON YOUR WIN PC – TREE MAP HD – SPACE MAP
2017 06 21 http://www.howtogeek.com/113012/10-best-free-tools-to-analyze-hard-drive-space-on-your-windows-pc/ 
SPACESNIFFER 
http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/index.html 
(2012 09 – Ron) I have played with it I like that you can filter out files &amp; folders as you identify you can’t touch them allowing you to focus on remaining space.  I also like that it redraws space allocations in real time as files are deleted.
HERE SOME OTHER OPTIONS TO FREE UP HD SPACE. – TREE MAP – SPACE MAP
Note: Buy the USB drive first, then make a Full Image Copy backup BEFORE you start deleting. That way when you realize you “oopsed” and deleted something you REALLY NEED, you will have something to recover from. Use a tool that will allow you to easily extract the files. DriveImage XML
External USB drive
Buy an external USB drive in the 1TB or larger size range. That way you could move all of your data files to the drive if needed. PLUS you will have space to make several image copy backups to this drive.   If you plan on buying a new computer in the next year or two, you should consider buying a “USB 3” type drive. Although USB3 is not important for your current machine (it will work at USB 2 speeds), on a new computer it will work up to 10 times faster than a USB 2 connection. So you might as well consider planning for the future.
 “Decrapify”
If you are deleting apps, take a look at other apps you have and do not use regularly.  Here is a link to a review of a couple of tools to help you “decrapify” your computer:
•	www.7tutorials.com/removing-bloat-crapware-pc-decrapifier-or-slimcomputer
•	Consider using 3rd party tools to uninstall apps. The third party tools often are more aggressive about deleting everything with old apps.
Disk Cleaner Utilities
It won’t hurt to use a couple of disk cleaners. They are tuned to look for different things.  But don’t let any of them run automatically. Do a scan and check the results to ensure it doesn’t get over enthusiastic
CCleaner is a free util that will identify and delete many unused files: http://www.piriform.com/CCLEANER  http://pcsupport.about.com/od/registry-cleaner/fr/ccleaner.htm (review)
http://www.wisecleaner.com/wisediskcleanerfree.html - another one I use periodically
http://www.thewindowsclub.com/system-restore-manager-for-windows-released - I don’t know if it will work on XP. What it does is allow you to see and delete system restore points you may not need.

Duplicate File Finders
Use one or more duplicate file finder tools, i.e.:
http://www.ilovefreesoftware.com/23/featured/5-free-duplicate-file-finders.html
http://www.mindgems.com/products/Fast-Duplicate-File-Finder/Fast-Duplicate-File-Finder-About.htm
NOTE: do no rely on “automatic” file selction. Confirm each file deletion manually 
Note: there are a lot of small system and application files that are duplicates that you really don’t need.  The main example is alternate language support. You will see things like the EULA and HELP files in a dozen or more languages you don’t read. You can delete them.
Locate Large files to delete
Find a “tree space” type disk mapping utility. They display file and folders sizes as relatively sized boxes. This makes it easier to identify places to focus on because they have the largest impact. Here are some examples:

•	http://www.worldstart.com/windirstat/print/
•	http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/free-tons-of-hard-drive-space-with-treesize/
File Compression
After you do all other file cleanup, and before Defragging, consider turning on XP System File Compression.  File compression will add a little delay when you read and write file, but is a worthwhile trade when you are short of space. You can identify a lot of data files you don’t use frequently.  The same goes with Applications. While you don’t want to compress the whole “Programs” folder, you could compress application subfolders for applications and application sub elements you don’t use frequently. Things like “graphics” or “artwork” or “samples”, or even “Help” are very rarely used, so taking a little longer to open them is not going to be a significant impact on your performance.
Defragment Utility
After you finish all of the file deletion, run a file defragmentation utility. This will consolidate files and free space.  it may coincidentally free up a little space. The main thing is by defragging your HD it will read and write files faster.
XP comes with a simple defragger: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314848
there are also better freeware. I’ve been using defraggler for a while, but have used others in the past.

2017 11 07- 7 WAYS TO MAXIMIZE STORAGE SPACE ON LOW CAPACITY WINDOWS 10 DEVICES
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/ 
A few years ago starting with the launch of Windows 8.1, Microsoft and industry partners launched devices that could compete with Apple’s iPad. These devices were severely limited in their storage space, including some with around 16 GBs of storage. The use case was multimedia consumption and casual usage – web browsing, email, listening music, streaming video. You were expected to use Windows Store apps, keep your files on OneDrive and use On Demand Files to manage storage.

When you upgrade your current version of Windows to a newer version, the upgrade process will create backups of important directories from your previous version of Windows. These directories include your user profiles, Windows folder, Program Files directory, and other important locations. These backups are then stored in two folders called Windows.old and $Windows.~BT, which can be used after the upgrade to recover any data that may not have been properly migrated over to the new version of Windows.
Before deleting the backups of your old Windows folders, please make sure that you have all of your data migrated to the new version of Windows. Unless you have created a backup, these folders will be permanently deleted from your computer.

ADDITIONAL ‘UNDOCUMENTED’, ELSEWHERE, CLEANUP OF OFFICE 365 CTR RELATED FILES
https://winaero.com/blog/free-about-several-gbs-of-disk-space-after-installing-office-2016/ 
We will see how to free up disk space after installing Office 2016 Click To Run (CTR).  The problem is caused by the Click To Run system, which downloads very huge updates, e.g. about 1GB per update. But it does not do any form of cleanup. Since it does not delete them later even after updates are applied, lots of disk space is taken.

<h3> loracheese  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keep getting message that the alps pointing device that I optionally updated is not working properly.  How can I uninstall it&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Compaq laptop C700 computer and back in May while updating Windows I chose to update Alps pointing device optionally.&nbsp; The update was successful, however , when I boot my computer a box pops up saying that the alps pointing device is not working
 properly and that Windows will close the program and notify if a solution is found.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have noticed that my cursor occasionally goes crazy flitting all over the screen and I have&nbsp; searched all over to find a way to uninstall this optional update with no success.<br />
<br />
Could someone please assist me with a solution to this annoying problem?<br />
<br />

<h2>            CODIGO DE CONTENIDO GOLD DE RESIDENT EVIL 5</h2>
                    
<p>Hola, hace unos meses compre el juego resident evil 5 gold edition y hasta hace un par de semanas abri el juego, el caso es que al tratar de canjear el código para descargar los capítulos adicionales del juego, me indica que el código no es válido y que
 ingrese un código que sí lo sea, cabe destacar que ya cheque con Xbox vía telefónica y me indican que el código sí es para México y que no ha sido usado, pero ellos no pueden ayudarme que tengo que acudir a los foros con Capcom, por lo que ahora no se que
 hacer y si me parece molesto que compre un juego y no pueda acceder a todo el contenido.&nbsp; Aguien ha sufrido un inconveniente como el mío? y que han hecho al respecto?&nbsp; De antemano gracias por su ayuda y orientación.</p>

                    I think I have a similar problem that others are having. You sign in-it's accepted-now one must re-enter 'old' password-and it states that you have entered the password incorrectly. It is the same one that you entered 2 seconds earlier!

    <title>RESET - when message &#34; you have tried too many times with - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dickstoner  say:</h3>
<h2>            RESET - when message &#34; you have tried too many times with incorrect password&#34;</h2>
                    <p>This is a very weird process and MS seems to imply it's for security,&nbsp; but it literally locks you out of your account forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had to enter recent emails sent,&nbsp; past passwords ( only one, but it wants more)&nbsp; and then name contacts from my address book,&nbsp; but if it does not like the match,&nbsp; it tells you it can not validate your account enough to send you a reset for the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the correct answer is&nbsp; " Don't Use any software that makes it this ridiculous to reset, especially when you are using the same machine on which you set up the account, and your other MS accounts all work."</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you failed to fill out the verification form the first time, I highly suggest to fill out the form again, here are some tips you may consider following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The chances of passing the validation increase if you fill out this form from a computer that was previously used to sign in to that account, and was successful. Also, it is much better if you can do this process from a network location (i.e. home Wi-Fi
 or work network) where a previous sign-in occurred. </li><li>Be sure to use the information you had associated with the account originally, even if there were recent changes.
</li><li>The 4 basic information (First Name, Last Name, Birthdate and Current/Old Passwords are the best and easiest way to prove your Online Identity) And also, please be reminded that you just need to fill out information that you are just 100% sure and in the
 best of your knowledge. </li><li>You don't need to fill out everything but make sure that you have provided enough for you to pass this validation. The 4 basic information is more than enough to prove your identity - as long as it matches the system's record.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you no longer have an access to the security information presented when trying to reset your password, answering the verification form is the only option to ​recover your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if in case you already fill out the from and failed a couple of times, you may consider creating a new account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>SEE,&nbsp; I did this multiple times.... my only 2 past passwords,&nbsp; the names and details of 3 recent emails sent and all other info requested.&nbsp; IT fails each time,&nbsp; so I will simply not ever use this product.&nbsp; IT is a waste of my time.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have an outlook account
 and it keeps finding it and so starting a new account for Skype does not seem to work.&nbsp; It is not essential for my life, so I will find a competing product somewhere when needed.&nbsp; There is no reason to lock people out of accounts, when passwords and resets
 are available.&nbsp; They obviously do not want users.</p>

            Hi Marktire,<br />
<br />
<br />
•&nbsp;Do you receive any error message when tried to login to temp user profile?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A temporary user profile is issued each time an error condition prevents the user's profile from loading. Temporary profiles are deleted at the end of each session, and changes made by the user to their desktop settings and files are lost when the user logs
 off.
<p>It sounds like your user profile is corrupt. I recommed you to create a new user profile and check if you are able to login to it without any problem.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I'm adding a link that will help you to either fix a corrupt user account or create a new user account.<br />
<strong>Fix a corrupted user profile: </strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></strong></a></p>
<p>I've also found an article that explains the following: <br />
<strong>Error message when you log on to a Windows Vista-based computer by using a temporary profile: "The User Profile Service failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded"

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />If you forgot your Wi-Fi network password, you can find it if you have another Windows PC already connected to your Wi-Fi network. After you find your password, you can use it on another PC or device to connect to your Wi-Fi network.
<br />
<br />	1. On a Windows PC that’s connected to your Wi-Fi network, do one of the following, depending on which version of Windows is running on your PC:
<br />		a. On Windows 10, select the Start  button, then select Settings  &gt; Network &amp; Internet  &gt; Status  &gt; Network and Sharing Center.
<br />	2. In Network and Sharing Center, next to Connections, select your Wi-Fi network name.
<br />	3. In Wi-Fi Status, select Wireless Properties.
<br />	4. In Wireless Network Properties, select the Security tab, then select the Show characters check box.
<br />Your Wi-Fi network password is displayed in the Network security key box.

<p>Where are you getting these "MVI" files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your files are created by a Canon camera:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>Movie clips taken with IXUS 1000 HS, PowerShot Elph 500 HS, PowerShot SX 200IS, PowerShot SD 780IS and many other Canon cameras are normally saved as MVI_xxxx files. These MVI files are actually Motion-JPEG/H.264 encoded video
 with .AVI or .MOV as file extension. The SD MVI videos shooting at 640x480 end up as .avi files and HD MVI files at 1280x720 or full HD 1920x1080 .mov files. While, the MVI format does not playback or edit very well. To make Canon MVI videos playable on your
 PC with media player, editable for video editing programs like Window Movie Maker, you need to change MVI first as the above users mentioned.
</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p>The above paragraph is from a website that offers a product that will convert Canon camera video files to, for example, *.WMV files that can be played by Windows Media Player.&nbsp; A Google search will turn up several of these products, but most, if not all,
 are not free (unless you're willing to have watermarks all over your movies).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This website claims that its free version will convert Canon MVI files:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.any-video-converter.com/free-mvi-converter.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.any-video-converter.com/free-mvi-converter.php</a>&nbsp; MVI is not, however, in the list of supported file formats:&nbsp; http://www.any-video-converter.com/supported-formats.php&nbsp; Also, my antivirus complains about some pages at this web site:&nbsp; if you choose
 to install this product, be very careful during the installation process to avoid installing other programs that you do not want and that may adversely affect your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You might see if the free VLC player can play your files without conversion..&nbsp; This is much more versatile that the video players natively available in Windows 7.&nbsp;

<p>Hi EBMB, </p>
<p>
</p><p>If your media is in a different format, you’ll need to convert it. There's a third party applications that you can use to convert it. This guide is for burning video and other media meant for a DVD player, not simply a data DVD. You may use Windows DVD maker
 to burn your&nbsp;own movies or photo collections. Thus, it only supports the following file types:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Video files</strong>: ASF, AVI, DVR-MS, M1V, MP2, MP2V, MPE, MPEG, MPG, MPV2, WM, WMV</li><li><strong>Photo files:</strong>&nbsp;BMP, DIB, EMF, GIF, JFIF, JPE, JPEG, JPG, PNG, TIF, TIFF, WMF</li><li><strong>Sound files</strong>: AIF, AIFC, AIFF, ASF, AU, MP2, MP3, MPA, SND, WAV, WMA.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>To go ahead with the conversion, follow the steps below: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Load Your Media. Open your DVD drive and insert a blank disc. Any type of burnable DVD (DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, etc.) should work, as long as your DVD burner supports it. Click the Start button, then type “dvd.” “Windows DVD Maker” should be the first result—click
 it to launch the program. </li><li>From the introductory screen, you can add photo and video files to the DVD storage and menu system. Click the “Add items” button to open a Windows Explorer menu, wherein you can search for and add video, audio, and photo files. You can add as many as you
 like, up to the limit of the blank disc in your DVD drive (typically four to eight gigabytes).</li><li>Click “Options” in the lower-right hand corner. This offers a few selections for authored DVDs—that is, DVDs intended to be played back as a movie rather than simply read as data.</li><li>Select a Menu. In this screen, you can select the menu that will appear before your video plays, assuming that’s how you set it up in the previous section. None of this is particularly important, it just lends a little extra flair to the presentation. Standard
 styles can be selected from the scrolling box on the left.</li><li>When you’re ready, click “Burn.” Now just wait—depending on how much data you’ve added to the disc it could take a few minutes or more than an hour to finish. When it’s done, pop it into any DVD player (or any other computer with a DVD drive and playback
 software) to enjoy your movie.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>

<h2>            reinstalling windows 7 after hard drive died &#40;and was replaced&#41;...........</h2>
                    <p>Greetings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping I might be able to reinstall windows 7 pro, 64 bit myself (rather than pay geek squad). My hard drive died and it is under warranty, so I'm getting it replaced. I have the two windows 7 pro disks that came from HP when I got my notebook at the
 time. It is the full install, and I was wondering is it like XP? I had to reinstall XP after against years ago my hard drive died and was replaced, and xp was so easy and beautiful it would have reinstalled itself if it could.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I am just hoping to save money rather than paying the geek squad, as these are not great times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Can someone tell me if there is a trick to it, or just put in the installation disks?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have quite a few back ups of my entire notebook (OS and all, the copy of the disk etc) to an external hard drive and am wondering which would be best? At this point, I just want to get windows up and then I hope I can re-download and install word,
 which I also paid for and have the key to.&nbsp; All other files are in external dries. Maybe (gee) I could even get outlook to work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for any help. I have to go to the library to respond, I do get some email in my phone but not all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>thanks again,</p>
<p>

            Use the latest revision, make sure the update matches your system model number. Updating is usually a safe procedure, I updated by brothers Inspirson 640M purchased in 2006 the other day and its surprisingly quick and easy.

<h2>            HIbernate has stopped working on Surface Pro 3 &#47; Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>The hibernate sub-option on my power button stopped working today. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;My surface pro 3 with Windows 10 is fully patched and has been working like a charm for years.&nbsp; I have hibernate enabled and I use it daily.&nbsp; Today, for some reason when I clicked on power and then chose hibernate, nothing happens.&nbsp; All the other sub-options
 still work: Sleep, restart and shut down all work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have hibernate linked as the default action on the physical power button and as a result nothin happens when I now push that button either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions as to what might break this so I can fix I?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried turning off the hibernate feature and then back on.&nbsp; It did not fix the issue.&nbsp; No patch or update has been applied in the last few days.</p>
<p>

<p>Can you also check if Shutdown works correctly?</p>
<p>In my case if I click Shutdown in Start menu, the system starts to shut down, then the screen goes black and it looks like everything ok, but actually it's not. The tablet remains in strange state - it cannot be turned on by clicking power button, and clicking
 Windows button makes it vibrate. I have to keep power button pressed for a long time to forcefully turn off the tablet. Then it can be turned on normally.</p>

<p>ACHEI A SOLUÇÃO!!!!<br />
<br />
A grande falha é que assim que baixamos queremos logo ver se ta tudo funcionando mas NÃO FAÇA ISSO!!<br />
<br />
Assim que abrir o app pela primeira vez, deixe ele aberto na pagina inicial, tu vai notar que vai começar a carregar uma barra de 3 pixeis logo em baixo da tarja roxa do jw library. ESPERE ESSA BARRA CARREGAR TODA sem sair do programa, sem mecher!!!! apenas
 espere!! quando essa barra carregar, pode usar normalmente, e o app estará perfeito!<br />
Que jeová te abençoe &lt;3</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; Translated by Google:</p>
I THOUGHT THE SOLUTION !!!!<br />
<br />
The big flaw is that as soon as we get down we want to see if everything is working but DO NOT DO THIS !!<br />
<br />
Once you open the app for the first time, leave it open on the home page, you will notice that it will start loading a 3-pixel bar just below the purple jw library strip. WAIT THIS BAR LOAD EVERYTHING without leaving the program, without flipping !!!! just
 wait!! when this bar loads, you can use it normally, and the app will be perfect!<br />
May Jehovah bless you &lt;3<br />
