<h2>            Bulk add multiple e-mail addresses</h2>
                    When creating a contact list (e.g., distribution group) or an inbox rule, it appears as if each contact has to be entered individually. Is there any way to bulk add e-mail addresses when creating a contact list or inbox rule?

<h2>            PC boots into BIOS settings after attempting Windows 10 build 10240 update</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a custom built Windows PC with a As rock H55M-LE P1.80 (latest bios update) Mobo. I've been apart of the Windows Insider Preview program since build 130. My PC recently received the build 166 updated via Windows Update without any problems. However,
 &nbsp;I turned on my PC this morning upon which I received a Windows notification instructing that the Windows 10 build 240 was ready for install via Windows Update. I followed the instructions by restarting the PC ... the update did its thing ... PC shutdown to
 do the restart, but now it keeps booting into the bios. I've tried completing shutting the computer down leaving it off for 5mins and then turned it on with the same results.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>

    <title>Several problems with Office 365 Home including &#39;Updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taffy087  say:</h3>
<h2>            Several problems with Office 365 Home including &#39;Updates Available&#34; - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I moved to Office 365 Home in January 2016 and when I renewed it this year I had problems - it didn't recognise that I'd renewed it for two weeks and it kept telling me I had to 'renew or lose'. Eventually it sorted itself out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the past five days, I've had problems that I've never had before:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I opened an Excel document that I'd saved the day before, changed some details and when I clicked on Save As (so I could give the amended document another name) I got this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/79edcd93-4cbf-461c-9aaa-4cad01889004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/79edcd93-4cbf-461c-9aaa-4cad01889004" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed that link and got this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a00701f-68a5-428d-bdd2-65f8724027f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a00701f-68a5-428d-bdd2-65f8724027f8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>My workaround was to save it to Desktop with a slightly different name and from there I moved it to where I wanted to save it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I tried to 'Save As' another document I'd saved the previous day. This time I got this warning:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/946a0aef-6491-47ad-b38e-ad57d0bc0a3f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/946a0aef-6491-47ad-b38e-ad57d0bc0a3f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, my workaround was before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Then this happened when I tried to 'Save As' a Word document I'd saved the previous day:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f55c6c3-408c-4819-870c-5af28364ae46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f55c6c3-408c-4819-870c-5af28364ae46" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never been asked to start Offcat.exe &amp; have no idea how to. I clicked on the
<em>[Edited at 11:00 on the 4th to correct the following. It was the Office <strong>
Upload</strong> Center]</em>&nbsp;<del>Office Update Center </del>icon (if that's its name) and saw No Updates Available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. If I open a document I've saved recently I now get this message about 'Protected View' 40% of the time:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8776b879-e370-4cf2-bfce-20361420e720" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8776b879-e370-4cf2-bfce-20361420e720" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But the documents are MY documents, not ones that I've been sent via the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. It's probably relevant if I&nbsp;mention that I have never 'signed in' to Office when creating/saving documents. I never share documents with anyone else, nor need them to Edit my documents. In simple terms, I use Office as I did before - PC-based, not cloud-based
 - so why am I' having these problems? And why am I having these problems only now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I accept that I have never fully explored Office 365 Home but what I do is all simple basic stuff so I don't need 'bells &amp; whistles'. Am I missing something basic? Is there a 'Dummies for Office 365 available? (I can't find one on-line.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> &nbsp;:o(&nbsp;&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping someone can help me! Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS I've lumped these problems together - if a Moderator feels they should be split into separate threads, please do so. Thanks, again. And I could only find Office 365 Home via the OneDrive label. Is this correct?</p>
<p>

            Edited at 10:56 4th just to add the 'problem number viz<strong> 6.</strong> I've just had to update one of the Excel documents (above) that I'd saved. This time I got a message similar in layout and colour to the Protected View message above that said
 words to the effect "Sorry but someone has just edited your document". It gave me the option of retaining my version or the current version so it was easy to change/save it. But again, why did I get the message? Will this happen every time I try to update
 &amp; save one of my documents?

            Hello.
<p>I'd like to update you before replying to your specific questions:</p>
<p>7. This morning, I opened&nbsp;a 2016 Excel worksheet (in a 2016 Folder for the subject in question) &amp; 'Saved as' in the 2017 Folder for that subject, with a 2017 name. An hour later when I opened it to change some of the information it told me it was in Read-Only
 mode:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86cb1dd7-c390-456d-b2e9-370ef928e98d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86cb1dd7-c390-456d-b2e9-370ef928e98d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on Edit Workbook, changed some details but could only save it via my Desktop as I'd done in the examples above. I then moved it to the correct Folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. What's the difference please between the "Microsoft Office Upload Center" (circular icon is a white up arrow on red) and the "Office 2016 Upload Center" (similar icon but on orange background? And why/what should I need to upload anyway, as I don't sign
 in to my Cloud account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><em>What troubleshooting steps have you already performed? </em><strong>None - this is the first time I've had any problems. What steps are available, please?</strong></li><li><em>Have you tested manually downloading the updates for Office 365? </em><strong>No - I thought my Updates were delivered automatically, And I've no idea how to
</strong><strong>start Offcat.exe </strong></li><li><em>Are there any changes made on your computer prior to the issue? </em><strong>No changes made.</strong></li><li><em>Have you checked if the issue is re-occurring on safe mode for Office? </em>
<strong>No - I wasn't aware that Office can be opened in Safe Mode. How &amp; what would I do, please?</strong></li></ul>

<p>Thank you Jhessica. I'll do what you suggest at the weekend. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/136343/whats-the-difference-between-office-365-and-office-2013/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How-to-Geek article</a> that someone has PM'd me (the link description wrongly refers to Office 2013!) &nbsp;the Author
 writes that</p>
<p><em>"While we’re focusing on the desktop versions of Office for Windows PCs and Macs here,
<strong>Microsoft also offers Office Online.</strong> This is a completely free, web-based version of Office. If you’re happy using Microsoft Office through a web browser, you can use web-based versions of Word, Excel, and PowerPoint for free.</em></p>
<p><em>These are simplified Office applications and don’t have all the features you’d get in the desktop applications—<strong>you can’t even use them offline</strong>, for example—but they’re surprisingly good. They also have excellent compatibility with Office
 document formats. They may be a good option if you don’t need Office often, or just need a few basic features."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>So you'll understand why I completely confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Must I be on-line when using my Office 365 and if so will I always get the irritating and time-wasting nonsense I've outlined above?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be grateful for your advice on this.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The sync'ing problems have gone away at the moment, after Creators was installed overnight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'm still having the Protected View messages, even on documents I created a year ago and amended a few weeks ago. Every time I enable Editing and change a document, it tells me that it's only the document saved on my PC that been changed, that that online

<p>2(b) Will all my current documents (saved on my PC) be automatically transferred to the 'boxed version'?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I realise I'll lose some whistles &amp; bells and I don't I need&nbsp;Publisher, Powerpoint, Access, Skype or the 365 version of Outlook. I will miss OneDrive though.</p>

<p>It's nearly two months since I created this &amp; Jhessica Sur replied and I've got no further.
</p>
<p>This problem is driving me mad - several times a day I open a Word document and get the 'Protected View' nonsense. Today, there was yet another problem: yesterday, I opened two 2016 documents - simple Word documents that I'd used as a poster in my Sports
 club. I amended them and saved them with a 2017 name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, after receiving confirmation of the 2017 dates/times, I modified them &amp; pressed Save:</p>
<p>This is what I got:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/947328d7-fe65-450f-86b9-a2fd90633bac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/947328d7-fe65-450f-86b9-a2fd90633bac" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It wasn't 'someone', it was ME, and backing out of this nonsense has wasted an hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So let me ask again, please:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Do I&nbsp;<span><strong>have</strong></span>&nbsp;to use the cloud and sign in? Why can't I simply use Word &amp; Office etc as I used to when I installed them to my PC i.e.
<strong>save/edit all on my PC</strong>, not in the cloud?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Do the 'boxed' versions of Word &amp; Excel 2016 currently have an 'End of Life' date?</p>
<p>2(a) i.e. if I install them &amp; update them as before will MS withdraw support in the near future?</p>
<p>2(b) Will all my current documents (saved on my PC) be automatically transferred to the 'boxed version'?</p>
<p>3. If so I'll just lapse my 365 renewal at the end of the year and buy boxed versions. &nbsp;I just can't put up with this 'Protected View' nonsense any longer'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realise I'll lose some whistles &amp; bells but I don't need&nbsp;Publisher, Powerpoint, Access, Skype or the 365 version of Outlook. I will miss OneDrive though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate a response within the next day or two - please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edited at 07:36 to add: Oh, and by the way, you may want to advise me what caused all these problems to suddenly appear at the end of of February. There was no Cumulative WU that month - was there an Office Update?</p>

            Hello lacusnight,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your patience.
<br />
<br />I am pleased to inform you that Outlook.com has fully completed its deployment of the fix that had impacted service availability for some users in the infrastructure and there should be no more service interruption now.
<br />
<br />See: <a href="https://portal.office.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/servicestatus</a>
<br />
<br />In case it is still not working for you, it could be a browser-related issue.
<br />
<br />May I suggest you to delete your Microsoft/Outlook.com cookies and clear browser caches then restart the browser? 
<br />
<br />- selectively deleting browser cookies
<br /><a href="https://www.beacontechnologies.com/blog/2012/10/clearing-cookies-from-just-one-site/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.beacontechnologies.com/blog/2012/10...</a>
<br />- clearing browser caches
<br /><a href="https://www.refreshyourcache.com/en/home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.refreshyourcache.com/en/home/</a>
<br />
<br />Alternatively, open in private mode ("incognito mode") or try with a different browser
<br />
<br />Otherwise, clear your DNS revolver caches: <code>Win</code>+<code>R</code> and enter <code>cmd.exe</code> then key in <code>ipconflig /flushdns</code>
<br />
<br />Please ensure that your browsers have
<br />

<br />
<br />As I am continuously trying to improve myself so that I can give customers the best customer support experience they deserve, please let me know if my answers could be better. Your indication will reverberate across great distances and spans of time especially users who are encountering the same issue as you.

<p><strong>I got a new hard drive for my computer a few months ago, and I have been trying to connect my zune to my computer, but nothing has worked at all. &nbsp;I have tried signing in to my zune account on my zune hd so that I can at least download some new apps,
 but it just won't connect. &nbsp;My friends told me the zune was great, but I am disagreeing with them at this point. &nbsp;I need to know how to connect my zune, because so far, this zune was a complete waste of almost 400 dollars, not to mention the zune pass fees
 I didn't realize ere building up on my credit &nbsp;card. &nbsp;In total I have spent well over 1000 dollars on this device. &nbsp;I need to know it was a LITTLE worth it. &nbsp;Please Help.</strong></p>

<h3> jeffreybl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2013 calendar invitations sent to IMAP address are not formatted as proper appointment requests, but those sent to non-IMAP addresses look normal</h2>
                    <p>Running Office 2013 365, but also was an issue with regular license Office 2013. &nbsp;Issue is on both Windows 7 and 8 machines. &nbsp; I use Outlook 2013 as my email application on my computers. &nbsp;Two different, but seemingly related issues. &nbsp;Bitdefender
 security software. &nbsp;Two computers, same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Calendar Invitations: &nbsp;</strong>When I create an event for which I invite attendees, if only one attendee, and they have an IMAP account such as gmail or icloud, they get an email with only the text of the appointment, and no clickable
 actions such as accept, decline, etc... &nbsp;My sent folder has essentially a plain text version (what they received), which is not set up as a calendar event. &nbsp;The event does land on my calendar. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>If the recipient is non-IMAP, they get the proper calendar function email and the proper calendar function email is in my sent folder and the event is on my calendar.</li><li>If I have multiple attendee recipients, both IMAP and non-IMAP email accounts, the non-IMAP gets a functional invitation, but the IMAP recipients get the plain non-functional email. &nbsp; In this case, both versions are in my sent folder.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Emails: &nbsp;</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">My default email format is set as HTML. &nbsp;My email is gmail set up as IMAP. &nbsp;If I create an email for which at least one recipient has an IMAP account, such as gmail
 or icloud, then two versions of the email are put in my sent folder. &nbsp;The first one that hits the sent folder is the proper HTML version. &nbsp;The second one that hits a second later is the plain text version. &nbsp;Usually, recipients do get only the HTML version.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Have spent hours on the phone with 1800Microsoft (mostly the latter issue) and am getting nowhere...</p>

            <p>The initial issue was the email part of the situation, where after sending an email created in my default HTML format, I sometimes would see two versions saved in my sent folder. &nbsp;First the HTML then a plain text version. &nbsp;As best as I can tell, the HTML
 version is the one actually sent. &nbsp;But the issue was not reproducible on command, thus after the technician tried a few things, I would send a test email, and all appeared normal, but then it happens again after the call. &nbsp;They would see the evidence in my
 sent folder from when this happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of great interest, this originally was being troubleshot on my Lenovo Windows 8.1 laptop, and an older Dell Windows 7 desktop. &nbsp;Same issues, both computers. &nbsp;But I have since replaced the Dell with a Lenovo desktop with Windows 8.1. &nbsp;I have the same exact
 issue there. &nbsp;The computer was built from scratch, including the Outlook folder (email history and contacts) being created under the IMAP protocol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, this originally was with two full license versions of Office 2013, and I moved to Office 365 when I got the new computer. &nbsp;No change in the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what I mostly recall from the technicians is (only performed with the full individual license versions):</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>making sure the default email format is set to HTML. &nbsp;Yes.</li><li>Doing &nbsp;a "repair" to the program. &nbsp;No change.</li><li>Checking all the IMAP account setups. &nbsp;All fine.</li><li>Making sure the "save copies of messages in sent items folder is unchecked (per IMAP protocol to not have two copies saved). &nbsp;Yes.</li><li>I'm sure there were other items when they were zipping around my computer checking things, but these were the primary items.</li></ul>
<p>I most recently looking into the calendar aspect described in my original post, and was able to come of with what seems to be a predictable and reproducible scenario for having calendar event invitations go out without normal calendar functionality for accepting,
 etc..., and tying it to happening only with IMAP email addresses. &nbsp;I have not tried calling support on the latest aspect, as it usually ends up with a frustrating review of aspects that are too elementary for finding the causes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Bing Weather App - Missing Option to Pin to Start Screen from within App - Stuck with London</h2>
                    <p>Answers to questions from customers wanting to customize the default Live Tile showing in their start screen usually involve this answer and the Microsoft advice assumes the Pin to Start option shows within the App which is not the case for me :</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>How to add Weather data to the Start Screen:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to the <strong>Weather App</strong> and <strong>
right click</strong></span><span> </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>At the top, click on <strong>Places</strong></span><span> and select the City to be added to your Start Screen</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(38, 38, 38, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p>However using Windows 8.1 (Update 1) I cannot locate this option in the pop up bottom bar. Right clicking gives me various options including change to Fahrenheit etc but no Pin to Start. Therefore I am stuck with London in start screen despite the fact that
 my Home is not set to London but actually Edinburgh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why Bing Weather App does not set Live Tile to Home by default anyway is beyond me to understand!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help? The Microsoft advice assumes the Pin to Start option shows within the App. But it isn't there for me...</p>

 correctly because my user/profile folder will not be available. How do I avoid this, without knowing how to write VBS code.&nbsp; I can give specific examples of the macros I need.&nbsp; Help!!

            Here are the basics:<br />
<div>
<span>How to Use the Macros in This Book</span>
<p>You may want to use the macros in this book in your own computer system. This is a great way to add features to your system and to use the techniques shown in this book. You may be curious how you can copy the macros in this book and
 paste them directly into the VBA Editor.</p>
<p>The answer to this question depends on the format in which you are reading this book.
<i>WordTips: The Macros </i>is available in two formats: PDF and Word document.</p>
<p>If you have the Microsoft Word version of this book, then you can use Word’s capabilities to simply select and copy the macro code lines, and then paste them into the desired place in the VBA Editor. (If you are working with macros, you
 undoubtedly already know how to copy and paste text.)</p>
<p>The defacto format for most electronic books is PDF format. This type of file is opened using Adobe’s Acrobat or Acrobat Reader programs. In this format you can easily read, search, and print information. If you want to copy macro code
 lines from the PDF file and place them in the VBA Editor, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
<span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Display the page containing the code lines that you want to copy.</p>
<p>
<span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the Acrobat toolbar, click the Text Select Tool.</p>
<p>
<span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Position the mouse pointer (which should now look like an I-beam) at the beginning of the first line of code you want to copy.</p>
<p>
<span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Click and hold down the mouse button.</p>
<p>
<span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Drag the mouse pointer to the end of the last line you want to copy. (The text behind the mouse pointer, back to the starting point, is selected.</p>
<p>
<span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Release the mouse button.</p>
<p>
<span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Press
<strong>Ctrl+C</strong> to copy the text to the Clipboard.</p>
<p>
<span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the VBA Editor, position the insertion point at the location where you want to paste the code.</p>
<p>
<span>9.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Press
<strong>Ctrl+V</strong>. The code is pasted at the location you specified.</p>
<p>This process of copying and pasting text is very similar to how the same process is accomplished in Word, with the exception of step 2. The only thing lost when pasting information that originated in a PDF file is the indentation of each
 line. Other than that, you should be able to paste exactly what you copied.</p>
<br />

</span></p>
<br />
<br />
Try using <span>
%UserProfile%\ to replace the personal part of the path.&nbsp; If that doesn't work, posting a couple of examples would help</span>.<br />
<br />
You can paste it into the start menu search field to open explorer in that location so you can see how much of the path is included.<br />

            <p>A macro you copy and paste from your own editor is no different from one you might copy and paste from here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically you need to place all&nbsp;of your macros you want to share into a template and then share that template with your co-workers.&nbsp; Your co-workers can load the template manually or automatically:<br />

</p><p><span><span>Re Outlook 2016, I figured out how to get my contacts to be the default contacts. However, I wound up with 2 calendars, one from the old (say Cal’10) titled CALENDAR and one from the new Outlook (say Cal’16) titled CALENDAR (THIS COMPUTER ONLY).
 I made a copy of Cal’10 and placed it into the Cal’16 folder. But I wound up with 3 calendars with the 3rd as a separate folder within the Cal’16 folder.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So I deleted the one I copied over and left it alone to see what would happen.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now I have the old calendar with the carryover tasks alongside the new calendar with no task.&nbsp;You can see a screen capture at
</span><a href="http://screencast.com/t/yaVuHpb1XtG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://screencast.com/t/yaVuHpb1XtG</span></a><span> .
<span>&nbsp;</span>But now when I get a reminder, the same task is shown twice in the reminder window.<span>&nbsp;
<span>&nbsp;</span>But now when I get a reminder, the same task is shown twice in the reminder window.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is a mystery since I can only see two calendars, one filled and one empty.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I figured out that if I copy each task from Cal’10 and place it in Cal’16, I will have a duplicate calendar. And then I could delete Cal’10.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But then I would likely get 3 with the same tasks.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So how do get just one calendar, the default, with my old calendar tasks in it and only one task shown in the reminder window?</span></p>

If this were my system - would simply make sure I had all the contact/calendar/task data you want to keep in a PST file so it doesn't get lost. Either move it to an existing PST file in the profile (if everything is not there already) and then start clean with

<p>
</p><p>Just from the description, going to guess that you first configured your &lt;Imap&gt; account which resulted in the &lt;This Computer Only&gt; folders being in the Imap folder tree. Starting with OL'2013, Outlook maintains everything in a single .ost file (hence the
 "This Computer Only" folders) and that .ost file is also set as the default data file for the profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OL'2010 on the other hand, kept contact/calendar data in a separate .pst file with email folders in a second (primary) pst file for the Imap account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strongly suggest that you maintain your contacts in a separate PST file the same way OL'2010 did which is done by simply setting that PST file as the default for the profile which in turn makes those contact/calendar folders the default for the profile -

<h2>            Appointments entered onto my Pocket PC will not sync with Outlook</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had the Cingular 8525 for about 6 months already and never had any syncing problems while running Windows Mobile 5. Two weeks ago, I upgraded to Windows Mobile 6 and now any appointments I enter onto the Pocket PC will not sync into Outlook
 2003 and vice versa. My&nbsp;ActiveSync manager says that the sync was complete and successful-there are no&nbsp;error messages displayed. But when I go back and look at the calendar-my new appointments are not there.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Anybody else have this problem? I have done a Detect and Repair on Outlook, deleted the partnership from ActiveSync 4.5 and nothing has worked. I don't notice any problems with my contacts, tasks, etc...Just with the calendar.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Shara</p>

            Shara, Linley's advise is pretty solid.&nbsp; If an appointment is recurring and no end date is set, it creates the appointment for 400 years .... a long time, a lot of data to store and we will never see the last appointment.&nbsp; Put end dates and give it another
 try....

Yes, but its not the recurring events that I am having problems with-and those that are recurring have end dates-its all appointments, most of which are only occuring once.

<p>Hi RyanVanYperen,</p>
<p>Since you can sign in to the Office applications with another account, the issue may be related to your account.</p>
<p>So to narrow down the issue, could you reply to the following?<br />
1. When you log into the Office application with another user’s account, are you redirected to another page automatically? Could you give us some screenshots about the process of logging in with the account?<br />
To upload a screenshot, click <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> and then click
<strong>Insert/Edit Media</strong>.<br />
2. I’ll send you a test account for your testing via a private message. Could you log in with the test account and tell us the outcome? You can get it via
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations.</p>
<p>Moreover, to check your account, please also provide it in the private message I sent to you.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Cliff</p>

<p>The issue persists. I can sign into the online Office 365 portal, and I have updated my Office client. I was not able to activate office by signing in, but my office IT installed the programs using an embedded key so now I can use the products, but can not
 tie them to my account by signing in.</p>
<p>When I say I am able to log in on another user account, what I mean is that I can create a new Mac username account for my computer (for example: Guest) and when I log in to that account, I can then sign in without a problem. However, when I try to sign
 on my username, I get the "There is a problem with your account" error every time.</p>

<p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing information with us.</p>
<p>Based on the latest post, it seems that your Office for Mac have been activated and you can use it successfully. The only issue is that you can’t sign in to Office for Mac with your Office 365 account, right?</p>
<p>In this case, to clarify the situation, please help confirm the following information:<br />
1.Try to use another Office 365 account to login to Office for Mac to check whether this issue is related to the specific account. You may seek help from your Office IT to complete this test.<br />
2.Please consult your company IT whether they have configured ADFS. According to this article
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3015526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot issues that you encounter when you sign in to Office apps for Mac, iPad, iPhone, or iPod Touch when using Active Directory Federation Services</a>, users may encounter this issue if
 the Administrator have configured AD FS 2012 R2 to let users sign in by using an alternative user identifier.</p>
<p><span>If this is the scenario, then this issue is related to Office for Mac application. In this situation, I suggest you post at our
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/home?forum=Office2016forMac&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;brandIgnore=True&amp;sort=relevancedesc&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;searchTerm=cna%27t+sign+in+to+Office" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office for Mac support forum </a>for professional support. Your understanding is highly appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span>If there are any misunderstood, please correct me.</span></p>

    <title>Cannot generate table of figures in Word 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> buzzls  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot generate table of figures in Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to generate a Table of Figures in Word 2016 (in either Windows 10 or Word for Mac) after I replaced the automatic number with a manual number.&nbsp; I noticed this on my MacBook yesterday when editing the documents with track changes turned on.&nbsp; I
 have now converted the documents to clean copies, and am editing them in Word on my Windows computer.&nbsp; Same result.&nbsp; After replacing the automatic numbers with the manual numbers, it returned a message that "<strong>No table of figures entries found</strong>."&nbsp;
 &nbsp;I deleted the table of figures and tried to re-create it, but now the Table of Figures tab is greyed out.&nbsp; All of the captions were generated by right-clicking the figure and using the Insert Caption function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, I just re-created a caption and left the automatic number in.&nbsp; I inserted some manual text before and after the automatic number, but left the automatic number in.&nbsp; &nbsp;Same result - the Table of Figures tab is still greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's going on and how do I fix it?&nbsp; This has NEVER been a problem before.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />

            By default, the Table of Figures is compiled from paragraphs that include the
<strong>{ SEQ Figure }</strong> field, which you have overwritten with a manual number. So you can't use the out-of-the-box Table of Figures. What you can do, however, is base the TOF on the Caption style, provided you haven't used it for anything other than
 figure captions. To do this, in the <strong>Table of Figures</strong> dialog, click
<strong>Options...</strong> In the <strong>Table of Figures Options</strong> dialog, check the box for
<strong>Style</strong>. The Caption style will be selected automatically. If you do have other captions, you can apply a different style to the figure captions and base the TOF on that.

<p>The <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/complex_documents.htm#TableFigures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
table of figures</a> depends on the label "Figure" is the Caption's <a href="http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/numbering.htm#Sequence_Fields" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SEQ field</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The field code for the Table of Figures field is { TOC \h \z \c "Figure" }.</p>
<p>That is, this is really a special <strong>Table of Contents field</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Caption field should look like this:</p>
<p>{ <span>SEQ Figure \* ARABIC }</span></p>
<p><span>To see field codes you can toggle the view using Opt+F9 or by changing the Preferences.</span></p>
<p><span>Here is the documentation on TOC field switches:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/field-codes-toc-table-of-contents-field-1f538bc4-60e6-4854-9f64-67754d78d05c?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/field-codes-toc-table-of-contents-field-1f538bc4-60e6-4854-9f64-67754d78d05c?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>\c "SEQIdentifier" </p>
<p>Lists figures, tables, charts, or other items that are numbered by a SEQ (Sequence) field. Word uses SEQ fields to number items captioned with the
<strong>Caption</strong> command (<strong>References</strong><strong> &gt; </strong>
<strong>Insert Caption</strong>). <em>SEQIdentifier</em>, which corresponds to the caption label, must match the identifier in the SEQ field. For example,
<strong>{</strong> TOC \c "Figure" <strong>}</strong> lists all numbered figures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The \h means that it acts as a hyperlink in the Table of Figures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The \z hides the tab leader ...... and page number in web view (since pages don't make sense in web view).</p>
<p>
</p><p>----------------------------------<br />
How to include only part of a Caption in the Table of Figures<br />
- Use a Style Separator<br />
&nbsp;To do that:<br />
<br />
1. Insert a paragraph break after the text you want to keep (in the middle of your Caption). Press Enter to do this.<br />
<br />
2. Change the Style of the newly formed paragraph containing the text you do not want in your Table of Figures to something other than the Caption Style. If you want that text to look the same as the Caption text, create a new paragraph Style based on the Caption
 Style and use that.<br />
3. Return to the end of the paragraph containing the text you wart to keep and press Ctrl-Alt-Enter. That will convert the paragraph break after it into a Style Separator, allowing both 'paragraphs' to flow together on the same line and, if you refresh the
 Table of Figures, the text after 'paragraph break after the text you want to keep will disappear from it.<br />
<br />
More on the Style Separator: http://www.addbalance.com/usersguide/styles.htm#Style_Separator<br />
<br />
Mac versions may not yet have the Style Separator. If not, select the paragraph mark at the end of the part of the caption you want to keep and use Font formatting to mark it as hidden. That should give the same effect.</p>

</p><p>I have been trying for some time to download the Afrikaans LIP for Office 2010 but in vain (https://www.microsoft.com/af-za/download/details.aspx?id=6804). I have tried multiple times on various browsers and still no joy. Does anyone perhaps have an alternative
 link?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not able to download the LIP. I click on the download button (Aflaailêer) and then get the pop-up window where I select the package I require. I have tried to select the 32bit and 64bit version. Then it redirects to the page with the message "<span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">If
 your download does not start after 30 seconds,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/af-za/download/confirmation.aspx?id=6804&amp;6B49FDFB-8E5B-4B07-BC31-15695C5A2143=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)"><span>"
 and then nothing happens even after waiting more than 30 seconds. When I click on the "Click here" link it goes back to the pop-up selection menu. The download does not start. I&nbsp;</span>have<span>&nbsp;repeated
 the process several times.</span></span></p>

I guess problem could be with your browser or internet connection.</p>

Try changing the both and see if it makes any difference.</p>

    <title>HPC Workbook Offloading slow performance - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> retep292  say:</h3>
<h2>            HPC Workbook Offloading slow performance</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have been testing HPC Services for Excel as a possible way to speed up some slow-running Excel workbooks. However I have encountered a performance problem: Any cell-manipulating code inside the HPC_Execute method takes an unreasonable amount of time to execute
 when it is being run on a compute node through HPC (0.67 seconds), whereas if I run the workbook on that same node as if it were a regular workstation that time becomes negligible (0.00 seconds). The compute node is an Azure A2 VM running Windows Server 2012
 R2 with Excel 2010 and HPC Pack 2012 R2.<br />
<br />
The workbook will (eventually) calculate the output of the workbook correctly, and the HPC Head Node is having no trouble splitting up the workbook into jobs for the nodes to process. I know that having cell-manipulating code in the HPC_Execute method is a
 bad idea, but removing that code will take too much effort and I can't find any reason as to why it would be running this slowly.<br />
<br />
Are there any known issues that would cause cell-manipulating VBA code to run slower than normal inside an Excel workbook on a HPC cluster?

            <p>It's generally best to leave autonumbers "under the hood", not exposed to user view and not assigned any meaning. They will ALWAYS have gaps - if you start a new record and hit &lt;Esc&gt; after a single keystroke to cancel it, an autonumber value will be "used
 up" and never used again.</p>
<p>If you want a human-meaningful, sequential, numeric or alphanumeric ID, you would do better to use a Number or Text field respectively, and increment it yourself in VBA code. Do a Google or Bing search for "Access Custom Counter", there are scores of examples
 of how this can be done on the web.</p>
