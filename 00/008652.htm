<h2>            Retention Policy recurrence on a custom date</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>We are quite new to Office 365.</p>
<p>I have enabled retention policy on a custom content type to start a workflow(which sends mail to the document owner) when the review date comes.</p>
<p>With created date it is working perfect even on recurrence.</p>
<p><em>[The contents containing private information have been removed by moderator]</em></p>
<p>But when I tried with a provided review date, workflow starts perfect for the first time on that date.&nbsp;But it is not working for the new review date with which I uploaded the updated document.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>[The contents containing private information have been removed by moderator]</em></p>
<p>It seems I need to reset some properties that got set during the first run so that it will again start the workflow for the new review date.</p>
<p>Could you please help? Please let me know if more information is required.</p>
<p>Thanks<br />
Mithu</p>

<p>Hi Mithu,</p>
<p>We would like to run a few tests based on your description to try to first look into situation in our environment.</p>
<p>It may take some time due to the timer-job for updating a new retention policy.</p>
<p>We will share updates or further comfirm the situaiton with you here.</p>
<p>We would appreciate your patience and working with us.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />

<p>hi mithu,</p>
<p>thanks for your waiting patiently.</p>
<p>while we are running the test to confirm the results, we would like to explain the situation for your references.</p>
<p>after we enable retention policy in a library, files we upload into it will be, as you may have noticed, added the properties that are used by the policy.</p>
<p>you can view this in your word app. open the downloaded copy of the file &gt; file &gt; info &gt; at properties section, click on the properties &gt; advanced properties &gt; custom tab.</p>
<p>the properties of itemretentionformula and _dlc_policyid which stored the information of the policy are created.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=02f37258-98ee-4b16-a2c6-046a1afa37ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d02f37258-98ee-4b16-a2c6-046a1afa37ad" /></a></p>
<p>for a policy-executed file, _dlc_itemstageid and _dlc_lastrun will be created to indicate the status of the information management policy run on the file.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=71deab56-02c6-4cf3-bcf3-7fa4b419dc8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d71deab56-02c6-4cf3-bcf3-7fa4b419dc8d" /></a></p>
<p>therefore, when we need to re-upload the file, we need to manually clear these properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=1d46fa2a-cc51-44c3-8527-6521e05b2af4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d1d46fa2a-cc51-44c3-8527-6521e05b2af4" /></a></p>
<p>sharepoint online does not have a programmatic to automatically remove the properties.</p>
<p>for further discussion on how to reset the retention policy on the files, we'd suggest you post the question in our
<a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-us/home?forum=sharepointsearch%2csharepointdevelopment%2csharepointgeneral%2csharepointcustomization%2csharepointadmin%2cappsforsharepoint&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Thank you Rene for the update. </p>
<p>It really helped me to understand where the properties are stored. </p>
<p>I did remove dlc_ItemStageId and ItemRetentionForumla manually for a file and uploaded with a new review date. Hope tomorrow expiration policy job runs at cloud end.</p>
<p>Also I will ask help at Microsoft Developer Network forum &nbsp;for a programmatic approach to remove the properties.</p>

<p>Expiration Policy job has run today and it sent mail to me for the new review date.</p>
<p>Now I need to find a way to do it in a program rather than doing it manually.</p>

<p>Hi Rene,</p>
<p>I found a different way to retention for doing this. </p>
<p>When the document is uploaded with a review date a workflow will start automatically (It needs to start automatically when item changes too). It will pause until the review date and once it reaches sends a mail to owner saying please review your document.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mithu</p>

    <title>Excel files opening as read only and not saving after latest Office - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel files opening as read only and not saving after latest Office for Mac 2016 security update</h2>
                    <p>After updating my MS Excel for Mac 2016 to the latest security update (I think a couple of weeks old), the following has occurred:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;Whenever I open any Excel workbook, it opens as 'read only', with the filename 'A'. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;When I try to save it to any location on my Mac, it says 'you do not have permission to write to this folder'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the info on every file I've tried to open, and confirmed that a) they are not 'read only' (e.g. the box is not ticked), and b) I have read and write permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also checked the permissions on each folder I've tried to save to, and confirmed that I have read and write permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am experiencing the same problem on both of my macs, after updating them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a problem I've ever experienced, and it only happened today after updating both my macs (A MBP and a Mac Mini) to the latest security update. &nbsp;Clearly it is an issue related to the update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone offer advice?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andrew</p>

            What is the OS in use? Also what is the version of office you see. Go to File-&gt;About Excel to find it out. The current version is supposed to be 15.16. I don't see this happening on a number of Mac mini's on my end. Restart the mac systems once since you
 have installed updates. Most of the issues caused after installing updates have been resolved by a simple restart.

            <p>I have had the same problem after updating my mac to Mavericks and then copying my files back from Time Machine. What I found is that Time machine had saved the 'open' environment of all MS files, i.e. saved (and copied back to my upgraded macbook) all the
 files starting with tilde in addition to the original source files. Then these files would only open as 'read only' and wouldn't be saved 'no permission'.
</p>
<p>If you search your HD for all files starting with tilde and remove them you may be able to work normally again. To see these 'tilde' files you need to enable your OS to show all files (these are hidden by default, which is a bad policy BTW, as users we need
 to kn what is going on and nothing shall ever be hidden from us). </p>
<p>You will notice that whenever you opens an MS document, MS creates a temp file starting with tilde with the same attributes. These may be the culprits. Close all MS apps, search all MS document files starting with tilde and delete them.</p>

            Sorry to hear that. Has the problem gone away or are you still stuck? I recently upgraded to capitan (10.11.1) and found no such issues with Excel for Mac 2011.

<h2>            Cannot enter data on Form when bound table is empty</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When the table that's bound to the form is empty, the form does not accept input on any of the fields. I've had to initially create a dummy record to test the form's functionality.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm a MS Access novice so there must be something basically wrong with how I created my form/table that's causing this problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

Is this a table that is directly in the database file you have opened, or is it a linked one?&nbsp; If linked, is it to another Access database or to another data source?

Maybe the index on the table is broken. run the Compact &amp; Repair on the database and try it again with an empty table.

Open the form in design view and go to the DATA tab on the properties.&nbsp; Is the RECORD SOURCE TYPE set to Dynaset?&nbsp; It isn't set to Snapshot is it?

Then I am at a loss.&nbsp; I would suggest emailing a copy to one of us.&nbsp; If you choose to do so, you can send to me at acce|ss|bob| at g|m|a|i|l dot com.&nbsp; (remove the pipe characters and replace the at with the appropriate sign.&nbsp; And, if you do, run compact and
 repair on it and make sure there is no real data in it and then right click on the file and select SEND TO &gt; COMPRESSED FOLDER and include a note telling what is happening, what form to look at, etc.

                    Microsoft Security Essentials is telling me that, somehow, my Real-time protection has been turned off, and that I should turn it back on. (I don't know how this happened!) Anyway, when I press the red "Turn on" button, a window tells me that I can't turn
 it on because the "timeout period has expired." I have no idea what this means or what I should do. Any suggestions? Thanks! -Larry

            <p>Hi Larry,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start with the following compliments of Dr. Strangelove:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you have removed all other real-time antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, McAfee, TM, AVG, OneCare, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).
 Then, use the cleanup tools here: </span></strong><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools</span></b></a>.
 You MUST use the cleanup/removal tools to get rid of these programs properly as the normal uninstall process leaves remnants behind that cause problems with any other AV product you install later including MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: If you have installed Adobe FLASH, and you already had the Google toolbar, you were presented with the option to install “McAfee Security Scanner”, which is selected by default. If you were caught by this, and unknowingly/accidentally
 installed McAfee, uninstall it and use the McAfee cleanup tool in the list above. Other programs "package" deals like this as well with this or other products and if you've recently done a clean install (a restore to factory conditions) you may have also re-installed
 trial software that you long since forgot was there.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that your PC clock is correctly set. If not, correct it. If it is wrong, you may also want to either synchronize with a different internet time server or replace your CMOS battery (which keeps the clock running when you turn off the
 PC and like any battery can eventually run down).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that Windows Defender is uninstalled (if XP), or Disabled (if Vista/W7).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are up-to-date with SERVICE PACKS and updates (including .NET and IE). Yes, it can take some time to do this.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Verify that you are using version 2.0.657.0 or 2.1.1116.0 of MSE.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Then, restart your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try a clean boot (Vista and W7) <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>. If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem. Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it. Once done be sure to
 reset your system back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work. If using XP, see
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a> and
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, uninstall and re-install MSE. To uninstall MSE, proceed as follows:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To re-install, check out this article and follow ALL the procedures: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/check-list-for-installing-microsoft-security/bf757e6a-e320-4a67-92bc-767e6acb26c4">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do or ever did have any other AV program installed on your computer (even if you didn't use it), you need to make sure they are all uninstalled and fully removed before you install. To fully remove them, check out this listing of removal tools<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/msestart/thread/407bf6da-c05d-4546-8788-0aa4c25a1f91</b></a>
 or the listing in that article at the bottom under troubleshooting steps (why this link isn't at the top near things to do first where it discusses removing all the prior and current AV programs is beyond me) or, if not on the lists, go to the website of the
 AV software and get and use the removal tool for that product.<span>&nbsp; </span>You cannot just uninstall these programs – you MUST also use the removal tool – even if the uninstall was years ago but you didn’t use a removal tool at the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install, go to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> and click on languages and locales at the bottom of the Download button and then choose your language and the appropriate version for your operating system. When you download, save it to the
 desktop (rather than running it). When finished, right click on the installation icon and click run as Administrator (even if you’re logged in as an administrator) as I’ve found this sometimes helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you need to configure your settings, set a scheduled scan, enable real-time protection, update MSE, and then run a quick scan (or a full scan if you have time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also recommend the following setup for MSE (though the decision is yours - I've just found this helpful and the most effective and best way to set it up and is how I have mine configured):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure that ALL threat levels are sent to Quarantine where you can then decide whether or not to allow them or leave them there, or remove them. It is the safest solution for having the most options for dealing with the situation. Quarantine is as safe
 as removed, but in some cases you may want to remove them to be more certain - and with this one I would remove it (when the time comes). To do this, open MSE, click on the Settings Tab, and for each of the threat levels, set the action to be Quarantine and
 save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the History tab and click on allowed and unless you specifically placed something in allowed, remove everything else from the allowed category. Only put things there that you ABSOLUTELY know are not problems (are "false positives") and triple-check
 before you do it as doing this could allow a real threat to bypass security and infect you and it won't be detected or rather won't be reported or acted upon by MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Real-time protection and check all the boxes and save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on SpyNet and click on Advanced and save. This is not at all dangerous to you and no information sent will be used by Microsoft to identify you even if some minor identification information is sent in terms of defining the
 infection, but it can sometimes help with new threats by initiating an immediate update to deal with the problem if it is in the SpyNet database (and it helps Microsoft update definitions to provide you and everyone else better protection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Settings Tab and click on Advanced and check the box for save Quarantine items and change it from one month to three months so you have more time to decide if you want to restore something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, then there's a good chance you may be infected by malware. Please proceed as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected or the problem goes away, you
 shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore
 the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</p>

<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If malware was found and removed, then you need to again uninstall and re-install MSE as it will never work properly if installed on an infected system (which we didn’t know at the time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully, one of these solutions (or a step in one of these answers) will resolve the problem. If not, then open a support case describing the problem starting at:<a href="https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/</b></a>.</p>

            Same issue, but I didn't purchase DRM rights.&nbsp; Didn't even know you could do that.&nbsp; In either case, I'm losing approx. 1000 subscribed songs by buying a Lumia 920, not sure I want to go thru the entire list just to download again.&nbsp; Seems like a major oversight

If you have a Zune Pass, its now a Xbox Music Pass....you know this.&nbsp; The rights should transfer over with little or no problem.&nbsp; What you have in Windows 7 Zune, should be avialble in Windows 7 XBOX Music.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have only a Windows Phone 7.5 or below device, you should not use any of the new tools.&nbsp; You should stick with the Zune client, until they make it go away.</p>
<p>If you have Windows 8, the Zune client will load and install, as long as you have a Windows Phone 7.5 or below.</p>
<p>If you have Windows Phone 8, then you must use the new tools.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new tools should be able to see your music list as is, and as such, sync correctly with your Windows Phone 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of this prevents you from using the Zune Client to manage your music on your PC.&nbsp; You can create playlists with your music.&nbsp; Those playlists will be visible on XBOX Music.&nbsp; There are even ways to import your playlist music from Zune so it will be seen
 in XBOX Music....remembering the DRM requirements</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are bound be somethings that don't work.&nbsp;&nbsp; This works between Windows 7, and Windows 8, Between Zune and XBOX Music, and between Windows Phone 7.5.&nbsp; It gets touchy with Windows Phone 8, but it mostly works.</p>

Umm....why not use the new Windows Phone 8 tools then.&nbsp; The zune client will NOT work with WP8. Download the new Windows Phone client...it was released last week.&nbsp;&nbsp; It will work.&nbsp; Its not as graceful as the Zune Client, and there are restrictions, but it works.&nbsp;
 They even did an update to it last night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rules ( as I see them)</p>
<p>Your Zune Pass is now an XBOX Music Pass</p>
<p>Your XBOX Music Pass works with Zune client.&nbsp; No change on your part.</p>
<p>The Zune client will continue to work on any platform PC.</p>
<p>The Zune Client will continue to work and is required on all Windows Phone below 8.</p>
<p>The Zune client will work in Windows 8</p>
<p>The Zune Client in Windows 8 will not intermingle with XBOX Music app, though the access is the same</p>
<p>When you purchase a Windows Phone 8, you can only sync using the new Windows Phone tools.</p>
<p>Even though you have Windows Phone 8, you can still use the Zune client for music. on your PC. It just wont sync with Windows Phone 8</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gotta keep the logic flow separate.</p>

<p><br />
I read on another forum, if you take all your Zune DRM's music and put it into a single playlist, in the Zune client, then Import the play list into the Xbox Music app, the music will transfer to Xbox Music and be available.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried it, but I didn't pay
 too much attention to the zune subscription stuff, sorry.</p>

            The issue is using windows 7 PC with the new windows phone software (zune wont recognize wp8 devices) and trying to sync my old zune pass downloaded songs with my new lumia 920.&nbsp;

<div>What I have concluded:
<div>Windows 7 will not sync DRM protected music (not purchased, only download) using the new windows phone software to a windows phone 8 product.</div>

<h2>            Changing the order of comments in the comment pane--PowerPoint 2016</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to find a way to reorder two comments appearing in the comments pane for a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">specific</span> slide using PowerPoint 2016. I inserted a comment several lines down on a slide, and after creating several more slides, realized I needed to return to the slide already containing a comment and insert
 a second comment. The issue is that the second comment pertains to information presented
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">on the first line of the slide</span>, but in the comments pane the comment appears
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">AFTER</span> the comment I already inserted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I send the presentation to the person I'm creating it for, she will see the first comment bubble on the slide, but the actual comment will not appear as the first comment in the comment pane. This can be confusing for the recipient. Surely there is
 a way to reorder the two comments without having to delete and redo one of the comments in order to reverse the order????</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've googled the web for answers, but have not found any solutions. Any suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Office 365 Pro Plus and it is the Enterprise version provided by my employer.

<p>PPT sure seems to go out of its way to make this difficult, doesn't it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the slide where you need to swap comments and run this bit of VBA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't actually swap comment order; instead it adds a new (third) comment with the same characteristics as the first, then deletes the first, so the second comment is now the first and the newly added third comment is now number two.</p>

    <title>Punch List Item for Word 2016 Backward Compatibility - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimg_890  say:</h3>
<h2>            Punch List Item for Word 2016 Backward Compatibility</h2>
                    <p>I am finding that doc files created in previous versions of Word are not compatible with Word 2016 if the doc files contain tables. I can open the same doc files containing tables in Word 2010 with no problem.&nbsp;Also, doc files not containing tables open just
 fine in Word 2016. Word 2016 cannot repair the doc files containing tables when opening. It can open the file, but it looks like gibberish. The pop-up error window is as follows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"This error message may be the result of a corrupt table in the current document.<br />
You can recover the contents of the document and the table by closing the document, and then reopening it by using the Open and Repair command in the Open dialog box. To find the Open and Repair command, click the File tab, click Open, click the down arrow
 next to the Open button, and then click Open and Repair. After the file is repaired, the corruption or incorrect formatting of all tables in the document should be corrected.<br />
If the document still has errors in a table after a repair, you may want to examine each table to see if any text is too long for any given cell or row, or if an incomplete table was created or imported into the document."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file is not corrupted because it opens just fine in Word 2010. The file uses Office 97-2000 formatting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't expect a solution here, I but hope the Microsoft programmers add this item to their to-do list to make&nbsp;Office 2016 a&nbsp;fine product like Office 2010 (my all-time favorite).</p>

            <p>Have you tried to save the DOC file as a DOCX in 2010, then open it in 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using docx will also have the benefit of slightly reducing the file size of most of these documents (unless they are very small).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option to try to correct the issue is open the DOCX version of these files in OfficeLibre.&nbsp; It is "more tolerant" of XML issues and can often open AND repair slight XML corruption issues that Word carps out on.&nbsp; Just open the file, and resave it
 as DOCX should be enough to fix SOME XML issues. </p>

            <p>Rohn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply and suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened the doc-file on a different pc that has Word 2010 (Office 2010) and saved it as a docx-file. I then opened the docx-file on my new pc that has Word 2016 (Office 2016). The docx-file opened perfectly in Word 2016, but not the doc-file. Great short-term
 fix suggestion!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening RTF-files of similar genre in Word 2016 is not clean either, but I do not want to go there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea of moving documents back and forth between two pc's as the final solution is not appealing even though it works (good short-term fix though). I am trying to migrate all of my work to one pc, my new&nbsp;Windows 10 pc, and away from two other pc's;&nbsp;Windows
 XP (my current primary workstation) and Windows 7 (spouse's primary workstation).&nbsp;I would like to do all of my work on one pc and not be spread around. Otherwise, what good was it for me to upgrade everything to Windows 10 and Office 2016? One of my key genealogy

            <p>Since apparently these are files being generated by a 3rd party program, you should contact them with this issue. It appears that some part of the format they are generating is not fully compliant with 2016 needs/standards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How did you buy you copy of 2010?&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have the boxed CD, then that is most likely a retail license that allows you to install on 2 machines (otherwise it is most likely a one machine license).&nbsp; So as a work around, you could try to install 2010 on your
 new machine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also take a look at this tool, the File Format Validator:</p>

</p><p>The validator is written for 2010, so it may or may not catch the issue causing the problem in 2016. I have not been able to find a later version of it beyond 1.0.&nbsp; But if it does identify issues, you can provide them to the 3rd party programmers as a specific
 guide to the problem</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you again. To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) the 3rd party software company went out of business recently, so not an option there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) I have a 3-pc box with CD-ROM and product key of Home &amp; Student&nbsp;Office 2010. I have used all three. I could not successfully move one of these copies to my new pc without a telephone conversation with&nbsp;Microsoft support and a new product key from them.
 There is apparently no automatic way of&nbsp;moving Office 2010 license from one pc to another. Microsoft also recommends against trying to install Office 2010 and 2016 on the same pc as is raises a lot of issues beyond the scope of this current subject.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will check out the file validator as you suggest.</p>

</p><p>Jim:</p>
<p>The person you talked to at MS was not very knowledgeable (it was hard to come up with a polite synonym for what I really wanted to call them &lt;grin&gt;) .&nbsp; Your Office 2010 Home and Student "Retail" (the boxed cd) license allows you to install on up to 3 machines
 at the same time. It also allows you to "transfer" those installations to new computers as required, WITHOUT getting a new key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To transfer Office you have to make it unusable on a current machine. That means either uninstall it from a working machine or that it was on a machine that "died" or has been returned to the maker (they either trash the machine, really!, or wipe the drive
 and re-install windows fresh). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> the uninstall process does NOT contact the activation system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you have freed up an installation count, you can install on the new machine. Try internet activation first. Sometimes it will go through.&nbsp; If it does not go through, then activate again and this time select the Phone activation option. When you phone
 in,, don't reply to the initial prompts. Wait, a long time, until the system gives you the option of talking to a live "service" rep.&nbsp; Explain that you are transferring an installation and how you freed up the "activation count" (uninstall or dead machine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes MS certainly does, and ALWAYS HAS, 'recommended against' installing more than one version of Office on the same computer. The idea is to "<em>encourage</em>" people to upgrade and forget about the older version.&nbsp; But the reality is that it can be done.
 I have had <strong>2003/2007/2010 AND 2013</strong> all installed on the same machine. Just today another MVP said he had
<strong>those 4 PLUS 2016</strong>.&nbsp; I don't know how he managed that. All of the reports I've seen say that 2016 FORCES you to uninstall all older versions before it will install.&nbsp; I suspect he will say that he installed 2016 then all of the others. That goes
 against normal "best procedure", which is to install oldest first up to newest last.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a couple of additional tweaks you have to do to make multiple versions work together, but it is relatively easy.

            <p>Rohn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your advice regarding multiple versions on Office on the same pc. Astounding, 4 versions, maybe 5!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the file format validator tool, but have not done anything with it yet. I am being super cautious and making a backup&nbsp;image of the&nbsp;hard drive on the pc to be used before I install the tool. So it may take me a bit. I have uploaded an offending
 file to OneDrive if you want to try it yourself. Here is the link:</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I said&nbsp;previously misled you and I apologize. I did not telephone Microsoft support yet about moving Office 2010 from one pc to another because&nbsp;I had read what was required on several forums and decided I did not want to put myself through the trouble.
 My comments were based on the experience of others. I gave up on&nbsp;moving Office 2010&nbsp;to my new pc, but perhaps I should revisit that approach after your comments.</p>

            <p>Thanks for putting the file on onedrive.&nbsp; Unfortunately it won't help as I don't have 2016 yet. I don't have room on my old machine (new one on order, yippie!&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4522bb56-db7d-4560-9f3a-771c0a278482" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4522bb56-db7d-4560-9f3a-771c0a278482" /></a>
 ) for it, and frankly I didn't want to deal with fighting to install it with older versions ... &lt;grin&gt;.<br />
</p>
<p>You may want to wait until I clarify the multi version situation with the other guy who has made it work.

<h2>            Solver no longer provides integer solutions&#63;</h2>
                    I believe there is an error in the new version of Solver accompanying Excel 2010.&nbsp; In a textbook exercise on the use of Solver, all changing cells were constrained to be equal to integers.&nbsp; In XL2007, integer solutions are found.&nbsp; In XL2007, with the identical
 workbook, integer solutions are not found.&nbsp; An example workbook is available on request.&nbsp; There is no means to attach it here.<br />
<br />
This error should be addressed by the Excel team.<br />

            In an e-mail exchange with the folks at Solver I learned that the behavior is expected.&nbsp; What I'd missed (just following textbook directions!) was that I needed to uncheck the box for Ignore Integer constraints in Solver Parameter, Options.<br />
<br />
I have since e-mailed my colleagues who also teach this course and the publisher's representative.<br />
<br />
The issue is now settled to my satisfaction.<br />

                    <p>My calendar is hosted on Outlook.com.</p>
<p>I just got a new Sony phone with Android 9. I use the Android Outlook app, but that app leaves syncing to Googles calendar app.
</p>
<p>The Google calendar app does not sync old events. Nothing older than 2 weeks month is shown. Except ongoing events reaching into the present.<br />
My Android 8 tablet syncronises old events, as did my old phone.<br />
On my new phone there is no settings for calendar syncronization period. On Android 8 I could change the settings to “all”.</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac 2016 - Endless Login Loop</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since updating to macOS Sierra yesterday, I am unable to use Outlook for Mac 2016 with my Office 365 work account. The sign in web view window appears when I open Outlook, and I am able to enter my password with no issue. However, the sign in window will
 quickly re-open. This happens over and over again, leaving me unable to access e-mail via the Outlook for Mac application. However, my username and password works just fine on outlook.com and on all other Office services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Completely uninstalling and re-installing Office (I deleted everything office-related off of my mac, including the library folders).</p>
<p>2) Removing and re-adding my exchange account to Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time and any help you can offer!</p>

<p>
</p><p>To address your concern with regards to Outlook 2016 for Mac, we suggest that you try removing the following from the user folder:</p>

</p><ul>
<li>/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.Outlook.plist</li><li>/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.Office365ServiceV2.plist</li><li>~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.Outlook.LSSharedFileList.plist</li><li>~/Library/Autosave Information/com.microsoft.Outlook.plist</li><li>~/Library/Autosave Information/com.microsoft.Office365ServiceV2.plist</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Backup your files before removing them.</p>

<p>Yes, the keychain deletions work, but it's not a permanent fix. Come on, Microsoft! My old Entourage 2004 was far more functional without any of these login hassles. Why did I pay for a 365 subscription to be treated like a second-class user?</p>

    <title>Redownload OEM Office W&#47;O Product Key - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Redownload OEM Office W&#47;O Product Key</h2>
                    <p>Hello all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased and ASUS computer in April 2014 &nbsp;that came preloaded with Office Home and Student 2013. I've had the computer for nearly 2 years and I'm itching to do a fresh install of windows and wipe the slate clean. However, I want to be able to redownloaded
 the Office that came included (that I paid for in the price of the computer). When I go to the page to redownload Office, I find that there are apparently no copies of Office associated with my account even though I can see the account with the activated office
 by going to the account system in word, powerpoint, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I've found by talking to (nearly useless) support:</p>
<p>- It's not coming up because it's a manufacturer's license - talk to Asus Microsoft does not have the product key</p>
<p>- Asus says "there is no way to retrieve product key" and also some jumble about how it only included a year's subscription even though this only appears to apply to some models (my friend has one of these) - I have no notice of an expired subscription associated
 with my account AT ALL and my Office is still activated and updates regularly.</p>
<p>- Called Microsoft again and was told that the only option was to buy new office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't be the ONLY person to have this issue - and it doesn't seem that Asus cannot retrieve the product key and neither can Microsoft? This seems to basically be saying unless you keep track of a tiny card there's no way to redownload which from what I
 read, Dell had to change about their OEM Office offerings years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am contemplating going to a Microsoft store but I was wondering if I had any other options to try to be able to redownload this software.</p>

            It appears from what you have said that your Office 2013 came bundled along with other bundled programs and application. You say that "I paid for in the price of the computer". Yes, I suppose you did along with the other bundled programs and apps. These
 programs and applications are OEM provided at a discount rate to the manufacturer.&nbsp; If your computer manufacturer provided you with a years subscription and your office is still working thank your lucky stars. Microsoft will catch up with you eventually. If
 on the other hand your computer manufacturer provided you with a OEM version of&nbsp;Office 2013 then&nbsp;you should be able to restore your computer using factory settings feature.&nbsp; I do not know what modal you have but this should give you some idea of what it entails:
<a href="http://www.asus.com/uk/support/FAQ/1006133/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 8 - How to restore the system to factory default settings?</a>&nbsp; PLEASE check on the&nbsp;ASUS website/forum before restoring to factory settings to find out exactly what the implications are. I have an HP laptop and would have no problem recovering my system
 to factory settings that is restoring my computer to the same state it was in when I purchased it.

                    <p>I just received my first spam call in over 2 years. I thought I could add the number to my contact list and then block the caller. Thereby eliminating this spammer. I seem to recall that I used to be able to do this on a previous version of Skype. But I
 can't figure out how to do it (block caller) now. </p>

            <p>Hi Raylene,</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Office and thanks for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description provided you want to use Outlook 2003 along with Office Home and Student 2013 on Windows 8 Machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8 supports Office 2007 and later versions. Older versions like Office 2003 and earlier will have compatibility issues and functionality issues. Refer to the following link which talks about
 if Outlook 2003 is compatible with Windows 8 or not:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Microsoft%20Office%20Outlook%202003&amp;vendor=Microsoft&amp;Locale=1033&amp;ModelOrVersion=11&amp;BreadCrumbPath=outlook%202003&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=win8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Microsoft%20Office%20Outlook%202003&amp;vendor=Microsoft&amp;Locale=1033&amp;ModelOrVersion=11&amp;BreadCrumbPath=outlook%202003&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=win8</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, you may install individual (Outlook) program and follow the steps mentioned in the following link to run it on Windows 8:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-PH/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-PH/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install individual Office 2003 application, follow the steps from this link:</p>
<p><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/install-or-remove-individual-components-in-office-HP005274169.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/install-or-remove-individual-components-in-office-HP005274169.aspx</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the suggestion is helpful. If you need further assistance, reply so we can assist you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I tried to connect to an ad hoc network from my windows 7 laptop. I have an ipod and it perfectly finds and connects to this network (with WEP encryption). However, my lumia 610 does not even see this network. I tried different also WPA2-personal or even

            I see… This is quite different indeed (MacOS X has Autocomplete capabilities: you can complete words while typing).
<div>I am unfortunately not aware of any way to either edit the autocomplete list or import anything into it.</div>
<div>I don't see any option beside adding to the address book :-\</div>
<div><br />
<div>As for importing contacts, I've had no problem with a CSV file, but the easiest option is to import from vcf files. You simply need to drag and drop them in the address book and that's it.</div>

<h3> torotoro23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pivot TABLE  I need to convert values in table to a percent of total.  </h2>
                    
<p>I created a pivot table&nbsp;from&nbsp;two columns of data, Let me explain:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first column, column B in the excel sheet, has the&nbsp;heading"visits to the gym per week" and includes numbers from 1-10.&nbsp; There are 1214 numbers in the column, so the number&nbsp;data is taking up 1214 cells in column B.&nbsp; The second column (C in excel spreadsheet)&nbsp;has
 the&nbsp;heading "satisfaction with gym" and also includes numbers from 1-5.&nbsp; There are also&nbsp;1214 numbers in the column.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I created a pivot table with the&nbsp;number data that just mentioned that&nbsp;compares the two variables "satisfaction with gym" and "visits to gym per week". basically it &nbsp;tells you how satisfaction with gym and the number of days someone visits per week relate.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I created the pivot table with visits to gym per week on the "row" side and "satisfaction with gym" on the column side.&nbsp; So there are 5 columns and 10 rows in the pivot table, which represent the&nbsp;1-5 level of satisfaction (columns)&nbsp;and 1-10 (rows)&nbsp;visits per
 week.&nbsp; I selected the&nbsp;count option,&nbsp;NOT the sum data option, so that each&nbsp;ocurrence and combination of 1-10&nbsp;data&nbsp;and 1-5 data&nbsp;would be counted; this way&nbsp;you could figure out how many people that went 10 times per week selected 1,2 or 3 level of satisfaction.&nbsp;
 The table makes sense now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MY problem is that I can't convert the Pivot table to "percent of total" or what percent of 1214&nbsp; each combination of (visits per week and satisfaction level)&nbsp;represents.&nbsp; I right click and select"value field settings", select "show value as" and the option
 I get is "Percent of" the 1-10&nbsp;rows I created or 1-5 columns I created, but there is no "percent of" TOTAL option or a way to put in the total I want (1214), so that each combination of variables&nbsp;is shown as a percent of the total number of combinations or
 1214.&nbsp; PLEASE HELP and let me know how to convert the table to PERCENTS!!</p>

            In the Show Values As tab of the Value Field Settings dialog, you have to scroll down the "Show Values As" dropdown list in order to see the "% of total" option. You don't see that option when you first click the dropdown arrow, but it is present!

<h2>            Junk Email Reporting Add-in for Outlook is not working -- Microsoft email address is bouncing.</h2>
                    <p>For the past week, any email report that the Junk Email Reporting Add-in (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=18275) attempts to submit bounces from Microsoft with a retry timeout exceeded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the address that the reporting tool uses:</p>
<p>
</p><p>abuse &lt;at&gt; messaging.microsoft.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the tool set to do a BCC to SpamCop and those still work but I'm wondering if Microsoft has discontinued this address or updated it but not realized it's burned into the reporting tool?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? Anyone else seeing this?</p>

            Hi RealSkier,
<br />The COM addin is deprecated and parts of it may not work.  If the address is bouncing, its no longer a valid address - because its deprecated, it won't be fixed.  (It also doesn't play well with Outlook's ribbons.)
        </p>

            That's too bad. It's been working fine up until recently. Never seen a problem with the ribbons in 2019.

            I had two Delete and Archive buttons when it was installed (with an Exchange mailbox) - i was testing a complaint from another user. 
<br />
<br />I use the Office addin version for Office 365 mailboxes - it sends the messages to junk at office365.microsoft.com  - i resent one of the messages to the address you used  and it did not bounce (I'm using an office 365 mailbox though.)
