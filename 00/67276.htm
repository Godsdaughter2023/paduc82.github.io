Hi All,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I've recently started experiencing choppiness when playing Apex Legends on my original Xbox One that I've owned for just 2.5 years. I'm not sure if it's a frame rate issue necessarily, or what it is, but it's as if my screen skips for just a tenth of a second,
 and this happens every few seconds or so. It's not one of those lags/FPS drops that makes it unplayable, but it certainly puts me at a disadvantage. BUT, what IS unplayable, is that at some point in almost every game the game crashes due to an "out of sync
 with server" issue. Very very frustrating!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
And it's not just an issue with Apex Legends, I went over to PUBG and the game play was choppy as well. I've been playing Apex since it came out a few weeks ago and this issue hadn't been an issue for the first few days that I played, but has been an issue
 for probably a a week and a half now. I'm worried that something is wrong with my xbox itself, and I'm hoping there's a solution out there that can help, rather than going out and buying a new console entirely.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I've done some googling and tried a bevy of things, all to no avail:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Performed a power cycle, aka a Hard Reset</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Turned off the xbox broadcast/record-that setting.</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Cleared the MAC address</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Uninstalled Apex and reinstalled</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Turned xbox onto "Power Saver" setting</p>
</li><li>
<p>
calibrated video settings to my TV</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Uninstalled all games/apps that I no longer have any intention of playing in an attempt to free up space. I now am only taking up 7% of my available storage.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I don't believe that it's an issue with my internet, my speed is consistently around 60 mbps, which I know, certainly isn't the best internet in the world, but at my old place I had internet that was only 20 mbps and I was able to play games like PUBG just
 fine. Additionally, I run apps such as Netflix, Youtube, and Prime Video on my smart TV (not through the xbox) and I experience no such issues.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Has anyone else ever experienced issues like this with their xbox? Is there some more troubleshooting I can do? Is it common for these consoles to poop out like this?</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
tl;dr Experiencing choppy video when playing games on OG Xbox One, don't think it's necessarily an issue with the individual games but rather my xbox itself. Tried plenty of trouble shooting tactics with no resolution yet.</p>

<p>Hello Frosty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with the choppy framerates. Also for letting us know what troubleshooting you have done. You could try a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
soft factory reset</a> and see if that helps.</p>
<p>

<p>There was a brief outage of some of the party services. &nbsp;If you are still experiencing a problem go ahead and do a hard reset on your console. &nbsp;Hold the power button on the console for 10 seconds or until the power shuts down completely. &nbsp;Unplug the power
 cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes. &nbsp;Plug the power cord back in and restart the console. &nbsp; Once it is back up and operational test for results. &nbsp;Let us know. &nbsp;Good Luck!</p>

            Hi Marty, I was speaking about Windows SR AND only because I have had to use it again because my Dragon NS 11.5 has ceased working!!<br />
<br />
In truth I have been experiencing a catalogue of disasters as regards my computer and Dragon, this after I ran a program called "Reimage" which seems to have wiped out a few things on the computer pertaining to Dragon working well.
<br />
<br />
When I tried to reinstall Dragon from my disk it would not let me because of a " Visual C++9 Runtime" error.&nbsp; Dragon told me it needed that to be installed and to install it from the disk, which I did, only the same message keeps reoccurring and nothing I do
 can fix it. <br />
<br />
I've tried everything from running the computer in safe mode, creating a new user and password, using the "msconfig" feature to disable programs, deactivating antivirus and firewall and so on, all to no avail.&nbsp; In fact the sad part about it is that I tried
 to use system restore and that failed because of an error.&nbsp; It seems that the Reimage program has disrupted quite a few things and left me with no avenue to be able to fix things.
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions would be appreciated now that we have got onto the real subject.&nbsp; Kind regards, Cyril
<br />
<br />
<br />

            Thank you for your input, much appreciated.<br />
<br />
I did eventually manage to solve the problem I had with Dragon because I could not reinstall it once I had uninstalled it because of a "Visual C++9 Runtime" error. Whenever I tried to load it again, the error message came up and recommended I tried to install
 it from the disk, which I did. However when trying to reinstall again the same error message came up and so on, and so I was going round in circles.
<p>So here is something that worked for me………… I used the Microsoft Fixit tool and managed to find the "Visual C++9 Runtime" programme on the list of programmes installed, yet here was Windows telling me that it wasn't so I took a guess
 that it was possibly corrupted and I removed it using this tool. I then reinstalled Dragon from the disk and!!!!!!!! yes it reinstalled correctly and started working again and much to my delight the paragraph problem also disappeared!!</p>
<p>So I am very happy with things at the moment although they are not perfect because I cannot seem to run Dragon in all other applications (such as the one I am replying to you in) because I get the "HOOKER_non notify window" error message
 coming up, however I can live with this for the moment.</p>
<p>So thanks again for your help although not directly attributable to the fix, it certainly fired a few neurons to help me look for it. Kind regards, Cyril</p>

<h2>            Status -  available vs inactive mobile</h2>
                    I have my Skype for Business&nbsp;set for 360 minutes to show me available, but when my computer is shut or offline it shows me inactive mobile. How can I make it show me as available instead?

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior indicates that&nbsp;you probably have signed into a mobile client somewhere and not logged out of it. By default the mobile app will not sign you out when the app is minimized or closed and therefore Lync presence is stating that you are inactive
 on that device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix it, you may need to check if you've used your credential to log with another client, (mobile phone). If so, please log out them and test again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, please make sure that the version is up to date. You can check it through any other Office 2016 apps, like Outlook, and navigate to&nbsp;<strong>FILE &gt; Office Account &gt; Update Options &gt; Update now</strong> to verify the version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, please share the following with us:</p>
<p>1. The current version of Skype for Business.</p>
<p>2. The screen shot of inactive mobile.</p>
<p>3. Let the admin of your organization remove the Skype for Business license temporarily and then re-add it to you, check if there is any improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Lance</p>
        </p>

<p><span>Hi Maxwell Goode,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Is
 Windows activated but still says not genuine?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you make any hardware or a software change on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Check to see if Windows is activated. If not
 enter the product key and activate online to check for the exact error. To do so, follow these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 Windows Activation by clicking the Start button, right-clicking Computer and then clicking Properties.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>See
 if it says “Windows is Activated”. If not, click Change Product Key and enter the product key. Click Next and wait for the process to complete.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, visit:&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/activate-windows-7-on-this-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Activate
 Windows 7 on this computer</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>If this does not help then check to see if this
 article helps.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Windows-7-activation-error-invalid-product-key" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Windows 7 activation
 error: invalid product key</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>If the copy of Windows is already activated and
 you still receive the message that Windows is not genuine, then please visit the following website and click “Validate Windows.”</span></p>

 enable me to do this?&nbsp;Thank you.

            <p>Hi Dean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can understand that the update for Windows 10 fails with error message:
</span><strong>C1900101-20004</strong>. <span>In this case, you can upgrade your current PC to Windows 10 by going to the Windows 10 Software Download page to download the Media Creation Tool. The Media Creation Tool can be used to create a USB or DVD media
 to upgrade your current PC to Windows 10 or install Windows 10 on a different PC</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the instructions on Windows 10 Software Download page: </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10</span></span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>When upgrading to Windows 10 using media, you must run setup.exe from within your Genuine and Qualified version of Windows 7 or Windows 8. If you want to boot from media, you must have upgraded to Windows 10 previously. Boot from Windows 10 media directly
 without upgrading to Windows 10 previously is not supported and will have activation issues.</span></p>

<p>Me too!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried twice to install through Windows Update- and then again, to install with a downloaded copy and the media creation tool.&nbsp; It still gave me this error message- after it gets&nbsp; partway done, my computer shuts completely off, and doesn't restart itself.
 Then when I restart it, it reverts to Windows 7, and gives me error messages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Google for the software to do this as I can't remember off hand what I used.</p>

<h2>            HP Slim Desktop 260-P026, suddenly my wired keyboard, wired mouse, and all usb ports stopped working all at the same time.</h2>
                    HP Slim Desktop 260-P026, suddenly my wired keyboard, wired mouse, and all usb ports stopped working all at the same time. I have turned off power, unplugged, rebooted, and the Microsoft sign in screen displaying the correct time and date always comes
 up. I can't sign in because the wired keyboard, wired mouse and usb ports are not responding at all. I've tried another wired keyboard and wired mouse in all the usb ports with no success. I can't turn the PC off unless I unplug it. When I plug it back in
 I don't get a screen telling me Windows shut down improperly, instead it goes straight to the Microsoft sign in screen, but I can't use anything to sign in. Telepathy has also failed.

<p>This seems to be a huge problem with the new update. I am also looking for a way to get into my computer. Keep looking around and I have a feeling more and more people will be posting this problem. Mine updated last night and I've seen quite a few on here
 that are just discovering the problem.</p>

            Thank you for your reply. I have tried to login with a different account. However, the problem is still there. I have look for a possible fix on the internet. I have tried different method. (for example, sf /scannow, powershell, dsim ....) But the problem
 still not go away. For now, if I click on start button, It don't have any respond.(No Critical error dialog box). The windows store icon is missing, The edge Button is missing, If I click on search button, nothing happens. If I unplug a USB thumb stick, It
 won't show any notification. The start button did function sometime (The tiles is blank with some 'internet address like' word). If I restart the computer, the start button is not function again. I am thinking to reinstall the windows 10 , but I afraid I will
 lost all my photos and phones backup. Is there any fix from microsoft on the way? My machine is a bit old. It is a lenovo Edge91(model no: 1895F2B). Any Suggestion? Please help!

None of the app windows come up, store does not work, and account management in control panel will not create additional users.

<h2>            Windows XP Print spooler very slow to remove printed jobs.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have printer connected throug a usb port, on windows xp sp3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The printer prints normally, but after it prints the document, it takes a long time to remove the printed job from the queue.</p>
<p>So the next job have to wait this process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a registry entry, or fix, to decrease this waiting time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>best regards.</p>

    <title>Lost pen and touch input on my windows 8.1 laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lewismilrod  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost pen and touch input on my windows 8.1 laptop</h2>
                    <p>After&nbsp; a Windows update at the end of October, my touch screen on the Toshiba Satellite S75t-A7217 no longer worked. Under System, it says that no pen or touch input is available for this display.&nbsp; I followed the instructions on the Toshiba virtual help
 desk website. It said to go to device manager and uninstall the drivers for the touch screen. I did so&nbsp; but when I rebooted the drivers did not automatically install as they were supposed to.&nbsp; Initially, before uninstalling,&nbsp;the Human Interface Touch screen
 listing in device manager was only available under Hidden devices; it is no longer there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded display drivers from the Toshiba site but I wonder if I am missing Microsoft Windows 8.1 touch screen drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help and/or ideas would be appreciated. Costco Concierge services said that I can send in the laptop but I cannot afford to be without it and have been using it without the touch screen.
</p>

            I am having trouble identifying the exact update but I believe the date was 10-27-15. The other suggestions don't apply because the laptop now thinks it does not have touch and pen input because the drivers (I think) are missing.

    <title>Stuck on BIOS after Windows 10 clean install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> f&#225;bio daniel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stuck on BIOS after Windows 10 clean install</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>I have a problem on my quite old desktop computer. I was performing a clean install of Windows 10 Redstone 1 (or anniversary update if you want). I did a custom install, allowing me to delete all partitions I had (had several partitions with different OS,
 all Windows). I got un-allocated space, corresponding with the total memory size of my HDD. I created a partition with a certain size. Windows created the system partition to. I moved on with the installation. Setup moved files, installed features, updates
 and then came the first restart, as typical on Windows installations. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.digitalcitizen.life/sites/default/files/img/inst_win10_clean/windows10_install7.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>(just an image to represent the step I described above)</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For my big surprise, I got stuck on POST screen after the restart. More precisely, it checks the GPU first of all, then it comes POST screen where my CPU is listed, also the correct RAM size, and it keeps listing peripherals. When it's time to test the HDD,
 it get's stuck. Due to this, I can't get on BIOS or boot from other devices (like USB), because that's only possible after POST.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this image, which is quite similar to mine POST screen. Also, pressing keys to enter BIOS menu or show boot menu, are responsive. So, it's not like the POST freezes or something, but something with the disk that POST doesn't like, at all... Everything
 I described above, matches this picture. POST stops when reaches the SATAII line. But also shows the disk name, and also the features enabled. Just doesn't move on.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/80de5680-094e-475a-8b28-d0d659380406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/80de5680-094e-475a-8b28-d0d659380406" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Things I have tested:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The HDD lights on</strong> when I power on the PC. It also detects the HDD on the BIOS/POST screen. It's shown there correctly.</li><li><strong>I unplugged the HDD, powered the PC, and POST moved on</strong>. As I don't have any other HDD plugged in, or USB devices, It reached the screen asking to insert some device to boot.
</li><li>It's <strong>not a problem with ATA cable or motherboard</strong> (tested the two SATA ports that my motherboard has, it could be damaged, but its not). I
<strong>tested</strong> with the <strong>older HDD</strong> that came with the PC (that has some problem, not sure what, but I can't install windows on it, boot will fail after installing, maybe some sector damaged, likely the boot sector.. it's 10 years old,
 I think it's normal with that age), <strong>and the POST went fine</strong>. It tried to boot the HDD that's empty. So, the problem is actually related with my current HDD.</li><li><strong>Restored default BIOS setting</strong> by removing the CMOS battery for 5 minutes.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>It all seems to indicate that Windows, somehow, corrupted boot sectors of my HDD, or something like that. I really hope it didn't damage the HDD, and that formatting it will solve the problem. If it matters, I used the media creation tool, which deployed
 the files to USB pendrive. I also had the Aniversary Update some time installed, as I am part of Windows Insider program. Although, that installation was via Windows Update. I feel like if I hadn't format all partitions I wouldn't have this problem..</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My question is: how will I format the HDD if I can't boot from other devices, like USB or DVD, as POST doesn't&nbsp;</strong><strong>finish?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The HDD is very recent, like 1 year old. I did clean installs before, never had problem.</p>
<p><strong>Additionally:</strong> No, I don't have another PC to plug my HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, a friend of mine had the EXACT same problem, although with SSD disk. He his also stuck on BIOS, since he attempted a clean install with Anniversary update.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.tenforums.com/installation-setup/59322-windows-10-stuck-bios-screen-during-clean-install.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Found another thread on the web from this month, reporting the same issue.</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Any recommendations?</strong></p>

            You seem to have covered everything I would have done to try to narrow down what is happening. The only thing different I would have done, during the custom install delete all partitions and then select Next. Do not create any partitions yourself. Did
 you do that for a reason, are you intending to install other operating systems on the remaining free space.?

            <p>Thanks for the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The computer it's old. My parents bought it in 2006. It's Tsunami brand... can't check the exact model right now, but I have some hardware specifications in my memory (although, don't think this will help)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel® Core™2 Duo Processor E6400</li><li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> ASRock ConRoe 945G-DVI</li><li><strong>GPU:</strong> GeForce 210</li><li><strong>HDD:</strong> It's a toshiba brand SATA II disk with 2TB of memory and 5400 rpm speed. Don't know the model.</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong> 4GB installed, however I can only use 3.2GB due to Intel chipset limitation.</li></ul>
<p>2./3. The system came with Windows Vista. Since then, I upgraded to Windows 7. When Windows 10 was released I upgraded it using academic licenses. Since then, I am using Windows 10 on this PC. It's about two years, because since early joined the Insider
 Program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I don't understand this question that well... I have Windows 10 ISO on my USB pendrive which I used to install Windows 10 (or tried...). Right now, with every peripheral connected (including the hard disk), I am stuck on POST screen. Like the image above.
 I can't either Boot Windows or access BIOS. I can access BIOS and boot other devices if I unplug the hard disk, but this is already described above. I would like to run the check disk tool that Windows setup files include, however... I can't boot the USB and
 at the same time have the HDD plugged in, which is my big problem.</p>

            <p>Hello <strong>neilpzz</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, I had several partitions with different Windows installed. I formatted and deleted them during Windows setup.
<strong>No partition, can't install Windows</strong>. Right? Correct me if I am wrong, but the list of disks was only showing unlocatted size. Windows it self won't create the partition. As I am doing a custom install, I am the one who tells Windows to create
 how many partitions I want, and where to install Windows. I am also quite sure the Next button was disable, which makes sense.</p>
<p>With the un-allocated space, I created a partition with 400GB or so. Windows setup created it, and additionally a system partition. From the many times I did this procedure, everything was going as supposed. After creating my 400GB partition, then I was
 able to move on with install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes, I was planning to have another partition where I would install Insider builds. It's good for me to stay tuned to latest improvements related with development technologies, such .Net platform and so on, but also I like to help providing feedback
 and have a taste of new features :)</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Well, keep in mind that the HDD was working very well and running Windows 10. Let me tell you, that I had a partition with Windows 7, another with Windows 10 Threshold 2, and another with Windows 10 Redstone (14393). I haven't changed BIOS settings lately.
 Everything was working. Then format HDD using Windows setup, and ran into the problem.
</p>
<p>I thought that Windows could change something on my BIOS settings, and as I described, I reset BIOS by removing the CMOS battery. Waited a little, and after power on, the system date was back to 2010 (date of latest BIOS version) as also I could check that
 some settings that I changed many time ago were on default again. This also didn't solve the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Anyway, that settings should I look at, in your opinion? &nbsp;</strong></p>

            <p>Windows cant change anything in the BIOS. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And since you reset the BIOS settings,&nbsp; you need to change the date / year to now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows and programs rely on the date being current not 6&nbsp; - 20 yrs ago. Since it gets the info from the BIOS</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should also check what else you want to enable / use in the BIOS before you install Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've got a sata hdd enable AHCI. You cant enable it after you install Windows</p>

            I know when I clean installed 10586 on a spare hard drive I just deleted all partitions and selected Next. Could be worth trying and you could use disk management to change the partition size if the install works.

<p>Sure, but I already changed the necessary settings, such date and time. Also tweaked the boot menu order for some tests, but wherever the HDD is (1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th) I get stuck on Windows. Ah, and enabled some CPU Intel technologies, that were enable
 before. I actually NEVER changed anything related with disk on BIOS. Even when I replaced my older HDD with this new one with 2TB. I am also not sure if I can't change anything, as I need to unplug the HDD to access BIOS. So, at least, I won't be able to change
 specific settings of the HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will take a look. Thanks :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I insist, what I really need is a way of formatting the hard drive, which I can't now because I am stuck on POST screen...</p>

<p>Well, I don't know then :)</p>
<p>I would like to try if I could... however, as I described, I don't know how to boot Windows Setup files from USB, and keep the HDD plugged in.. Any idea?</p>

            3D works on 120hz(Nvidia 3D Vision) and also 60hz(Discover Glasses).....
<div><br />
<div>Yea 120hz is the perfect one!.....and my friend! i play games only on 1 monitor not two.... Nvidia Surround supports &gt;=3 monitors!... my primary is 120hz and 60hz just helps with my work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Issue is 120hz monitor doesnt kick itself into 120hz instead it remains at 60hz causing that error to pop up!.Its due to the 60hz monitor!.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If i disconnect my 60Hz monitor its perfectly fine.</div>

<p>my logon is just a password, not an email + password.</p>
<p>When I try to use "Let's get started", or add a user, or try to use cortana, I get a message saying can't do it, or cannot connect to the internet. (even though I am) I appears that these all require hotmail connections</p>
<p>I *suspect* the problem relates to the lack of a hotmail address when I logon.&nbsp; I have a hotmail account, and even when looged on through my mailer, windows 10 doesn't seem to recognize this</p>
<p>I have tried to change the logon, but cannot find a place or way to add an email address.</p>
<p>Suggestions/ideas are welcome.&nbsp; I did try a fresh install option, but that would require me to reinstall a bunch of programs, and I REALLY don't want to do that</p>

            Hi to all and anyone at MS Answers - if an 'official-person' from MS would care to reply.<br />
<br />
1st. This text composer will not let me say the words F I X&nbsp; I T and keeps replacing it with FIT IT? Whats going on MS?. Is everything a challenge with you?<br />
<br />
2nd. I posted this answer before but MS had disallowed it or something, because I posted the link everyone needs to fix this!
<br />
<br />
I don't get it MS? <b>You want us to find our own answers and help others</b>, then you refuse to let us post the links that will solve the problem?? Duh....! I am so annoyed..<br />
<br />
I am trying again here and now, if this does not work I'm giving up on MS Answers. I would advise anyone NOT TO RUN the MS FIX IT software to fix this issue! But, like me, if you are here, reading this already, its too late isn't it?<br />
<br />
3rd. <b>Now lets get to it!</b><br />
My PC was working fine except for the massage <b>as in BOLD below</b>. It did not seem to be affecting anything, but I just wanted the message to stop
<u>and to have that hdaudbus.sys file on my PC</u> that the 'FOUND NEW HARDWARE' program was asking for..<br />
<br />
I ran the FIX IT software following advice at the MS site and it broke my sound by turning off my mic and broke two other things as well that I cannot fix.&nbsp; THESE WERE WORKING OK BEFORE!
<br />
<br />
Now playback levels are too quiet with screen capture and I I have no sound in the GTA4 game.
<br />
I can find no-help or answers at MS except to t run the FIX IT software again! <br />
<br />
If a plumber floods your house, would you let him back in to do more damage?&nbsp; <br />
I don't even know how to phrase my questions because I don't know whats wrong. <br />
<br />
Not having learned my lesson from the last time I ran the FIX-IT software, I decided to run it again, to try and find the solution. It has given me even more serious problems that I did not even have before I tried to fix something that was working.<br />
<br />
<u>****Every time I restarted my PC, I get a found new hardware message&nbsp;</u><b>"&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;UAA bus driver for High Definition Audio "
</b>and then when I went on a search of every software disc I have for my PC to find the file....<br />
hdaudbus.sys
<b>I could not find it! Not anywhere... </b><br />
<b><br />
it is a simple answer of Microsoft just giving us a link, instead of making us have to go off and find the answers elsewhere on the net. Not good service MS!</b><br />
<br />
I found this software/ program file and downloaded and ran it - initial problem solved. But will this Microsoft Answers let me post the link below this time? They did not before! So here goes!<br />
<a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareDescription.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=US&amp;swItem=ob-45958-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareDescription.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=US&amp;swItem=ob-45958-1</a><br />
<br />
If you see no link above, then blame MS Answers for yet another blunder, they make us help ourselves, by finding our own answers, that MS should be answering themselves, then don't let us post the link needed to fix it!<br />
<br />
MS should provide this simple answer themselves. (If they do already, then I can't find it! I got this via Google powered search via AVG).<br />
<br />
I am always loathed to follow links by other users. You don't know me, I'm not a MS Windows expert, just some other innocent bystander like yourself trying to find answers to software faults.
<br />
<br />
MS's FIX-IT software broke this! There was nothing wrong originally.&nbsp; I just followed the MS online advice to check my system. It reported that it had fixed a fault that didn't exist (re I had left my mic on (open)). It claimed to have 'fixed a problem' by
 muting my mic. After that my mic would not work at all.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Thanks Microsoft, for a days worth of wasted time.&nbsp;&nbsp; The FIT IT software is now also reporting two other faults that I have no clue as to what is wrong. Everything is working now, thanks to my own diligence and persistence..
<br />
<br />
Andy..<br />

<h2>            &#91;Solved&#33;&#93; Teredo Adapter missing.</h2>
                    So, i cant play on multiplayer in Xbox games. I know the problem is me not having the teredo adapter, but if i go into device manager &gt; Add Legacy Hardware &gt; Microsoft, i cant find it there. In short, i dont have the adapter and i cant install it.

<p>did you ever figure out what to do I'm having the same problem</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well my problem turned out to just be that Teredo was disabled. Type in cmd in to the search bar on your desktop and right click on Command Prompt and run it as admin. Then, type in&nbsp;<strong>netsh interface Teredo set state type=default .&nbsp;</strong>This will
 re-enable Teredo. Also you dont have to reinstall Teredo as it will install it self.</p>
