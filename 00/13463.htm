    <title>Unable to Dimiss Recurring Appointment Reminder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mjftn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Dimiss Recurring Appointment Reminder</h2>
                    Hello! I have customer using Outlook 2007 with a Personal Folder. She has been getting a recurring appointment reminder every day, several times a day. The appointment is not found on any calendar or in the Tasks folder. If you click "Open" to view the
 appointment, nothing happens. If you click Dismiss, it will go away, but return later.
<br />
<br />
I found this article: <a href="http://www.office-outlook.com/outlook-forum/index.php/m/276310/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.office-outlook.com/outlook-forum/index.php/m/276310/</a> and tried the following from that post:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Start Outlook with the /cleanreminders switch</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Downloaded MFCMapi tool and used it to first determine where the reminder was from, it was from her Peronsal folder (.pst file). Then, I used the notes in that article to try and delete the reminder, but it gave an error:<br />
<br />
Mapi_e_unknown_flags == 0x80040106<br />
Function ((LPMAPIFolder) m_lpContainer) -&gt;DeleteMessages ( lpEIDs, lpProgress ? (ULONG_PTR)m_hWnd : Null, lpProgress, ulFlag)<br />
File Folderdlg.cpp<br />
Line 691<br />
<br />
It did not matter if I had outlook opened or closed when trying to delete the reminder.<br />
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>I then used ScanPst.exe to scan and repair the pst file. It did find errors and fixed them, but the reminder still comes up.</li></ul>
Any idea how to get rid of it? I am out of ideas.<br />
<br />
Oh also, the O/S is Windows Server 2003 64bit (Terminal Server)<br />
Thanks!<br />

<p>hello Phendrena,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had this same problem. First thing, from your PC log into your hotmail account. You might have to do a spam filter check. After that, go into e-mail, settings and uncheck the sync button for e-mal, exit out and check the box to sync.</p>
<p>After that your e-mail should work.</p>

    <title>Office 2007 Outlook does not clear the OUTBOX - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pegstress  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2007 Outlook does not clear the OUTBOX</h2>
                    My operating system is an XP.&nbsp; I'm running Office 2007.<br />
<br />
I've narrowed my problem with the OUTBOX not clearing (emptying) down to emails created by clicking on the REPLY button.&nbsp; I can create new emails, and they clear the outbox after sending.&nbsp; And, the sent emails appear in the sent folder.&nbsp; None of this happens
 when i reply to an email received.&nbsp; The reply email stays in the outbox and is repeatedly sent out every 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
My *.pst file is 1,900,000 KB in size.&nbsp; Running the scanpst.exe application did not resolve the problem.&nbsp; The repair didn't help.<br />
<br />
If anyone has a solution, i'd appreciate some help.<br />
<br />

            Try running Outlook in safe mode. Press "CTRL"+Outlook icon to start it and see if you have the same issue. If not, disable your add-ins and then add them back one at a time until you find out which one is causing you problems.<br />

                    <p>Welp... I can't find any Angry Birds games in my Windiwa Phone 8.1 Nokia Lumia 1320</p>
<p>Googling says Rovio, the owner of the Angry Birds games, removed it from the store.</p>
<p>Is there any unofficial way to get that game? I really want to play those games. Ive gotten pretty old and I love to throw away birds at piggies (pretending to be my father, who is the one who wants to play it, and has been asking me from some time to search
 it). But welp, cant find it on store. Soooo... any, just ANY way I could download it again?&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow these steps to fix instant search (w/o search):</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Log in Outlook 2016&gt;<strong>File</strong>&gt;<strong>Options</strong>&gt;<strong>Search</strong></span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Indexing Options</strong>&gt;<strong>Modify</strong></span></li><li><span>This is where you can make sure that Outlook has been selected for indexing.</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c2fc13c5-617d-4f8a-b1ec-0f14c71687a8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c2fc13c5-617d-4f8a-b1ec-0f14c71687a8" /></a></p>
<p><span>If this setting does not work, you need to rebuild your Outlook 2016 index. Please following these steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click on <span><strong>File</strong></span>, then
<strong><span>Options</span></strong>.&nbsp;Click&nbsp;<strong><span>Search</span></strong> on the left side.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong><span>Indexing Options.</span></strong></span></li><li><span>Click on <strong><span>Advanced.</span></strong></span></li><li><span>click on “<strong>Rebuild</strong>” within “Index Settings”.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>The rebuild may need time to take effect, depending on the system you are using, the amount of files that need to be indexed, and file size.</span></p>
<p><span>If you got any problem, please provide us with the following information:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Which mail account type and windows version are you using?</span></li><li><span>What error message do you get when trying to do a search?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to downgrade back to Outlook 2013, you can do the following:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware.aspx?source=ohp-ib" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Log in with your Office 365 account</a>, and install the Office 365 with the 2013 apps at the bottom of the page.</span></p>
<p><span>If you encounter any problems, please post back.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

1. I am using POP and IMAP accounts, search doesn't work with any of them. &nbsp;There are about 8 email accounts.</p>
<p>
2. There are NO errors, it just says it can't find anything. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>It is a problem with Outlook 2016. &nbsp;There are THOUSANDS with the same problem. &nbsp;I am not going to waste more of my time going through ridiculous acrobatics just to find it doesn't do a thing. &nbsp;I have already done numerous trouble shooting suggestions, nothing
 works (as THOUSANDS of others have also found).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As I have already answered, there is no &nbsp;error, it just shows no results. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled 2016 and reinstalled 2013 (which is still a flawed problem with numerous bugs). &nbsp;I will be expecting a refund.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Until MS acknowledges this is a HUGE problem and releases a bug fix I will be using 2013. &nbsp;</p>

            "Licenses" in Office are represented by Product Keys.&nbsp; Since you are dealing with less than 5 licenses you cannot use the discounted Volume agreement, you must buy individual retail licences.&nbsp; Can you see need for 2 more license within the next year or
 so to justify a volume license?<br />
<br />
Although there is a "Product Key Card" option, I strongly recommend against it. It is slightly discounted, but for most people the discount is not worth the license rights you give up. Unfortunately most buyers aren't aware of the limitations in time.&nbsp; PKC
 licenses are good for installation on one computer PERIOD. Like an OEM (factory install) license the PKC license dies with the hardware. In worst case scenario, a new computer dies and is replaced under warranty, but you will still have to BUY a new Office
 license!&nbsp; In contrast, the retail / "FPP" license, allows you to install on 2 computers for the same user (a "primary" device and a "portable" device), and to later transfer those licences to new hardware as required.<br />
<br />
If you decide on retail licenses you have 2 options: Online download and Boxed CD/DVD.&nbsp; They typically cost the same. I normally recommend the Boxed CD so that you don't have to rely on MS maintaining&nbsp; the download links. People with 2003 can NO LONGER download
 installation files, and Academic licenses require the original educational email address, so former students can no longer download.&nbsp; In your case I would suggest buying at least one Boxed CD so that you have the media on hand for future re-installs.<br />

<p><span><span>Thank you for posting.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you are running PCGuard firewall in addition to Windows Firewall this could be your problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You need to disable one of the firewalls.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you wish to continue using PCGuard then go to the Control Panel, System and Security, then Windows Firewall and then disable/turn off Windows Firewall.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This should then allow your feeds to update.</span></span></p>

                    <p>I have two outlook.com accounts in my Outlook 2013. I exported the folders (containing e-mails) from&nbsp;&nbsp;the accounts and stored them in my pc ( I saved the files as pst files), since I needed to remove one of&nbsp;the outlook.com accounts from my Outlook 2013 due
 configuration problems with this account. I added again to Outlook 2013 &nbsp;the account I removed, but the problem now it's that I can't&nbsp;import the&nbsp;emails back into Outlook 2013...I've tried many times, and the system gives me this message in every attempt:<em><strong>C</strong></em><em><strong>ould
</strong></em><strong><em>not complete&nbsp;the operation because the service provider does not support it.

<p>I tried export e-mails into my pc (which was ok) from the two accounts in my Outlook 2013, but I can't import them back....I've spoken a few times with Microsoft representatives and I've searched the web and Microsoft site, but I can't find a solution to
 this problem. </p>
<p>Can anyone help me with this problem. My outlook 2013 does not allow me to import e-mails!! After I get the message "<em><strong>C</strong></em><em><strong>ould

<h2>            activation error 0xC004C003 on downloaded ISO install.</h2>
                    <p>I have just about had enough of this MS C**p. For a week now I have been trying to activate a 10240 build.
</p>
<p>having been on the insider program since 2 0ct 14, and been updated throughout until 10130 where I had a shed load of OS problems, no USBs recognised,&nbsp;wouldn't find the network or other machines and finally got stuck on a security&nbsp;update, I used ERD from&nbsp;MS
 DaRT&nbsp;to clean the drive and did a clean install using the 10130 iso, last week it updated to 10240&nbsp;but wouldn't activate. Took the advice of Abe Gaul and waited a few days because the servers were busy, still no activation.</p>
<p>Today I&nbsp;did a clean install of 10240, still wouldn't activate. downloaded the ISO from MS, Cleaned the drive again using ERD, installed from the ISO and guess what? it still refuses to activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I get is the error 0xC004C003, what the hell is going on? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a screen shot of the FAQs from the start of the insider program which show that at the end of the testing period insider would receive a full version of the software. although to be fair it doesn't actually say it would be an activated version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has proved to be a total disaster with similarities to XP service pack 2 and Vista launch. for God sake someone get this mess sorted out. I have told my clients not to accept any updates to 10 until we have a clear strategy that is not going to cause
 mayhem. we can't afford the loss of business.</p>

            <p>Yes I am still having this issue, I have read the article mentioned above which basically says buy a licence for almost £200 or tough luck. well that is not going to happen.

<p>
</p><p>This is not what I expected when I started this program and am disgusted with the Microsoft attitude after all their disasters with this offering.

</p><p>As a Microsoft partner, this has really put me off their future products and ethos.</p>

    <title>Question about Clean Install to New SSD&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cubdukat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question about Clean Install to New SSD&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I currently have Win10 Pro installed with the license linked to my Microsoft account. Right now the system is so incredibly messed up that I was going to do a reset, but I have decided to wait until I get a new, larger SSD and do a clean install.<br />
<br />
My concern is this: Is this likely to cause problems when I go to activate the system, even though the only hardware in it that has changed is the boot SSD? Every other component in the system would be the same as it was before the install.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am hesitant to do a refresh for a variety of reasons:<br />
<br />
1. I have not gathered all the programs I will need to reinstall, and&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I am using a separate regular hard drive for data and most installed programs due to the lack of space on the SSD. This drive is hard-linked to the SSD, and I am fearful that because it is hard-linked, it will erase everything in the various Windows related
 folders such as Documents, Downloads, et al., and I do not currently have any way to back these up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am wondering is if I should physically remove the drive before the reset, then reinstall it afterwards and re-link everything? I will still have to reinstall all the programs, since they will be orphaned, but that's the only way I know how to ensure
 none of my data gets erased.</p>

<p>If you do a clean install;</p>
<p>If the computer was activated there is no longer a need for a key.<br />
When asked for a key just go to the bottom of the page and click on Skip, Do this later, or I do not have one.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Have you thought of the clone process. &nbsp; Clone the old SSD to the new SSD and all of your data, programs, and links should still be there.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Also;&nbsp; If you have not cleaned it out before doing a clean install or reset do this; copy the Download Folder in File Explorer to a USB or another drive on the disk.&nbsp; Then use it to install the downloaded programs rather than wandering all over the Internet
 to download the programs again.</p>

<p>I actually had considered cloning the drive, but Win10 is so badly corrupted that it needs to either be reset or installed fresh. Now, I could reset it after the clone, but I'd still have the same issue with the linked drive.<br />
<br />
Also, I checked each of the Windows folders (Docs, Downloads, etc.) on the hard drive. The smallest one of them is 600GB. I think I'm just gonna wait and pick up another 4TB drive to clone that one to so that in case something goes wrong, I can restore everything.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Eventually what I'd like to do is move the contents over to a NAS setup, but that's in the future.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I really need to do in the future is figure out how to do soft links instead of what I did with this one ( right-clicking on Properties and selecting the corresponding folder on the 4TB drive). I tried it initially when I first built the system, but
 for some reason it wouldn't cooperate. Hopefully I can fix a lot of the mistakes with with the initial system with the reset.&nbsp;</p>

            In the Download Folder what is taking all the room?&nbsp; If it is music, video etc it can be removed as you probably have it saved,&nbsp; What you needs to save off is the downloaded Program files.<br />
By the way the numbers after the prerelease are the date and time of when it was compiled.

<p>Your activation is digital, based on running a certain version, such as home or pro, with your existing motherboard, and is stored on the activation server at Microsoft. Changing your hard drive or doing a clean install doesn't require reactivation. If you
 do a clean install, be sure to install the version, home or pro, that you now have activated. Early in the install process, when it asks for a key, check the box "I don't have a key", and proceed. The activation will be automatically continued by the server.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My personal preference is to keep all data on a separate drive, redundantly backed up, and the operating system and all installed programs on an SSD of around 120 GB, backed up in a disk image (about weekly) saved on a separate drive. I usually keep the
 image of the current build and the two previous ones, as well as the last public release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That allows one to restore to one of the previous builds in a few minutes, and since the data is on separate drive, it stays current, so after restoring to a previous build, the accounting program can be run using current, undisturbed, data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, in case the SSD fails, it only requires a few minutes to recover on a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your present system, when you unplug your SSD and plug in the new one to do the clean install, the drive that your data is on will not be bothered during the clean install. If you keep all of the newly installed programs on the new SSD, you can then just
 delete any remnants of old programs from the data drive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's going to be one of the changes I'll be making in the near future. I've been putting it off, but come tax time, I'll be getting another 4TB or greater drive to clone the current data drive. After that, I'll have another drive in the system to take
 backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, though, the system's taken a turn for the worse stability-wise, so I am going to forego cloning the SSD because I would be cloning a corrupted system. I'm going to then disconnect the data drive and do a reset, and hopefully that will work.
 After the reinstall I'll reconnect the data drive, re-link the Windows-specific folders, then reinstall things, hopefully directing everything to the data drive instead. It's the safest way to do it, given the circumstances; I can't be sure I can limp into
 next month with the current system. It's gotten to the point where I'm constantly installing the same Intel graphics driver at least every two hours, even though each time it says it was successful...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other advantage is that I may be able to fix some of the issues I got after attempting to set up a dual-boot Linux setup. It virtually borked everything, and it took me a week on and off to get things back to normal.
<br />
<br />
Once Win10's been reset, I'm sure everything will be back to normal and I can get back to getting Insider Builds. Because the system's so corrupted, the last two or three refuse to install, and they give me the BAD_POOL_CALLER GSOD screen at about the 80% install
 point...</p>

            Truth be known, I'm scared to look :)<br />
<br />
No, seriously, I know one of the things are various ISOs and VirtualBox files. They're probably a good amount, plus all of the programs I'm going to need to install. Once the system's more stable I'll see how much can be burnt to Blu-Ray and deleted. I suspect
 it'll be a lot...

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would unhook the hard drive and do a clean install... Either on the old or new SSD..</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to easily link back to your documents and stuff using the Properties...Location Tab...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The programs are a different story, but as you mentioned, you will need to reinstall them any way..</p>
<p>
</p><p>It kind of defeats the purpose of using a SSD to install your programs to a different HDD... Some of their "Project" files and similar, yes maybe... I do this on a limited basis... Especially video editing programs that have huge project files...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only advantage to Cloning in your case would be to have backup on the old SSD...</p>

<p>If the failed attempt to install that driver ends with a statement that an already-installed driver might be better than the failed one, it is almost certainly caused by a flaw in Microsoft's update system rather
 than an issue in your computer... it doesn't hurt anything, but it seems annoying.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can prevent further attempts to install it by running wushowhide.diagcab, which you can download here: http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/2/F22D5FDB-59CD-4275-8C95-1BE17BF70B21/wushowhide.diagcab</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not a fan of dual booting Windows with Linux. I've always felt that, if I wanted to run Linux, I would run it on another computer, so that I could run both operating systems concurrently, rather than needing to reboot to switch to the other one.

            I think I only got that recommendation about the driver once. Most of the time I'll have no updates, then I'll get a notification that it can't install updates, so I install it, and it'll be good for another couple of hours, then it happens all over again.
 It's really the only update I'm getting now that I'm on the Slow ring.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I actually ended up using Linux under Virtualbox because of the problems I've had dual-booting under UEFI. It's almost as fast, and I don't have to deal with the install configuring my system as if it was an Nvidia Optimus system (I actually have a GTX 960
 installed as my main card, and the Intel GPU is just being used for QuickSync duty).&nbsp;

<br />
I have emails forwarded to my Outlook.com account, and since yesterday Outlook refuses to receive them, even though the forwarding address is in my safe senders list.<br />
<br />
The domain is @spangley.com<br />

Please help Microsoft. <br />

            The restriction code you are asking for is an unlock code.<br />
<br />
The only place you can get an unlock code from will be the network provider of the handset.<br />
<br />
I suggest you contact the network provider for this information.

Absolute nonsense.<br />

Updating a phone's firmware will <u>not</u> lift the SIM restriction.

Phone restricted is a phrase I used to see often on my Nokia 6233 , specially after browsing the internet ,this phrase vanished after I updated the software ,I've seen many people asking about the restriction code they may inset instead of restarting the mobile,
 and really no one had a clue about it , and as you are talking about Nokia 6233 , I thought this is the restriction code you are looking for !

            I think restriction code due to sim card block if very well known to be related to the service provider and should have been submitted with the subscription ,<br />
<br />
but restriction code due to phone restricted phrase that appears on the screen for no reason and disables the phone is something logical to be asked about , since it is related to phone model , and all codes that you may have related to the phone or to the
 sim will not work .<br />
<br />
after software update , this phrase shall disappear for good.<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure I made myself clear now ! :)

<h2>            Pressing Space adds letter to the beginning of the sentence</h2>
                    <p>Note, I think it is 2013.... It came with the Surface RT. </p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Sometimes</em> while typing, I start a new line with ENTER. Then whenever I hit&nbsp;SPACE/PUNCTATION it adds whatever letter the new sentence began with. It looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>YYYYyyyyyyyyyyyyyyoucantakeawatersamplelotsofsmallspecies </em><br />
<em>You can take a water sample, lots of small species</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If I start a new line, it stops. If I return to the line, it continues like this.
<br />
<br />
Am I doing something and not noticing? I'm using&nbsp;a wireless&nbsp;Microsoft keyboard. I've put in fresh batteries and it still does this. Has been happening for months. I had the keyboard that also works as a cover, clicks right in, it had the same problem.</p>

</p><p>I installed Microsoft Office on a new laptop at home. But it tells me that the office version can not be released because for the product key were already the max. number of sw-licenses used. After that I uninstalled an office installation on my old laptop,
 which means that I should have now one licence free. But I can still not release the office on my new laptop.</p>
<p>Could you please advise how I need to proceed in order to release the office on my new laptop?</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />The On-premise product keys provided with the Action Pack subscriptions allow a limited number of activations.
<br />
<br />Licenses are considered used when a product key is activated in one of the following ways:
<br />
<br />If the software is installed on a different machine, one product activation is considered used against the product key.
<br />If the software is installed on the same machine, with no changes made to the hardware, product activation is not considered used against the product key.
<br />If the software is installed on the same machine, with changes made to the hardware, product activation is considered used against the product key.
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Once activation of the product key has been fully accounted for, partners are not be able to use it again and won’t be able to request additional keys.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Please refer to this link to view the license table for Microsoft Action Pack Subscription and refer to the screenshot below where you can access it:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/membership/internal-use-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/membership/...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />I recommend you to review the Product Usage Guide which outlines the program license use rights, policies, and terms of use for specific products and cloud services.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />You may also contact our Product Activation team for assistance. This team will determine if the key has been misused or if additional activations can be allowed. You may look for your regional Product Activation Center.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If you need to use or deploy more licenses that the ones granted, you will need to upgrade your Partnership level to a Silver or Gold Competency to receive more product licenses or you may contact your Local Microsoft Office for details on how to purchase these licenses through a channel such as Retail or Microsoft Volume Licensing.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Kind Regards, 
<br />
<br />Engr. Jamshed Muhammad

            The 2016 Home Use Program, HUP, was improved to allow you to install Office on ONE computer at home. Since it is 2016, you should be able to manage your installation through the MyAccount site.  
<br />

<br />This page shows how to install Office AFTER the license has been activated.  It also shows a few other things you can do in the MyAccount site.

<h2>            Nokia 520 says try again in 7589472 minutes&#33;</h2>
                    Hi there, so my nokia 520 phone says try again in 7589472 minutes! I tried to reset the phone, but it doesn't work. It only goes up to the exclamation mark, then it vibrates and says "Nokia" then the windows logo turns on, and says the same thing, 'try
 again in 7589472 minutes' &nbsp;The date and time is even wrong on my phone. &nbsp;I've tried and tried but i can't get in, and also, i cant remember my pass code so is there anything i can do to get rid of the pass code and the try again? Thanks&nbsp;

<h2>            Receiving unnecesssary alerts for upload in other folders of Onedrive</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I tried to place an alert on a folder in Onedrive, such that whenever someone uploads a document, I receive an alert. Following is what I did:</p>
<p>1. Click on XYZ folder <strong><em>created by me</em></strong> (i.e. tick mark next to folder) and Select Library--&gt; Alert Me--&gt; Set an alert on this Library</p>
<p>2. Select the following in Set an alert on this Library:</p>
<p>a. alert title = Upload alert for XYZ folder</p>
<p>b. Send alerts to = my e-mail address</p>
<p>c. Delivery method = email</p>
<p>d. Change type = new items added</p>
<p>e. Send alerts for these changes = Anything changes</p>
<p>f. When to send notification for this alert = Send immediately</p>
<p><strong>The Problem:&nbsp;</strong>While I do get the alert when I upload a document in XYZ folder, I get an alert if I upload anything in my Onedrive. Also, when the alert is created, it says that an alert is created on my name. When I click my name, I am directed
 to my whole onedrive. Similarly, when the alert comes to my inbox, and I click View Documents, it shows my whole onedrive instead of only the contents of folder XYZ. I end up getting 2*2=4 alerts if I have placed alerts on two different folders. What is the
 workabout or what am I doing wrong?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Had to replace phone - how do I get my data from myphone service down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cjlatta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Had to replace phone - how do I get my data from myphone service down to my new phone&#63;</h2>
                    I think some of this topic may be answered in other threads, but I want to be sure I'm headed in the right direction.&nbsp;
<br />
The following is a summary of how I understand the steps:<br />
<br />
The suggestion is to move everything in the&nbsp;myphone service to archive.&nbsp; <br />
Then start up the myphone app on the telephone device and do a sync to myphone service.&nbsp; Since there's nothing to sync to, nothing will be transferred.&nbsp;<br />
Move everything back from archive and perform another sync.&nbsp; All should then be downloaded to the phone, since it's all "new" data.<br />
<br />
My questions - since my new telephone device doesn't have the myphone app, should I download it before or after moving my data to the archive files?&nbsp; Are my steps listed above correct?&nbsp; Should I add/change any of the steps?&nbsp; Is there some place to say to the
 myphone service that what's on the telephone device should replace/override/append what's on the myphone service or vice versa (especially important once I do get the data back on my telephone device)?<br />
<br />
I'm old school enough to be worried about "sync" - I would like to know whether it's a download or an upload that happens first.&nbsp; Which has the priority?<br />
I'm gun-shy at the moment about doing anything - after losing all my contacts when getting this "new" phone (actually a warranty refurb device), I'm just wanting to be sure I don't lose my pictures, etc.&nbsp;

<p>Hi cjlatta,<br />
<br />
To answer your questions -<br />
<br />
1. Yes, you are absolutely right. Move everything to archive -&gt; sync -&gt;&nbsp;move it back -&gt;&nbsp;sync. You should now have all your contacts and data on your new phone.<br />
<br />
2. To download the My Phone application on your phone, go to <a href="http://myphone.microsoft.com/install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://myphone.microsoft.com/install</a>&nbsp;(from your phone). This should give you an option to download the installation file and then you can install the application.<br />
<br />
The sync direction cannot really be controlled at this point. The steps that you listed above are probably the safest and easiest way to bring down data to your phone without any confusion. Please feel free let us know if you have any further questions.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            <p>One problem people see a lot, and don't realize until it's pointed out, is that you need to make sure your time, date, and time zone are all set correctly. The year might be off on the date, or your time zone might be set to something close, but wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try setting that to manual, make sure all the settings are right, then go to the IE settings and delete the browsing history. Much like a Windows computer, the browsing history stores cache data for your phone. Clearing it periodically can be beneficial.
 After that, just restart your phone. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're still having issues, something might have gone wrong with your firmware install. If you're using a Nokia, you can use the Nokia recovery tool to reinstall the firmware on your phone. Unfortunately, the other manufactures haven't put out a tool
 to reinstall this yet.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 928 wont power off &#38; touch wont work</h2>
                    <p>Over the weekend I had to let my phone die completely, I put it on the charger to charge at night.&nbsp; Sunday I could not hit the side button to lock it. And it wont phone will not power off.&nbsp; I have done the restart by holding down the volume and the power
 button, it does its thing, turns back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought letting it go completely dead again, it dies but shows the battery in red &amp; acts like it want to come back on with a vibrate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now after that when I hit the volume it reverts back to screenshots, then I reset it then its fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to do a hard factory re set this am, now the phone will not power off, nor can I touch the front to get the phone to wake up. I have to hit the camera button, then hit the home key.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Lana M.Thompson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for posting to the forum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest to try the Nokia/Hardware support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But just in case, you can try resetting the phone with the recovery tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download it <a href="http://download.fds-ncom.nokia.com/supportFiles/phones/files/recovery/NokiaSoftwareRecoveryToolInstaller.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here </a>and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
