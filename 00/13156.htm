Eman #1 in my €ye</a>. If you're using a Lumia phone, try pressing and holding the volume down and the power keys at the same time for 10-15 seconds and see if it makes any difference. You may also try checking if there is any update available for the phone.
 Go to Settings &gt; phone update &gt; check for updates. We'll appreciate letting us know the outcome.

<p>Note: AF29 didn't explain this properly.&nbsp;the purpose of these instructions is to reboot the phone. you're supposed to hold the two buttons until the phone actually restarts (ignore the screen when it asks to slide down to power off). you might need to adjust
 the date and time when the phone restarts.</p>

    <title>Nz in select query - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ridotta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nz in select query</h2>
                    <p>I have two tables, tbl.OrderDetails and tbl.Transactions. I am trying to build a select query to tell me how much I have received so far from the open purchase orders. In my order details table I have fields for PO#, ItemId, Order Qty among other information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>tbl.Transactions includes these fields:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to build a query that tells me what I have received so far on the PO. Sometimes I have not received any of one of the items and when that is the case it doesn't show in my query. In this example, I have ordered 3 items but only received 2, items 812-205047
 and 812-205042. My query returns the quantities received for those two but does not mention 812-200396. Here is my query and results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried Nz but it didn't work. I got the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Rather than screenshots of your queries it usually helps us more if you post a&nbsp; query's SQL statement as text in your reply.&nbsp; To do this switch from query design view to SQL view and copy what you see in the SQL window.&nbsp; To post an image file here use
 the Image icon in the menu bar at the top of the reply window, rather than pasting.
<br />
<br />
From the information you've provided my guess is that you should be using a LEFT OUTER JOIN rather than an INNER JOIN in the query.&nbsp; The former will return all rows from the table on the left side of the join, regardless of whether there is a match on the right
 side. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Note however that if you want to restrict a query's results on a column in the table on the right side of the join a LEFT OUTER JOIN will not work, in effect becoming an INNER JOIN.&nbsp; The way to get round this is to LEFT JOIN the referenced table to a subquery
 in which the restriction is undertaken.&nbsp; The following is an example form my DatabaseBasics demo:<br />
<br />
SELECT FirstName, LastName, EmployerCount<br />
FROM Contacts LEFT JOIN <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (SELECT ContactID, COUNT(*) AS EmployerCount<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FROM ContactEmployers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GROUP BY ContactID<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1)&nbsp; AS CE2 <br />
ON Contacts.ContactID = CE2.ContactID <br />
ORDER BY LastName, FirstName;<br />
<br />
This returns all contacts, along with the number of employers for any who have more than one employer.&nbsp; The subquery is given the alias CE2 and joined to the Contacts table in the same way that you'd join two conventional base tables.&nbsp; You cannot easily do
 the above in query design view, however, though you could create two separate queries in design view and then join those queries in a further query, all in design view.<br />
<br />
You'll find my DatabaseBasics.zip file in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />

<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />

<p>Here is the SQL version of my query. As I may not receive all of an item at one time, I want to sum the receipts for each item.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SELECT DISTINCT UsysOrderDetails.[PO#], UsysOrderDetails.ItemId, Sum(UsysTransactions.Received) AS SumOfReceived<br />
FROM UsysOrderDetails LEFT JOIN UsysTransactions ON UsysOrderDetails.[PO#] = UsysTransactions.[Purchase Order]<br />
GROUP BY UsysOrderDetails.[PO#], UsysOrderDetails.ItemId<br />
HAVING (((UsysOrderDetails.[PO#])=[Enter PO#]));</p>
<p>
</p><p>I replaced the INNER JOIN with LEFT JOIN. It does return all items, but it sums the receipts of all items together.</p>

            The purchase order number is not a candidate key of UsysOrderDetails.&nbsp; Its key is a composite of PO# and ItemID.&nbsp; Consequently the Transactions table's foreign key must also be a composite of purchase order and itemID columns, and the tables should be
 joined on both columns.&nbsp; The query will then return the sum of each item received per purchase order.

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Yes it is listed in Programs and Features after "dissapearing"&nbsp;but clicking on Uninstall/Change does nothing.</p>
<p>2. After i just install it again everything works fine even Emails Profile etc is there.</p>
<p>3. No error Messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i only have to install it again after it gets "lost" then ok i can live with that but if it dissapears weekly on the same Machines that would be&nbsp;annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far it only apeared on 2 out of 8 Clients but i guess it will sooner or later happen to everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just trying to find a solution beforehand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before Office 2016 they used 2010 which we had to uninstall manually cause Office 2016 Setup told us/wont install before.</p>

<h2>            O365 Unable to purge email from Recover items folder</h2>
                    Recently I have been unable to purge the emails from my Recover items folder from Outlook. I contacted support and they were unable to resolve the issue. My workaround is to go onto Outlook.com which is a lot more effort than necessary. Has anyone else
 encountered this issue? Is it a new bug?

            Hi James,
<br />Do you have a lot of items in the folder? How long did you wait after you purged all to see if they purged?  When you purge from outlook, it can take some time for the changes to sync up and back down to outlook. 
<br />
<br />That said, it doesn't seem to be working - I'll ask Microsoft about it.

<p>I knew there was a delay, but most times the purge was immediate.. until lately. Now when I select the items for purge, click OK and return to the folder, the items are still there. I had support online, we tried several things including a new profile with
 the same result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to log on through Outlook.com to purge the folder.</p>

    <title>How to undo rollback when your 5 year old selects it and trashes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ohiodad  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to undo rollback when your 5 year old selects it and trashes EVERYTHING on the system&#63; &#40;including months of my wife&#39;s Minecraft world play&#41;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; I installed a new, blank hard drive in a system a few months back and then installed Windows 10 on it.&nbsp; I figured it would be good to get used to the new interface.&nbsp; It was only connected to the Internet every month or two - not regularly.&nbsp; I wanted to
 see how it would function as a game PC (everyday use for us) for my wife and Kids, and it had been doing great - very stable with Steam, and my wife played Minecraft on it a LOT, with very few problems of any kind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; When I connected a wifi dongle yesterday, I decided to update to the latest build of Windows 10.&nbsp; Unknown to me, Microsoft had evidently added a "rollback" choice to the startup screens that will destroy all installed programs and saved files.&nbsp; When I
 was still half asleep, my 5 year old got up and chose this this morning, and now every single program and saved file seems to be gone.&nbsp; The OS did NOT roll back to how things were yesterday, just before the update was downloaded.&nbsp; Instead, it seems to have
 'rolled back' to how it was months ago, removing all of our programs and saved files in the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Why in the world would Microsoft think it would be a good idea to add a choice on bootup that would destroy nearly all installed programs and saved files if selected?&nbsp; Some of us have kids you know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Why would Microsoft set up a rollback to roll WAY back to the very original configuration, rather than the last known working configuration?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I'm really hoping that there is some sort of "undo rollback" choice that I haven't found yet, but I'm guessing that they only make it easy to TRASH your system. - not to undo the last thing that was done.&nbsp; I'm also in the doghouse now, because hundreds
 of hours of my wife playing in Minecraft and creating her own world appear to be gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Would it be too much to ask for Microsoft to protect this potentially destructive rollback choice by requiring entry of a person's Windows Insider username or password first before the rollback can commence?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Thanks for your consideration.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;The age old solution to things like this (and there are many many more others) is to back up your system to an external hard drive.&nbsp; The school of hard knocks is a great teacher but it is a painful one.&nbsp; Live and learn!&nbsp; That ounce of prevention sure beats

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; In this case, the ounce of prevention I was looking for would have been a captcha type check, requesting user to type in a couple of words of script before it would proceed with the rollback.&nbsp; If they simply had that implemented, it would make certain
 that cats playing with the mouse/keyboard or very young kids doing the same would be unlikely to hose the whole system.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;It's like driving a car.&nbsp; It's not enough to watch what YOU are doing, you have to watch out for what OTHER drivers are doing.&nbsp; Sooner or later something else will happen to cause you to need that backup.&nbsp; Do you drive without a spare tire?&nbsp; Do you have
 homeowners insurance?&nbsp; These things shouldn't be needed maybe, but stuff happens.&nbsp; Three things in life are certain, death, taxes, and hard drive failures.&nbsp; Somebody could spill a drink on the computer, something could fall on the computer, it could get knocked
 off the table while running, a power flicker could make it non-bootable, etc., etc.&nbsp; Food for thought.&nbsp; That backup will save you a lot of headaches in the future.&nbsp; If you don't believe that, well all I can say is those who don't learn from history are doomed
 to repeat it.&nbsp; :-( </p>

<p>Great news!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>msconfig and such start up after that screen, so if you want to make it so the kids can't get at it, just use power settings to spin everything down, so all they do is move the mouse to have it come up to the log in screen when they want on.</p>

            <p>If you open Administrative tools (type in search or&nbsp; open control panel &gt;system and security &gt;administrative tools) then open system configuration and select Boot tab. You can set timeout to as low as 3 seconds and/or if you click on Rollback in the list
 you can delete it entirely and it won't show up when booting. </p>
<p>I tried deleting this since I had already deleted the windows.old folder (16GB!) which was the previous Win10 build, and nothing disastrous occurred.</p>
<p>(I'm in a dual boot but someone who has upgraded from an earlier OS might want to keep the option to roll back.)</p>

<h2>            Need to recheck the Advanced Setting for TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 for Internet Explorer Every time I restart my PC</h2>
                    <p>On restarting my Windows 7 64-bit PC, when I click on Internet Explorer I get the message "This page cannot be displayed".&nbsp; The solution to this is to go to the Tools, Internet options, Advanced Settings, and recheck the boxes for TLS 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 at
 the bottom. This only works until I restart the PC at which time I get the same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do not do this I not only cannot open Internet Explorer pages such as the Google webpage but I also have problems using certain functions of Quicken and other programs including the help function of the various Office 13 applications.&nbsp; Microsoft tech
 support wants me to pay $100 to work this problem.&nbsp; I'm not going to do that and I sincerely hope somebody can help me at this forum.&nbsp; I know this is a known problem, but the solutions I've seen have not helped.</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac still stuck on Sync Pending</h2>
                    <p>I am using Outlook for Mac 2016 on an Office 365 subscription for my gmail account on both a MacBook Pro and an iMac. &nbsp;This is a ridiculous issue and Microsoft doesn't appear to have a fix for it. &nbsp;Oddly, it is slightly worse on the MacBook Pro than the
 iMac. &nbsp;I tried the solution that talks about logging but it made no difference. &nbsp;Both the inbox and the outbox get stuck for ages, then at some point it starts working, but it is terribly intermittent. &nbsp;It also loses the password and wants it to be re-entered,
 sometimes several times. &nbsp;I have tried exiting Outlook, restarting the computer and various combinations of the above, all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I often end up reverting to my iPhone or to the gmail web interface. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like this is a fairly fundamental issue - and it seems to be one that has been around for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's going on?</p>

    <title>office 2007 hangs on reboot with windows xp - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew lebell  say:</h3>
<h2>            office 2007 hangs on reboot with windows xp</h2>
                    <p>i look after many computers and the same problem has occurred many times but mostly with office 2003 and now with office 2007.&nbsp; in all cases it has to do with replacing the hard drive on a computer.&nbsp; i do a fresh install of the operating system and then
 load on microsoft office, and it appears to work the first few times then it hangs everytime i rebooot the computer.&nbsp; when i first install the software (in this case office basic 2007) i do the full install and after i finished i open up excel and it asks
 me to register / validate my copy of office and i do so and receive the message thank you for registering your copy of microsoft office.&nbsp; i open and close word and excel a couple of times with no issues.&nbsp; i make sure xp pro and office 2007 are completely updated
 and this is when the problem seems to occur.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>problem (using excel as the example but it also applies to word)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i restart the computer and when it is up and running i double click on excel and try to type some numbers and nothing appears, and then i click on the x in the right hand corner and get an excel book 1 not responding&nbsp; after a few minutes(sometimes 10 minutes)&nbsp;the
 program exits.&nbsp; if for example i open excel type some numbers and nothing appears and i dont try to exit, the numbers will eventually show up a few minutes later.&nbsp; after this initial problem the programs work without any issue until the computer needs to be
 rebooted again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHAT I HAVE DONE SO FAR</p>
<p>deleted the normal.dat</p>
<p>ran the program with excel.exe /a</p>
<p>used regedit to set permissions for everyone and specif user to full</p>
<p>checked to make sure roxio software wasnt installed on the computer as this can apparently causes an issue</p>
<p>ran the microsoft office diagnostics (no problems)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ISSUE I HAVE NOTICED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when the program is hanging i start task manger and under applications i see Microsoft excel (not responding twice even though i have only opened one instance.&nbsp; if i right click on the first entry microsoft excel (not responding) and select go to process
 it takes me to the processes tab and excel.exe is highlighted&nbsp; when i do the same to the second entry microsoft excel (not responding) it takes me to the processes tab and explorer.exe is highlighted</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dontbelieve it is the computer because this has happened many times on different computers / laptops</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Windows 10&nbsp;Insider Preview Forums.</p>

</p><p>I understand that&nbsp;you are unable to upgrade your&nbsp;Windows 10 to build 10074 and getting error 0x80246017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue usually occurs when the Windows Update Components become corrupt and your computer faces difficulty to connect with the server of Microsoft to download and install Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the method below and check if it helps. </p>

<p>
</p><p>Please&nbsp;perform reset of&nbsp;Windows Updates components and check if that fixes the issue with Windows Updates.</p>

<p>Profiles or accounts? Each profile has an associated PST file containing the data. Copy those PST files to the new PC then from within the appropriate profile in Outlook 2010, open the relevant PST file from file menu and then also from the file menu set
 it as the default data source. Move anything you wish to keep from the 'new' PST file to the transferred one then closed the unwanted one. Repeat for each profile.</p>

                    I am trying to add page numbers to an existing document.&nbsp; I have inserted section breaks and still cannot get the pages numbered.&nbsp; I have 3 sections which need page numbers 1-1 thru 1-9, 2-1 thru 2-100, and 3-1 thru 3-100.&nbsp; Any suggestions on how to do

<p>Hi searaygator,</p>
<p>You could delete the preceding two section breaks. If that's not a viable approach:<br />
.&nbsp;select the existing 'Section' field and press Ctrl-F9 to embed it in another field (eg '{ 3 }');<br />
. fill in the field so that you end up with '{=3-2 \# 0;;}';<br />
. press F9 to update the field code.</p>

<p>Hi searaygator,</p>
<p>When you access the header/footer where you want the page numbering to appear, first unlink it from the previous section. Then:<br />
1. Press Ctrl-F9 to create and empty field, thus '{ }' and type 'SECTION' between the field braces, so that you end up with '{SECTION}'<br />
2. Type '-' after the field<br />
3. Press Ctrl-F9 to create and empty field, thus '{ }' and type 'PAGE' between the field braces, so that you end up with '{PAGE}'<br />
4. Format the PAGE field to start from 1.<br />
5. Select the fields and press F9 to update.<br />
6. Copy the field code.</p>
<p>Repeat the header/footer unlinking for the subsequent sections and&nbsp;format the page numbering there to start from 1 also. If they're already unlinked, paste the copied field code that you copied at (6) above.</p>

<p>Hi SD17,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although admin can’t view the list of MFA enabled/authenticated devices, users can view MFA enabled/authenticated devices. Users can restore Multi-Factor Authentication on their remembered devices by going to the additional security verification settings
 within their user profile. A shortcut to go there directly is at&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/mfasetup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/mfasetup</a>&nbsp;where you can click the Additional security verification tile. For more information, please refer
 to this <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/94a3011f-9e9f-48e6-8da8-a0723e752992/where-to-find-mfa-trusted-devices-in-azure-ad-and-default-behavior-of-outlook-2016-when-mfa-enabled?forum=windowsazureactiveauthentication" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
thread</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want let admin view the list of MFA enabled/authenticated devices, we suggest submitting your feedback in Office 365

                    Will be installing Outlook 2010 and want to keep all data files (.pst).&nbsp;&nbsp;Can I save the 2003 .pst files from their present location and then after installing Outlook 2010, copy them to the location where the .pst files are kept for this version?&nbsp; I have
 a very complex e-mail account tree and do not want to re-build it or loose the data in the file.&nbsp; I understand that it is best to uninstall Outlook 2003 before installing&nbsp;Outlook 2010.&nbsp;Thanks Much

<p>No. Do not just copy files to the default location. Doing so does not connect them to the Outlook profile correctly and may just corrupt your new installation. Correct methods are poasted here daily. Sorry you couldn't search the form.</p>
<p>The file you need is your Personal Folders file (*.pst) It's where all the mail, calendar, contacts etc are stored.</p>
<p>Take a look at these pages for info on Outlook data backup or transfer:<br />
<a href="http://www.slipstick.com/config/move_outlook.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.slipstick.com/config/move_outlook.asp</a><br />
<a href="http://www.howto-outlook.com/Howto/backupandrestore.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howto-outlook.com/Howto/backupandrestore.htm</a><br />

<p>Note that some of the information on the Microsoft page is outdated and contains errors, particularly when applied to Outlook 2003, 2007 or 2010. Specifically:<br />
1. Ignore any advice to copy your PST file to Outlook's default location to connect it to your profile. Doing so will often corrupt your Outlook profile. Copy it anywhere BUT the default location and then open it within your Outlook profile.<br />
2. Ignore any advice that tells you to use export or import to transfer an entire Outlook data file. That has never been sound advice, but the process has become too deeply flawed to be trusted.</p>
<p>Also, Outlook 2010 has a nice new option that lets you connect to a pre-existing data file when creating a new profile instead of having to jump through all the hoops of creating a new file, connecting to the pre-existing file, then disconnecting the new
 file.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the late reply. I understand that you wanted to open or save a zipped PDF attachments that you have received in your account. Here are the steps to download the said attachments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. On you inbox, view the message with attachments.</p>
<p>2. Click on the attached file.</p>
<p>3. You will be prompted if you want to open or save the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clicking Open, the file will be shown, make sure that you have a WinZip application installed on you computer to view the zipped files. Also, you need to have Adobe reader to view the files. If you click Save, the files will be saved on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also click the link Download as zip to open the attachments and follow the on-screen prompt. I hope I was able to help you. Get back to us if you have more questions or if you encountered an error message.</p>

</p><p>There is a possibility that the sports app that you have before is no longer compatible with the Windows 10 Mobile operating system which is why you can no longer install them in your Lumia 532. However, you can still use other sports apps that are available
 in the Store like the <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/msn-sports/9wzdncrfhvh4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="MSN Sports">MSN Sports</a></strong> app. Please use the keywords

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />There are several possible reasons why this issue is happening. To help resolve the issue, follow the steps below to check sound settings:
<br />
<br />Type Sound in the search box, then press Enter.
<br />Go to Sound tab.
<br />Scroll down and look for Notification bar, then click it.
<br />Select a sound available from the drop down list.
<br />Click Apply, then OK.
<br />
<br />Note: Make sure to enable sound effects using Outlook. Click this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/turn-sound-effects-on-or-off-in-outlook-e37d6cb4-5313-4d60-87fd-c4a7c2e4df59?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/turn-s...</a> to know how.
<br />
<br />Let me know if that helps.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards, 
<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Access - create a comment box&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am VERY new to Access. I have limited knowledge of Access capabilities. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a form set up and on that form is a button, when you click the button it will open up a subform that has a few sections, review date, follow-up etc., and a comment box. When I fill in the information in the comment box and close out it does not save
 any of the information. I would like it to save the information for that specific record associated with the click. I would also like the review date etc. to populate the main form in the locations that have the same labels. I hope that makes sense? Please
 let me know if you have any words of wisdom!</p>

            Does the fact that you are using two forms rather than one bound form imply that you are trying to associate multiple comments with each record in your main form?&nbsp; If so you need two related tables, one with columns for the attributes of the main table,
 the other with the attributes of the related comments table.&nbsp; The comments table will contain columns for the attributes of each comment record, along with a foreign key column which references the primary key of the main table, and a relationship should be
 created between the two tables, with referential integrity enforced.<br />
<br />
You are using the term 'subform' incorrectly here.&nbsp; A subform is a form which is embedded in a parent form, so in your case you could have a comments subform within your main form, linked to it by setting the LinkMasterFields and LinkChildFields properties
 to the primary and foreign key names respectively.&nbsp; Normally a subform will be in continuous forms view or datasheet view, but not necessarily so; it can be in single forms view.<br />
<br />
What you are describing are 'linked' forms, which is an alternative approach.&nbsp; In this scenario, to open the linked form to insert a new comment record the code for a button's Click event procedure would be along these lines:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm "frmComments",&nbsp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DataMode:=acFormAdd, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WindowMode:=acDialog, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OpenArgs:=Me.YourPrimaryKey<br />
<br />
where YourPrimaryKey is the name of the main form's table's primary key column.<br />
<br />
In the frmComments form's BeforeInsert event procedure, assign the value passed to the form as its OpenArgs property to the foreign key column like this:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(Me.OpenArgs) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.YourForeignKey = Me.OpenArgs<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
You'll find examples of the use of subforms and linked forms in FormsDemo.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file one option uses subforms on separate pages of a tab control, another option uses linked forms in dialogue mode as described above, while a third option uses linked forms in synchronized mode.<br />
<br />
However, I'm a little concerned by your statement <em>"I would also like the review date etc. to populate the main form in the locations that have the same labels."</em>&nbsp; This suggests that you might be storing data redundantly in more than one table.&nbsp; A fundamental
 mechanism of the database relational model is that of Normalization, which requires all non-key columns in a table to be functionally determined solely by the key of that table.&nbsp; For an introduction to Normalization, of which a good understanding is essential
 to anyone designing relational databases, see Normalization.zip in my same OneDrive folder.&nbsp; You might also like to take a look at DatabaseBasics.zip, which is a simple introduction to some of the main principles and methodologies involved in the design of
 relational databases.<br />

=====================================<br />
Just as an experiment....copy the following photo to <br />
your desktop and insert it in a publisher publication.<br />
Let us know if it looks blurry also.<br />

I just thought of a setting that might be worth checking...<br />
