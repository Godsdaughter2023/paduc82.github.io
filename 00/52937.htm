Games for Windows Software V3.5 has been downloaded and installed 3 times before I caught it. Why isn't it recognizing that it has already been installed?

<p>You seem to be having a&nbsp;few problems with your Computer.</p>
<p>I have noticed a couple of your posts</p>
<p>And no, System Restore does not affect Data, according to Microsoft.</p>
<p>But, Data backup should always be part of your plans. You never know!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>First thing to try is a System Restore to before the problem:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do System Restore in Safe Mode, if unable to do it in Normal Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try tapping F8 at startup, and from the&nbsp;list of startup selections, select Safe Mode by using UP Arrow Key to go there &gt; then&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />
<br />
Click Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; System Restore &gt; pick a different time &gt; Next &gt; etc</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>If the above does not fix the problem, follow these steps to improve performance and resolve the issues:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Go to your&nbsp;Laptop/Computer Manufacturer's website &gt; Drivers and Downloads Section &gt; Key in your Model number &gt; Look for latest Vista Drivers
 for it &gt; Download/install them.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/83ec0ffe-ee04-4d53-8b87-25d1f05c954e1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/83ec0ffe-ee04-4d53-8b87-25d1f05c954e1033.mspx</a></span></p>
<p><span>“<strong><span>Optimise Windows for better Performance”</span></strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/1264bc24-72a8-48aa-84e3-a355327139d91033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/1264bc24-72a8-48aa-84e3-a355327139d91033.mspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>“<strong><span>Delete files using Disk Cleanup”</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>The More Options tab is available when you choose to clean files from all users on the computer. This tab includes two additional ways to free even more disk space:</span></p>
<p><span>Programs and Features: Uninstall unwanted Programs.</span></p>
<p><span>System restore and Shadow Copies: Delete all but the most recent Restore Point</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;Above is what
 you should do as part of normal Computer maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;full scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the<strong><span>Scan</span></strong>
 button to start scanning your computer<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.</span><span><br />
<br />
6</span><span>.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span><span><br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Run the Vista System File Checker Tool:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2231/vista_run_system_file_checker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2231/vista_run_system_file_checker/</a><br />
<br />
<br />
</span><span>1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>“How to analyze the log file entries that the Microsoft Windows Resource Checker (SFC.exe) program generates in Windows Vista”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
If SFC finds serious errors it can not fix, you may have to do a Vista&nbsp;Repair Upgrade Install.<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;you do not have a Microsoft Vista DVD, borrow one from a friend.<br />

<p>1. What if for the System Restore, I have no exact date when it happened. It has been doing this for a while, just I was unable to fix it because I had no time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.I don't think I have a vista CD, if I did find one I think it would be an older version, does that matter?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Would it work if I did a backup of my computer at the current time, then restored it to a few months back and then added my new files from the backup onto the old system? how would I do that?</p>

What is System Restore?
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Restore helps you restore your computer's system files to an earlier point in time. It's a way to undo system changes to your computer without affecting your personal files, such as e‑mail, documents, or photos.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>1. You must have some idea when this started.</p>
<p>You can go back &gt; undo the Restore if wrong &gt; then go back Further</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>2. Borrow a Vista DVD.</p>
<p>If older disk,&nbsp;the information re SPs&nbsp;is in the link&nbsp;I already gave you.</p>

<p>Hi Teejay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The error code 0xC004F074 occurs when <span>you entered a product key for the Enterprise edition of Windows to activate<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><span><span>Windows&nbsp;10</span></span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Home
 or<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><span><span>Windows&nbsp;10</span></span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Pro.</span>
 To address this concern, you'll need to secure a copy of your Windows 10 product key. Since you mentioned that Windows 10 Pro came pre-installed on your device, we suggest that you contact the store where you purchase your computer since they have a copy of
 your Windows product key. Once you already have the product key for your Windows 10 Pro, type Activation using Search and then choose Activation on the search results. Click on Change product key and then enter the product key for your Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/94a39d70-a5de-4dd5-8bfb-6038cc32358c" title="דניאלמ">
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community. We understand that you are concerned about the slow restart time and fast shut down/turn on time. Before we discuss about anything, we want to share an information with you. The Windows
 8 and above versions support "Fast Startup" feature, which helps the system to turn on quickly by resuming the system from "hibernate" state. When this option is enabled, the system doesn't really&nbsp;shut down when you press&nbsp;Shutdown, but goes to hibernate, if
 supported. The "Fast Start-up" option is enabled by default in the system and the user can opt-out this feature anytime.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Anyway, to access this feature, go to Charms by pressing
<strong>Windows+C</strong>, and type <strong>Change what power buttons do</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click/Tap on that,&nbsp;which will pop-up a window, where you should tap/click on
<strong>Change settings that are currently unavailable</strong>. Scroll down and under
<strong>Shutdown settings</strong>, <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">uncheck</span></em>
<strong>Turn on fast startup (recommended)</strong> and press <strong>Save changes</strong>.<br />
<br />
Now, you've successfully turned off the Fast startup and your PC will shutdown completely when you'll intend to shut it down. The faster turn on time&nbsp;is actually&nbsp;there as your PC never turns off completely. Let us know what you experienced. Hope this helps,<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you describe is normal... As mentioned, there is a new feature in Windows called Fast Startup that makes this happen... Not the one in your BIOS...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It uses a shutdown process that works a bit like hibernation, and keeps a lot of your settings, drivers and stuff loaded... When you power back on the machine starts quickly as a result...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you do a Restart this feature doesn't function, so everything has to reload from scratch...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that you have an issue that makes your Restart longer than it should be...</p>
<p>It is normal for a Shutdown\Power On to boot 2-3 times faster than a Restart..</p>

<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Disabling the Fast Startup will not help your system to restart faster. What we tried to point out is that the faster shutdown/turn on process is available only when "Fast startup" in enabled in the Power Options. To be precise,
 restart time&nbsp;is not dependent on this particular feature. We have only provided the information why your PC shuts down so quickly. Hope this helps,<br />

<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could be due to an internal conflict in the system which could be caused by a corrupted file or an issue with the hardware itself. To isolate the issue, please provide the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Aside from the error message, are you receiving any error codes as well?</li><li>Have you made any recent changes prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For starters, we suggest checking this support article as initial troubleshooting in resolving the issue:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/14238/windows-10-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot blue screen errors</a></strong>. The support article will walk you through the process of addressing the
 issue.</p>

<p>the most recent crash (which happened about 20 minutes ago today while having just Google Chrome and Discord open) produced this error code:&nbsp;0x7F (0x8, 0xFFFFCB8028349FF0, 0xFFF784875F645678, 0xFFFFF809681686FF) with the error messaged "UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP"</p>
<p>I got this code from the WhoCrashed program.</p>
<p>I did not note any of the other codes, but I have included the link to other minidumps in my original post.</p>
<p>I did not make any recent changes other than the clean install of Nvidia drivers, but the issue existed even before this.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the delayed reply.<br />
Thanks for the answer, appreciate it, but, the first solution works for some apps only, and the second one, when&nbsp;I hit enter, windows says it can't find "<strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">servicecs.msc"</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.<br />
<br />
But, recently I found another solution, that worked for me:<br />
I had to go to <strong>Control Panel - System and Security - Security and Maintenance - (in the left part of the screen)
</strong><strong>Change User Account Control settings - and brought the slider down to "Never notify"<br />
<br />
</strong>I know that this isn't the safest solution, but it's the only one that worked for me,&nbsp;I had to spend some days searching for it, because I couldn't find anything on the internet.<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for the help, and sorry for the delayed answer.<br />

            <p>Make sure you installed all your certificates correctly.&nbsp; I found you can just right-click each downloaded certificate, click "install certificate" and let the wizard automatically select the correct location based on the certificate.&nbsp; Much faster and easier
 than clicking inside each of the files you downloaded per the PKI instructions.</p>

<h2>            Vectorworks on surface pro.</h2>
                    Vectorworks 2013 worked when I first installed it on my Surface Pro but eventually failed to start up I finally stripped the Computer back to Factory srttings and reloaded Vectorworks which worked up until Windows inevitably updated itself and the problem
 reappeared. No one at Nemetzchek can figure this out and have declared that VW won't necessarily work on a machine that hasn't been tested by them. Unquestionably, the graphics system on the surface Pro is substandard for the Program but I would expect that
 to only slow me down as it has in previous computers with the Intel on board graphics.Has anyone fixed this? Its ability to run Vectorworks was the reason I bought the Surface PRO.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
ps. I loaded VW2011 but got the same result<br />

            Roll back the video driver to the one that was first released with the PRO, I believe the date is from Nov. 2012 &amp; off hand I cannot tell you version number (look at some posts here for it), and then stop windows from automatically updating the driver
 to the current ones... all will be fine.

<br />
<br />In their wisdom MS decided not to include a DVD player in Windows 10 so they could sell one I would not buy. 
<br />
<br />There are good free alternatives here, of which VLC is the best choice:    <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/how-to-play-dvds-in-windows-10-for-free.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/...</a>

The UI is very poor coming from a software developer like Microsoft, the questionair is full of questions that are completely subjective but yet have only one right answer, (ie. yes in my opinion the enforcement team is extremely annoying) and even though your supposed to be told why you have an enforcement action their reasoning is either so vague it could pertain to anything or not pertain to your situation at all. Microsoft really needs to rethink this whole system and get fire the current enforcement team for negligence if their even played employees at all. To me it seems more like the same structure as the YouTube Heroes system that everyone was against. There is literally no fair way to debate your enforcement action and I have yet to hear of anyone actually getting an appeal on their enforcement even when they have do

 </blockquote> <p>suspensions for nothing absolutely happen all the time and are upheld because no one on the enforcement team actually take the time to review the cases.

            Yeah, i got reported today for reporting someone for holding our game hostage and never letting it end and body blocking. But he also reported me for asking why he was trolling and then im banned and he isnt. After talking to three separate reps via chat
 and call , they just say “you must have done something” was a response. The real customer service team faults me for not having a real solution. Its so backwards how they loop you until you give up trying.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 Update stuck at 100&#37; Updating for 26 hours so far&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I know I'm amoung thousands of other people dealing with this problem, and EVERYONE agrees that Microsoft needs to deal with this. &nbsp;There is literally no information helping people who's otherwise fine computers are being RUINED BY MICROSOFT WINDOWS 10 UPDATES!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer began installing an automatic update, and it's now been 16 hours and is not complete.</p>
<p>It is stuck on a black screen that says "Updating your system (100%)" and the circle of dots continuously spins in a circle.</p>
<p>I'm concerned that others who have turned off their computer at this point never got it working correctly again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer was perfectly fine before this update began.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help from anyone who has actually fixed this is appreciated. &nbsp;And if anyone from Microsoft actually reads these boards, many people are abandoning your products because this is exasperating. &nbsp;If my computer is ruined and all my work is lost, I will be
 reaching out to the thousands of others in this community about filing a class action suit for the computers and irreplacable we've lost while no one addresses this ongoing issue.</p>

            Hi Sharon, since it has been so long (26 hours), honestly you are going to have to bite the bullet, you do not have a choice, you will have to hard boot your PC . .. 
<br />
<br />Press and hold the Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down
<br />
<br />Wait a minute or two and start it up again . . 
<br />
<br />If you do actually have issues after the hard boot:
<br />
<br />You can try rolling back to 1709, but honestly your best and probably only option is to reset Windows 10, while keeping your files and apps . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, 
<br />Then start the Reset

<h3> mikevan80  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer won&#39;t restart after updates in Windows 10, stalls at rotating circle of dots</h2>
                    <p>I have a 5 year old Dell desktop PC. &nbsp;All the drivers are up to date. &nbsp;It was originally running Windows 8.1 and updated to Windows 10 over a year ago. &nbsp;All updates have been installed since then. &nbsp;This restart problem started after I installed the Windows
 10 Anniversary Update.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Since Windows 10 only does automatic updates it also TRIES to restart after the updates are complete. &nbsp;It shows the Dell logo and will stall at the Windows rotating circle of dots screen, with the circle of dots running in the center bottom of the black screen,
 there is no disk drive activity except an occasional brief flash of the drive light. It will stay there for hours. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
In frustration I pushed and held the physical power button, in violation of all warnings, since I couldn't access the Windows/Start virtual power button, wait about 30 seconds and power up again. Sometimes I have to repeat the sequence (off-wait-on) three or
 four times in a row but eventually it boots normally and presents the Windows log-on screen. &nbsp;I get sweaty palms every time I see an update thinking that one of these times it is going to die.<br />
<br />
No error codes. High speed wired versus wireless Internet connection, running Norton Antivirus, plenty of physical memory.<br />
<br />
The PC has a 300 GB disk that is less than half full, all packaged or downloaded standard software, nothing out of the ordinary, no modifications, no viruses, no warnings. In between updates the computer runs normally, boots and shutdowns OK. &nbsp;I have tried
 to manually restart and the same thing happens – stalls at the dreaded rotating circle of dots.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Version 1607 build 14393.1198</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get it to restart after an update? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated....</p>

            Hi Mike,<br />
<br />
After an update it usually takes 20 minutes, depending on the size of the update for it to be applied to your computer. When you see the rotating dots on the screen, it means that it's backing up all your files so it's best for us not to interrupt it. We really
 need to wait for it to finish, once it's done backing up your files it will restart automatically.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further help with any windows issue.

<p>Has not solved the issue. Even waiting an hour, nothing changed. Restore points dont work, maybe only windows reset will, but don't want to do that unless an absolute last resort</p>

<p>I have let the computer sit overnight - 8+ hours - after the update has tried to restart and stalled and the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">rotating circle of dots is still there unchanged the next morning. &nbsp;I don't think it is a matter
 of waiting - I watch/listen to the hard drive and initially it churns and seems to be busy. &nbsp;When it stops I do the off-wait-on cycle (sometimes 3 or 4 times) which has worked every time so far. &nbsp;When Windows is running normally I manually select Restart from
 the Start menu, even though there is no update in progress or pending, it also stalls in the same manner. &nbsp;</span></p>

</p><blockquote>Hi Mike,<br />
<br />
After an update it usually takes 20 minutes, depending on the size of the update for it to be applied to your computer. When you see the rotating dots on the screen, it means that it's backing up all your files so it's best for us not to interrupt it. We really
 need to wait for it to finish, once it's done backing up your files it will restart automatically.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further help with any windows issue. </blockquote>
<p>I have let the computer sit overnight - 8+ hours - after the update has tried to restart and stalled and the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">rotating circle of dots is still there unchanged the next morning. &nbsp;I don't think it is a matter
 of waiting - I watch/listen to the hard drive and initially it churns and seems to be busy. &nbsp;When it stops I do the off-wait-on cycle (sometimes 3 or 4 times) which has worked every time so far. &nbsp;When Windows is running normally I manually select Restart from
 the Start menu, even though there is no update in progress or pending, it also stalls in the same manner. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The computer will Shutdown with no fault and power up using the manual power button every day.</span></p>

<p>Can you tell me when you're doing the hard power off? Are you waiting on the circle black screen for a certain amount of time before powering off?</p>

            After an update has occured I wait until the disk activity stops while it is holding on the black screen with the rotating dots, usually 5 to 10 minutes, then wait again usually 5 minutes then push and hold the power button, it powers down, wait 30 seconds
 and push the power button to power up. Most times that doesn't work the first time so I repeat the above cycle sometimes 3 or 4 times. Eventually it reboots normally passing the rotating circle of dots rather quickly and presents the windows log on screen.&nbsp;

<p>I couldn't get passed that at all.</p>
<p>I ended up doing a Windows Reset, while keeping all my files and data. Yeah it reinstalls Windows and deletes third party software, but big deal. After that the update installed fine and the computer is a bit less bloated now.</p>

<h2>            Audio Service not running - troubleshooting gives error 0x80070002</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer wasn't starting up, it seemed to be stuck on the BIOS screen. I used the Setup to disable drives etc and finally got my windows 10 to load normally. However when it came on, I noticed the sound icon in the system tray had an x against it. "Audio
 Service not running". I tried to run the troubleshooter by clicking on the system tray icon and got the following message -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Package ID: AudioPlaybackDiagnostic</p>
<p>Path: C:\WINDOWS\Diagnostic\Index\AudioPlaybackDiagnostic.xml</p>
<p>Error Code: 0x80070002</p>
<p>Source: Engine<br />
Context: Elevated</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried going into Device Manager, updating the drivers for the audio and it found that I had the latest drivers already installed. I deleted both items under audio (uninstalled, actually) and rebooted so that Windows again configures my audio devices but
 still had the problem with the sound not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Settings -&gt; Update &amp; Security -&gt; Troubleshoot</p>
<p>and using it on Audio gives the same problem.</p>
<p>When I try it on Windows Update, it also gives the same error code (Package ID: WindowsUpdateDiagnostic).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to boot into Safe Mode, and still saw the red x for Audio Service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check running Services, the Windows Audio service is setup as automatic, however it is not running currently. When I try to start the service, it says Error 0x80070005 Access is denied.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In reading up on the problem, on some thread I saw about running sfc /scannow after running DISM in an elevated command prompt window. I tried that but the DISM command also stopped at 67% (or so) with error 4448. So, I never ran sfc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Home with the October 2018 Feature update installed (it installed in January).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate some help in fixing my problems.</span></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Hi ikkh.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />1) For sound problems first try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-restore-default-services-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-resto...</a> 
<br />
<br />3) Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />  
<br />7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />10) If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            If it is a local password &amp; not a MS passowrd, then did you set any other logging methods like pin, picture password? if not, then I'm afraid you need to take your pc to its manufacturer and have them unlock it for you or you need to hack into it yourself,
 take a backup immediately and do a reinstall if possible

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>How do you log on to your computer? Have you connected it with your Microsoft Account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, you can reset your Microsoft Account password at <a href="https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx</a>&nbsp;and it should reset your Windows password as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using a local account, you will have to use a third-party password cracking tool. You may also be able to restore the default Administrator account and reset the password from there (not sure how this works in Windows 8, though). &lt;removed &gt;</p>

<p>Hi brlieite whenever you get into a matchmaking game it will generally tell you what your NAT type is in the lower right corner ( I think) if it turns out you have a strict or moderate NAT then this can cause issues for matchmaking and for trying to join
 friends, if you need to know how to open your NAT then use this solution here <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-live/connecting/nat-type-strict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../nat-type-strict</a> and this will guide you through the process.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Godmonkee</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>p.s it will also tell you your NAT type when you do a connection test, if it comes up with NAT TYPE ERROR then you have a moderate to strict NAT and again you can use the guide posted above to help solve the issue.</p>

<p>Hi Godmonkee, </p>
<p>I was getting the nat type error sometimes when doing the connection test. So I followed the guide and the fixed it by the "UPnP" method. &nbsp;Now i have a no warning more when I do the connection test, and in the options section of Halo 4 shows that my Nat
 is open (green).</p>
<p>Even so sometimes I can't connect to spartan ops. It shows only 150-350 players in each game in my region (my IP is from Brazil).... maybe that is another problem....</p>
<p>In the wargames matchmaking shows alot of players... and i have no problem connecting to this game mode.</p>

<p>Spartan Ops matchmaking is usually a very lowly populated gametype on Halo 4. Due to the increased length of missions, even if you are searching for a player, they all simply might be in game. There's nothing much you can do other than being patient, unless
 it is a problem on your end with bandwidth/internet.</p>

                    After resfreshing WIndows 8 on &nbsp;my PC, I was checking email on Ouutlook.com for a friend when I started the Photos app and tried to open the Skydrive folder. Since I wasn't logged on to my account it found nothing. I realised the problem and logged in
 as my own account, but the Photos app still says it can't find any files on the Skydrive. Opening the Skydrive app itself shows there are pictures there, how do I get the Photos app to do a rescan of Skydrive?

            <p>&nbsp;Hi Derek,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
From your description I understand that when you open photo app it says can't find any files on the Skydrive.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Let’s start with few questions.<br />
1. What is the exact error code or error message?</div>
<div>2. Are you able to view the files in SkyDrive app?</div>
<div>3. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to his issue? </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            OK, the exact sequence of events was:
<div><br />
<div>1. PC accidentally switched off during updates. After reboot, several errors so decided to Refresh the PC.</div>
<div>2. After Refresh, I logged on to Outlook.com using my sister-in-law's Live ID because she wanted to show me an email message.</div>
<div>3. I switched to the Photos App to show her some pictures on my SkyDrive.</div>
<div>4. Because it had been refreshed, the Photos App scanned the SkyDrive for a few minutes. I had expected this.</div>
<div>5. Eventually it produced the message:</div>
<div><br />
<div>"SkyDrive 0 files</div>
<div><br />
<div>We couldn't find any photos in here</div>
<div><br />
<div>SkyDrive gives you free online storage for photos, videos and documents so you can acess them from anywhere.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Go to S<a href="http://skydrive.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">kyDrive.com</a>&nbsp;to get started. Any photos and videos you store there will be shown here"</div>
<div><br />
<div>6. I clicked the link, which took me to an empty SkyDrive page. I noticed that the ID was my sister-in-;aw's so logged out and logged in as myself.</div>
<div>7. I checked that all my photos were still there.</div>
<div>8. I reopened the Photos App and went to SkyDrive, which still showed the message as above.</div>
<div>9. Opened Photos App options, unticked SkyDrive. Closed app. Reopened it. Ticked SKyDrive. Same message.</div>
<div>10. Checked SkyDrive App could see the same as the SkyDrive web page. It can. It will also display pictures although, presumably, it's not using the Photos App to display them.</div>
<div>11. Check SkyDrive desktop (file explorer) could also see the same files.</div>
<div>12. Checked Photos App. Still displays same message as above.</div>
<div>13. Seached for a 'refresh' or 'rescan' command to Photos App. There doesn't seem to be one.</div>
<div>14. Tried restarting. No change.</div>
<div>15. Tried shutting down (overnight). At reboot, got OS selection page so assume this has been a full reboot. Still get message as above.</div>
<div>16. Tried your steps in Method 1. Troubleshooter found some 'security settings' needed changing and requested a restart. Still get the same message.</div>
<div>17. Checked options again, SkyDrive is still ticked.</div>
<div>18. Followed part of method 2. Update check found another app (Live TV) had an update available, but not Photos App.</div>
<div>19. License sync executued. Photos App still displays the same message.</div>
<div>20. I have&nbsp;<b>not</b>&nbsp;tried uninstailling the Photos App as it doesn't appear in a search of the App Store and I'm not sure how to reinstall it.</div>
<div>21. I assume this counts as 'contacting the app publisher'! :-)</div>
<div><br />
<div>To answer your three questions.</div>
<div>1. The message is as above, i.e. Photos App claims SkyDrive contains 0 files.</div>
<div>2. All my files can be viewed in the SkyDrive App, the SkyDrive desktop folder and on the SkyDrive web page.</div>
<div>3. The PC was refreshed and I opened the Photos App for the first time while logged in with someone else's Live ID.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As a further test, I tried logging in the SkyDrive web page as my sister-in-law and uploading a picture then logging out. It does&nbsp;<b>not</b>&nbsp;appear in the Photos App. Also attempting to search while SkyDrive is open (displaying above message) in the Photos
 App produces the message "Can't search SkyDrive. Try your local Pictures Library". I also checked that the same message appears if I am logged in to my sister-in-law's SkyDrive web page. Obviously, the back-arrow goes back to the "SkyDrive 0 files..." message.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Basically, I need a way to either refresh/rescan my SkyDrive from the Photos App or to reset it back to first time use, so it will rescan automatically. I'd rather not have to do another PC Refresh as reinstalling the various desktop tools takes over 2
 days! Is there a registry setting for the Photos App to reset it? Or can it be uninstalled and reinstalled (and would this fix it)?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards</div>
<div><br />
<div>Derek.</div>

            OK. I found the Photos App in the App Store so uninstalled and reinstalled it. This caused a rescan when I opened SkyDrive from the Photos App.
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, it hasn't made any difference and I still get the "SkyDrive 0 files ..." message!</div>

            The pictures are all, or at least mostly, JPEG files. They are located in sub-folders below the Pictures folder, e.g. Pctures/photos_by_date/2012/06/20120603_1023.jpg.
<div><br />
<div>If I open the desktop SkyDrive, right click a picture file and use Open With and click the Photos app, then the picture is displayed in the Photos app. So the problem isn't with the format of the file or whether the Photos app can access it. It seems to
 be simply that the app won't scan the SkyDrive folder and build a catalog (or whatever the index of thumbnails is called).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Presumably there is supposed to be some event to cause the SkyDrive rescan to start, as otherwise it wouldn't notice when pictures were added, but, at the moment, my copy seems to have decided there's "0 files" and it's not going to look again!</div>
<div><br />
<div>My thought is that there's some registry setting, config file or whatever which is corrupt and removing/installing the app or refreshing the PC isn't clearing it so he situation doesn't get changed.&nbsp;</div>

            FYI, I just tried another remove/install on the Photos App. This caused a rescan on the SkyDrive, byut after a few minutes it still comes back saying there are 0 files. In fact, there are over 10,900 files below the Pictures folder on my SkyDrive.
<div><br />
<div>Perhaps the problem is that there are simply too many files for it scan so it times out before it's finished?</div>

            I tried putting a single Jpeg in the Pictures folder and doing a remove/install of Photos to force a rescan. After a couple of minutes, I got the usual "SkyDrive 0 files ..." message.
<div><br />
<div>Obviously, I don't want to move the Pictures/photos_by_date folder as there's about 12Gb of data there and it would take ages to resynchronize (as well as being a complete wast of bandwidth!).</div>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.
</span><span>I will certainly help you with the issue that you are facing. I would like to ask you:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>When was the last time it was working fine?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Do you remember making any software or hardware changes prior to this issue?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Is there any error message on the Blue Screen? If so, what is it?</span></span></li><li><span><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The issue that you are facing might be due to driver crash, as you are getting errors for Intel graphic driver. Try the following method and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1:
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1: Try
<strong>Safe Mode</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Safe mode is the configuration of Windows, when it is running on only basic set of drivers and all the startups are disabled. To
 know more about safe mode, follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue is resolved in safe mode, follow step 2 after restarting the computer in regular mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 2:
<strong>Clean Boot</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps
 eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To know more, follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><em><span><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>’.</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: Update the drivers</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>To update the drivers, you may refer to the link below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Automatically-get-recommended-drivers-and-updates-for-your-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Automatically-get-recommended-drivers-and-updates-for-your-hardware</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persists, I would recommend you to visit the computer manufacturer’s support website and download the compatible
 drivers for your system.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may also download Intel drivers from the support website of Intel.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/detect?_ga=1.256004361.321987948.1435559767" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/detect?_ga=1.256004361.321987948.1435559767</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 3: Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted
 files. It will scan your system files and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope the information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance with Windows related issues</span><span>, we’ll be
 glad to assist you.</span></span></p>

<p><span>I bought SSFIV yesterday on Steam and I can't play it online. Offline works perfectly fine. When I try to go online, it says:"Online interaction is not available with the current gamer profile." It happens after I login at GFWL with my Steam profile,
 which apparently only requires clicking your username. I tried making a seperate GWFL account and I can login at the Games For Windows Marketplace, but not at SSFIV. It just says:"Invalid username or password, please try again." The product key is no problem.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Does anyone know how to fix this? I have been googling for hours and posting on forums.</span></p>

<p>Umh that can happen if your Windows LIVE ID is not activated, also you can't use your Steam profile to play on the XBOX LIVE Servers, as far I know,
</p>
<p>So also I saw you to tried to use your Windows LIVE ID but you couldn't connect, so I suggest you go and ask support in the Steam Forums because there's where you downloaded the game so the problem is more from them than our.</p>

            You can only "scan to" an email client.&nbsp; Since Outlook mail is browser based and not a true email client you cant.

            Folders on external drives turning into shortcuts is a common indicator of malware. Scan the drives (and your PC) with
<a href="http://support.kaspersky.com/viruses/kvrt2015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KVRT</a>, MalwareBytes etc.<br />
