<h2>            submit idea</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not getting the forum to place my idea in front of microsoft, even don't know weather this is the right way to write to such a big esteemed organisation like microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am basically a masters in manufacturing from BITS pilani (2014) and primarily a mechanical engineer from pune university (2009), currently working in an automobile technical center in Hyderabad. I am using microsoft windows since teenage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we are habituated to WINDOWS OP &amp; is very easy to work with, i would like to give my idea in user's perspective. We all are working on destops &amp; laptops daily for at least 6 hours in office on week days. And sometimes on weekends too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since all the people are using MS office on regular basis, the command COPY (ctrl +C) &amp; command PASTE (ctrl + V) is frequently used in all cases. if we calculate the the frequency of using these keys by single user daily on each desktop, then it will be
 huge numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My idea is to propose one single button for the combination of COPY command &amp; one single button for PASTE command incorporated in keyboard. only you have to select the new location of paste by mouse. This will be helpful for so many users &amp; reduces the user
 fatigue. Sometimes some people may feel little difficult to press two buttons by only one hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I expect microsoft to think on it &amp; revert back on this topic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Awaited reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shekhar</p>

            <p>Thanks very much for taking the time to reply guys. its much appreciated. (love the&nbsp;bird in your&nbsp;avatar Mike H :) )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a go at implementing both your suggestions but no luck I'm afraid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With reference to the image I attached, look at the first set of yellow cells looking from left to right, there's 5 of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically what I need is this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u><strong>If the user&nbsp;selects "YES" in&nbsp;any of these 5 cells, then cell O10 will display "YES".</strong></u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm guessing its this part of the formula&nbsp;which is causing me a problem:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>=IF(AND($C$10="YES",OR(AND($C$12="YES",$C$16="YES",$C$18="YES",$C$24="YES")),</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But this part of the formula works perfectly:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>AND($F$10="YES")+($F$18="YES")=1,COUNTIF($I$10:$I$32,"YES")),"YES","NO")</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apologies if this seems confusing, but I don't know how else to express it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Cal</p>

<p>OK, Those 5 cells are C10, C12, C16, C18 &amp; C24</p>

<p>This formula in O10&nbsp;will display YES if any of those have a YES in.</p>

            Hi Cal,<br />
<br />
As Mike and Bernard already mentioned, your question is not 100% clear about the conditions, so following is just another interpreatation:<br />
<br />
1) If any of the cells C10, C12, C14,&nbsp; ... contains a "Yes", consider it as TRUE, multiple "Yes" values are allowed.<br />
<br />
2) F10 OR F18 must be "Yes", not both. You don't specify a condition if both cells are empty. I consider this situation as FALSE. Not clear if both must be filled in.<br />
<br />
3) One or more cells containing "Yes".<br />
<br />
<br />
=SUMPRODUCT(--(C10:C32="Yes")*(MOD(ROW(C10:C32),2)=0)*--OR(F10&amp;F18="YesNo",F10&amp;F18="NoYes")*--(COUNTIF(I10:I32,"Yes")&gt;=1))&gt;=1<br />
<br />
Maybe a bit of explanation cloud help to understand my approach:<br />
<br />
1) As in "1)", one or more cells on even rows in the range C10:C32 must contain&nbsp; "Yes"<br />
(C10:C32="Yes") <br />
<br />
to avoid counting a "Yes" in uneven rows: (MOD(ROW(C10:C324),2)=0)<br />
<br />
2) Or F10 or F18 must contain "Yes": OR(F10&amp;F18="YesNo",F10&amp;F18="NoYes")<br />
<br />
Maybe you have to modify this part!<br />
<br />
3) A "Yes" in I10:I32<br />
<br />
--(COUNTIF(I10:I32,"Yes")&gt;=1)<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Snigdha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>May we know why you would like to get&nbsp; raw sensor data?&nbsp; Normally, if these parts need replacement or have been deemed faulty, then you would need to bring it to the nearest Microsoft Store so they can process a replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Replacement would however be dependent on the part availability of the unit.</p>

<h2>            Formula to assign number value if cell is blank&#47;not blank</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to develop a scoring matrix whereby I could assign scores if a cell is blank or not blank.&nbsp; For example, if CB2 is blank arrive a score of 0.&nbsp; If not blank, arrive a score of 5.&nbsp; I've not found a formula to do this.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>
<p>I've currently set up IF formulas to at least get TRUE/FALSE values but it reads as FALSE unless I manually click inside the source cell which should automatically be reading as TRUE.</p>

    <title>document too big in single page view - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> laurencewithau  say:</h3>
<h2>            document too big in single page view</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have Word 2007 and Windows 7.</p>
<p>When I open a document, as of yesterday, the single page is too big and the type is bigger than the size 12 in the display box at top left of screen.
</p>
<p>The sliding scale at bottom right of screen says 120%.</p>
<p>If I start to slide the pointer to the left, the view changes from single to double page, which is too much of a distraction.
</p>
<p>If, using the view button on the ribbon, I then click on 'one page', I get a single page but this time it's too small.
</p>
<p>this time the pointer says 73%.</p>
<p>If I slide it to the right I again get two pages. </p>
<p>How do I get 100% size single page, which is the way it used to be before yesterday?
</p>
<p>Thank for any help you can give,</p>
<p>Laurence</p>

            <p>Hi Suzanne S. Barnhill. </p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. For the moment I've settled for&nbsp; decreasing the size of the Windows pane until the view goes from two pages to one.</p>
<p>My method is to open the document, which opens in two pages each at 100% when only one is needed or wanted.
</p>
<p>I then click on the button next to the 'close' button at the top right of screen. The view then goes to one page at 100%.
</p>
<p>If necessary I drag the screen vertically. </p>
<p>The drawback is that the desktop can be seen at the sides of the pane.</p>
<p>But it's a lot better than the two-page view.</p>
<p>I'll try to learn how to use the macro, and then I'll come back with a progress report.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Laurence</p>

<h3> country folk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Internet Explorer 11 . Security Alert window keeps popping up saying &#34;The identity of this web site or the integrity of this connection cannot be verified.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I just reinstalled my Windows 7-64 bit operating system, McAfee Total Protection,&nbsp;and all updates over the past couple&nbsp;weeks&nbsp;but just now started getting a weird pop-up on yahoo.com's homepage of all places. I'm not even clicking&nbsp;anything on the yahoo page
 when&nbsp;a window keeps popping up saying "&nbsp;The identity of this web site or the integrity of this connection cannot be verified" Once this window pops up, I can't click anything else on the screen. When I try to close the pop-up, the same one keeps popping back
 up until there is 4 of them pasted over top of each other. &nbsp;I've tried searching for a solution but didn't come across anything that fixed the problem and it's tiring having to constantly try to close this window while clicking on the "mail" icon so I can
 get to my yahoo email!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, this definitely has been mentioned in at least one other thread going back as far as 2010 and in fact we have come&nbsp;across quite a few&nbsp;other posts/threads concerning this same or almost identical&nbsp;pop-up causing problems for them but according to
 the replies, nothing that has been suggested is solving the problem. Sure, some people had replied that a particular thing had solved it for them but like us there are still many who replied saying how it did&nbsp;nothing to solve this problem.... we tried installing
 and running the&nbsp; anti-malware software that people said had fixed the problem for them but that did nothing for us and others. We tried adding the website (in our case yahoo.com) to the allowed/trusted websites list but this did nothing as well.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can even search this issue by&nbsp;typing "*.btrll.com" who&nbsp;is one of the ones the certificate errors is issued to and you will find even more posts about this problem but still nothing from Microsoft on how to solve&nbsp;it.&nbsp;So for at least 7 years now this
 has been a problem but Microsoft has done nothing or very little to resolve this issue which is obviously a serious problem when this&nbsp;error is the type that pops up and dominates&nbsp;your screen where by not letting you click on anything and especially a serious
 problem when it won't let you click on your own icon for getting into your email account!!!</p>

            One suggestion made (not a solution, just a by-event bypass) is to press and hold the Alt key and press (may have to tap repeatedly) F4.&nbsp; That's worked for me on occasion.&nbsp; The only other way I've found around it is to open the Task Manager, highlight
 the task and click on "End Task", then consent to close the program.&nbsp; Then I avoid that website for at least the rest of the day.&nbsp; Not easy to do if it's something like your email account, however.&nbsp; By the way, when this "certificate" thing popped up on me
 most recently (yesterday, I believe), it was on a Yahoo news page.&nbsp; But it's also happened in other places as well.

<p>Thanks for the suggestions but neither of them did any good here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Pressing the alt and f4 key wouldn't remove the pop-up....the pop-up would only flicker each time it was tried.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Already tried the control alt delete to bring up task manager and force the pop-up to close but this only closes it momentarily and then the&nbsp;pop-up immediately comes right back up every time. Also tried task manager to close the whole webpage but&nbsp;the webpage
 will just close and then&nbsp; reopen with&nbsp;the pop-up coming right back up again.</p>

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When concerning these issues, just about anything is possible especially when there are enigmas like how&nbsp;anyone can go out and buy 3 identical computers and install the same operating system on each computer&nbsp;using&nbsp;the same installation disc and using the
 same steps/methods by which you install it but yet each computer's operating system installs differently where by resulting in having different&nbsp;default settings than the other computers that you installed it on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally have even tried this and confirmed what others were saying&nbsp;as well as not just resulting in having different default settings but having issues where by one of the computers (mine)&nbsp;would accept a particular Microsoft update and the other computer
 (my wife's)&nbsp;wouldn't accept&nbsp;the same update&nbsp;even though both computers were identical being the same manufacture, model, bought at the same time, had a totally fresh installation of the operating system and no settings/options having been&nbsp;changed/altered from
 how the installation disc put the operating system and settings on the computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, sorry we're not of much help as we're in the same situation as you and others where by&nbsp;no one's providing an actual solution to fix the problem, and so the main point has now turned into&nbsp;why hasn't/isn't Microsoft taking responsibility to fix or address
 this issue especially after having been over 7 years that this problem has been reported many times and on different sites including Microsoft.com!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: we just received a reply from yahoo concerning this issue and were told that they looked into it and couldn't find any errors on their behalf and to contact Microsoft for them to look into it.</p>

<p>Hi P-W --</p>

</p><p>It's entirely possible that it's not Yahoo's problem, since I've also had this on numerous other websites. Offhand, I'd say that it's MS's problem.&nbsp;And as usual, they shift the burden or responsibility on the consumer and the consumer's computer. Even though

<p>
</p><p>3. Repair Office app to refresh it. Detailed steps are provided on this <strong>

<p>Have you rebooted? </p>
<p>Do new messages work correctly if you open outlook in Safe mode? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've seen this behavior caused by resource issues (fixed by a reboot) and by antivirus scanners. It's also possible an update is the cause - rebooting might fix it. If all else fails, try system restore to go back to before the problem started.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that mail already downloaded will probably not be fixed. </p>

            If I understand correctly, what you want to do is basically use your phone as a USB WiFi adaptor?<br />
<br />
I'm afraid that feature is not built into Windows Phone, or into any other phone operating system as far as I know.

            Try removing the memory card and inserting it again. It may have been jarred loose. If the memory card still doesn't work, then I suspect that the card or the connector have been damaged.

<h2>            Windows 10  build 10565 still no dts or dd</h2>
                    Hello!<br />
<br />
I just updated to build 10565 to hopefully get surround support via optical out from my motherboard.<br />
Using MSI Z87 g45 gaming, I have in recent builds gotten 5.1 support when watching movies, not all movies with 6 channels output more than 2 channels to my receiver, but thats perhaps the same problem i have with games.<br />
I can't configure windows to encode 5.1 channels via optical but the test tone play on all speakers when i test both DTS and DD.<br />
<br />
All drivers are up to date, I am kinda stuck on this, some help would be great!<br />
<br />
Best regards,&nbsp;<br />
Bernhard Aaberg<br />

    <title>Do I need McAfee Security Scan Plus if I already have Windows Defender - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> audreychoden  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do I need McAfee Security Scan Plus if I already have Windows Defender Security Center to protect my pc &#63;</h2>
                    I have Windows Defender Security Center that contains McAfee Virus Scan and Firewall on my pc. I also have McAfee Security Scan Plus which came packaged with my pc when I bought it.&nbsp; I was told by someone who was fixing my computer that I do not need to
 have McAfee Scan Plus in addition to Windows Defender. The McAfee software is due for renewal, and I am thinking of not renewing if I already have necessary virus protection through Windows Security Defender. Do I still need the McAfee Security Windows Defender?

<h3> john ames_850  say:</h3>
<h2>            autocorrect uses a file name to complete my name. &#34;John&#34; becomes &#34;John Run&#34;</h2>
                    I set up my normal user account with the name "John Run" to distinguish it from the my admin account. Now, when I sign an email with my name, John, and enter a space, the auto correct adds "Run" to my name instead of my actual last name. How do I fix this?
 Word had my corrct name in the "author" entry, so this is not the source of the problem.

            <p>The solution to this problem&nbsp;is the “Building Blocks Organizer” in the “Quick Parts” of the “Text” group Of the “Insert” tab of Word. Thanks to DeanH for the clue that helped
 me find this obscure function in Word. I may even find a use for it. It is probably also necessary to save this change in your Word Template file. I did this and it seems to have fixed the problem.

<h2>            Total of a Calculated Field in Access Query</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm newer to Access, so this might be a simple answer: I'm trying to build a query that includes a calculated field:&nbsp;<strong>([price of an item] * [1 + tax%])</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>[price of an item]</strong>&nbsp;is a currency data type, and&nbsp;<strong>[tax%]</strong>&nbsp;is
 &nbsp;a number. Everything runs just as it's supposed to in the query, but when I try and add a totals row to the query,&nbsp;<span>it only gives me the options "None" or "Count" for that particular field if I try to format it as a currency.</span> If I don't try to
 format it as a currency, however, the option to sum it is there, but I would really like to have it in currency format.&nbsp;Why am I not able to sum it, as I'm able to do for the [price of an item] field (or other fields) that are in currency format?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I'm running Access 2013.</p>
<p />

</p><blockquote>However, I'm still a little uncertain of&nbsp;<em>why&nbsp;</em>the total button in a query will not give me the option to sum.</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure it’s the fact that you are formatting the value that limits the available aggregation operations.&nbsp; A formatted value is a string expression, so cannot be summed.&nbsp; If you interface with the data via a form or report, on the other hand, you
 can sum the expression without any formatting, and then apply the format to the result.</p>

            PS:&nbsp; It occurs to me that, if you are using this as the basis for an invoice, in my experience it is usual to compute sales tax or similar at the invoice level rather than at invoice line item level.&nbsp; Otherwise cumulative rounding errors can result.&nbsp; It
 might differ in your tax jurisdiction of course.<br />
<br />
You'll find an example of tax computation (VAT in this case) in both forms and reports in InvoicePDF.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file VAT per invoice is computed separately per group of items in the invoice, thus allowing for differential rates of VAT, and presented in the invoice as separate values for each group.&nbsp; This is normal invoicing practice in my experience
 and eliminates cumulative rounding errors within each group.<br />

<p>Try running with Excel with the /regserver switch. CLose Excel, then go to the Windows Start menu, choose Run, and enter</p>
<p>"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\Excel.exe"&nbsp; /regserver</p>
<p>Of course, change the folder path to the location on your machine where Excel is installed. The /regserver switch causes Excel to start and rewrite its registry keys, file associations, and other system related entities.</p>

    <title>Unable to sort favorites in Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to sort favorites in Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
I open multiple mailboxes using Outlook 2016. &nbsp;I "favorite" a number of these mailbox inboxes for quick and easy access. &nbsp;Despite being able to sort the favorite folders while in Outlook 2016, it does not maintain the sorted order. &nbsp;Outlook 2016 will only present
 the default order after closing/restarting the applications. &nbsp;Thus, I have to resort the favorites folder each time I start Outlook 2016. &nbsp;I understand this is a known issue, but it is a pain.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
This really makes the favorites folders not very useful if you cannot sort them in a preferred order.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(67, 81, 91, 1)">
Anyone have a workaround?</p>

            <p>I've had this issue too. Until yesterday (June 1 2016) ...I realize this is an old thread, but it was the first in the search list, so I'm spreading the wealth here lol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read a thread (yesterday morning, for my umpteenth search for a solution to this) where someone mentioned it might be due to mixing Exchange and MAPI enabled accounts. This hint gave me a (really
<em>the</em>) clue toward a solution (well, "solution" if you call two days without experiencing the problem a "solution" lol).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my situation I have two Exchange account, and several hotmail.com/live.com/outlook.com accounts. Along with two MAPI accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did after considering whether Exchange vs. MAPI was the heart of the issue was to delete every account Inbox from my Favorites list. (I was left with only Sent Items, my main Exchange account Unread Mail search, and the Clutter folder, in my Favorites).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then exited and restarted Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I added each Exchange (and hotmail.com/live.com/outlook.com) account Inbox back to Favorites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I exited and restarted Outlook 2016 each time I added an Inbox back to Favorites.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After each restart, the sort order was exactly the sequence I'd added the Inboxes back to Favorites in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last I added the two MAPI client account's Inboxes (one was a gmail,com account, and the other an inbox.com account ...yes, there is actually an "inbox.com" lol), again restarting after each addition to the Favorites list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every restart since has the Favorites list in the order I added the various account Inboxes back. No change. Repeated restarts. A couple of reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've probably restarted Outlook 2016 several dozen times, just to check if the Favorites sort order has changed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nope: the sequence has been consistent ...which hasn't been the case for almost two years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm pretty happy about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bad is that I'm afraid if I change the sequence (and I'd really <em>like</em> to have the Gmail Inbox the 2nd in sequence in the sort order ...but "oh well"), I'm going to end up with a hot mess again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for now, I'll just leave well enough alone (I don't feel like further testing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My "theory" is that the Favorites list somehow "checks" connectivity of available accounts in the Favorites list, and for whatever reason, if you put a MAPI account Inbox (or any folder, probably) "higher" in the Favorites list (sandwiched between Exchange
 type accounts), the sort sequence just ...crumbles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you end up with the hot mess that quite a few [orderly &amp; efficient] people (including
<em>moi</em>) are frustrated with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>...I'd add that I've tried about every "fix" to the problem I've come across during the past two years (the 2nd best was the "right click to open the main Inbox in Favorites in a new Window" trick), and nothing -
<em>absolutely nothing</em> - has kept the sort order sequence as consistently as this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently there's <em>some</em> issue with mixing MAPI and Exchange sequences when folders are added to the Favorites list that screws things up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dunno what it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But at least now, you can work-around the problem by putting Exchange accounts first (adding them in the sequence you want: it doesn't seem to matter if that's alphabetical or some other sequence priority ...whatever floats your boat, just put Exchange accounts
 first) and then adding the MAPI accounts (probably POP too: I don't prefer to use POP anymore so I can't say for sure).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then leaving the sort order alone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I suspect not changing the sort order is essential, but I haven't test it yet.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But - at least in my case - it's more important that the sort order is consistent than that my 2nd most used account (Gmail) is 2nd in sequence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just happy all the Inboxes stay in the same place in the list - <em>now</em> lol - when I exit Outlook and restart (and yes, even after a system reboot).</p>
<p>
</p><p>HTH.</p>

            <p><strong>@rboetger</strong> - I had this same problem in Outlook 2013, somewhen post-initial-release ...that's when it started. You'll see threads across the 'net from bewildered people from 2013 on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't have the issue in Outlook 2010, 2007, 2003 and earlier (I've been using Outlook a
<em>loooong</em> time lol).</p>
<p>
</p><p>...when the dull roar from crowd reaches crescendo proportions, Microsoft usually does fix stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem in this case with such an obscure issue is ...there's just not that many people comparitively who passionately care about things like this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a ton of end-users I support (I've been in IT since the '80s), and most of them don't have the faintest clue how useful the Favorites list can be (very few have asked about it, and those who
<em>have</em> asked were mostly puzzled about why they have "two Inboxes" in their Mailbox, sigh).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean, this drove <em>me</em> bonkers enough that I've spent hours &amp; hours (bordering on days over the past couple of years) searching &amp; tinkering. But I'm a tech-nerd - and I live and breathe Outlook almost: it's been necessary for my
<em>career</em> - and stuff like this <em>does</em> drive me nuts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>...my best guess is the guy on the Outlook team who could have pointed exactly what this problem was (and fixed it), retired sometime early in the 2013 release product cycle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really miss "that guy" LOL.</p>

                    <p>flash is such a mess... I'm trying to watch some movies on crackle. but watching them in IE is painful cuz the ad loading scheme they use snarfs major resources every 10 seconds resulting in frame rate drops. bleh\derp</p>
<p>
</p><p>and for reasons I cant seem to divine, wedge wont stream movies from crackle... only tv shows...</p>

            <p>thanks for the reply. yeah I thought about ad blockage but I cant ethically use&nbsp;that gear on a site&nbsp;like crackle.&nbsp;so I just wrote them a letter about poor web&nbsp;page design. : P&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>but I managed to "fix" my problem as well as I could. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using an old win7 sub admin account. so I deleted that and made a new win10&nbsp;native&nbsp;subad account. so for what ever voodoo&nbsp;reason,&nbsp;wedge&nbsp;loads up flash&nbsp;movies/tv shows just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I spent a few minutes checking&nbsp;for any disparity between wedge and other browsers.&nbsp;in this case I couldn't find any. the&nbsp;excessive ads cause problems for video quality on fox/krom/ie and so on. on an&nbsp;odd side note,&nbsp;wedge and ie interrupt frames where
 as fox and krom just&nbsp;drop res&nbsp;quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try not to spend much time on flash related problems, but I wasn't sure if there was something obvious I was missing. thanks again.</p>

    <title>Outlook colour categories not showing up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lewbartlett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook colour categories not showing up</h2>
                    <p>Hi I am having terrible problems with outlook and coloured categories. I have been using outlook from the office mac 2011 home and business addition on my iMac and make extensive use of the colour categories for my work calendar. &nbsp;I also access my calendar
 on my iPad and iPhone and this is where it just doesn't seem to be compatible. &nbsp;initially the calendar kept getting corrupted and duplicated and after much web trawling I found help and have now urned off the apple i-cal syncing and do not use it at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In trying to find a solution i have taken out a Microsoft exchange account with a new email and this works great on the iMac but on the iPhone and iPad i only get the light version when I log on regardless of which browser i Use. &nbsp; I see all the emails and
 calendar entries but it's only a lite version and no access to categories etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I signed up for the Microsoft 360 home 30 day trial being told that the Outlook web app would solve the problem but i still don't get any coloured category information just lists of entries. all the entries are there but no colour coding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when i downloaded the 360 version of outlook all the categories changed colours! and still only show up on the iMac. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No one wants to take responsibility or provide an answer. Apple care say that they cannot support Microsoft products such as outlook and tell me to ring Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft tell me they cannot support apple or outlook or office 360 because I am using a Microsoft exchange account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Microsoft exchange account provider 1 and 1 tell me it is a Microsoft/Apple issue!!! &nbsp; My email, syncing etc all work fine its just the format it gets displayed in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only solution I can see is if I buy a macbook as then I will be able to install the full version of outlook. it seems a bit extreme and an expensive option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help greatly appreciated. &nbsp;Im losing the will to live.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>AFAIK, color categories are locally for Outlook 2011 only. </p>
<p>Outlook 2011 is not the same as outlook web access or the mail app that you use in your mobile devices.

            <p>I’m afraid you cannot sync categories between Outlook for Mac and iOS devices. While each platform has the ability to “color” something, they don’t apply the color to the same items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>iOS devices apply color to <em><strong>calendars</strong></em>. They don't understand the concept of categories.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook for Mac allows you to apply a color to a category, which you can then apply to an&nbsp;<strong><em>event</em></strong>. However, you cannot apply a category to a calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be sure to let Microsoft know you'd like to see this feature in future versions by using the Help &gt; Send Feedback mechanism in any Office application. You should send feedback to Apple as well. Until they agree on how to apply categories/color, you
 will not be able to synchronize between your devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>Thank you for your help I found out after my posting that Msn office 2007 is not being supported since the advent of 2013 &amp; office 365. So last week I Upgraded to it &amp; so far so good.&nbsp; Once I got the 2013 up and running both my Outlook 2007 and also my Word
 2007 started working without error messages.&nbsp;&nbsp; If that can help others then I do think upgrading to 2013 is a very good option and if not 2010.&nbsp; The yearly costs of Office&nbsp; 365 is ok otherwise&nbsp; the consumer is looking at that much or more for each program.&nbsp;
