<h2>            Teams and .xlsm files</h2>
                    <p>I am working with my team on spreadsheet to track how our staff are doing with a particular certification.&nbsp; We used color to help show our teams progress.&nbsp; I was asked about making an equation to count by color.&nbsp; I was able to make a VBA module and got the
 equation to work however the macro doesn't appear to work in Teams or Excel Online.&nbsp; Ideas to help make this doable?</p>

<p>I have a dynamic named range called "Data" using the formula&nbsp;<strong>=OFFSET('Country Data'!XEY147,0,0,COUNTA('Country Data'!$A$1:$A$1000),COUNTA('Country Data'!$A$1:$P$1))</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to change the Data Source of my Pivot Table to use the range Data I get
<strong>Reference is not Valid</strong><strong> !</strong> and an OK box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need my range to be dynamic so that users can insert columns or add rows &amp; the data will be used in the pivot table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Office 2010 on a W10 pc. Users are on 2010 or 2013 on W7.</p>

</p><p>Remark: when you add one or more&nbsp;columns&nbsp;to the Data range, then refresh the pivot table, the new column(s) will be available, but they will not automatically be used in the pivot table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be better to restructure your data source like this:</p>
<p>

<td>67.89</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>...</td>

                    <p>This morning the Android devices are unable to login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This includes both tablets and phones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see from the Service Health board that there is an issue with iOS, but we are experiencing this with our non-iOS devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keeps prompting us to enter our password, and when entered it says "Error occurred". &nbsp; &nbsp;Some of my users have confirmed that their passwords are still valid as they are able to login through the web with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>ps is this the only way to report an issue? &nbsp;as an Enterprise customer, i would have expected a way to talk to customer support.</p>

            Hi Alan,<br />
<br />
I suggest you contact your admin to check the Autodiscover record to see if it is autodiscover.outlook.com.
<br />
Log in to the portal&gt; DOMAIN&gt; domain settings.<br />
If it is normal, I suggest you contact the in-app support. For the Outlook for Android issue, we have a dedicated channel where you can use the in-app support to report any issues regarding this app. You may also request bug fixes and submit feature requests
 via the in-app support.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c2ed4bb3-9137-4abe-a92e-d60a24fcaa7e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c2ed4bb3-9137-4abe-a92e-d60a24fcaa7e" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02f6d2c2-e8a9-4fcf-a348-7650e0e90eec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02f6d2c2-e8a9-4fcf-a348-7650e0e90eec" /></a><br />
* When using the in app support, please note the following:<br />
1. It can take a while for a representative to get back to the user. It is recommended that the user turn on notifications for Outlook in order to know when the technician is available.<br />
2. If you don’t have notifications turned on, then when the user opens the app again and goes to support, you will see a response from the technician.<br />
3. It is recommended that the user’s initial question be as fully descriptive as possible of the situation.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Andy <br />

            <p>I have been having the same issues as others. I launch IE11 in Windows 10 and the pages are blank and when refreshing the tabs nothing happens. if I type in an address again, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn't be using IE11 if it weren't for a couple of sites that seem to need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried turning it off, shutting down then back on and shutting down as well as all of the other suggestions.</p>

<p>
</p><p>There was a typo for step 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fix the typo and give it a fair try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, in an Administrator Command Prompt enter:</p>
<p>
</p><p>control.exe&nbsp; inetcpl.cpl,,6</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, others have found that having all updates installed is somehow not the same as having them properly applied, so you could try checking with IE's Help About, Update versions: link to first verify that it is going to a KB article about
 IE related modules you have to verify that they are what they should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To maximize your chances of being able to open IE you could try this way:</p>
<p>Run... (e.g. press Win-R and Enter after a Copy and Paste of the following line)</p>
<p>
</p><p>iexplore.exe&nbsp; -nohome&nbsp; -extoff</p>
<p>
</p><p>The immediate objective of that command is to have a window open and stay open.&nbsp; To do anything with it you may have to use Stop (e.g. press Alt-V p) to get out of its No Home state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case something that you are starting normally is interfering you should also try that command in a safe mode boot.&nbsp; Just safe mode would be sufficient for the test; e.g., you would not need Networking to verify that the window could stay open there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;you can't even open IE enough to get to its Help About here is a link to the latest update for Windows 10.&nbsp; Actually there is currently a bug in IE's Help About in W10 which doesn't give the correct URL, so you would need this hint&nbsp;anyway.&nbsp; Unfortunately
 the file information is now only available in a .csv download</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/9/F/19F9E46A-0B2A-4007-A280-F517DAB568EF/3093266.csv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/9/F/19F9E46A-0B2A-4007-A280-F517DAB568EF/3093266.csv</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can open that in Notepad or Excel if you have it.&nbsp; Note that even without IE running Windows Explorer and File Explorer will still have loaded some&nbsp;browsing related modules, so you can do the Loaded Modules check with or without IE even open.&nbsp; In fact,
 then you may find it more convenient to do it with Resource Monitor, pin all instances of explorer.exe and in the CPU tab's Associated modules pane sort by Version, then scroll to the group that starts with 11.0 and check those against the ones implied by
 the .csv file.</p>

<h2>            People stuck using Chrome because it has remembered their passwords and they can&#39;t.</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Listening to the PC Pro podcast the other day (I think it was ep 365).&nbsp; They read out a listener question:&nbsp; Given chrome has memory leak issues that I have noticed and you have complained about recently which browser should I be using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>They babbled on a bit about browsers for a while including joking about upgrading their computers to keep up with the growing demands of Chrome before the realised an interesting thing they all have in common.&nbsp; The all moved to Chrome when it came out as
 it was faster and lighter but now none of them can leave Chrome because it remembers all of their passwords and they can't remember them.&nbsp; They finished with a comment along the lines of - Good one Google you lured us all in and we can't leave.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just thought it was an interesting conclusion to a conversation and food for thought when trying to get people to switch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Personally I'm stuck with Firefox as it has the option not to load tabs until I click on them as I frequently have 100+ tabs open)</p>

<p>not if you have passwords saved for 100 websites...and I don't even know how or where to look chrome passwords up.<br />
but the thing about chrome is it eats to much processing power..</p>
<p>the thing about internet explorer is that it is always stuck and u can't scroll the website that is already loaded until it loads all the scripts and whatever stuff...</p>
<p>but Spartan is better though.</p>

<h2>            Internet Explorer is not responding</h2>
                    <p>My question started out about IE can not display webpage,&nbsp; that is the link I clicked on for help here so, I will try some of those.&nbsp; but I still have a couple questions regarding it.&nbsp; My webpage does display but, it says IE is not responding.&nbsp; it usually
 only does this on my game.&nbsp; which is zoo world 1, (highly animated.. jave 32 and 64 install because I have a 32 bit IE and a 64 bit pc.&nbsp; windows 7, all adobie up to date. I just got 2 new Javas also incase they were corrupt.&nbsp; My first question, I read on a
 post concerning this issue from another tech, told the person to try a program for tool bar remover. it was BHO.&nbsp; I was in Java.com and it showed I had IE11.&nbsp; and somewhere else on my pc showed I am using it but, when I click on about internet Explore for
 help, a window comes up telling me to download IE11.&nbsp; Also, I have read somewhere and cant remember where, that windows has detected I am not using a default browser.&nbsp; when I go to IE options the place that says make IE your default is not highlighted. so
 im assuming at some time I clicked on it to make IE10 my default.&nbsp; the checkbox below it says tell me when IE is not my default.&nbsp;&nbsp; My biggest concern here is how do I know for sure which IE I am using?&nbsp; should I just go ahead and download and use IE11.&nbsp; I
 thought IE11 was for mobile?&nbsp;&nbsp;is ok to use on my HP G60-635DX Notebook?&nbsp; Concerning IE is not responding.&nbsp;&nbsp; when I was reading about bad&nbsp; updates from Microsoft, one of them was this.&nbsp; an update from Microsoft issues are that sometimes when you are searching
 the web, the time it takes for your search to reach the server, the response time doesn't come back to your browser in a timely fashion as it is suppose to. (please don't quote me here, im just typing it as I remember what it said)&nbsp; could that be the reason
 why my IE in my browser says that the webpage you are viewing is not responding.) it doesn't close down, it just flashes like it is going to close down but, doesn't .&nbsp; I have treid disabling java and jave ssv2&nbsp; in my browser and that doesn't make any difference.&nbsp;
 I did read we can keep it disabled now because it isn't nessecary. is that true too?&nbsp; I relize I have several questions here so if you can only answer 1 please answer the one relating to why my webpage isn't responding in internet Explore.&nbsp; thank you.

</li><li>Kaspersky Pure 3.0.13.1.2.558 data bases release 3/28/14.&nbsp; 1 year subscription and has about 60 days left.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not using any other spyware.&nbsp; I recently installed Malewarebytes as suggested by I believe PA Bear from MS community.&nbsp; today I used adwcleaner
 as suggested by&nbsp; I think Hetti from MS community.&nbsp; No other third party firewall.&nbsp; Last time I was&nbsp; able to get into windows defender, i did disable the fire wall there but there was aplace I had been working from that said I had 2 firewalls running, I believe
 it said windows defender but that can not be because I KNOW I DISABLED IT.&nbsp; I can not get into windows defender to check anyway because it says when I do try that because group policies were changed, I can not get into windows defender to check fire wall status.&nbsp;
 Now, im not sure how group policies changed. I tried researching this so I can have some knowledge as to what that means and if I need to re change group policies but can not find and answer anywhere.</li><li>Norton came pre-installed and I used the free trial version.&nbsp; I bought another year of it when the trial expired.&nbsp; I then went on to use Kaspersky (before this Kaspersky) and I KNOW I uninstalled Norton before I installed Kaspersky,&nbsp; when that Kaspersky
 ran out, I installed McFee but as soon as I installed it, I uninstalled right ways because I didn't like it straight away.&nbsp; I uninstalled it with the tool and that's when I installed this version of Kaspersky&nbsp;I am using now (as stated in 2.) No other anti_virus
 ever installed.&nbsp; I do remember one time an AVG program installed itself on my laptop. at the time I didn't know much about it.&nbsp; since then I understand it can be an anti-virus program with tool bars and third party fluff.&nbsp; I have removed as much as of that
 as i could find.&nbsp; today I ran adwcleaner and it found some more of it and I removed those also.</li><li>Norton came pre-installed.</li><li>KB2930275, yes, installed successfully, KB2929961, yes, installed successfully, KB2925418, yes, installed successfully.</li><li>Java tested successfully.</li><li>Adobie 12.0.0.77 is installed tested successfully </li><li>a)&nbsp;IE11 was offered but I never checked the box for it to install.&nbsp; I haven't rechecked but now that&nbsp;you mention it last time I was looking at updates all I saw was bing updates.&nbsp; (I haven't ok'd those updates for bing.&nbsp; I have had a response somewhere,
 ( I cant remember where message says that I don't have a search provider.. ??&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see it being offered in the about internet explorer where the internet options menu. I never clicked on it to download.&nbsp; it just asks me if I want to upgrade to it.&nbsp; that's
 why I cant understand when I see in certain places (cant remember off my head where) that I am usaing IE 11. it may be in java.com that's where I have been recently.</li></ol>
<p>8b.)&nbsp;&nbsp;I had chrome and uninstalled it because I thought I had a bad install,&nbsp; when I went to uninstall it,a message asked me if I wanted to delete my browsing history during the uninstall and I said yes,&nbsp; after that I could not install chrome anymore because
 when you delete browsing history upon uninstall, it deletes the user profile for it to be installed again. I research this and found that out. It took me a month to find this out too. so I quit trying to reinstall it.&nbsp; I tried about 5 times. LOL anyway. not
 funny,&nbsp; I installed FF and uninstalled it the same day. I also had comodo dragon and used it for a day or tow but it had issue on my game. behind each icon on my game was black flashing backround and my cursor was erratic.&nbsp; this problem only occurs in comodo
 and comodo is chrome based also&nbsp; My research on comodo told me they use a dsn weather you want it or not and also have a layer of anti virus protection which I did not know til I uninstalled it.&nbsp; I still have comodo listed in my startup menu but it is not
 for use as a browser. I lef it there because I didn't know what to do with that.&nbsp; i click on the word comodo there and nothing comes up under it. i guess it is there as a user profile file??? not sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 9.&nbsp; I am being totally honest when I tell you I have never download any of the tools in 9. you are referring to.&nbsp; when ever I am being directed by a friend to use anything like that, I ALWAYS&nbsp;come to MS community and ask first.&nbsp; if you go back and read
 my help questions you will see I have always asked about these tools and I have replied back, thank you I respect you all advise and NEVER&nbsp;have used any one of them listed. I only use my disk cleaner&nbsp;on my ;laptop&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the only 2 of anything I have used and
 it has been recently and only suggested my help on this site was Malewarebytes about a week ago and today 3/28/14 used adwcleaner for adware.&nbsp; suggested here.&nbsp; other than those 2 that's it, Actually I fear them&nbsp; I have tried to tell my friends also not to
 use ccleaner either they wont listen to me and get offended. not sure why.&nbsp; the only other tools I use are the uninstall tools that come with things like the comodo dragon, I did use that and I had downloaded and use slimdriver and uninstalled that using their
 tool.&nbsp; I didn't know at the time i could update drivers via my own machine. I know now tho, and because i got screwed up with what drivers were from who, I decided to download slimdrivers again and reload the drivers I needed.&nbsp; Now. I can honestly say that
 this is all i have used on my machine.&nbsp; anytime I need to research a removal tool I come here..&nbsp; thank you so much for your dedicated help to me.&nbsp; If you need anymore info please let me know..</p>

 much maleware but, when I go to adobie flash settings manager, I notice cloudfront.net is sometimes but, not always, listed as sharing my bandwidth.&nbsp; its strange why it isn't always because the place I am visiting (my zoo world 1 game)&nbsp;&nbsp; is where I go when
 I can sometimes see it sharing bandwidth and sometimes not.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also used adwcleaner and it didn't find cloudfront.net either.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please let me know if adwcleaner is just a download and not installed on my pc.&nbsp; I am pretty sure it was sjut a download to use
 one time and not installed as I didn't see it in my programs list.&nbsp; I wanted to use it again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

previous thread of yours</a>&nbsp;(23 Feb-13 &amp;ff), we discovered that a previously-install Norton free-trial period had expired a day or two before you installed a Kaspersky application which predates the one you have installed now&nbsp;- and that Kaspersky subscription
 expired about 2 months before you then installed&nbsp;a McAfee free-trial on 10 February 2013. As such, I concluded that you may have been seeing the effects of a "hijackware infection"&nbsp;=&gt;</p>

            Yes, it appears to be gone,&nbsp; the place I was able to visibly see it was in the Adobie flash settings Manager.&nbsp; under the tab that shows who is sharing bandwidth with me.&nbsp; cloudfront.net was there everytime.&nbsp; I found Out that I do have IE11 as it was an
 automatic upgrade because I failed to untick the box that allows automatic upgrades in IE.&nbsp; since the upgrade to IE11 happened, I haven't noticed cloudfront.net.&nbsp; you had advised me to do a reset and I didnthave to do it.&nbsp; As far as I am concerned, this problem
 has been fixed. I also appreciate your time helping me with it and hope it doenst happen again in my new IE11. I am experiencing some of the other issues tho and will continue those questions in the appropriate thread.&nbsp; thank you PA Bear.

            Thank you for your suggestions. I can not always bet back any sooner to reply to my posts because of being busy but, I always will come back.&nbsp; Im not trying to be difficult where I&nbsp; sometimes post a question.&nbsp; Sometimes these threads can be confusing.&nbsp;
 im doing my best.&nbsp; I had posted a reply in one of my threads you were helping me with before I read this one so&lt; I wont be asking anymore questions about this pc here as you have asked me not to.&nbsp; altho, I'm not sure what is going on with my pc.&nbsp; Since I have
 been working with you, I did get rid of cloudfront.net so, all is not lost.&nbsp; if I may, I would like to just tell you one more thing.&nbsp; I've noticed from reading other peoples problems that they have the same issues I have and one thing that has stood out to
 me was this.&nbsp; A lot of people have said that their internal clock isn't set right.&nbsp; Mine isn't either but the clock in my task bar is correct.&nbsp; (I understand why that is too)&n

    <title>Build 14905 Fails to Rollback Properly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ray a h  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 14905 Fails to Rollback Properly</h2>
                    <p>On my test computer I have setup two partitions. One partition is running build 14393 public build. My second partition is running Windows Insider Builds. i was not getting build 14905 even though set up as fast and was set at build 14901. Dual boot working
 fine. My primary partition received build 14905 (forgot to take it off fast). I let it update to build 14905 with the intention of rolling it back to build 14393 once my second partition received build 14905 which it finally did. I wound up with two partitions
 with build 14905. I then booted my primary partition to restore to prior build 14393. Windows prompted me to do the steps to restore previous build. When it restarted nothing happened it stayed at build 14905. Finally I tried a 2nd time then it finally worked.
 With build 14901 a similar thing happened except that time it would not restore at all finally reinstalled build 14393. At least some progress on rolling back but still not working as expected. Dual boot is working properly now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did send feedback on this issue.</p>

            Yes both in first failed attempt and again yes on one that worked. It asks several questions why you want to roll back and one of the options you can type complete reason.

    <title>Word 2013 won&#39;t recognize printer envelope tray - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dorienkelly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2013 won&#39;t recognize printer envelope tray</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Word 2013 in a Windows 8.1 environment with an Epson 4540 printer. I also happen to be running Word 2010 on Windows 7 on another laptop computer. While it's no issue having the older system print envelopes, I cannot get Word 2013 to recognize
 that I have not only 2 printer trays but a top slot for envelopes on the Epson. They're simply not there so I can't even do a manual change to the proper tray. I looked through the "help" stuff and all it told me was that Word 2013 magically knows which printer
 tray to use. Except it doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried reloading the printer driver, to no success. Epson's help people say this is a Word issue. If that's truly the case, does anyone know how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            In spite of what Epson help people say, the printing functions in Word are dictated by the printer driver.&nbsp; It is quite likely that Epson need to create an updated driver for use with Word 2013.

            <p>Hi Matt Rs,</p>
<p>If you bought the software through download then you must have associated your Microsoft account with it. What I mean that during download or after installing you have login to the Microsoft account in the office. If that is the case Just go to&nbsp;
</p>
<span>
<p>https://products.office.com/en-in/compare-microsoft-office-products</p>
<p>
</p><p>Login there and install office. Microsoft will automatically activate it because the office is registered with your Microsoft account. Hope this will solve your problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks </p>

 but I can not figure out what it is.&nbsp; Any thoughts or suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Are you confident that a paired-samples t test is appropriate for your data? </p>
<p>
</p><p>The typical use of this test is to take measurements before and after some kind of intervention, e.g., test scores for each student before and after a series of lectures or exercises.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The data are usually arranged with one row for each student, e.g., student name in column A, the associated pre-test score in column B, and post-test score in column C.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it is useful to enter the difference in the two scores for each student in column D.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The intent of the paired-samples t test is to detect whether the average of the differences is significantly different from zero.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How are your data arranged?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why have you converted the results to zero and one?</p>

<h2>            Custom names for colors</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to give names to custom colors when setting up your own color theme?</p>
<p>insted of Accent <u>1 </u>etc. in the "Create New Theme Colors, So when using the colors in fx. shape fill, &nbsp;Light Blue would be Ocean Blue - so it matches the companys color guideline.

<p>Thank you for answering my question and attempting to help me. I have set all my SMS notification to none on my Lumia phone but the sound will not stop. This means if you want to send a message to someone to save you from robbers it means the robbers will
 know where you are hiding from the sound and will attack you. Is serious. Help.</p>

<span><span>We suggest you to perform a Hard reset on your Windows phone.
</span></span></p>
<p>The hard reset will bring your phone back to factory settings, the same state as when the device was first turned on. All apps, messages, media, personal settings, etc&nbsp;will be removed from the phone. If
<strong>backup</strong> is turned on under Settings, you can restore your apps and settings after performing a hard reset (as long as you initialize the phone with the same Microsoft Account). Note that resetting your device will not remove any OS or firmware
 updates. You will remain on the same version of Windows Phone after the reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can turn on your device you can reset your phone under Settings: <strong>

<p>When you feel the vibration, release the buttons, and then immediately press and hold the

Your phone should now reset and restart itself. (It might take
 a while for the reset to finish.)</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The hard reset operation will take a while to complete and will show spinning gears before it reboots your device to factory settings. Usually it will finish within 30 minutes but can, in some rare cases, take up to a couple of hours. Some older Nokia Lumia
 handsets have a bug where a reset never seems to finish. If that should happen to you, check this

<h2>            WP8 local network web server access issues</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to reach a web server using IE (Web UI exposed by my NAS) but unable to access with
<a href="http://hostname" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://hostname</a>. I've been able to successfully access the same URL through my laptop. Even my iOS devices are able to access the page through
<a href="http://hostname.local" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://hostname.local</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that I'm able to access it with the IP address but not with the hostname. My router does not have a domain name setup and hence propagates my ISP's connection specific DNS. So I tried adding that to the URL as
<a href="http://hostname.ISPDNSSuffix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://hostname.ISPDNSSuffix</a> but that didn't work either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what is the option to access it by hostname from my Windows Phone rather than by IP?</p>

            <p>I am no expert on NAS/URL/DNS but it seems to me that your router is unable to resolve the hostname to the local IP address.. Particularly when the request goes from the windows phone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since your laptop and iOS devices are able to access it with the hostname, it is possible that windowsphone does not have the necessary ability to place a request for the hostname in the right way. In other words, there is probably no fix for this on windows
 phone platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily for you, you are able to access with the IP address. I would suggest that you add this IP address into your phone browser's favorites. At least, that way, you don't have to type in the IP address every time.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, have you tried alternative browsers from the store? May be, it is a browser issue.

            <p>Hi Karthik.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tnx for your attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem is all those issues ,I described before; worked quite well with Build 9926 but</p>
<p>build 10041 they don´t. Compatility mode doesn´t help. You can not even install Win "keyboard and mouse center" and Logitech "Gaming mouse" install give me this famous (lol) " 0xc0000076" error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, build 10041 works pretty good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That particular error code refers to an invalid image format. However, what the error code usually means is that you are trying to run a program that is intended to work with a 64 bit Windows operating system, but that you only have a 32 bit OS. There are
 a couple of other reasons why this might be happening as well, particularly if you know you have a 64 bit operating system, or have been able to run the program in the past. Here are some troubleshooting steps for you to follow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to install the program then I suggest you to place the computer in a&nbsp;Clean&nbsp;Boot and then try&nbsp;to install the program in compatibility mode.
</p>
<p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows&nbsp; by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Follow <strong>step 3 </strong>to reset the computer to start as usual after the clean boot process.

<h2>            Clean Installed Preview, Still Get Full Release&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm wondering if anyone has the answer to this. I'm running the insider preview on&nbsp;my Asus vivotab m81c. I initially did a clean install of 10074 from 8.1. Then that updated to 10130. That build was having MAJOR problems for me, so I did a complete reset
 using&nbsp;in recovery to wipe the drive and reinstall. After the initial 10074 install, I used the disc clean utility to delete windows.old and win back some space. I did that again after the 10130 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, even after all of these clean installs, recovery resets, and windows.old deletions, will I still be able to update to the full RTM for free? "Activation" under settings does say I am "activated", and this did all start from the original 8.1
 install&nbsp;my tablet came&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I now want to delete these columns, but I am unable to do so using the csom as a result of the column being sealed.</p>

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>I find you have posted another thread in our TechNet forum. I suggest you follow that post for the solution, since TechNet is the recommended forum for resolving the CSOM related issue. Also, you may consider post the error screenshot in that thread for
 experts there to identify the root cause.</p>

<p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>Thanks for the response. Unfortunately, I have had no response on TechNet, so it is not that helpful.</p>
<p>Since you work for Microsoft support, are you able to find out the method and a code sample for deleting a custom sealed column in the Office 365 environment? This would prove very helpful for me, and any others in the future that run into the same issue.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your assistance!</p>

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>Based on my research, you can try adding the following lines to the script to change the Sealed property for the affected column to “False”. Then, you can remove it via CSOM.<br />
$schema = $field.SchemaXml<br />
if ($schema -match 'Sealed="TRUE"')</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $schemaAfter = $schema.Replace('Sealed="TRUE"', 'Sealed="FALSE"')</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $Field.SchemaXml = $schemaAfter</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $Field.update()</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $ctx.ExecuteQuery()</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>else</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; write-host "Field is ok " $schema "</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue remains, I’ll send you a private message to collect some information so we can try to look for a way from our side. You can check and provide the information via

<p>Just in case anyone else runs into this, the columns that couldn't be deleted ended up having to be deleted using back end code, which cannot be done by end users. I would suggest that if you run into this issue that you raise a support call, as it is necessary
 to get MS support to remove them for you.</p>
<p>The mistake I made was to create the columns as sealed, as that was how they had been created in the 2010 on-prem environment. Not sure why some of them could be deleted, but others couldn't, but I won't be creating any sealed columns in o365 tenants in
 future!</p>

<h2>            Recovery Key - Insignia iPad</h2>
                    <p>My brother gave me an iPad but he cannot remember the password he used to open the device. Took it to retailer's expert and in trying to reset it the device is locked up.&nbsp; The recovery key was sent to my brother's email but he cannot access it, I need the
 recovery key to be sent to alternative email. What to do? The virtual agent was unable to help.&nbsp;</p>

            It's an Insignia iPad not Apple. I have contacted manufacturer and was referred to Microsoft. The question really is: how&nbsp; to get Microsoft to send me the recovery key. Microsoft will send key to (brother's email address (which I have) but without his
 password I can't access it. Can Microsoft send the key to an alternative email?&nbsp;

            Hey, so we need a passcode, but your brother doesn't have access to that account? Because that is really the only way to get that code. Unless he set his phone up as a second way, then you could get a code that way

<p>Ok.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's how the phone may help. When you go and click on forgot password, it'll come up asking for email address. We need to look around and see if there is a button like "try another way to get code".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, on his phone, does he have email?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does he have any other devices?</p>

    <title>In Call Duration Timer for 6085 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rossco---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            In Call Duration Timer for 6085</h2>
                    My friend just bought a 6085 at a Telstra shop and specified that she wanted an in call timer (this is about the only option she wants on a mobile othet than making/receiving calls &amp; SMS).<br />
<br />
The guy who sold it to her and said to look it up on the internet or manual as Telstra didn't have any demo models.<br />
<br />
We can't find any reference to an in call timer? Does anyone know if this is available on a 6085?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

            To view the approximate information on your recent communications,<br />
select Menu &gt; Log &gt; Call duration, Packet data counter, or Packet data<br />
conn. timer.<br />
<br />
It might be different if you are using a network variant phone. First try to restore factory settings on your phone then access this menu.

            Thanks Okinawa but doesn't this show the call duration of recent i.e. past calls?<br />
<br />
We were after an in call timer i.e. a second/minute timer that appears on the display screen as one is making a call. This is handy with some network providers who offer free 3 minute calls on mobiles to selected numbers. Once the current call duration reaches
 3 minutes one can hang up and re-ring for another 3 minutes without being charged a call fee.<br />
<br />

<h3> hnt.le  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Visio&#58; is the product key independent from software version&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a legit MS Visio Professional 2013 product key (obtained from MSDN AA when I was a student) but haven't used it yet. Now I'd like to install Visio Professional 2016 together with other Office 365 apps (which are 2016 version).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it possible to use Visio Professional 2013 product key to activate Visio Professional 2016? Or I have to purchase a separated license for Visio Professional 2016 (sad news)?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you :-)</p>

<p>Thanks Gerrard :). I will try to stick with Visio Pro 2013 then. Buying another Visio Pro 2016 license is too expensive and not really an option for me ^^.</p>
