<p><span>However</span><span>, </span><span>it is still not clear to me

</span><span>for </span><span>the </span><span>Deaf

 mention features or capabilities included with Windows DVD Player. And I posted my question because I read some comments on different forums indicating that Windows DVD Player didn't support SDH.

 pc with usb cable as i should but unfortunately i have dowloaded the wrong driver. I think it was ciliniq or something, then i restarted my pc and then i realized it was the wrong. I wanted to uninstall the driver but it is not saved anywhere as a program,
 its just gone. But i can see there is a lot of wacom files in system32. I have made a systembackup and retried to install the driver but it keeps stopping and makes an error. The wrong driver i installed was completed succesfully and i have no idea what to
 do know, i hope you can help me. My questions are:</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">When i installed the wrong driver, could it maybe damaged my tablet and what should i do to install the real driver now.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">The program can't be found in programs and features, neither if i look it up from controlpanel&lt;uninstall program. Here is what

<p>Hi. I figured it out, i don't know if this helped but i disabled my antivirus sofware and looked for the driver in the device manager. I clicked show hidden devices and Wacom drive downloader showed up somewhere, can't remeber right now, but i was able to
 remove it and install the new driver, which works perfect right now. Thanks for the help.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Stuck on 0&#37; when reinstalling Windows Vista</h2>
                    I have a Dell Studio 540 (desktop) and it runs off of Windows Vista. It won't start up and has been giving me these weird error messages like no boot device detected and stuff like that. I have contacted Dell and they sent me a disk so I can reinstall
 Windows Vista (and yes, the disk is geniune). When I turned it on I pressed F12 and pressed boot from CD/DVD drive. It is installing now but it's been stuck on "expanding files 0%" for an hour now. Is this normal? if it is not, what should I do about it? :S
 The disk isn't dirty or anything because I just took it out of the sealed CD sleeve

<h2>            How do i remove directories from a folder using cmd&#63;</h2>
                    I had problem deleting files from a thumb drive - it showed deleting but the files were still in the directory. I tried using cmd to delete, which worked until I found a directory that contained 2 sub-directories with&nbsp; no data. What command must I use
 to remove these sub-directories?<br />
I am using Windows Vista<br />

            <blockquote>Thanks for reminding me. I have forgotten all the DOS commands which I used to use 2 decades ago. There is a command to delete a directory and all the subdirectories, but I forgot what it is. Is it&nbsp; del xtree? there is an x
 somewhere. RD does not work in this case.<br />
<br />
My folder is named abc def mar 2007 so the RD/s \ abc def mar 2007 does not work. I get error<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
The folder name has spaces in it so you need yo wrap in quotes like,<br />
<br />
RD /S "abc def mar 2007"<br />
... or without confirmation as<br />
RD /Q /S "abc def mar 2007"<br />
<br />
Your use of the \ troubles me. If you were in c:\Windows\System32 and wanted to get rid a directory c:\abc def mar 2007 then you would use the backslash since it tells the command to go to the
<i>root</i>&nbsp;and look for the path from there. That's a good use of syntax if that is what you wanted to do, but usually people just RD from the parent directory as I've done (without the backslash). But is the cursor was in c:\Users\Public and you wanted to
 get rid of c:\abc def mar 2007 and all subfolders contained within then the command would be,<br />
<br />
RD /Q /S \"abc def mar 2007"<br />
<br />
BTW, I think you were referring to DELTREE which became legacy and unsupported after NT.

            You can use the RMDIR or RD command to remove a subdirectory (e.g. <i>folder</i>). At the CMD prompt type RMDIR /? for the syntax.

<p>I deleted my email account as it had been hacked, forgetting it was the email address I'd used for my xbox account. &nbsp;Now, I can't change it, because microsoft wants me to check the verification email sent to my deleted account before I can make any changes.
 &nbsp;I don't really want to delete my account as I have ms points. &nbsp;Is there any way that I can change my email address and get my account working again?</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, here is a guide on how to change your Windows Live ID associated with your Xbox LIVE Profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
1.) Sign in to the account you wish to alter, then press the middle silver button on your controller &nbsp;<br />
2.) Press RB twice! <br />
3.) Go down, and select 'account management' &nbsp;<br />
4.) Go across twice, and select 'Account security' <br />
5.) Select 'Change Microsoft account' <br />
6.) Select Yes, enter the password for the email address shown (that is assigned to that account)
<br />
7.) Enter the email address you wish to change it to, and enter the password for that email address.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps! <br />

<p>Hi, and thanks for your answer. &nbsp;unfortunately I'm going around in circles. &nbsp;I sign in, and it immediately takes me into the "Add Security" screen where I can set up email, text and phone. &nbsp;I tried this with my new email address, and it says that I need
 to verify it. &nbsp;I tried to verify it, but it still isn't letting me past this screen. &nbsp;When I try to enter it again, it tells me that they are waiting for me to go to
<a href="https://account.live.com/p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/p</a> and verify. So when I go to account.live, I can't do anything because it wants me to verify the email account that I have already deleted. &nbsp;Your above suggestion
 doesn't work, as it doesn't do anything when I press RB twice.</p>

    <title>Xbox One is obsolete&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smileskybird  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One is obsolete&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone. It's been a few years since I was last on this forum. I've had Xbox since late 2010. It started with my Xbox 360 250GB Slim console, which still works to this day. I've also had Xbox One X since it launched. And I had the old original Xbox
 One console with Kinect which I sold 2 years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 10, there isn't a need to have console gaming with Xbox anymore. Most of the Xbox One titles can be played on computer with Windows 10. I had a full friends list on Xbox 360, Xbox 360 was great. No multi platform games which meant everyone you
 played with was playing on an Xbox 360 console. Then there was Party Chat, Voice Messaging, and Picture Messaging, social media features available on Xbox Live on Xbox 360, but which were NOT available on the competition, PS3. That's why I chose Xbox 360 over
 PS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox One got off to a VERY rough start. Microsoft made two POLICY REVERSALS. And it's hard to get such a big company to make those. Microsoft learnt a very important lesson. They need to create things that help of things that the customer wants or which
 helps them, NOT create things that the customer has to unwillingly adapt to. And when Xbox One came out, a lot of young people my age and younger, jumped ship to PC or PS because MS wasn't thinking right back in 2013. As evidence they received a lot of complaints
 in 2013 about the Xbox One system. Safe to say, they've made considerable improvements since then. PS console has more than twice the active people on it than people active on Xbox One consoles. There's actually only a few million people worldwide who are
 actively playing games on Xbox One consoles. Half of them are only using it as a YouTube or Netflix player ^u^&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a custom desktop PC (from 2016) which kicks out better graphics, colours, and performance than the Xbox One X console. Only 10% of my friends from Xbox 360 have an Xbox One cause they know better to play on PC with Windows 10, or PS4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP laptop which is 4 years old and plan on upgrading to a Microsoft Surface Pro 6 in around October this year. It's mobile and very portable and it's a two in one laptop/tablet and has a quad core processor and, USB 3.0. I also might upgrade my
 custom desktop PC next year once I have additional money to spare, to a system with an i9 9900k and GTX 2080 Ti 2TB Samsung M.2 SSD and 32GB DDR4 RAM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing Xbox One lacks right now is appeal from younger players, which is why it's mainly only adults on Xbox One, or splitscreeners or people with 0 or near that gamerscore. And it lacks exclusive games which are not available on PC or other platforms.
 Many of the exclusives on Xbox One are playable on PC thanks to Windows 10. PC's you can use your Xbox controller for those who don't want to play with keyboard and mouse. And Xbox does not have 100% full keyboard and mouse support yet. Not to mention with
 PC Windows 10, you're not locked behind an Xbox Live Switchboard. When Xbox Live goes down, and it does go down quite a lot!! that means you can't do anything only on your Xbox console. That is what is meant by Xbox Live Switchboard. The same situation with
 Xbox 360, which was the best generation as Xbox 360 recieved a lot of praise for its gaming and social media features including video chat, party chat, voice messaging, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The good thing about Windows 10 is you can continue to use your Xbox profile/Microsoft Account with it to work, watch and play. And with controller support, one has to question, is it really worth having something that you don't really want or need anymore,
 perhaps selling to cover any additional costs on devices that improve your life or make it enjoyable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Food for thought. Thanks for reading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Xbox one is not obsolete. Yes, some games release also on pc but not everyone can afford a pc or wants to upgrade their pc every year and a console is the perfect compromise.

            Good point. But as a gamer and microsoft fan they im happy with whatever choice they think will benefit the Industry they arent trying to Separate the community. They are trying to bring it together with Different devices.&nbsp;

<p>Wait, you realise this is an xbox forum right? For xbox fans?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There appears to be alot of misleading 'opinions' in this post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"only a few million people" actively playing xbox? Seriously? try using your PC's web browser and you will quickly find out that there is actually over 77 million active xbox players and growing, in fact, its almost doubled since 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox Live has been down/Offline for about 30mins total in the last year and that was purely down to a ddos attack, so thats untrue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The lack of xbox exculsives is well documented but the 'play anywhere' feature has bought all those games to PC. They are still console exclusives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you like to game on PC thats fine, but your post is full of inaccuracies and is misleading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes your pc plays better, of course it does. Did you have a point? or just trying to convince an entire xbox forum to abandon the entire console because YOU think its dying?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My xbox is so much more than a device to play games, its a community and i love it.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why cant i have PC and Xbox? Sometimes i dont want to fire up the PC and just want to chill out on my couch and play. Do i just stop doing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If consoles were dying, they wouldnt be releasing next gen.</p>

<p>Not all young people can afford "gaming pc's" with the same or better abilities than a One, and for sure not at under $500.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add to that, many don't have the want, or knowledge to build their own. (Which I've been doing since the 90's).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I strongly doubt your 4 year old laptop can keep up with the One.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just because YOU have no want or need for the XBOne, or Scarlett next year doesn't mean there aren't tens of thousands who do want and even need them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Stopped reading at the " only a few million people playing" comment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Last year there where over 60 million active xbox live accounts &amp; that number has increased.You really think the majority of those just use their xbox one for Netflix &amp; youtube? What nonsense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have a fairly decent pc but never use it for gaming,i hate gaming on a pc other than playing RTS games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Not everyone can afford to constantly upgrade their pc's in order to play the latest games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Xbox One &amp; console's in general are far from obsolete &amp; will be around for a long time yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Xbox live has only been completely down once,due to a ddos attack a few years ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;PSN was hit at the same time.Xbox live was back up within a few hours,PSN took a few days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you want to play on your pc then good for you,but your "reasons" for thinking the xbox one is obsolete are utter rubbish &amp; show a lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Edit:Just seen who created this thread,should of known by the usual "pc specs" they posted. For those of you who have only started using the forums within the past year or so,the op is well known for posting "opinions" like this that contain "made up" facts
 &amp; always has to post their pc specs in every post they make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Nothing to see here.</p>

<p>As a PC gamer my view is slightly different from yours in that I have no reason to see the Xbox One X I own as being obsolete.&nbsp; In my eyes some games require a PC, it's not being snobby to say it for me but some games are better suited to the PC world (FPS
 for example) where others are better suited to a console ecosystem (sports games like FIFA/Madden/NHL).&nbsp; Not that you cannot play either on the other format but for me it's a question of is there any benefit to *me* of playing a game of FIFA on a £1000+ gaming
 PC when I can do it perfectly fine on an Xbox One X.&nbsp; Then there's the fact as a console/PC gamer I'm sitting having completed Red Dead Redemption 2, meanwhile the PC only folks are still waiting to even get off the mountain - patience is not a virtue I was
 blessed with!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox and PC will always be a pairing for me, for some I dare say they'd consider it obsolete but at least I know for the foreseeable future that I walk into any games store in the world and buy an Xbox One game I know 100% it's going to run, where my PC
 (which is admittedly a bit older!) I have to think about it.&nbsp; In 2-3 years time my PC will need either major overhaul or more likely a total rebuild, that X will still run games without any fuss!</p>

            Well, my XBox One X provides me with a solid stable 4k gaming experience at a price you can't beat.&nbsp; A 4k gaming PC will literally run you thousands of dollars, so I would argue that no, the XBox One isn't obsolete, in fact it is leading the pack.

                    <p>Original Title: Free update to 8.1 pop up after a restart</p>
<p>
</p><p>A while back Microsoft downloaded update KB2885699 that enabled this pop-up. I uninstalled this and then hid it so it could not be installed again and that worked for a long time . Recently I have noticed it started popping up again on several PC's I support
 even though the above update is not installed . Did we get another updated from Microsoft that enabled this pop up again ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks !!</p>

<h2>            My recycle bin is suddenly full of thousands of random files</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it's causing any problems but it is concerning me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10, and just a few moments ago noticed there was stuff in my recycle bin. I always like to keep it empty so I went to check it and found there are apparently 6872 items in it. I didn't delete that many items from my computer... What's
 more bizarre is that looking through the files, i'm seeing all sort of random files, such as emoticons from Skype, icons and data for games I have never owned, and even random company logos I've never heard of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm somewhat concerned by this, as I have no idea where it has all come from, and worry that if I delete it all that the system may be unstable or something.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>I will definitely assist you with the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The files which are displayed in recycle bin may be temp files, I suggest you to run Disk cleanup and check if it clean recycle bin. Disk Cleanup will automatically reduce the number of unnecessary files on your drives, which can help your PC run faster.
 It can delete temporary files and system files, empty the Recycle Bin, and remove a variety of other items that you might no longer need. To run Disk cleanup follow the below link.</span></p>

<h2>            Resolved&#58; Media files not playing in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>UPDATE - I found a solution to the problem!</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>Did you ty uninstalling your drivers completely via device manager and reinstalling them after a reeboot? This seem to fix many issues both regarding sound and video.
</blockquote>
<p>I tried this and it seemed to temporarily worked. So I concluded that the problem had been related to the Audio drivers and I eventually found out a solution to fixing this problem! It's actually quite simple and I couldn't have found out about this solution
 without your advice! So thank you :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's how I fixed&nbsp;it, for others who want to know how to&nbsp;fix this problem:</p>
<p>1) Opened Control Panel</p>
<p>2) Searched using the keyword "Sound"</p>
<p>3) Clicked on "Manage Audio devices"</p>
<p>And a pop-up appeared saying that I should disable Driver Enhancements to resolve problems with the Audio drivers... or something close to that!<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">___________________________</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I recently updated to the Windows 8.1 General Availability Update on my laptop,&nbsp;Lenovo Ideapad U310.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually have a few audio and&nbsp;media related problems.</p>
<p>This first one regards a problem with the most crucial feature of Windows, playing media.</p>
<p>I used to be able to open media files (.WMV, .MP3, .MOV, .MP4, .M4A, .M4R, etc.) without any trouble on Windows 8. Now that I've updated to Windows 8.1, I can't play these files at all. Windows Media Player will open, but the media files won't play. They
 also won't play on other media players I have, such as Quicktime and iTunes. In addition, a lot of my video editing software doesn't work because of this media playback problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, I have this software called Dolby Home Theater installed on my computer. It was probably built into my computer as part of the software these Lenovo computers come with. Whenever I start up my computer, a window comes up on my desktop saying something
 like "Dolby Home Theater was unable to begin the process; Please restart your computer to fix this problem."</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the device manager, there's nothing wrong with my speakers or any other audio and sound drivers.&nbsp; I've searched many times on the internet for solutions, but haven't been able to find anything related to my problem on Windows 8.1. Probably because it
 just recently came out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any sort of help fixing these problems would be very much appreciated! :)</p>

            If your installation of Windows 10 is exhibiting strange behavior that doesn't seem to resolve through typical troubleshooting you may need to perform a "Repair Upgrade". This will reinstall windows over top of your existing installation and will preserve personal files and settings.

<p>Good day! Thank you for reaching out Surface Community. Congratulations on your New Surface Go. Please know that Surface Go came with
<span>Windows 10 in S mode. It is a version of Windows 10 that's streamlined for security and performance, while providing a familiar Windows experience.
</span>To increase security and performance, Windows 10 in S mode runs only&nbsp;apps from the Microsoft Store.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to install an app that isn't available in the Microsoft Store, you'll need to permanently switch out of S mode. There's no charge to switch out of S mode. Please follow the steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On your PC running Windows 10 in S mode, open
<strong>Settings</strong> <span>
</span>&nbsp;&gt; <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong>&nbsp;&gt;
<strong>Activation</strong>.</li><li>Find the <strong>
Switch to Windows 10 Home</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Switch to Windows 10 Pro
</strong>section, then select the&nbsp;<strong>Go to the Store
</strong>link.
<div>
<div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p style="margin-left: 0">
Note</p>
<div style="margin-left: -24px">
<div>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
Don't select the link under&nbsp;<strong>Upgrade your edition of Windows</strong>. That's a different process that will keep you in S mode.</p>
</li><li>On the page that appears in the Microsoft Store (<strong>Switch out of S mode
</strong>or a similar page), select the <strong>Get</strong> button.&nbsp;After you confirm this action,&nbsp;you'll&nbsp;be able to&nbsp;install apps from outside&nbsp;the Microsoft Store. I would also recommend that you Restart the Surface Device before installing
 the app.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You may mark it as answer if that helps you download the <span><span>QuickBooks<span> Pro 2017</span></span></span>.</p>

            If the system says it's taken, then it's in use somewhere on Microsoft's servers. The tag system is in use on other Microsoft services, so even if it's not in use on an Xbox, it may be in use somewhere else. The system also doesn't see things like spaces
 as making a gamertag unique. So if you were to look up "gamertag" it may not show up even though it's actually in use as "gamer tag". There's no way to take a gamertag if it's unavailable. If it's in use, the original owner would have to change the name or
 if they do not sign into the account for 5 years (starting in 2016) it will be freed up.&nbsp;

<p>By then you might as well use a different way of spelling it</p>

            It's most likely that the username you searched for was actually taken but they were banned. I believe that banned usernames are lost and cannot be re-used, that's what I was told in the past anyway. Sadly it looks like you'll need to choose another username.
 Sorry.

    <title>How do I get those three guide pictures on Fresh Paint&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I get those three guide pictures on Fresh Paint&#63;</h2>
                    I just started using Fresh Paint and I was really pumped for the three guide pictures they keep showing on the side of the examples. However, I have found that I have no clue how to get those there. I like to choose pictures from the "inspire me" link,
 which is a fantastic idea, but that means those photos aren't on my tablet to import on to the canvas multiple times. So, I would like to know how to get this thing that I thought was automatic to happen. Thanks.

<h2>            how to keep the inbuilt mobile hotspot on permanemtly&#63;</h2>
                    Hi how do I keep the inbuilt mobile hotspot feature on permanently with the creators update? Since this update third party apps that previously did this are not compatible with the creators update. Unfortunately because of this issue I cant update my pc
 to the creators update until I get a resolution. Thanks for your help.

<p>Need to either never sleep, hibernate or otherwise turn off the PC&nbsp; ...well some, but not all pc's can sleep and still have a network connection.</p>
<p>

            yeah that doesn't work already tried those settings. I can start it fine the problem is it turns itself off unless there is an active connection. Once it starts I need it to stay on permanently not turn itself off. Auto starting is not the issue staying
 on permanently is.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We just like to isolate this issue that you're having right now with your Mobile hotspot connection. When did you start to encounter that your device disconnect if there's no activity? Did you make any changes on your device before this issue happens? What
 is the current build and version of your OS? You can check it by pressing the <strong>
Windows </strong>key + <strong>R</strong> and type <strong>winver</strong>. <br />
<br />
We will wait for your response.</p>
<p>

<p>hi </p>
<p>I started to encounter device disconnect with no activity as soon as creators update installed, I have since rolled back to previous anniversary update all works fine now, able to use baidi wifi hotspot to keep on permanently. I'm looking for a solution
 to the auto disconnect issue with the creators update so I can keep system updated or a work around to allow a third party app to do it, my preference is for the inbuilt hotspot to stay on permanently.</p>

            If you're still up for a challenge, I suggest that you try to update your device one more time just to check if the update was main reason of the issue. I'm just thinking that there's a possibility that there are some components that got corrupted. In

            I have tried updating multiple times issue still persists ie mobile hotspot doesn't stay on turns itself off automatically. I'm not interested in the feedback hub as I'm looking for a solution that will allow current functionality while being up to date,
 new builds shouldn't take functionality away from the user these things should be sorted out prior to update. Telling me to go the feedback hub is not a solution it doesn't help me at all. Is there no way around the auto shut off issue with mobile hotspot?

            I still haven't been given a realistic option or solution to this, I know for a fact I'm not the only one with the issue of mobile hotspot not staying on so a genuine answer would be appreciated and would help a lot of people. Thanks

<h2>            NBA 2K13 keeps freezing</h2>
                    
<p>Just to be clear this isn't the myplayer freezing that 2K fixed. My disc keeps freezing when it starts up. When it gets to the screen that shows all 30 team logos it freezes.</p>
<p>This is the second disc i got, i returned the first one. Both have the exact same issue. &nbsp;My other games work on my console. Could it be a bad batch of games that the store received?</p>
<p>I tried cleaning the disc, taking the hard drive out and starting it up that way. Trying the game on another console worked got it past the start up screen and it would work sometimes and freeze other times. I tried installing the game but it only made it
 to 2% and couldn't continue.&nbsp;</p>
