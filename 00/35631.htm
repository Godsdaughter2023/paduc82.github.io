<h2>            Upgrade to Windows 10 stuck at 54&#37;</h2>
                    <p>Hin I've seen lots of evidence of the issues regarding upgrading older laptops but nothing seems to be a definitive answer.&nbsp; i3 HP Pavillion DV6 3112sa&nbsp; 64bit w 4GB RAM,&nbsp; intelHD graphics /Radeon HD5 mobility card /30GB HDD left.
</p>
<p>I an replacing w 1TB SSD / 8GB RAM to get the laptop useful for my kids next week but want to install W10 ( note that this failed when i tried to do the free install at the time of release, didn't bother figuring out why).&nbsp; The key issue i have is that Windows
 7 version of OneDrive is trying to download ALL my online folders. i have 2 more newer laptops and a Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help diagnosing and fixing would be appreciated.&nbsp; Ive uninstalled AV, disabled progs, disabled graphics card etc etc</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I appreciate your efforts to work on this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Could you please get me more information on “The key issue I have is that Windows 7 version of OneDrive is trying to download ALL my online folders.”?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description provided by you, the laptop is not tested with Windows 10. There are updated drivers available only for Windows 7. As there are no drivers available for Windows 10, that is why the installation is getting stuck.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can refer <a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/HP-Pavilion-dv6-Entertainment-Notebook-PC-series/4247579/model/4320680" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, you can try updating to Windows 10 by following the steps mentioned below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note: <em>Due to non-availability of drivers from the manufacturer, you might face issues during or after installation.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Disconnect external devices</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to disconnect all the external devices connected to the computer such as printer, scanner or any USB device except mouse and keyboard and start the installation.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Clean boot</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can perform a clean boot on the computer and then start the installation. To perform a clean boot on the computer refer to the article
<span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></a></span></span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note: <em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Performing a clean boot will start the computer with minimal set of drivers and programs, to determine whether a background program is causing the issue. Some of the Startup programs will not load after performing
 a clean boot on the computer. However, that functionality will return when you reset the computer to start normally after finishing the troubleshooting.</span></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">For additional information, you can refer to the article
</span></em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12435/windows-10-upgrade-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Upgrade to Windows 10: FAQ</span></a>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, I suggest you to get in touch with the Laptop manufacturer and check if they have updated drivers available for Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps. </span></p>

    <title>Multiple services terminate unexpectedly when using Wi-Fi - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Multiple services terminate unexpectedly when using Wi-Fi &#40;1511&#41;</h2>
                    <p>10.0.10586, the problem arised a week ago after installing the 1511 update</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same symptoms as in&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/major-connectivity-and-stability-issues/5de9a3ba-5028-4f93-82c5-ae231c297334">Major connectivity and stability issues (WiFi/LAN/core
 Windows Services) after migrating from Threshold 1 to 2 (1511 update)</a>&nbsp;(none of the attempts listed there fixed anything). Basically, whenever I'm using wireless connection, some services terminate unexpectedly after a few minutes or even seconds of working.
 Some of them can be successfully restarted manually but they terminate again and again as long as I'm using Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried three different adapters with different Realtek and Atheros chips, so I don't think it's a driver problem. They also work fine in 10240. Everything's ok when I use the wired or the tethered connection (the latter presents itself as wired, too). So
 I believe it narrows the problem down to the wireless support components of Windows 10 build 10586.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The actual wireless connection may or may not continue working but the network list under the tray icon becomes and stays empty until system is restarted. The event log service stops as well, so to see what happens I first start the service manually, and
 then it looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd36628e-da32-45d5-a283-5d1577af20c3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd36628e-da32-45d5-a283-5d1577af20c3" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the log:&nbsp;http://pastebin.com/LyW5zY3f (for some reason most services retained their Russian names even though I applied the English language pack beforehand).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any workarounds except going back to 10240 and wired/tethered connections?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience caused. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still facing the issue, I would suggest you to try performing a repair upgrade using an installation media and check if it helps. Repair upgrade is done when the system starts causing different problems. It will not remove or delete any files.
 Refer the steps given be Andre Da Costa on <strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">How

<h2>            KB2533552 Update Issues</h2>
                    <p>Ok. First time user so be gentle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently installed all Windows updates (Windows 7 Ultimate). Everything went like clockwork. Updated to SP1 no problems.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, another update is recommended - KB253352</p>
<p>This like all the others previously was downloaded automatically and installed.</p>
<p>Again, no issues. All programs on laptop&nbsp;working as they should.</p>
<p>However, when I plugged in my usb drive I noticed all folder properties had changed and could not be changed/ customized by me. The slideshow option previously available was no longer presented either but it was still available on folders stored on the laptop
 itself.</p>
<p>I did a system restore back to before KB2533552 and hey presto the usb drive was as it should be. All folders were as customised and the slideshow option available.</p>
<p>The following day KB2533552 was almost forced upon my laptop and installed automatically. As previously, the usb drive folders all changed properties and wont allow me to change them back. Again, the slideshow option is not available.</p>
<p>Works fine on other machines (not updated) and all other usb pen drives I use on my laptop have the same issues.</p>
<p>I'm told that KB2533552 cannot be removed. I do not want to copy every usb drive file onto the laptop.
</p>
<p>How do I get my usb pen drives to work as they should?. How do I get the slideshow option back? I want to undo KB2533552, what are my options?</p>
<p>I have tried updating usb drivers but my machine advises they are all up-to-date</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hoping to hear from intellects soonest</p>

            <p>Thanks, but already done all that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KB2533552 has installed itself and apparently cannot be removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The properties of the USB drive and its contents still cannot be changed. I have also noted that the folders on the laptop, while their views, etc. can be changed for that moment you are viewing them they are not remembered/ stored by the laptop (close the
 folder and immediately reopen the customization has been lost)</p>
<p>The Win 7 slideshow option is still available for image files on the laptop but not for those on the USB flash drive.</p>
<p>Am I the only one having this issue with this update?</p>

            The problem isn't that you need to download one of those 3 drivers as Windows 7 already comes with the driver. The problem is that the HP universal drivers do not support scanning in the same way that you are used to. If you look at the "Software" section
 near the bottom of the&nbsp; <a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareIndex.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;prodNameId=1140778&amp;prodTypeId=18972&amp;prodSeriesId=1140783&amp;swLang=8&amp;taskId=135&amp;swEnvOID=4063" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HP Driver download page</a> you will see a link labeled "HP Color LaserJet and LaserJet AiO/MFP Products - Use the Scan and Fax Software in Windows 7" with an "Obtain Software" link on the right that will lead you to the following page of instructions:

    <title>New Version of Microsoft Photos App in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jwwbaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Version of Microsoft Photos App in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am very disappointed with the new Photos App that has recently been installed on my computer (probably from a recent Win 10 update).&nbsp;
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This App is next to worthless</span>.&nbsp; It has no&nbsp;manual editing features and the auto enhancement button does&nbsp;not produce acceptable edits.&nbsp; The previous version was a pleasure to work with&nbsp;and produced great edited photos.&nbsp;
 It was a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">big selling point </span>when discussing the advantages of Windows 10 over Apple products with folks who are just beginning to work with computers and to those who were just sharpening their skills by learning
 more about Windows 10 features and advantages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please consider either making the old version available to Windows users or simply replace the newer version with the previous version at the next update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an MCSE on a previous operating system and have many years of working with Windows.&nbsp; Am retired and now teach computing to senior citizens on a volunteer basis.&nbsp; Many of us are grandparents and have literally thousands of photos that we use in scrapbooks
 and other personal projects.&nbsp; We need the previous version of this product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would very much appreciate&nbsp;a response to this message if at all possible.</p>

            it's totally insane that a useful app was replaced so completely with something so completely use-less.

            I tested that number with Skype and it went through just fine. When I disabled my Caller ID in Skype, the call was dropped. By default,&nbsp;<br />
Caller ID is disabled in Skype since inbound Skype numbers are not provided freely. This will occur if you disable Caller ID&nbsp; using any other phone service.&nbsp; That number, like many others, can restrict calls that are private (with no Caller ID), similar to
 blocking anonymous calls on a mobile/landline.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Most webcams don't use drivers per se, but rather integrated software that comes with the webcam (or in your case, the monitor). What specific model HP Monitor do you have, and what Bit Depth are you running?&nbsp; Hint:&nbsp; go to Control Panel, select System, and
 find the data in the System Type line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can answer these questions, I'll try to provide additional assistance to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Gaugus,</p>
<p>Yes, the data was exactly what I needed. I found a Windows 7 driver, here:&nbsp; <a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/SoftwareDescription.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=US&amp;swItem=vc-80416-1&amp;mode=5&amp;jumpid=reg_r1002_usen_c-001_title_r0005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And while I couldn't find your webcam specifically (there was nothing by the monitor), I was able to find a generic VGA driver that might work, here:
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=da-75204-1&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;os=4063&amp;product=3337935&amp;sw_lang" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try those and see if they fix the issue for you. Keep me posted.</p>

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>Thanks so much for your efforts.&nbsp; I downloaded both suggested downloadables, unfortunately neither one worked.&nbsp; I wonder if I&nbsp;connect the monitor&nbsp;to the cpu with&nbsp;an HDMI cord, it might make a difference.&nbsp; But there is no HDMI connection on the CPU side.&nbsp;
 Question is Should I get a cord reducer that will make HDMI possible.&nbsp; Happy 4th.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I did another, different search on the HP site and came up with a plethora of potential results - 766 to be exact - including several for webcam applications. You will need to sift through them and see if any match the one you have. The search results are
 here:&nbsp; <a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/site/search/r4_0/jsp/search.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;tx=w2558hc+webcam&amp;pc=0&amp;sc=2&amp;cf=1&amp;nh=10&amp;rf=0&amp;lkc=1&amp;lk=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/site/search/r4_0/jsp/search.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;tx=w2558hc+webcam&amp;pc=0&amp;sc=2&amp;cf=1&amp;nh=10&amp;rf=0&amp;lkc=1&amp;lk=1</a>&nbsp;. Drill down through the pages, as there are several results for desktop models in the 100 to 150 results range.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good quality adapter might also&nbsp;be a workable solution, though some feel there is an (unacceptable) loss of video quality. You'd just have to invest in, or possibly&nbsp;borrow, one to try it out and see for yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if there is anything else I can do.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            When does it happen?&nbsp; For example, you can quickly adjust the size if you press Ctrl while you scroll your mouse or touchpad.&nbsp; You can also adjust the size by "pinching" on a laptop touchpad (similar to zooming into a picture on a iPhone or ipad).&nbsp; I often
 see people unaware of this and so as they touch the touchpad with their arm or wrist it changes and they aren't sure why it's happening.

<h2>            Internal Harddrive disconnects and game freezes in game.</h2>
                    I just recently cleared out my storage to free up space and crucial files were deleted. I then had to just reinstall windows 10. After that it was updated and another update about a day later occurred. After reinstalling windows my internal secondary hard
 drive that has everything except my os and a select things has been disappearing. It disconnects while I'm using files inside of it and then shuts everything I'm using down. I have to go to device manager and make it scan my hardware or restart the computer
 to get it to show back up. The second problem is that while I'm in a game, if the hard drive hasn't disconnected itself. I get my whole screen frozen every 10 seconds or so. Only while playing games though. Ive tried updating my GPU drivers but it still has
 the same problem.

    <title>We ARE The Forerunners Of Halo - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spartan i043  say:</h3>
<h2>            We ARE The Forerunners Of Halo</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;We are the founders of the Halo rings. We destroyed the flood and restored humanity. We lived and thrived before anyone. We are the earliest Halo players. We are Team Forerunner.
<br />
<br />
Hey! Spartan I043 here.<br />
<br />
Beginning sound cool? Keep reading! I am currently a Field Marshall and I am currently in the process of recruiting for my clan Team Forerunner in Halo Reach.
<br />
<br />
ABOUT TEAM FORERUNNER:<br />
Team Forerunner is a clan where winning and losing don't count, where skill doesn't matter, where cussing hardly exists, and where fun is always in the game. If you cuss up storms, only care about winning, and are unsporting don't bother reading on or sending
 us friend requests. We DON'T want players that cuss up storms and we DON'T want players that are unsporting and only want to win. We want players that want to have fun, we want players that are good sports and we'd prefer players that don't cuss (we don't
 mind if a you can't help throw a cuss word in every now and then). We currently have about 60 awesome, official players in Team Forerunner! Team Forerunner only cares about having fun and if we win great. . . if we lose, oh well we have our chins held high
 ready to move on either way. We are very strict on players who only want to win, who are unsporting, and who cuss up storms (We banned two members because they were both cussing up a storm and one of them only wanted to win and was unsporting). Most of Team
 Forerunner's members rarely ever cuss (which is really nice) and we try to help each other rank up, complete challenges and become better players. Both guys and gals are welcome to join our clan. Reydaitso and KillJoyseries89 made two websites where you can
 view more of Team Forerunner's information.<br />
<br />
WEBSITE INFO:<br />
KillJoyseries89 made this website:<br />
http://team-forerunner.spruz.com/ (No registration is required except in posting)<br />
<br />
We also have the "group" feature on Bungie.net. You can join our group there if you wish. We also have our own Youtube channel. Check that out if possible.
<br />
<br />
TEAM FORERUNNER RULES:<br />
1. Player must respect the leaders/co-leaders: Spartan I043, Iron Hawk II, Jakeylakes, Reydaitso, and fishiesDONTswim (So far only two members have disrespected us and I don't want it to happen again)<br />
<br />
2. Player must be a good sport whether it's win or loss. (In other words, have fun whether you win or lose)<br />
<br />
3. Player must have a mic and must communicate to the team. <br />
<br />
4. Player must be willing to participate in ALL Halo Reach game modes. (Slayer, Capture the Flag, Headhunter, Invasion etc.)<br />
<br />
5. Player must change their emblems to Team Forerunner's official emblem (No armor or gamertag changes are required, however if you join our clan, I ask that you put "Team Forerunner" into either your motto or bio so that way when our new members look at my
 friend's list, they will know who is in our clan and who isn't)<br />
<br />
I allow ALL ranks to join so I will allow you to join whether you are a Recruit, Inheritor or anything in between. Currently our highest ranked officer is a Field Marshall and our current lowest ranked officer is a Warrant Officer (again these are official
 Team Forerunner members). And we have many ranks in between, so you should be able to fit right in!
<br />
<br />
TEAM FORERUNNER INFO:<br />
Players can also list a specific preference in which class they will be assigned. (All-Around, Heavy, Long Range, Close-Quarter, Vehicle Operator, etc.)<br />
<br />
An Octagon backround with the Champion Star in the middle is the Team Forerunner emblem. The Colors are Steel (Backround Color), Silver (Primary Emblem Color), and White (Secondary Emblem Color). I no longer require the service tag to be changed, because it
 is hard to recognize teammates with the same service tags.<br />
<br />
As said above I am trying to make Team Forerunner as fun as I possible can, and if there are any recommendations let me know. We also try to have clan battles every weekend, so if your clan wants to battle ours, feel free to contact our Clan Battle Organizer
 Jakeylakes.<br />
<br />
TEAM FORERUNNER CONTACTS:<br />
You are more than welcome to contact any of the leaders/co-leaders listed above, but for the most part you will want to send me messages. You can contact me multiple ways:<br />
1. Xbox Live Gamertag: Spartan I043 <br />
2. Right here in the forum<br />
3. Send me a private message<br />
<br />

NOTICE: You may have been aware that I kept using "official Team Forerunner Members." That is because some of the players who want to join us take so long to recruit.
<br />
<br />
If you recruit by:<br />
Week 1: You will receive ALL Team Forerunner Updates and will be invited to games.<br />
Week 2: You will NOT receive Team Forerunner Updates for 3 days and will not be invited to games for 3 days.
<br />
Week 3: You will no longer be eligible to join.<br />
<br />
What I mean by recruiting by week one, two, and three is how much time you have to join before you are penalized. For instance, if you wanted to join by week 1, but were offline for 1 week, you would be penalized, unless you had a good excuse for not recruiting
 by week 1.<br />
<br />
If you make me wait I will penalize you. I am only doing this because so many players don't recruit before week 1 and they make me wait and wait and wait. . . Sometimes it takes at least 2 or more weeks for most of them to join. We are VERY SERIOUS when it
 comes to recruiting. If you plan to join please be serious about it. To be an "Official Team Forerunner Member" your emblem must be changed, you must obey the rules, and you must play at least one match with me and/or my co-leaders. We will then decide if
 we want you in our clan. We also decided that we don't want our members in other clans besides ours. If you join our clan, it will either be this one, or another one. It gets to complicated if our members are in more than 1 clan in Halo Reach. If you for some
 reason can't join before week 1, please send me a message ASAP and I may excuse you from being penalized depending on the excuse.
<br />
<br />
TEAM FORERUNNER MEMBER NEWS:<br />
We now have our very own clan meeting room! We hold meetings EVERY Saturday. You can come to these meetings and find out more about us if you wish.</p>
<p>Also,&nbsp;When you join Team Forerunner, don't only send me a friend request, but also send Iron Hawk II (Team Forerunner Leader), Jakeylakes (Team Forerunner Co-Leader and Clan Battle Organizer), Reydaitso (Team Forerunner Co-Leader and Secretary of Treasure)
 and fishiesDONTswim (Team Forerunner Co-Leader) one. This way they will know you are wanting to join or have already joined. You can try to contact one of them if I'm not online.<br />
<br />
Iron Hawk II writes:<br />
"Hey guys, I am proud to be a Team Forerunner leader. I hope you have the best experience possible playing Reach in our clan.
<br />
This clan was built by Spartain I043 and myself and we want other Reach players to play to win, but also be good sports about losing because we will most likely not win every match. This has been a great experience for me. I hope to see you on the battlefield
 soldier. Iron Hawk II, signing out.<br />
PS: I appreciate my fellow clan members to be my friends and also if it isn't too much to ask, I would like a good rep. Oh! And one more thing I would appreciate as little language (cussing/swearing) as possible."<br />
<br />
Jakeylakes also writes:<br />
"Hey guys i'm Jakeylakes one of the members of Team Forerunner. I would just like to give you a heads up display of how great this clan is and I highly recomend that you join. Team Forerunner plays for fun, Team Forerunner accepts anyone who's willing to join.
 These past few weeks have been awsome, I have played so much now and my ranks are soaring through the roof because I can actually play Reach and enjoy. Team Forerunner has lots of members and there all fun to talk to. If you consider becomeing an honarable
 member of Team Forerunner all you need is a mic, contact Spartan I043( our team leader- also give Iron Hawk II respect aswell) or alteranativly you can contact me and i'll talk with Spartan I043. Many Thanks Jakeylakes Team Forerunner"
<br />
<br />
ArmorLock4Noobs also writes:<br />
"I'm a new member myself, this is a great clan to join. Team Forerunner may put fun first, but don't let that fool you into believing we are not a serious clan. I have been in 4 clans spanning the past 7 years on XBOX Live and I am impressed with the level
 of professionalism on Team Forerunner. "<br />
<br />
Other quotes by my members:<br />
1. "Team Forerunner&nbsp;is a VERY fun clan!" -Capt Dewy/ispartan365&nbsp;<br />
2. "Team Forerunner puts the Team in Teamwork!" -Crazed So<br />
3. "I never plan to leave Team Forerunner!" -Untaimed Spirit<br />
4. "Finally a clan where winning doesn't matter!" -burningclod<br />
5. "Team Forerunner's guys are GOOD!" -SILENTxkiller<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION:<br />
Believe it or not this is our (Iron Hawk II and me) first time running a clan as well as being in a clan. We must be doing a good job or our clan members wouldn't be saying these things. Personally we love to have fun, but we can get very serious (especially
 when it comes to recruiting and cussing players with unsporting attitudes). If you want proof that these guys have fun in Team Forerunner just send them a message and ask. They will tell you how much fun they have. We guarentee you'd have fun as well. If you
 want to join, but may be nervous if you were to want to quit and not disappoint me, don't worry about it. We don't force anyone to stay, nor do I force anyone to leave. It is completely up to you. We ask that you really think about joining. We have so much
 fun as a group and we want to share our fun with YOU.<br />
<br />
If Team Forerunner is a clan where you want to find friends, play with mature yet fun guys that rarely cuss, have VERY GOOD sportsmanship, and have the teamwork spirit, then Team Forerunner is the clan for you, because Team Forerunner wants you to have a Halo
 Reach experience that you will NEVER forget.<br />
<br />
Questions and comments needed answered quickly about Team Forerunner should be sent to Spartan I043, Jakeylakes, Reydaitso and/or fishiesDONTswim. Iron Hawk II is online when possible (not frequently) so only send him messages if necessary.
<br />
<br />
On behalf of Team Forerunner we hope that you join (quickly).</p>

<h2>            Error message&#58; KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE after upgrading RAM</h2>
                    <p>I have just upgraded my Dell Laptop XPS-L501x with 8GB (2 x 4GB) RAM as it originally came with 4GB (2 x 2GB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop attempts to boot but windows flags KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE error..!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Replaced the old set of RAM modules and all is well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new RAM modules are made by Crucial and accroding to them it is a match for my laptop's spec.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new RAM does appear in the BIOS showing as extended memory just short of 8GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone has any suggestions or can recommend a solution..?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks..!</p>

            Hi GLoria,
<br />
<br />You can only do that if you have a Restore Point for around that date:
<br />
<br />In the search box, type System Restore
<br />
<br />Open the System Restore Applet
<br />
<br />Click the System Restore button and check to see if you have an appropriate  Restore point . . .       
        </p>

<br />
<br />Did you set a restore point at that time?
<br />
<br />I'll keep working with you to resolve this issue.

            Hi, GloriaDunn
<br />
<br />You could also check to see if there are some sectors of the hard drive damaged.
<br />After you correct the damaged sectors you can enter with Windows Virtual and backup your files and then reinstall Windows
<br />
<br />Take a look to the following link, there is a step by step guide 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hirens-boot-cd-allinone-boot-cd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hirens-boot-cd-al...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.hiren.info/pages/bootcd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.hiren.info/pages/bootcd</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a>
<br />
<br />Process: 
<br />1. Enter your USB drive or CD
<br />2. Enter Dos Programs 
<br />3. Enter Hard Disk tools 
<br />4. Enter HDAT2 4.53 (Test/Repair Bad Sector) 
<br />5. Then auto &amp; choose your keyboard United states (or wait it will do automatically here) 
<br />6. Press Enter &amp; Press Drive level tests menu 
<br />7. Enter Check and Repair bad sectors 
<br />8. And now it will start, it takes a lot of time, so wait until it finished.
