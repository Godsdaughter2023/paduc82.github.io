    <title>Grey outline around tabs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ben tsow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Grey outline around tabs</h2>
                    I recently updated to a newer version of Windows 10 and ever since, whenever I right click an icon from the task bar, e.g. Google Chrome, there is a grey outline that is in the same shape of the pop up options box, but slightly larger, so there's kind
 of a box floating. It's hard to explain so here's an example below. Hopefully someone can help. Thanks in advance!<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/928ff30a-92a6-4b47-b843-636c3fd0a5f4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/928ff30a-92a6-4b47-b843-636c3fd0a5f4?upload=true" /></a>

<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your efforts in providing details about your concern. Just to verify, does the issue only occur on certain apps? Also, do you have another user account on your PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you only have one user account on your PC,<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>let's<span>&nbsp;</span><span>try creating another</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>local user or administrator account to</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>check
 if the same issue persists.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>In this way, we can identify if the issue is related with<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>a c</span></span><span>orrupted user profile.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps on how to create a local user or administrator account in Windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Select the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;button, then select&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;<strong>&nbsp;Accounts&nbsp;</strong>&gt;<strong>&nbsp;Family &amp; other people&nbsp;</strong>&gt;<strong>&nbsp;Add someone else to this PC</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Firstly thanks for the reply. I have created a new user and this problem doesn't occur on there so it's only my own account. Also this outline is also for popups when you right click Spotify or other stuff on your task bar. Again thanks for your help!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 lost all of my data - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ted_miller  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 lost all of my data</h2>
                    <p>When windows 10 became available I enthusiastically upgraded to the new format. It wasn't a perfect&nbsp;fit,&nbsp;but I&nbsp;figured out&nbsp;how to make most of my existing software work. It was rocky for a couple of weeks but I was working through it. Then one day I got
 a message&nbsp;telling me that my laptop had no operating&nbsp;system. I called Microsoft and after navigating through their system was connected with a technician named Mohammed.&nbsp; He said to press f9.&nbsp;Nothing happened. Then he said to try f11. Nothing happened. After
 a moment he asked if there was anything on the computer that I wanted to save. Then he instructed me to shut down the computer and to take it to a computer and store to have the hard drive copied. I shut it down. The next day I started the computer up,&nbsp; it
 started to whirr, and proceeded to restore to windows 7 factory settings. Through an employer I'd upgraded towindows 2013 professional suite,&nbsp; for $9.99.&nbsp; I'd purchased the&nbsp;Photoshop Elements and &nbsp;Photoshop Premier elements. These were gone, along with e-mail,
 and photographs. I spent a half day talking withMicrosoft reps who told me that there was nothing they could do to restore the data that had been lost.</p>
<p>Frustration the most accurate&nbsp; term for how I feel. I've lost thousands of&nbsp; dollars of programming&nbsp; and due to an illconcived premature&nbsp; launch of Windows 10.</p>

    <title>Bitlocker - password failed to unlock volume - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pch111  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bitlocker - password failed to unlock volume</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop that was encrypted and requires a PIN entry.&nbsp; The user knows his PIN.&nbsp; Today when booting up, it no longer took that PIN, saying it was incorrect.&nbsp; We have the Recovery Password too.&nbsp; The Recovery tools also aren't accessible from this machine.&nbsp;
 Using Microsoft DaRT, I went into CMD and entered the command:</p>
<p><span><span>manage-bde –unlock C: -rp XXXXXX-XXXXXX</span></span><span><span>-XXXXXX</span></span><span><span>-XXXXXX</span></span><span><span>-XXXXXX</span></span><span><span>-XXXXXX</span></span><span><span>-XXXXXX</span></span><span><span>-XXXXXX&nbsp; (where
 the X's are replaced with the recovery password)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>and it says "ERROR:&nbsp; The password failed to unlock volume C."</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Then I ran the command to get the recovery key ID so I can be sure it's the right password:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>manage-bde -protectors C: -get&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Volume C: [Label Unknown]</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>All Key Protectors</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>ERROR: An error occurred (code 0x80310000):</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This drive is locked by Bitlocker Drive Encryption.&nbsp; You must unlock this drive from Control Panel.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Normally on an encrypted volume, we should still be able to see the key ID.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Microsoft DaRT disk, when entering the Recovery Tools area, would prompt for you to enter the recovery password first.&nbsp; It doesn't for this machine.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What I know from our inventory records is that this drive was in the middle of decryption (77% encrypted) but didn't finish.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I tried repair-bde but that didn't work since it wouldn't take the recovery key.</span></span></p>
<p>Dell Diagnostics shows no errors for the hard disk.</p>
<p>Does anyone have tips on what to try next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:&nbsp; Also tried mounting it as an external drive.&nbsp; When trying to unlock it, I get the message "There are no supported protectors on this drive.&nbsp; The drive can't be unlocked."</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. I also tried mounting it to earlier versions of Windows 10 and also to Windows 7 but they showed similar error messages.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the user did not have his data backed up.&nbsp; The only thing I could think of that caused this was file corruption where the Bitlocker metadata is stored.&nbsp; It's a SSD.&nbsp; I'm just glad I don't have to be the one to break the news to the user..</p>

<p>Thanks for the graphic. To paraphrase, a shared screen cap is worth a thousand words. It is very possible that your standard windows display settings had been corrupted when the<em> 'plug was pulled out'</em>.</p>
<p>To deal with your icon spacing, right click a blank area of the desktop and select<em> Personalize</em>. From the new window select<em> Windows Color</em> at the bottom. In the next window select<em> Advanced Appearance Settings....</em></p>

Figure 1.0 - Desktop Icon Spacing</p>
<p>From the<em> Item: list,</em> select<em> Icon Spacing (horizontal)</em> and modify the setting within<em> Size:</em> to the right. Repeat for<em> Icon Spacing (vertical)</em>. A standard setting would be in the 40-45 range, though this varies greatly with
 screen resolution. If you have left some desktop icons visible, you can click&nbsp;Apply and wait a second or two while the desktop icons rearrange themselves.</p>
<p>Click<em> OK</em> to save your changes to the Windows Desktop. Close any extra windows.</p>
<p>With the icon spacing back to a more reasonable setting, try CTRL+&lt;mouse wheel&gt; again.</p>

            Your computer is most likely infected with a rootkit which is the most serious type of malware.
<br />
<br />
Do you have your Windows disc or a recovery disc for re-installing Windows? If so, that would be the best option for you. However, I would recommend you format the hard drive using a third party software such as KillDisk or Dban first. Windows default formatting
 tool, fdisk, isn't really sufficient for formatting when dealing with such malware as a rootkit.
<br />
<br />
If you need assistance performing any of the above let us know. <br />

<p>Do they ever post anything other than the above instructions? If so, it's rare. So, I place no value on their instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't know for certain which is why I said most likely as opposed to "Is". I have seen this several times in the past each of which was the result of malware. While I am not a fan of Iobit, they have the only scanner I am aware of which addresses this
 rootkit specifically. I could be wrong about it being malware as I am sometimes wrong. The OP hasn't stated the error began after using Internet Explorer Administration Kit although that is not preclusive of such. Perhaps the OP can clarify the same.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Edit: The op can reset IE to see if that will solve the issue. Follow the instructions
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2006/06/12/628499.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>. If this does not solve the issue I would lean toward malware.

            I had two zbots last week and finally got that cleaned up but I did get the above message since.&nbsp; I use Firefox.&nbsp; So, I went in and reset IE so we'll see if that fixes it.&nbsp; Even though my computer was whizzing around again, it was still freezing periodically.
 I think IE got messed up because it's so intertwined and when I was messing with the zbots problem it was being fed some crazy stuff.&nbsp; They disabled my virus and malware and tried to change my home page (I got a message over and over).&nbsp; It was my fault.&nbsp; When
 Avast updated it slowed down my computer so I turned off automatic updates and whamo!&nbsp; It was just a matter of 3-4 days.&nbsp; I have had some bad emails because I ordered some bp pills from overseas and since them I have gotten these very weird emails.&nbsp; They can't
 be serious because no one would respond to them, BUT they probably think it makes you curious enough to open them, which I didn't of course.&nbsp; Somehow they got in without me opening them.&nbsp; Is that possible?&nbsp; Otherwise it's just a coincidence.&nbsp; Right now I'm
 happy, until the next freeking virus.&nbsp; Once a year or so I get a bad one.<br />

            <p>I had the same problem and finally got rid of it. This is very tricky as it is buried in the registry in two places on my computer. Microsoft registry called these stub paths.&nbsp;My registry cleaner would fix one instance but when I re-booted the 2nd one would
 replicate itself. That is why you see it running on boot-up before anything else runs.</p>
<p>How I got rid of it:</p>
<p>Click on start.</p>
<p>Type "regedit"</p>
<p>Click on regedit at top of response column.</p>
<p>Answer "yes" I really want to.</p>
<p>Make sure the very top line is selected.&nbsp; This will select your entire registry.</p>
<p>Click on "Edit", then "Find"</p>
<p>Type in "brandie4" (without quotation marks)</p>
<p>Wait for search.&nbsp; Could be several minutes.</p>
<p>Click on rundll.32iedkcs32.dll.brandie4 and delete.&nbsp; Yes, you really want to.</p>
<p>Also delete the file shown directly above.&nbsp; This one should show "1"at the end.</p>
<p>Go back to "edit", "find next" and repeat the above again.&nbsp; Do this until nothing is found.</p>
<p>I then ran Advanced System Care Ultimate 6 to clean up the dregs.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Mine has not come back.</p>

<p>I have made a decision, and that decision is to install Linux Mint 18.2&nbsp; on this computer, and since I have 2 other computers in this house, My Editing Beast, which runs Linux Mint !8.2 and Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; Now this computer runs at&nbsp; about 93% Linux use,
 our HP Laptop, it runs Linux Mint 18 .1 and Windows 8.&nbsp; It sees about a a 99% use of Linux Mint 18.1&nbsp; So I think I will install Linux Mint 18.2 on the Laptop hooked to the TV, remove any trace of Windows on IT
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows taking over my Laptop like that was the most annoying computer thing I have ever had happen to me.&nbsp; Windows should be ashamed for doing this to my or any windows computer.&nbsp; I hate Windows for this Move.&nbsp; If anyone asked me what OS they wanted. it

<h2>            Skype contacts from app not syncing with computer</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I added a new contact on Skype on my tablet.</p>
<p>When I open Skype on the computer, though, the new contact isn't in the list. When he called me, it only came through on the app, while the computer Skype remained silent. I tried looking it up again to add it again, just in case, but I can't even find any
 new contacts through the search Skype option, it just always says there are no contacts with whatever name I try typing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how to solve this?</p>

My problem is that the wheel all works like it should, but the pedals act like they are not connected. It does have all the up to date firmware updated, and is connected through the usb ports in the back of my Xbox. What can I do to to fix this problem? Btw, it does work perfectly on the pc.</p>

                    I have a surface book that is less than a year old, and before going to bed last night I shut it down. Upon going to use it today it will not turn on. I have tried each of the troubleshooting steps located here:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/4023537.
 Are there any other suggestions people have? It is less than a month old and this has happened twice, so I'm looking for a way to turn it on so that I can scrub my data and return it because it looks like these things are plagued by this issue pretty heavily.

            Hi Michelle,
<br />
<br />You should take it in to your local Microsoft Store for evaluation for either repair or replacement if still in warranty. They do have a way of extracting data if the unit if it is not a complete hardware failure.

<h2>            How to change language to English from Chinese on WM10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought an international version of Lumia 640xl. It booted up in Chinese but was easy to select English.</p>
<p>But today I installed the Windows Mobile 10 assuming it would retain the English language.&nbsp; But no, it defaulted back to Chinese</p>
<p>and this time, it offered no easy option to select English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, I've poked around but it's pretty hopeless.</p>
<p>Can anyone offer guidance here?</p>
<p>Is there a WM10 Manual which I could use in deciphering some pages?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Realtek Semiconductor Corp. driver update for Realtek High Definition Audio</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as Windows 10 installs the Realtek Semiconductor Corp. driver update for Realtek High Definition Audio my audio becomes so low you cant hear it. If I uninstall the realtek drivers its fine for a short time before Windows 10 decides to 'upgrade' the
 driver again. Every realtek driver I install does the same. Only time I get audio is for a few minutes after rebooting after removing the drivers. Is there anyway just to stop windows from upgrading this particular driver?</p>

<span>
</span></p><p>http://windowsinstructed.com/disable-automatic-device-driver-download-in-windows-10/</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above by itself didn't stop the realtek driver to keep getting installed. Don't know why maybe because Windows already downloaded it somewhere.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</p>
<p>
</p><p>then used above hide tool and hid the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalled the realtek driver and just let it use generic driver and I get sound without issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this will get fixed in a future update.</p>

<h2>            XAudio2_7.dll Causing Far Cry 3 Crash</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be a very common problem. Far Cry 3 crashes after exactly 15 minutes of gameplay, and the culprit is XAudio2_7.dll.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've contacted Ubisoft about this, but since FC3 isn't officially Windows 10 compatible, they're not gonna do anything about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means that the only fix would be for Microsoft to release a patch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Far Cry 3 isn't the only game affected by this; Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, Assassin's Creed 4 and Assassin's Creed V are also having this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone from MS is reading this, it would be much appreciated if this issue can be sent to the developers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone was having the same issue but somehow fixed it, please show me how!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jehan</p>

<br />
Kill the process - TabTip (task manager - Details tab)<br />
<br />
I had tried everything - different sound cards, DX reinstalls, C libraries, different versions of &nbsp;xaudio2_7.dll - you name it... this made the game stable for me after having the XAudio error.

            THANK YOU! A hundred times, thank you! It's also fixing the crash with various other games. Currently testing Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning with this fix.<br />

Microsoft, you need to patch this virtual keyboard so it doesn't interfere with AUDIO DRIVERS!<br />

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; A network cable is not properly plugged in or may be broken</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>After upgrading to windows 10 from windows 7, it says "not connected no connections are available" in the bottom right. When I troubleshoot it says "a network cable is not properly plugged in or may be broken". My Internet works on all other devices and
 the same cable I'm using works fine on another device. This only started after upgrading to windows 10. What could be wrong?</p>

            Went on another computer, downloaded the newer network drivers saved them to a cd. Then I installed them onto my computer and it works now, thanks.

<h2>            Windows 10 &#39;Record That&#39; doesn&#39;t work properly</h2>
                    As an avid gamer, I want to be able to record instant replay clips whenever something exciting happens. However, since the recent major update to Windows 10, this no longer works for any full-screen game I play. It used to work just fine before that, but
 not anymore. Every time I hit 'Record That' in the game bar, it produces either a video with a white box or nothing but blackness over the audio, occasionally with the mouse cursor visible. Can someone please give me advice on how to fix this?

<p>Hi Black Vulpine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this up. Based on the information that you've provided, it's possible that the Windows Update applied on your computer affects the functionality of Game bar on Windows 10. Can you tell us if you updated your computer drivers as well
 after applying the Windows 10 Update? Also, what troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I recommend that you download and run the Windows Update troubleshooter to scan and repair the Windows Update to make sure that it's not corrupted. You may refer to this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em> to download the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Do get back to us with the results. We'd be more than willing to provide you additional help.</span></p>

<p>The troubleshooter test, even after being run as an elevated process, came back negative. No faults found, except for 'check for updates', which I did manually, and discovered
<strong>2018-05 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1803 for x64-based Systems (KB4100403)</strong>. Meanwhile, I made sure to check that my graphics drivers were up to date (in fact, I even clean-installed some of them), and even reinstalled some of my
 built-in software, necessary to keep the computer functioning healthily. The device I use, if it helps, is an ASUStek FX553VD gaming laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also highlight the fact that this issue only occurs on full-screen games, and even then, only&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Record That</span> is affected. If I use

<p>I appreciate your reply. Have you tried uninstalling the recent Windows Update on your computer? It's possible that uninstalling it could help to make the "Record That" command to work on full-screen games. You can also try to perform a clean boot on your
 computer to eliminate software conflicts. You may refer to this <em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em> for the steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your reply.</p>

<p>I am unwilling to roll my system back, although I am certain that will fix the problem. The reason I won't do it is because the new system has features that are ultimately much more useful for me and I feel I would not be able to do without them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I instead opted for the clean boot, which did not solve the problem. Between this and my last reply to this post however, I did discover that this bug only occurs for SOME of my full-screen games, not all of them as I had thought previously. Here are the
 ones where the bug occurs&nbsp;<strong>that I have confirmed</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assassin's Creed (1)</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed II<br />
Assassin's Creed Brotherhood</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Revelations</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed III<br />
Pinball FX2</p>
<p>Pinball FX3</p>
<p>Portal 2 (but not Portal 1)</p>
<p>Red Faction Guerrilla Steam Edition - Game Bar doesn't function at all, but a clip is successfully and correctly created upon keystroke (Win+Alt+G)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should be worth noting that I have a range of other games, and some of my other games I confirmed that the bug does NOT occur within them. However, given these games are from varying developers, it is unlikely that it has something to do with a mysterious
 setting within the games, unless they perhaps each use the same engine or something. Take from this what you will, and hopefully it will shed light on the matter.</p>
