<p>modders have been getting bad i agree on xbox live. I dont play gta4 much anymore due to it.. But yes i know, I agree with 100%. &nbsp;Couple days ago i was on it, And i must of shot this guy/girl atleast 100 times and they did not die, yet they can kill me..
 I am so annoyed with the game play on xbox live, For COD games and also gta games.. so pathetic how people can cheat... Yeah they are smart to do to it, But C"mon on xbox live going against real people is just wrong... It's like a guy/girl cheating on there
 spouse thinking they wont get caught... but they will. Hopefully... </p>

<p>Modding is actually not that difficult. If you read an sort of modding forum out there, you would see how easy it is. I agree; modding has gotten out of hand but IMO Microsfot and the XBL PET Team won't do much to enforce it. Plus, people can easily make
 another account and unban their consoles. What you should do is start palying in private matches with your friends or stay out of game lobbies with Friendly Fire: "ON". This is where you will find most modders nowadays. If that don't work, change up your preferences;
 most modders today are not found in Friendly Fire: OFF games nor Cops: ON games.</p>

    <title>Cortana does not exist on my Windows 10 in US - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lizaford  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana does not exist on my Windows 10 in US</h2>
                    <p>I already have asked this question. &nbsp;Community is not user friendly as I cannot find thread for this discussion so need to tart anew one--even when I click on link in email that there is an answer, it does not take me to the answer. &nbsp;Don't know why this
 is so complicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Cortana exists nowhere for me to enable. &nbsp;Do I need to download it? &nbsp;If so, how? &nbsp;It has nothing to do with my language setting which is the standard reply I always receive. &nbsp;Help, please, from someone who understands I have NO CORTANA. &nbsp;When I click
 on app it goes right to search bar. &nbsp;I had Cortana when I upgraded to Windows 10 and then there was an update that deleted it?</p>

 not work.&nbsp; And no new comments or suggestions about how to really fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have cortana on my system--it disappeared.&nbsp; Is there no way to get it back?&nbsp; The language answer doesn't apply; another answer to click on Cortan in settings does not apply as there is no Coratana in settings, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;Microsoft, please help!</p>

<p>
</p><p>No, I only have the administrator account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I search for cortana in settings it shows "Cortana and search settings"&nbsp; which do nothing, only offering a link to Cortana and search sttings which is of no help.</p>

            <p>Hi there,<br /><br />Remeeming errors can be caused by issues on the account itself. Be sure to check if your billing information is correct at http://billing.microsoft.com and also check http://account.microsoft.com/services for any outstanding amount issues, these need to be sorted prior to being able to redeem codes. <br />After that try redeeming the code on both xbox console and via xbox.com/redeemcode<br />Also check that the Xbox Live account, the console and code all match region wise, using different regions for any of them cause issues too.<br /><br />If you can't find anything wrong and it is still not working, best thing to do is to contact official Xbox Support via Phone or Microsoft Support Chat at http://support.xbox.com/contact-us they can do a more indepth look into this issue.</p>

    <title>Halloween Charity Skin Pack - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charybdian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Halloween Charity Skin Pack</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased the Halloween Charity Skin Pack way back when, though recently when I went into Minecraft all the skins from that pack are locked. I had downloaded several demo skin packs, and now I can select some (not all) of those skins to use. For example,
 in Battle &amp; Beasts 2 I can select the Highland Woman to use, but I can't select Highland Man; I technically shouldn't have access to either since all I have is the demo of the skin pack. I have cleared the cache, and I would uninstall and download the Halloween
 Skin Pack again except it is no longer available. Any ideas?</p>

<p>I had the exact same problem! If you have a Virgin Media Super Hub. Here's how to solve it. In a web browser (Can be on Xbox One's Internet Explorer) type 192.168.0.1 Then go to advanced settings at the bottom. Then Wireless Radio and under Wireless Mode
 change it to 54Mps. The 2nd day i had my Xbox One it kept disconnecting every 2 minutes and kept kicking me out of GTA Online. I contacted support and they made me re-install all 40+ Gb of Grand Theft Auto.</p>

<p>You may want to try to open your ports in your router don't do a port forward but do a port triggering since you are using multiple xbox consoles ports can be found here

<p>port triggering is usually close to port forwarding.</p>
<p>Once you have opened these ports please turn off all Xbox's unplug router for 30 sec and plug back in. Then do a multiplayer connection test to see if Nat is open and your connected to live</p>

<p>Thank you for the information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From screenshot, it seems that the size of the screen is correct according to Windows.</p>
<p>If you still have issues you may try resetting the monitor settinngs to default. You may refer to the monitor manual to reset the monitor settings to default.</p>

<h2>            Canon LBP 2900B Printer not recgonised by windows 10.</h2>
                    I have recently upgraded Windows 10&nbsp; from Windows 7. Ever since then I am facing the Printer Problems as it is not shown in the available Printers List. I tried with Microsoft Help Desk on phone, I was told that this is not our issue , hence please contact
 Printer Manufacturer i.e. Canon and or your Lap Top Manufacturer L.G. Upon contacting both have stated that this is not their issue since the same was working fine with Windows7. Again when I contacted Microsoft Help Desk 1800 102 1100 and spoke with them,
 they said they do not have any solution for it. Also While searching in&nbsp; Digital Drivers option in Canon, Make LBP 2900 B is not their. I have become a Foot Ball. Any body like to score a Wining Goal.&nbsp; Also please let me know how can I send an email to MR.

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>There appear to be Windows 10 drivers here for your printer:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.canon.co.uk/support/consumer_products/products/printers/laser/i-sensys_lbp2900b.aspx?type=drivers&amp;language=EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.canon.co.uk/support/consumer_products/products/printers/laser/i-sensys_lbp2900b.aspx?type=drivers&amp;language=EN</a>
 .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please ensure that this is your printer, that you select 32 or 64-Bit Windows 10 drivers (according to whether you have Windows 10 32 or 64-Bit) and follow any installation instructions.</p>
        </p>

            <p>No my problem is as it is. In fact before this suggestion, I had already tried these steps but &nbsp;still the Printer is not recognized by windows 10 32 bit.&nbsp; In fact Canon LBP2900B drivers are not found. Instead, Canon 2900 / 2900B CAPT printers drivers are
 being installed every time. Canon 2900B CAPT printer is shown in the unrecognized devices in the control panel/ Devices and Printers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any new trial and error methods; no harm in trying. Please suggest and or advice. "However Very Very, Very thanks to Microsoft , Canon and to L.G Companies for making me a FOOTBALL. Let see who can Score the Winning Goal or one has to toss for victory.&nbsp;"</p>

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried several times by again downloading the printer driver from the above list. But Windows 10 is not detecting the printer at all. Also tried several times by turning off / turning on the printer and re-plugging the USB cable. Since
<strong>Windows 10 is not recognizing the device</strong>, printer drivers are not installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the only problem with Windows 10. It also creates problem in MS Office (Student &amp; Home - 2010) almost every time Windows 10 updates are downloaded and installed in my Dell N 5110 Laptop. This is the reason I stopped updating Windows 10 as it
 has several compatibility issues with other softwares. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This canon LBP 2900B was working in Windows 10 before some updates which created compatibility issues with MS Office, Canon printer and other software. As a result, I had to uninstall the updates and restore my system to previous time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps this is the destiny of many unfortunate users like me, who upgraded their machines to Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            My taskbar and sidebar turned white.</h2>
                    My taskbar used to be black and my side bar was clear, now they are both white. This didn't happen to any of the other users on the computer. How do I get them to go back to normal?

<h2>            Windows 7 Action Center say Norton 360 and firewall are turned off</h2>
                    My Windows Action Center is telling me that my virus protection and firewall are turned off. &nbsp;I read an earlier post stating that these are archival messages and they will show even if they were off at some point&nbsp;(which I don't think they were) but regardless...my
 question is, how do I get the Action Center to stop showing the alert messages but still monitor both the virus and firewall protection.
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I click on the "Turn On Now" button it brings up Norton 360 and everything shows that it is working properly but the alert does not go away
<strong>and </strong>Norton stills shows as being off in the Action Center.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance!</div>

 on this forum can do. T10 has been banning folks since F3 for auction house and storefront violations, the 1st bans were suppose to correct your behavior. have fun with your game, perhaps you'll be unbanned in forza 5....</p>

    <title>Just received Spring 2018 update, Microphone settings are borked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> huan0144  say:</h3>
<h2>            Just received Spring 2018 update, Microphone settings are borked</h2>
                    <p>Symptom: Microphone appears to not be recording any sound levels. Troubleshooting turns up nothing. Drivers are fine. Microphone-attached headphone output is functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Identified Workaround: <strong>"</strong><span><strong>2. Allow apps to access your microphone - Make it ON" per&nbsp;</strong></span>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/update-has-broken-my-microphone/c666f06c-b63b-4cd6-9f57-a95857ecb3a7?rtAction=1528475190188</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue/Question/Complaint:<br />
<br />
This was not the behavior before.&nbsp;<span>This was not previously necessary for a functional microphone in the majority of use cases. Notably, the new update broke the expected behavior of the settings.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Previously:<br />
If "Allow apps" = off</span></p>
<p><span>-&gt; Microphone still worked with applications (e.g. games, VOIP, non-Edge browsers, Audacity)</span></p>
<p><span>-&gt; Apps were globally denied microphone access by default. No micromanagement, no worries about entries not showing in the listing or other problems.</span><span>-&gt; Can still see microphone
 responsiveness (test bar) in sound settings</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Currently:<br />
If "Allow apps" = off</span>-&gt; Microphone globally does not work with any application<span>(e.g. games, VOIP, non-Edge browsers, Audacity)</span>, nor even with Windows itself</p>
<p>-&gt; Apps cannot be globally denied microphone access by default assuming there is ANYTHING on your system you wish to use a microphone with. You now have to micromanage your installed apps and make sure nothing is skating by the individually set filters somehow.</p>
<p>-&gt; Cannot see microphone responsiveness (test bar) in sound settings; microphone appears nonfunctional to end user (clarity of problem is non existent; your HCI guys either didn't have a look at this or need reeducating)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"It does not block Windows."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Except that for all intents and purposes it does. Neither sound manager nor third party installed applications have ANY access to the microphone, now, if App access is denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question to Microsoft is whether this is an <strong>intentional </strong>
behavior change to how the sound and privacy settings function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's worth noting that if the answer is&nbsp;<em>yes (intended change)</em>, then you have made an unnecessary change to functionality that fails many of the primary UX/HCI tenets; e.g. clarity, consistency, control. The change creates problems that the system
 does not alert the user, and the user cannot intuitively identify. The change is inconsistent with how previous users have learned the system, as inconsistent with&nbsp;<em>the actual god damned explanation text</em> ("does not block Windows"). The change complicates
 control for the user by forcing them to micromanage something that could have been globally set before, increasing the odds of something falling through the cracks and leading to undesirable outcomes.<br />

It is highly likely that your disk got damaged in the fall. You need to replace it and reload Windows. When finished, put the old disk into a USB case. You might be able to retrieve some of your files. If not then you need to treat this unfortunate incident
 as a harsh reminder that you must back up important/irreplaceable files regularly (e.g. weekly) to an external medium. Best to buy two new disks right now: A replacement for the damaged disk and a smaller disk as your external backup medium.<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 reinstallation</h2>
                    <p>Due to a fatal system error, I've been advised to reinstall the Windows operating software on my desktop.&nbsp; When I purchased the computer, it came with Vista Home Premium.&nbsp; I upgraded to Windows 7 Home Premium last year.&nbsp; I've received conflicting views about
 the reinstallation of Windows 7.&nbsp; I've been told I should be able to reinstall Windows 7 by simply using the upgrade disc.&nbsp; I've also been told that I will have to reinstall Windows Vista first and then reinstall Windows 7 using the upgrade disc, although
 this may be related to the computer manufacturer warranty.&nbsp; Does anyone else have any expertise on the topic?&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp;

            <p>If your computer came with a previous qualifying license such as Windows Vista or Windows XP and the Certificate of Authencity is still attached to the machine in good condition, then the COA is reason enough for representing compliance to the software license
 agreement. No actual installation of previous software necessary, which means you can do a clean install with Windows 7 Upgrade disk.</p>
<p>How to do a clean install with the upgrade disk:</p>
<p>Boot from the Windows 7 DVD</p>
<p>Click Install Now</p>
<p>Accept License Agreement</p>
<p>When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>Click Drive Options</p>
<p>Select the drive/s click Delete</p>
<p>Click New</p>
<p>Click Apply</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>Click Format and click Next to proceed with the installation</p>
<p>Skip entering your Windows 7 product key and complete the installation.</p>
<p>Once you reach the desktop, click Start, right click Computer</p>
<p>Click Properties</p>
<p>Scroll down to Windows Activation</p>
<p>Click the link x days until activation.</p>
<p>Click the link that says 'Show me other ways to activate'</p>
<p>Enter product key</p>
<p>Click Next</p>
<p>Select Phone Activation</p>
<p>Click Next when Enter your key page displayed</p>
<p>Select your country</p>
<p>Click Next, call the number listed</p>
<p>Remember to explain to the call agent your situation.</p>
<p>Provide the generated installation ID when requested by the call agent</p>
<p>They will give you a confirmation ID in return, enter it</p>
<p>Click Next to complete the activation. </p>
<p>The requirements for upgrade media though is that you have a previously qualifying operating system such as Windows XP or Vista installed to use it. From the Windows 7 End User License Agreement.</p>
<p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from.</p>
<p>So, if you are still denied, you will have to simply reinstall Windows XP or Vista and let it do the eligibility check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The safest choice is to first reinstall the original operating system (qualifying product), then do the upgrade over that install.

<h2>            How to preview several .wmf files on CDs without opening each file </h2>
                    
<p>Preview WMF files in Windows 7</p>
<p>I was wondering if it is possible for me to preview wmf files I have on CDs. Several years back I purchased some Graphic CDs and on the CDS are images that I would like to be able to browse before selecting one. I can use Adobe Illustrator and have tried
 some 3rd party solutions but none allow me to actually open the cd and browse the images. I have to open the image to see what it is, which is very time consuming when you are talking about several hundred images per cd.</p>

=============================<br />
<div>If these are older CDs&nbsp;and you cannot open <br />
them...you may need to find a UDF Reader <br />
that will be compatible with Win7.<br />
<br />
If you can open the CDs but just cannot view <br />
the .wmf files...The freeware IrfanView might <br />
be worth a try...<br />
<br />
After downloading and installing the software...<br />
open IrfanView and go to...File / Thumbnails...</div>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Check drivers and memory testing methods.</p>
<p>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (drivers and BIOS).<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For<br />
each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description,<br />
version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
---------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method</strong><br />

For the Vista Memory Diagnostic Tool<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt;&nbsp; Memory - find Memory Diagnostics tool at top of list - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
follow the instructions<br />

This could be heat,&nbsp;defective hardware or memory, BIOS or Driver&nbsp;related. Make sure the system<br />
has adequate ventilation. Note that the BugCheck indicates a "<strong>FATAL HARDWARE ERROR</strong>". You<br />
may need a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or other BigBox stores) or the<br />
System maker's Support.&nbsp;Be sure all vents are&nbsp;clean and clear - try adding a small fan to blow<br />
into the&nbsp;vents to see if heat is an issue.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 124&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000124<br />

</strong>The WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR bug check has a value of 0x00000124. This bug check indicates<br />
that a <strong>fatal hardware error</strong> has occurred. This bug check uses the error data that is provided by the<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however there<br />
are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or Recovery<br />

The log might give you the answer if there was a corrupted driver. (Does not tell all the possible<br />
driver issues). <br />

Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

    <title>Direct Launch Application Buttons are driving me nuts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gamer6789  say:</h3>
<h2>            Direct Launch Application Buttons are driving me nuts</h2>
                    
<p>I own an Alienware Area-51 m9750 Gaming Laptop running Windows Vista Home Premium 32bit, which I use almost exclusively for playing World of Warcraft. It has, above the function keys on it's keyboard, some direct application launch buttons, which are an
 absolute nightmare. I'm 6'3" and 215 lbs, and my hands are big, so when I'm playing World of Warcraft, during hectic battles I hit keys so quickly that the tips of of my left Index and Middle fingers sometimes graze my Internet Explorer and Windows Mail buttons.<br />
<br />
My record after one WoW session currently stands at 49 (yes, forty-nine, four-nine) copies of Internet Explorer open, and one copy of Windows Mail (I never use either of these programs for anything, as I use Firefox for both web browsing and web-based email),
 but WoW gets mighty slow when it's competing with forty-nine copies of Internet Explorer for system resources.<br />
<br />
I've been googling this for hours, as well as searching both Alienware's and Microsoft's websites, but I can't find a single post about how to turn off or otherwise disable these ever so troublesome and grossly unnecessary buttons.</p>
<p>I went into the device manager and found that, much to my dismay, the "Disable" option for all five direct application launch buttons is grayed out, and I assume if I hit "Uninstall," Windows will simply detect them and reinstall them immediately, or crash
 my computer, seeing that they seem to be part of my motherboard.<br />
<br />
I'm about ready to take a large, (sharp) flathead screwdriver and tear them out of my computer, but something tells me that would do significantly more harm than good (as computers generally do not respond well to reckless hardware removal fueled by extreme
 user frustration).<br />
<br />
If someone could tell me how I can disable, permanently (at least until I willfully turn them on again), these infernal contraptions so I never need to think about them ever again, that would be most excellent. They are nothing but a nuisance, I have no practical
 need or use for them whatsoever, and I want them GONE.</p>

<p>I finally found the answer the this question on my own.&nbsp; While looking through my computer's user manual for something entirely different, I came across a section on special keyboard functions.&nbsp; It appears that my ever-so-annoying direct application launch
 buttons can be disabled (and then enabled again) simply by pressing the Fn and F11 keys at the same time, and I have done that, and they are no longer bothering me.</p>
<p>You have my sincere apology for wasting your time, I feel really stupid about this.</p>
<p>Thanks much!</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem with the update KB2633171, it's downloaded to my computer, but it will not it install. Keeps popping up an error code 0x8007054F, and it keeps trying to install the update&nbsp;into my computer about every 10 minutes, with the same
 error code. I've tried shutting all other programs down, cleaned the history files in the browser, ran the chkdsk and clean everything out, also defragmented the hard drive. Next ran my anti-virus scans nothing shows up. My computer is still having the same
 problem, also one other thing I noticed since this updated problem&nbsp;started my computer is starting to run a little slower on startups and trying to access the internet. What should I try to do next?</p>

    <title>Adding videos made with Movie Maker to Existing Project with Movie - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Adding videos made with Movie Maker to Existing Project with Movie Maker</h2>
                    I am having a very difficult time adding saved projects from Movie Maker to other saved projects. When I go to the File tab, I can open the first part of the movie. However, when I add or try to add the other saved projects, the first saved project goes
 away and I only get the next saved project. Here is an example.<br />
<br />
<br />
Beginning Credits are opened when I go to File, then click on Open Project. The credits show up.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I go back to File, Open Existing Project, the beginning credits go away and the next existing project comes on.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I work with Windows 8.<br />
Thank you.<br />

            <p>If you are trying to join together two separate projects, it is probably much easier to save each part as a
<u>movie</u> and then join those movies together in a new <u>project</u>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let's take an example where you have two <u>projects</u> called "Part 1" and "Part 2".&nbsp; Open up the
<u>project</u> file for "Part 1".&nbsp; Save that as a <u>movie</u> using <strong>File</strong> &gt;
<strong>Save movie</strong>.&nbsp; I'll assume you use the name of "Movie Part 1".&nbsp; Now close that
<u>project</u> and open up the <u>project</u> file for "Part 2".&nbsp; Again, save that as a
<u>movie</u> and give it a name of "Movie Part 2".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now open up Movie Maker and start a completely new project.&nbsp; Click on <strong>
Add videos and photos</strong>.&nbsp; Select the two <u>movie</u> files that you created for parts 1 and 2 (i.e. "Movie Part 1" and "Movie Part 2").&nbsp; Remember, these are the created
<u>movie</u> files, not the <u>project</u> files.</p>
<p><br />
The result is you should see two videos in your storyboard/project area.&nbsp; If you play them, you should see part 1 play back, then part 2.&nbsp; You can add a transition between if you like, or just leave them as is.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now save this project and also the final movie.&nbsp; The resulting video file will be everything from part 1 and 2 of your movie.</p>

    <title>ATI Theater 650 Pro digital tuner not detected &#47; set-up in Media - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            ATI Theater 650 Pro digital tuner not detected &#47; set-up in Media Center</h2>
                    I have Vista 64 Ultimate with SP2 and an ATI Theater 650 Pro with the latest ATI driver installed. Media Center will not detect and setup the digital tuner, only the analog (tuner works fine - get all analog and digital channels -&nbsp;in Win7 RC). Indicates
 that other tuners were detected bu they won't be set up because of missing or incompatible signals connected to them. I have installed EVERY available ATI driver in turn, including the ones from Dell (the card/system supplier). I have reinstalled windows several
 times (at Dell's request). The tuner has never once attempted to tune the digital and&nbsp;HDTV cable signals. It worked the first time in Win 7 RC.<br />
<br />
Does ANYONE have a way to make this work? Thanks!&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi
<span>Carl,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is the exact error message you receive?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Change the
<strong>Windows Media Center Receiver Service</strong> from a specific account name to a Local System account:</span><strong><span>
</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Start-Run, type
<strong>services.msc</strong>, the click on OK. </span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When the Services window loads, navigate to the
<strong>"</strong></span><strong><span> Windows Media Center Receiver Service</span></strong><span>
</span><strong><span>",</span></strong><span> the double click on it to open it,</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<strong>Log On</strong> tab, and then select <strong>Local System account</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on "<strong>apply", then OK on
</strong></span><span>Services warning message</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer.</span><span>
</span><span>Click
<strong>OK</strong> again and restart the computer</span></p>
<p><span>Now check to see if the issue is resolved.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Disable the security software and update the motherboard chipset driver from DELL
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>To disable the security software, follow the steps mentioned below</span></strong></p>
