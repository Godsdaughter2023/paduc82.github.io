<p>I suspect that you're referring to a page/message that popped up while browsing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not from Microsoft, it's spam/phishing. You're simply trapped in a JavaScript loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Task Manager from Ctrl+Alt+Del and close all processes of the browser. That should get you out of the locked-up situation.</p>

<h2>            All of my emails were deleted from my inbox&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Today, I&nbsp;logged on to my email to find all of my emails deleted. I click on the deleted folder and there they are, but I can not recover them unless I go email by email. I had over 1,00 emails that were in my inbox that I still need for school. When I clicked
 on recover deleted items, it does not show my emails in the new pop up window so that I can recover them all at once. Please help. I don't want them to be permanently deleted, but I don/t have time to go one by one.</p>

<p>Am I having this problem because my domain is registered with both services?</p>

<p>How does one delete the domain from domains.live.com?&nbsp; When I try to manage my domain logging into domains.live.com, it says my domain is already registered with Microsoft and that I need to contact support.&nbsp; I have gotten no where when trying to seek help

<p>As 93tid has mentioned, the only way of getting that information is through access to your Microsoft account. it doesn't matter which phone you have, model number or anything like that, because that information is irrelevant.</p>
<p>there is no "hacking" involved, just someone who got your password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but remember this: with the (little)&nbsp;information you've provided, there's no guarantee that this person has not just taken screenshots of existing data and doesn't actually have access to anything else. if this is the case, then there is even less to worry
 about (and less for you to do).</p>

<h2>            Internal email going to junk folder in O365&#47;Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>From last week (August 2017) email from one of our internal staff members has started going directly into people's junk folder. I have read the detail in this in KB article:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/2878323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">2878323</a><span>&nbsp;Description
 of the Outlook 2013 hotfix package (Outlook-x-none.msp): April 8, 2014</span></p>
<p>Since we are running the latest versions of Outlook 2013 and O365, I'm thinking it won't help
 to apply this hotfix since the version we're running is far past this hotfix. I have disabled junk filtering in O365 and Outlook 2013 on the affected users' accounts/PCs. This has not helped. I cannot whitelist the user whose email is being blocked since the
 are internal to the company. No-one has any forwarding rules or other customizations set up. It's odd since it affects the incoming email of only one user and it randomly started last week without us making any changes to office or Exchange. The user is connecting
 in the same as everyone else and running the same versions of O365 and Outlook. We have ESET enabled in Outlook, but that has also not changed recently. Does anybody else have this issue and any experience solving it?</p>

<p>hi abdalsalam,</p>
<p>thanks for your clarification.</p>
<p>given the situation, please double confirm whether the users (mailboxes) with *** Email address is removed for privacy *** have something in common (excepting the same domain *** Email address is removed for privacy ***). such as, the same attributes (1-15), department, location and so on.</p>
<p>if not, it is not feasible to do that. you can submit your feedback via the link:<a href="http://office365.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office365.uservoice.com</a>/ to our related team. many products’ features have been designed or upgraded based on customers’
 constructive ideas. thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>if so, (take the same “attribute1” for example) you can try create a new address book policy (abp) and assign it. the detailed steps are:<br />
1.&nbsp;add the address lists role to one role group, for example, my admin account belong to the organization management role group, i add the address lists role to this group.
<br />
2.&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj984289%28v=exchg.160%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">connect to exchange online powershell</a> with
<strong>an admin</strong> credential.<br />
3.&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj891095%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">enable address book policy routing</a>.<br />
4.&nbsp;create a new room (resource) list named “room1”. run the cmdlet:<br />
new-addresslist -name "room2" -recipientfilter {(customattribute1 -eq "alanwu.info")}<br />
5.&nbsp;create a new custom address list called “list1”: this address list will contain the users of “*** Email address is removed for privacy ***”. run the cmdlet:<br />
new-addresslist -name list1 -recipientfilter{(customattribute1 -*** Email address is removed for privacy ***')}<br />
6.&nbsp;create a new global address list (gal) named “gal1”. run the cmdlet:<br />
new-globaladdresslist -name "gal1" -recipientfilter {(customattribute1 -eq "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***")}<br />
7.&nbsp;create a new offline address book list (oab) named “oab1”. run the cmdlet:<br />
new-offlineaddressbook -name "oab1" -addresslists "gal1"<br />
8.&nbsp;create a new address book policy (abp) named “abp1”. run the cmdlet:<br />
new-addressbookpolicy -name "abp1" -addresslists "list1" -offlineaddressbook "\oab1" -globaladdresslist "\gal1" -roomlist "\room1"<br />
9.&nbsp;assign this address policy to the users within “domain1” in exchange admin center.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=b57e22bf-e9a3-4596-8196-d756ec6bc4fe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3db57e22bf-e9a3-4596-8196-d756ec6bc4fe" /></a><br />
you can assign this address book policy to other users of this domain. besides, for the users of another domain (“domain2”), you can create an additional address book policy, and assign it to them.</p>

<div><br />
<div>I am using Chrome (most recent version), &nbsp;I also have I.E. 9 &nbsp;and Firefox. &nbsp;It is not that things are not displaying correctly. &nbsp;It is &nbsp;that any photos/pictures/graphics &nbsp; automatically &nbsp;display and links &nbsp;are automatically &nbsp;clickable. &nbsp;With Hotmail, &nbsp;I
 was able to set it so that pictures/graphics &nbsp;were not automatically displayed &nbsp;and links were NOT &nbsp;clickable automatically. &nbsp;When an email with links &nbsp;and or/graphics &nbsp;was opened, &nbsp;there would be a message/option to "enable" &nbsp;the content if I so wanted. &nbsp;That
 is the feature &nbsp;I &nbsp;want &nbsp;back &nbsp;in Outlook.<br />

    <title>N70 Bluetooth problems &#40;tomtom and headsets&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gavc_uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            N70 Bluetooth problems &#40;tomtom and headsets&#41;</h2>
                    Lots of people are experiencing problems relating to tomtom mobile 5.<br />
<br />
The problem is seen after a seemingly random time period whereby the bluetooth gps sees its connection dropped to the handset. Many people have suspected that this was because tomtom do not support the N70.<br />
<br />
Well now tomtom are stating the N70 on their compatibility list!<br />
<br />
Personally, I wonder wheter the issue is really in the bluetooth softare for the N70. I for one have problems connecting my headset (motorola HS-810) to the N70. It seems I am not alone on this too, indeed many Nokia headset users are also having difficulties.<br />
<br />
Me thinks Nokia need to do some testing and see if bluetooth is correctly implemented as lots of users need to improve their experience of both headset and tomtom use.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I had a Nokia bluetooth headset but my N70 would not connect to it after 1 days use. On the seconday, i would switch it on and it would not connect, however, it did say "disconnected" when i switched it off. I took it back to the shop and they suggested changing
 the phone, which i did but the same thing happened. Have now trie a Pantronics headset but that is just as bad if not worse. It connected 1st time but according to the phone it stayed connected even though i left it work and drove a mile down the road. Since
 then, it will not connect but i do get the "disconnected" message when switching off.<br />
<br />
I asked some else i know who has an N70 and he has had problems so is this a common problem?<br />
Are there any bluetooth headsets that work well with the N70?<br />
<br />
Regards Toby.

            Hi Toby!<br />
<br />
Welcome to the Nokia Support Discussion.<br />
<br />
You might want to take your phone in to a Nokia Service Point to have the firmware checked out.<br />
<br />
Have you confirmed the Plantronics headset is compatible with the N70? What model of headset do you have?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
-<br />
Karim

            i doubt this has anything to do with the phone, your trying to connect it to two thrid party devices.<br />
<br />
one of my colleagues has just got one of these n70's along with a bluetooth headset(nokia one) and the ld-1w. his works fine.<br />
<br />
in fact, other than the route planning software being a bit slow (wayfinder) it all works pretty well, he can even use the headset at the same time

            Can you elaborate on your reasoning for why this is not a problem relating to the phone?<br />
<br />
I can appreciate that not every user and every bluetooth headset is causing problems but there are plenty of users in these and other forums describing problems connecting headsets and bluetooth gps whether both at once (which should work with bluetooth 2.0)
 or individually.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure whether to view your friends experience anectdotally or maybe you know more about the technology involved and can help understand where this issue might reside and so help resolve it.

            Hi,<br />
New to this forum, but got my N70 10 days ago, so joined.<br />
<br />
With regards the bluetooth tom tom issue.<br />
<br />
I got a BT GPS receiver I used to use with my P910i (hell of a phone) and Route 66 sat nav software. Both worked excellently, started up and connected in under 10 seconds everythime.<br />
<br />
When I pair the receiver with my N70, everything seems ok. Then I activate tom tom and it connects if and when it wants to. Sometimes it does so in 10 seconds, other times it says no GPS signal. This is not the receiver as it still works if i swap back to my
 P910. <br />
<br />
Tom Tom or Nokia.... one has a problem, and it needs sorting out... <br />
<br />
Nokia, connecting people? maybe not !!<br />
<br />
P.S. Why does the blue keypad light do its own thing as well?

            My N90 also having bluetooth connection problem with the Nokia HDW-3 headset. After using the headset for a while and off it, the connection cannot be establised if on the headset again. The bluetooth icon will show the "bracket" sign only. However, the
 N90 is not showing the headset icon and the headset cannot be used. If I off the headset, the phone will show the message of "The headset disconnected from the phone. If I try to connect using the phone bluetooth mennu manually, it will show "Failed to make
 bluetooth connection". In order to overcome this problem, I have to reboot the phone. This is very anoying. I have check with the local Nokia service center this morning, my phone firmware (v3.0.545.5.1) is the latest one. Nothing can be done to fix it for
 now. Hope that Nokia will fix this problem soon with the new firmware upgrade.

            I like a lot of people are having problems with Bluetooth and Tom Tom Mobile 5 on my N70.<br />
<br />
The problems manifest themselves usually as a loss of GPS signal so Tom Tom freezes at the last GPS Fix, the phone display will dim when it thinks it has lost its bluetooth connection but the phone and the GPS receiver stay connected, I have to turn the N70
 off and back on and Tom Tom will restart. The restart point is often back on the same route but the sound is generally tuned off, the loss of GPS signal can vary from less than a minute to around 30 mins, occasionally Tom Tom will freeze part way through an
 instruction when it loses its GPS fix.<br />
<br />
After some reading of the forums and some trial and error I have being able to get Tom Tom to operate fairly well. Before I go on a journey I turn my phone off and leave it off for 30 seconds or so, then when the phone is back on I run Tom Tom and allow Tom
 Tom to connect to the bluetooth GPS receiver in the preferences / show GPS status menu, if I allow the phone to connect to the GPS receiver in the blutooth menu it crashes when Tom Tom is running.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of other tweaks I have to do, when I installed Tom Tom I also installed the speed camera database and displayed the POI's, I have since deleated the speed camera database and can't run with the POI's diplayed as this causes the apparent loss
 of Bluetooth connection with the GPS receiver.<br />
<br />
If I am going on a long journey of more than two hours I will set the N70 to offline mode, this gives the phone less to process and appears to operate a little more reliably.<br />
<br />
If I connect my car kit Nokia CK7W, or headset Nokia HS36W it also helps the Tom Tom fall over, even if the car kit tries to connect to the N70 but I deny the connection Tom Tom will fall over.<br />
<br />
If I receive a call while Tom Tom is operating, the phone will appear to lose its Bluetooth connection shortly after the call is ended, a call can be taken with the Tom Tom running and the POI's not displayed with a certain amount of confidence.<br />
<br />
Not sure why the N70 with its faster processor and Bluetooth 2.0 is less reliable with Tom Tom than a 6600, but it is.<br />
<br />
A couple of other odd things are the blue backlights for the keypad, they appear to have a mind of their own, on start up they light up but go off on the pin request screen, then come on and off whenever.<br />
<br />
The bluetooth connection to my Nokia HS36W is fun to setup, it often connects but then won't work, and I have to turn the phone off and back on, delete all pairings then re-pair. If I leave the HS36W pairing in the bluetooth menu it causes problems with Tom
 Tom.<br />
<br />
I have reported the above problems to Nokia, they have asked me to contact my local Nokia service center, I have taken the N70 in and have been informed it has the latest firmware for the N70 product code I have.<br />
<br />
So now just field trialing the phone for Nokia / Tom Tom for free and giving feedback, and waiting for a firmware update to make this phone the excellent tool it should be.

            Found this on another forum (poss www.3G.com?) some time ago<br />
<br />
ATTENTION PLEASE! AFTER MESSING AROUND ON MY N70 AND TOMTOM MOBILE 5 FOR HOURS I FINALLY GOT IT WORKING PERFECTLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
OBVIOUSLY NOT A NOKIA PROBLEM, BECAUSE I CHANGED NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PHONE.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THIS IS HOW YOU DO IT..................<br />
<br />
1. DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL TOMTOM MOBILE 5 VER 5.2 FROM THEIR SITE AND FOLLOW THE EXACT INSTRUCTIONS BY USING A CARD READER/WRITER.<br />
2. WHEN THEY SAY SELECT YOUR DEVICE CHOOSE N90 AND NOT OTHER BECAUSE N70 IS NOT LISTED<br />
3. CHUCK YOUR CARD BACK IN YOUR N70 ENTER THE ACTIVATION CODE<br />
4. ENJOY!, COS IT NOW WORKS GREAT WITH NO FREEZE AND NO GPS DROP<br />
<br />
IM SO HAPPY!!!!!

<br />
The LEDs are controled by the little light sensor at the top of the phone. If you stand in bright light they should be off, now cover the light sensor and they should come on.<br />
Nice little battery saving touch if you ask me

            I think what you're actually seeing is a sync issue. The section IS being moved, in the cached notebook, but the move is taking too long somehow and OneNote is actually RE-syncing section ABC back to NOTEBOOK1.
<div><br />
<div>As a test...right-click NOTEBOOK1 before doing the move, choose Notebook sync status and change from Sync Automatically to Sync Manually.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do your move as before and wait...does the ABC section come back again on its own?</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you're satisfied that it has not, go ahead and initiate a manual sync and see if the ABC section returns then.</div>
<div><br />
<div>How large is the section in question?</div>

            <p>Thank you Shakib Rahman for your contribution,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you are trying to do is not possible to transfer an app to the SD card, because the app in the phone storage is already installed.</p>
<p>You can install from the SD Card to the phone.</p>

<h2>            File Block Settings disabled</h2>
                    I was trying to open a ".dbf" in Excel like I've done hundreds of times since 2000.&nbsp; However in this new Excel 2010 there was a pop-up saying "you are attempting to open a file type (dBase III/IV) that has been blocked by the File Block settings in the
 Trust Center"&nbsp; When i went to the Trust Center File Block Settings, all of the checkboxes were disabled.&nbsp; How can I make the change to allow me to import the dBase file?

            <p>I am sorry.&nbsp; Apparently I did not make myself plain.&nbsp; I said I tried again and again to open the dbf file in from withing Excel 2010, with no success.&nbsp; And&nbsp;course that was using File\Open.&nbsp; So how can I verify the results?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The edition and version of Office is MS&nbsp; Office Professional Plus 2010 Version 14.0.6129.5000 (32 bit)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an interesting update:</p>
<p>I was able to open the dbf file at home on my personal computer with the same edition, same version, of Office Excel, and save it as an Excel file then import it into SQL Server 2008R2 just fine.&nbsp; So it is apparently this installation of Office</p>

 it in the paste would not work so I have to type the entire response all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I stated earlier I am not suprised.&nbsp; These machines have been so locked down that the local adminstrator was not permitted to install a service pack to sql server because the Domain Group Policy did not permit the administrator to write to the log.</p>

 'You are not configured to connect to the server." It also says to contact my support team, but I am unable to, and also because of this, I cannot reset my password. Please help, is this because my network may have disabled SfB or is it because of something
 else?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Emily,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your post. According to your description, you are unable to sign into Skype for Business for incorrect password related notification or “You are not configured to connect to the server” error message. In this case, we need to confirm if you can login
 to <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web App</a> successfully at first. If not, you may need to contact the admin in your organization to help you check your related license assigning status and your credential information and help you change your password to give it a shot.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Besides, we suggest you try to clear the Skype for Business cache file (on PC):<br />
<br />
1. Exit Skype for Business and Outlook client.<br />
2. Browse to: %userprofile%\appdata\local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync. (e.g. C:\Users\xxx\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync)<br />
3. Delete the <em>sip_username@domain.com</em> folder and the Tracing folder.<br />
4. Reboot your computer and Launch the Skype for Business.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, to further look into it, we need to collect some information:<br />
<br />
1. Does this issue occur to other members in your organization?<br />
2. What’s the system of your tablet and laptop, Windows or Mac OS?<br />
3. What’s the detailed version information of the Skype for Business client you used?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jay

            Yes, you're right it's just a few seconds around the time the shutter is pressed.&nbsp; Are you asking if you can increase the duration of the video taken?&nbsp; If so, I think the answer is no, there is no setting for this.

                    I have a primary SMTP mail address and an alias address. I set up a rule which should forward emails sent to my alias address to a dedicated outlook mail folder. However all emails, even those sent to my primary address are forwarded to the folder. What
 is wrong? I am using Outlook 2016 client and an Exchange 2016 server.

<h2>            Trying to repair Office 2010</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">My husband got Office Professional Plus 2010 pre-installed with his Dell laptop from pharmacy school. For my job, I got the 365 Suite, but was let
 go due to financial cutbacks a month ago and no longer have access. To clean up unnecessary applications, I uninstalled 365 but accidentally uninstalled 2010 too. I tried to doing a system restore of the files, and while Office 2010’s suite came back, I cannot
 access it. When I try to open it, it says “The setup controller has encountered a problem during install. Please review the log files for further information on the error. I press “OK,” and it says, “Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 cannot verify the
 license for this application. A repair attempt failed or was canceled by the user. The application will now shut down.” I have tried under “Programs and Features” to click “change” to repair it, but nothing happens, even after waiting patiently, or clicking
 multiple times. I have spent many hours trying to fix this. Since it came with his computer pre-installed, I can’t seem to recover it since I have no product key. Is there any way to fix this? Thank you.</span>

            If you used Windows system restore, it should have restored the registry. Having done so you should be able to use Belarc Advisor -

<p>If system restore does not bring 2010 back well enough to run your next option is to do a "System Restore" using the "factory recovery partition".&nbsp; In theory your builder should have made their recovery partition backup after installing Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oops, I just remembered. Office 2010 Pro Plus is a very limited distribution bundle. You have to meet special criteria to buy it in the first place. It is unlikely in the extreme that it would qualify for factory install.&nbsp; On the other hand, Pro Plus has
 long been illegally installed by small computer shops.&nbsp; They used product keys that are not intended for resale. So there is a very good chance you did not qualify for a legal copy of Pro Plus and will not be able to successfully activate it again. Sorry,
 good luck with that</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, if you had Office 2010 factory installed you most likely should have been given installation disks for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; If not, do you have the Office 2010 25 character Product Key?&nbsp; Again, if not, then use Graham's suggested "Belarc" to try to extract the
 Product key from the computer.&nbsp; With the key, you will then be able to download the installation file from MS.&nbsp; Make sure to keep copies of the installation file safe. Office 2010 will no longer be supported after Oct 2020, so if you want to re-install after
 that date you will have to have your own copy of the installation file. So get it now, and keep it safe!</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the full Office product key you should be able to download the installation file from this link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/download-back-up-restore-microsoft-office-products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://products.office.com/en-us/download-back-up-restore-microsoft-office-products</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>365 / 2016 / 2013 / 2010 (you may have to scroll down)</span></p>
However, Pro Plus may not be available for download from that link. Let us know.

<p>Well, that suggestion was so close to fixing it... I was able to use Belarac&nbsp;Advisor to locate the software key, and I entered it, and it said it was valid. Then, when I try to open an Office program again, it seems to have changed its mind, since it's saying,
 "This product cannot be activated because&nbsp;the product key is not valid." Then it gives me this link:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Getting the product key is very good for you. It is unique.&nbsp; To use it you have to find a 2010 Pro Plus installation file or disk.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try talking to the university to see if you can borrow an installation disk or file from them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can download this file. I believe it came from a safe source but cannot positively guarantee it:</p>
<p>&lt;edit&gt; deleted link &lt;/edit&gt;</p>
<p>Let me know if you download it. I'll be deleting it after that.</p>

    <title>Printing in larger font size in OneNote - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul rittman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing in larger font size in OneNote</h2>
                    The more I use OneNote as a scrapbook for my notes on various subjects, the more I want to print from it. I find that printing notes from ON produces quite small print. Even though my font size in ON is 12, simply copying and pasting a note into MS Word,
 and then printing that (also in 12 pt font) gives me a noticeably larger amount of print (and quite a bit easier to read).<br />
<br />
One solution is to expand the ON notes to a 14 font size. I can do this, but it would require manually changing every note I already have, as well as making 14 the default font. The problem here (in addition to more work) is that these notes would take up more
 space in my pages.<br />
<br />
Is there another way to get ON to print notes in a larger font? I've never seen 12 point font text printed up so small. If I could fix this, I could keep all my notes/pages with a 12 point font, which would allow me to not have to scroll as much.<br />
<br />
Perhaps a macro, that would expand the font and then print, would do the job, if in fact one could be created?

            Thanks, but that pushes the content onto extra pages--so I'd have to push two papers together to see a single paragraph/section.

            <p>Your problem is that you have a little too much content on the page (horizontally). Therefore you have to either zoom out to fit them on a letter size page (make fonts smaller) or you have to split them in multiple pages. There isn't another magical way
 to fix this. You should make sure that the content fits the letter size so that OneNote doesn't have to scale things to fit. You can use View &gt; Paper Size and select Letter size and use that as a guide for how much content can fit on the paper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively you can use a larger paper.</p>

            <div>OK I can do that. That gives me a very good view of what can fit onto a single sheet of paper.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The problem now is that ON will not automatically create a new "page" so that the text that didn't make it onto page one, is seen on a white background on page two. As it now is, the text appears on a dark grey background.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there a way to get ON to give me more white space on the bottom, to be a page 2, 3, 4, etc? Or is there a ruler view that I can place on the top (like in Word), that I can use to move the text left of a given point on the ruler?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Or was this simply a way to arrange printing, with the idea of going back to the Auto view when done printing?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks, regardless. I've got that command on the QAT now so it saves a click or two.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>That's a crazy solution. &nbsp;If you copy / paste into MS Word it prints perfectly fine. &nbsp;No matter how narrow I make the horizontal column the font is still 2x normal size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it cannot print normally, how about a direct export into MS Word so we can print from Word? &nbsp;I can also open up the OneNote file with Outline+ and I have zero issues printing. &nbsp;I'm sorry, but this is an issue with OneNote. &nbsp;Just choosing Print should
 be enough. &nbsp;That's all which is needed with any other program.<br />

<h2>            Outlook set up old email ADDRESS with new email address emails</h2>
                    When 2010 was installing it pulled an email address that I haven't used in over 6 years.&nbsp; But it is importing emails from my new address.&nbsp; I can't delete the OUTLOOK email account as it states it's undeletable. so how do I reset my 2010 Outlook email to
 display the correct EMAIL ADDRESS?&nbsp; I've searched all over and can't even reset the thing.&nbsp; Help, it's frustrating that every time I open up the outlook email it is showcasing a century old email address and not my current email address and you can't delete
 it!&nbsp; HELP PLEASE.

<p>I had the same problem, just after the update - <strong>immediately</strong> after the update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wasn't having any citation highlighted, but rather a Prism graph. I took someone's advice and turned on field code by pressing alt+F9. I found this bit of code: "{ ADDIN }" appended to the end of the field code for my embedded graph. Once I deleted that
 item the document became functional again. I just replicated the same fix in a backup version of the file I had made, it really is just that piece of code.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like there are other pieces of code containing "ADDIN", based on a ctl+f search, one for each of my citations. But this { ADDIN } was the only one that was sitting alone, with nothing else in its curly braces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here are the steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Hit ALT+F9</p>
<p>2) Search for ADDIN (I didn't get a result for { ADDIN, only the letters themselves worked)</p>
<p>3) Delete the search result that is { ADDIN } alone</p>
<p>4) Try to refresh your bibliography to see if it's fixed!&nbsp;</p>

            I managed to correct the error. Hope it will help others.<br />
Every time I received the window with an error, Word was pointing on a particular piece of text with some citation that has a mistake (too bad it's not highlighted). You need to identify which citation is corrupted and delete it (just copy different parts of
 your&nbsp;text&nbsp;into a new word document + compile bibliography again, so that way you can eliminate the corrupted citation).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
