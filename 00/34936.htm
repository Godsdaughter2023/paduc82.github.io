                    Speed Traps&nbsp;<p>Getting 3 stars on all&nbsp;<span><span>Forza Horizon 3</span>&nbsp;Speed Traps</span>&nbsp;is easier than getting 3 stars on&nbsp;<span>Drift Zones</span> and&nbsp;<span>Danger Signs PR Stunts</span>; however, some of the Speed Traps Stunts in the game may require multiple retries.</p>

<p>In order to help you achieve this task we have created the following&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3</em>&nbsp;guide which reveals useful tips and&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/2POu7gc8E2U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">a video showing how we got 3 Stars</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/2POu7gc8E2U?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/2POu7gc8E2U?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div> on these specific&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3&nbsp;</em>Stunts.</p>

<p>The video game developed by Playground Games for&nbsp;<span>PC</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>Xbox One</span>, includes 29 Speed Traps.</p>

<p>On the map, a Speed Trap location is marked by an icon showing a road safety camera, as you can see in the image above.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fvgfaq.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2016%2f09%2fForza-Horizon-3-Speed-Traps.jpg" />&nbsp;<br /></p>

<p>To perform this type of stunt you have to drive as fast as you can through the road safety camera.</p>

<p>Similar to the&nbsp;<span>Speed Zones</span>, each Speed Trap in&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3</em>&nbsp;has 3 difficulty levels for which you will be awarded one, two or three stars.</p>

<p>Obviously, for the first two levels the requirements are lower, but for the last one you will have to drive very fast.</p>

<p>Here are some of the factors that will affect your speed while driving through a FH 3 Speed Trap.</p>

<p>First and the most important is the car you use. For your convenience, in our video guide we also reveal the models and the upgrades used by us when working on these PR Stunts.</p>

<p>The terrain is the second most important factor you have to consider when attempting a Speed Trap in FH 3.</p>

<p>Based on the first two factors we recommend buying the Ferrari F12TDF for the Speed Traps placed on asphalt and the Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 for the traps placed on dirt and sand.</p>

<p>The upgrades you buy for the cars you play with, are very important as well. Look for upgrades that maximize your car’s speed, acceleration and launch, instead of braking.</p>

<p>Your starting point and the route you follow are also crucial for these stunts. Try starting from an area placed in a straight line with&nbsp;the Speed Trap in order to avoid unnecessary brakes, and pay close attention to the environment.</p>

<p>Avoid the traffic as much as you can or you will fail getting 3 stars. When you have to choose between hitting an opponent or hitting the brakes, always choose the latter.</p>

<p>Therefore, before running through a&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3</em>&nbsp;Speed Trap make sure you:</p>

<ul><li>Check the leaderboards and see what cars have been used by other players to beat the required scores.</li><li>Watch our video guide below and pay attention to our starting points and the routes we have followed.</li><li>Upgrade your cars based on the terrain.</li><li>Use the rewind button every time you hit an opponent or object.</li><li>Practice and be patient. These stunts are accessible even to new drivers.</li></ul>Speed Zones<p>The difference between&nbsp;<span><span>Forza Horizon 3</span>&nbsp;Speed Zones</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>FH 3 Speed Traps</span>&nbsp;is that for the first type of PR Stunts, you have to maintain a cumulative speed which has to be higher than the one required by the said stunt.</p>

<p>Simplified, this means that for a Speed Zone Stunt, the score is determined by your overall speed while driving on a specific segment of a road.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fvgfaq.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2016%2f09%2fForza-Horizon-3-Speed-Zones.jpg" />&nbsp;<br /></p>

<p>These PR Stunts are more difficult than the Speed Traps but easier than the&nbsp;<span>Danger Signs</span>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<span>Drift Zones</span>&nbsp;available in the game.</p>

<p>In order to get three stars on such a stunt, you will have to beat the required speed, and below we will share several tips that might help you while working on achieving 3 Stars on all&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3</em>&nbsp;Speed Zones.</p>

<p><em>Forza Horizon 3</em>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<span>PC</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>Xbox One</span>&nbsp;features 21 Speed Zones, which are marked on your map by icons showing two road safety cameras, similar to those in the image above.<br /></p>

<p>When you scroll on one of these icons you will notice a marked section which represents the zone where you have to drive as fast as possible.</p>

<p>Your performance on these&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3</em>&nbsp;Stunts is affected by multiple factors and the most important one is the car you decide to use. This factor works in correlation with the second one, which is the terrain.<br /></p>

<p>While in the video guide below we use various models, we suggest you to try the 2012 Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4 for Speed Zones on difficult terrains (mud, sand and dirt) and the 2015 Koenigsegg One: 1 for Speed Zones placed on asphalt.</p>

<p>The second car is quite expensive, but you can use our method to&nbsp;<span>get</span> fast credits in&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3</em>, if you don’t have enough funds. Alternatively, you can get more CR from the free Wheelspins awarded when you level up.</p>

<p>To level up faster you can start smashing&nbsp;<span>XP Boards</span>&nbsp;or simply&nbsp;<span>use our Fast XP method</span>.</p>

<p>Obviously, the car you decide to drive&nbsp;must be upgraded accordingly; therefore, you should maximize your car’s speed, acceleration and launch.</p>

<p>The launch is important because some of the Speed Zones feature multiple turns, thus you will be forced to hit the brakes often.</p>

<p>When you play a Speed Zone Stunt you have to remember that you are allowed to leave the road but you are not allowed to get too far from it. This means that you are also allowed to cut corners&nbsp;as long as you don’t go too far.</p>

<p>This trick will help you conserve your speed so remember it&nbsp;whenever you see a corner&nbsp;on the road.</p>

<p>Another important factor that will determine your overall speed is your starting point. It is a good idea to pick a starting point located in a straight line and as far as possible, because if you enter a Speed Zone at high speed, you won’t have to worry about the speed you might lose when hitting the brakes.</p>

<p>Remember these five tips if you wish to get 3 Stars on all&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3</em>&nbsp;Speed Zones:</p>

<ul><li>Always check the leaderboards to see what cars have been used by other players.</li><li>Cut the corners if possible but stay close to the marked route.</li><li>Avoid all obstacles you might encounter.</li><li>Upgrade your cars accordingly.</li><li>Enter each zone as fast as possible.</li></ul>

<p>Last but not least, be patient and watch&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/sp0fSKDfe-c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">our video guide below to see our&nbsp;starting points</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/sp0fSKDfe-c?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/sp0fSKDfe-c?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>, as well as the cars and the upgrades that helped us achieve 3 Stars on all 21&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3</em>&nbsp;Speed Zones.<br /></p><p><br /></p>

            <p><strong>Danger Sign</strong></p><p>Getting&nbsp;<span>3 stars on all&nbsp;<span>Forza Horizon 3</span>&nbsp;Danger Signs</span>&nbsp;is one of the most challenging tasks you will face while playing the racing video game developed by Playground Games for&nbsp;<span>PC</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>Xbox One</span>; therefore,&nbsp;throughout the following guide we will reveal several useful tips that should help you during the game.</p>
<p>The Danger Signs in&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3</em>&nbsp;are PR Stunts that award you fans required to unlock new Horizon Events or new Showcase Races; therefore, you will need to complete them as soon as you can.</p>
<p>While there is no need to get 3 stars on all Danger Signs PR Stunts, if you wish only to finish the game; if you are completionist, then you will have to work hard on these jumps, because some of them are extremely hard to beat.</p>
<p>Unlike the&nbsp;<span>Barn Finds</span>,&nbsp;<span>Reward Boards</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span>Beauty Spots</span>, the locations of all&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3</em>Danger Signs are revealed by unlocking all Horizon Festivals and by upgrading them.</p>
<p><span>Forza Horizon 3&nbsp;is marked by a square icon with an exclamation mark, similar to those in the image above.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fvgfaq.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2016%2f09%2fForza-Horizon-3-Danger-Signs.jpg" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><span>
<p>Once &nbsp;you find such an event, you will have to complete it by jumping as far as you can. This goal is quite accessible if you want to get one or two stars, but for 3 stars, things get really messy and your nerves will be put to a test.</p>
<p>Here are some of the factors that will determine the length of your jump.</p>
<p>The car you use for a Danger Sign PR Event is obviously the most important, and the video below shows the cars we have used to achieve three stars on all these stunts. Sometimes you will need fast cars, while sometimes you will have to switch to&nbsp;heavy cars.</p>
<p>Do not assume that the fastest car is also the best car, because you will be surprised.</p>
<p>For some stunts for example, you need smaller vehicles such as the <em>Ariel Nomad</em>, which is slower than a <em>Bugatti Veyron</em>.</p>
<p>The weight of a car, or its traction will play a very important role as well.</p>
<p>Another factor is the starting point. In this case the starting point represents the location you pick to start moving towards the ramp.</p>
<p>When you choose a starting point, you need to look for an area without obstacles and traffic. Preferably the route between the starting point and the ramp should be a straight line. If there are any obstacles on your route, smash them before attempting the jump.</p><p><br /></p><p>The speed you have when you reach the ramp is also crucial. At higher speeds, your car will start to roll over, which means that you won’t be able to land safely. Again, choose your car carefully. Last but not least the way you touch the ramp with your car’s front wheels will determine what happens next.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that you will have to be very careful on the moves you make on your way towards the ramp. For most of these signs your car’s front wheels must touch the ramp at the same time, but sometimes you might want to steer left or right a bit, to change the trajectory of your car.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>To successfully perform a 3 Stars Danger Sign Stunt, you should:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Check the leaderboards a

            Drift Zones
<p>Getting&nbsp;3 stars on all&nbsp;Forza Horizon 3&nbsp;Drift Zones&nbsp;is almost as hard as getting 3 stars in the&nbsp;Danger Signs PR Stunts&nbsp;and the tips and tricks in the guide below are meant to help you achieve those stars.</p>
<p>Unlike&nbsp;most of&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3</em>&nbsp;Speed&nbsp;Zones&nbsp;and&nbsp;FH3 Speed Traps, which are easier to complete with 3 stars, the Drift Zones Stunts will require quite a few tries, so be patient before attempting them.</p>
<p>There are 17&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3</em>&nbsp;Drift Zones PR Stunts in the video game developed by Playground Games for&nbsp;PC&nbsp;and&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;One.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fvgfaq.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2016%2f10%2fForza-Horizon-3-Drift-Zones.jpg" />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To access all&nbsp;Drift Zones you have to upgrade each Horizon Festival location to its max level, unlike the&nbsp;Barn Finds,&nbsp;Reward Boards&nbsp;or&nbsp;Beauty Spots&nbsp;which are revealed by world discovery.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3&nbsp;</em>Speed Zones<em>&nbsp;</em>are marked on the map with an icon depicting a sliding car and when you hover over one of these icons it will highlight the area in which you are allowed to perform the drifts.</p>
<p>On the actual road, such a zone is marked by green flags on both sides of the road. Your drift is calculated as soon as you hit the area between the first two flags, hence it’s a good idea to begin the drift a bit earlier in order to maximize the amount you can get in the zone. Also, it doesn’t matter from which end you begin the drift, so experiment until you find what’s the most comfortable path for you.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>To initiate a drift you press the E-brake button while turning left or right on your joystick.</p>
<p>Then immediately you have to counter-steer in the opposite direction to maintain control.</p>
<p>Press the throttle gently to prevent over-steering.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Moreover, don’t approach a Drift Zone at a high speed, because you will overshoot the designated area and you will fail the drift. While it is safe to decelerate or even stop inside a zone (though not recommended), you will also fail the drift if you turn around the car.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>To make&nbsp;a car drift with ease you can turn off the&nbsp;<em>Traction Control</em>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>Stability Control</em>settings in the difficulty menu.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>An advanced setting would be to turn the shifting to manual. This way you can keep the car in the&nbsp;desired&nbsp;gear all the time. When the RPM drops significantly shift to a lower gear to keep the wheels spinning and prevent them from gaining grip.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>When you play solo use the rewind function to save some time and return to the start position fast. However, the Drivatars are the most annoying thing while playing solo, thus you can ask a friend to play in a private online freeroam session where you will not be bothered by AI traffic.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>While your skill can be an important factor in&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3</em>&nbsp;Drift Zones, the car you decide to use is the essential&nbsp;one and can save you from a lot of frustration while attempting the PR Stunts.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If you are a beginner don’t jump to the fastest and most powerful car. Instead, choose a B-class or lower tier car that has a rear wheel drive (RWD). Tune up its power to make it more potent.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Invest in handling, launch and acceleration, because you don’t need top speed when you drift. Alternatively you can try a AWD car (all wheel drive), but it tends to have more grip which is not a good thing if you intend to drift.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If you don’t know how to fine tune your car for drifting search for a custom upgrade/tune file that has been developed by other&nbsp;players. Usually, hardcore players know their way around a car and will amaze you with the results.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We got 3 stars on&nbsp;all 17&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3&nbsp;</em>Drift Zones<em>&nbsp;</em>using a&nbsp;1974 Toyota Celica GT, which was tuned using a AWD Drift Tune. You can check the upgrade&nbsp;file that we downloaded in the video below.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>While it can seem underwhelming at C-class we can assure you it was fine tuned to have an insane amount of power. You can also use the video if you want to see other cars suitable for drifting, along with the suggested tuning options.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The terrain is another factor that you should take into account. The car behaves differently on asphalt and gravel. When the rain starts it affects all the car physics and you will lose control more easily. The night makes the matter even worse due to low visibility.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>To get around the issue use the next trick. Fast travel to an already discovered&nbsp;Beauty Spot&nbsp;and the weather and time of day will change instantly. We suggest using the one at the crossroad in the Outback since it will make the weather sunny. Then return to the Drift Zone.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Take these tips into consideration when attempting&nbsp;to get 3 Stars on all&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 3</em>&nbsp;Drift&nbsp;Zones:</p>
<ul><li>Check the global leaderboards to see what cars (and their performance index) have been used by other players.</li><li>Properly tune your chosen car.</li><li>Use the rewind button if you hit any&nbsp;obstacles.</li><li>Be gentle with the controls, especially the throttle.</li><li>Practice a lot and be patient.</li></ul>

            Hi Crystal, no, the version of Windows will not matter !
<br />
<br />The file is possibly corrupt, try copying he file across again . . .
<br />
<br />Something else to try:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type wordpad and hit Enter
<br />
<br />Try opening the file from Wordpad . . .

            It's just a document from a word program. Could it be i used a windows 8 program to write it and im trying to use windows 10 to open it? If so how do i fix it?

            WordPad should be able to open the file. Have you tried launching WordPad then point to the file then open it?

            It is not that windows will not install updates, because it installs the normal updates. It is when i install the new Roll up package (KB3125574), the package does not automatically install the updates that it is supposed to.

<p><span>Hi Gunpal Jain,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span>I would suggest you to boot into Safe Mode
 and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer this link to boot your computer in Safe mode:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></strong></a></span></p>
<p><span>If a problem doesn't reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers as possible causes.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span>Perform a hardware clean boot to determine
 if any hardware is causing this problem.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Go to start and type device manager.<br />
2. Select device manager from the Control Panel list.<br />
3. Right Click on Sound Card, Video Adapter, and Network Adapter one by one and click disable.<br />
4. Reboot the computer. If the problem is fixed then you can enable the hardware devices one by one to find the exact device that caused the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>After you found the device that is causing the problem, installing the device’s latest driver should fix it unless it’s a hardware issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following link to know about driver updates:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly<br />
</span></strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></strong></a></span></p>

<p><span>Also&nbsp;update the chipset driver in particular and check.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have installed&nbsp;any Power management utilities provided by HP, then uninstall the same and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have not installed any power management utilities,&nbsp;then install&nbsp;the same and check if the issue persists.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Activation Key suddenly stopped working</h2>
                    <p>My PC was working with the product key I entered at least a year ago and now it is suddenly saying that the window's cannot connect to my organization activation server. I bought my PC refurbished a year ago but lost the product key that was given (so I
 don't remember if it was a product key for home and my PC somehow upgraded to pro or if it was for pro all along).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to clean my PC and try the product key using windows home but I don't have the product key anymore and&nbsp;<span><em>wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey&nbsp;</em>returns
</span>OA3x and nothing else.&nbsp;When I go into to the activation settings, there is a product key entered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to take the chance and reinstall it without the product key in case the key doesn't load up or something else happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can find my product key without using outside software? And is there a reason why my product key suddenly stopped working?</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

            Hi Haje_K,
<br />
<br />It seems somehow, you are running a volume licence version of Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />That product key you obtained, was for a version of Windows that is meant to be used in a company environment, where Windows will be re-armed on a regular basis. You will be unable to do that as a private user . . .
<br />
<br />Probably Windows update has seen that product key is a VL key and marked your Windows for de-activation . . .

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />Here are two support articles outlining how to change your notification settings and those on your lock screen too:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028678/windows-10-change-notification-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402867...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/31116-turn-off-lock-screen-notifications-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/31116-turn-...</a>
<br />
<br />Note: This is a non-Microsoft website. The page appears to be providing accurate, safe information. Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br />If those don't work, there isn't really any other way to prevent your monitor from turning on other than disabling notifications altogether.
<br />
<br />Perhaps you could unplug you monitor's power at night?
<br />
<br />Anyway, let me know if you need more help! Thanks!

                    <p>I have just set new Screen Time allowances for my kids on the Family Account settings, however, is there an App available for them to download onto their machines which shows them how much time they've used / how much time they have left?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway of creating such an App?</p>

<h3> zackfrazier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 can&#39;t connect to wpa2-psk network</h2>
                    I'm tryin to connect to the student network at my university and windows 8 doesn't recognize the network as bein wpa2-psk. I've read several forum posts asking for driver information an not givin any definitive answers. I can connect to the very limited
 guest network that doesnt have any security. The IT dept. has stated it's a windows 8 issue and they're waiting for a windows update to fix it. No one here I able to get it fixed and none of the other answers are actual solutions.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Edit: if it helps, atheros ar9485wb-eg wireless adapter. Version 10.0.209</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Another edit: driver states trying to authenticate when attempting to connect to network. According to IT here, the network shoul be found as wpa2-psk, not as wpa2. They showed me on a laptop using windows 7 and the network type is different on that one
 and on my laptop.&nbsp;</div>

<p><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista
 Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If there are corrupt files, try to identify them by name.<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning
 name changes (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Post the results here unless there are too many - then just post a sampling of those you think are most relevant.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with the upgrade from an earlier version of Windows section of the following: </span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system cane with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 installer stuck 99</h2>
                    <p>I'm installing WIndows 10. The installer has been running for 1.5 days and is stuck at 99%. I have searched for an answer on the Microsoft website and it tells me to keep letting the installer run, not to restart anything. So I'll do that. I am submitting
 this question to ask what I should do if I reach midnight and have not completed my upgrade?</p>

            My desktop has been showing Getting your upgrade ready ... Installing Windows 10. Please wait, Percent Complete: 99% for longer than 6 hours now. We were able to upgrade two other Windows 7 laptops and one Windows 8.1 laptop to Windows 10. The desktop
 is the only one which has not completed the upgrade from Windows 7. I had to reinstall Windows 7 and start over the upgrade after several attempts. My expectation is that because it started so early it will be still granted the license even if the deadline
 is reached and several hours pass by.

                    Running Win 10 Version 1803 (KB4462933) on my PC. Starting a few months ago, all of a sudden Asphalt 8 AND Asphalt 9 both stopped working (downloaded from MSFT Store). Only updates to my PC were your Cumulative Updates!!&nbsp; I saw previous posts with others
 having the same issue but NO SOLUTION!&nbsp; Launched both games, the logo appears for several seconds then disappears. Again this started several months ago. before that it was working fine. &nbsp; Uninstalled both and reloaded both - no change. Ran the Windows Store
 App troubleshooter - says no problems.&nbsp; Something in your updates is preventing these apps from working correctly.&nbsp; Also I am hesitant to start fooling around and download "<span>Media Feature Pack for N versions of Windows 10</span>" (&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=53356)
 since I am not running some "N" version of windows.&nbsp; Please advise ASAP. Thank you

<p>Update - I rebooted my PC and both games work - HOWEVER this brings up an issue that I believe is being caused by Microsoft Edge w/r/t system stability and causing live tiles, notifications and it looks like now some selected games like Asphalt to not function!
 Here is the synopsis:</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I have been having an issue with my win10 live tiles. after a time, live tiles and notifications would stop and the only workaround has been to log off my account then log back in or restart the PC.&nbsp; After
<strong>weeks </strong>of trying to see what app(s) might be causing this, it looks like Microsoft Edge is the culprit - I have been running all day fine with Chrome, Outlook, NetFlix App, etc and it has been running fine all day with notifications and live
 tiles <strong>working </strong>well. It was only when I opened Microsoft Edge (latest version that was updated on my PC) that after a few minutes, then live tiles and notifications stopped working! This started several weeks ago following a Windows update
 (I am currently running 2018-10 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1803 for x64-based Systems KB4462933).&nbsp;
<strong>This definitely seems like a bug/defect to me</strong> as it was working previously 2 months ago even with edge running. At first I thought it might be with Skype, but it still has the same effect with
<strong>just Edge.</strong>&nbsp; Please advise?&nbsp; I also ran an sfc scan and there were NO errors. so I cannot use Edge as my default browser as long as this keeps corrupting my Win10 Environment.&nbsp; Thank you

<p>Hello tear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your question. Unfortunately, this is not possible from the PC to delete the save from the cloud. I have searched everywhere to make sure of this. Even if you found the game file on the PC it will not delete it from the
 cloud. Only way I know of to do this is from a console. Do you have a friend you can download your profile on their console then the game. If this game is purchased from steam you can delete it
<a href="https://appuals.com/how-to-delete-steam-cloud-saves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
from steam</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply Brad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also search for a long time to find a solution, with no luck.&nbsp; Only instructions on How To with a Console.</p>
<p>The game is from Microsoft Store.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't know anyone with a Xbox Console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did lodge a suggestion on Xbox Ideas that is waiting for a moderator to approve.&nbsp; Its highly likely that I am not the only one with this problem, be nice if we could get the support to have this implemented.</p>
<p><a href="https://xboxideas.uservoice.com/forums/911263-idea-drive-suggestion-box/suggestions/37433365-windows-10-xbox-app-access-to-data-that-is-automat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://xboxideas.uservoice.com/forums/911263-idea-drive-suggestion-box/suggestions/37433365-windows-10-xbox-app-access-to-data-that-is-automat</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:&nbsp; Found a work-around</p>
<p>1. Uninstall Game/App</p>
<p>1.1 Sign out of Xbox App</p>
<p>2. Go to&nbsp;<a href="https://account.live.com/consent/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/consent/Manage</a>&nbsp;Find the app and click the Edit button.&nbsp; On the next page click "Remove These Permissions".</p>
<p>3. Re-Install The app, in my case Hill Climb 2</p>
<p>4. (From memory here)&nbsp; Launch the app, it should ask if you grant permission for the app to access your Xbox data.&nbsp; Deny access or Just close the Sign in box.</p>
<p>5. <strong>Important</strong>.&nbsp; Play a few games -&nbsp; I played until Bronze II before proceeding to next step. (Not sure if Game Name is important, I did use a new name)</p>
<p>6. Go to the Game/app settings and connect Xbox.&nbsp; Now it should ask you if you want to use Cloud Data or Local Data.&nbsp;
<strong>Choose Local Data</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Done</p>

<h2>            Wireless Bluetooth Device failure&#63; how to identify it&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Bluetooth stopped working abruptly. The system kept making sound notifications for a new connected devices repeatedly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked Device Manager and could see Intel Wireless Bluetooth blinking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran a diagnostic: (System Settings &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Bluetooth / Run Diagnostic). Results: Check Bluetooth Radio Status, to no effect. Then restarted the computer. Same situation as previously.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I have checked the driver for my device (Intel(R) Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260), tried to update it with Windows 10's wizard. It said the driver already installed is the best one!
</p>
<p>The driver is an old one though (19.41.0.1 date: 4/7/2017). I found an downloaded the latest (20.10.0.1 from 4/7/2017) and pointed the wizard towards it: it wouldn't install it because it says I have the best one already.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also found that the Hardware wasn't displayed within the properties for Intel Wireless Blue Tooth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4931d230-ba19-4c36-8433-9a4202912cc2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4931d230-ba19-4c36-8433-9a4202912cc2?upload=true" /></a></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I've tried uninstalling the Device: it wouldn't find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run troubleshooting for hardware: no problem found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled the device and it stopped the notification sound</p>
<p>
</p><p>It puzzles me that my wireless card is still working fine, I (think) I'm accessing Bluetooth with the same card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>----</p>
<p>QUESTIONS:</p>
<p>- Is this enough troubleshooting to say that I likely have a hardware failure?</p>
<p>- Should I try a manual driver removal / installation? (not using the wizard)?</p>
