            No. By moving the mouse to the bottom edge of the screen will always have the taskbar appear. So to get around that you'll need to make sure your mouse doesn't move down to the bottom edge.

    <title>Latest Win 10 Pro Anniversary Upgrade seriously broke PROTEL99SE low - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gerhardoberforcher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Latest Win 10 Pro Anniversary Upgrade seriously broke PROTEL99SE low level file access APIs</h2>
                    <p>I recently was switched at work from WIN7 to WIN10 PRO, Build 1511. Everything worked perfectly afterwards. I then went on vacation for two weeks and found that it was upgraded to the Build 1607, Anniversary Upgrade. Because the 30 day limit was reduced
 to 10 days I couldn't even revert the upgrade for testing anymore. As a hardware developer I use a wide spectrum of new and older programs and need to rely on O/S stability for my work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new anniversary edition broke some APIs that PR99SE relies on and produces a "File not recognized error". This results in no longer being able to load projects properly, nor close down the program without the task manager. The usefulness of the program
 is now seriously degraded. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Different compatibility settings have not made any difference. </p>
<p>
</p><p>How is it possible that an upgrade like this causes so much collateral damage to an expensive program? Although I use the modern replacement ALTIUM I still need to use PR99SE for special projects that ALTIUM has trouble to deal with.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I can't go back to WIN7. It is really disconcerting, that the forced updates, is like waiting for Allied ships to be torpedoed at any time out of the dark by German submarines. You never know when your life is going to change for ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before W10 I experienced an acceptable degree of O/S stability from W2000-W7. That has now all changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't care about&nbsp;ANY of the new features of W10! All I care, is, that the O/S I am getting to use can run the applications that are crucial to my activities. One pays good money for PCs and operating systems. This new service model of MS is a really,
 really bad idea if it&nbsp;endangers or damages&nbsp;legacy stability. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To me the O/S is not an internet media entertainment device. I expect the PC to be a serious tool that enables my work. So far, most previous MS O/S have done this very well. I never had a problem W2K-W8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other question, that needs to be asked, is: If W10 still offers compatibility modes ranging from W95 to W8, why aren't they able to provide the selected O/S&nbsp;interface to the program that needs it? It seems very meaningless. Shouldn't legacy Windows API
 compliancy be expected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems, the only recourse I have is to install WIN7 in an virtual machine. Although that works, it is not ideal either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the question to Microsoft: What are my chances, that this W10 anniversary upgrade can be fixed, so that applications like PR99SE can be used again such as it was possible with W10, Build 1511? With Build 1511 it worked flawlessly. I would be so grateful
 if MS could look at&nbsp;my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Work life has become very frustrating when you can no longer rely on your premier design tool. From one hour to the next, one musty fear now that the PC becomes compromised.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>A very frustrated W10 User</p>

            <p>I have tested both of your suggested actions. The sfc program found no issues. Shutting services down made no difference either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found, however, some inconsistencies in Protel project loading behaviour. Sometimes, hen I load an existing project it finishes fine, and &nbsp;icsn use the CAD properly and save the project changes normally. Then, when I close the project and open it
 up again, Protel will no longer finish loading the project database and hang. At this point only the Task manager can terminate the program. As I repeat the above, sometimes it will work, most of the time not. I have akso found, when I select a project file,
 sometimes I get a File not recognized warning, try it again, it then works again. It seems totally unpredictable now. Before the latest upgrade and all the years befote, Protel behaved always consistent. It seems to me, after the Build 1511, some APIs Protel
 is using, no longer return the correct data, the caller expects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is now impossible to load the usual 10-15 Project databases simultaneously. If I luck in, and the project loads properly, I can actually work with it. Occasionally I experience the file not recognized error, repeating the access again and it works. I
 can, fortunately, still save my open files most of th time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that helps to diagnose the possible cause.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed a new W10, 1511 system on another hard drive and it works properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, I hope we can gett to the bottom of this so frustrating problem.</p>
<p>

<p>If an update caused the problem, then Microsoft should rectify it. My Task Scheduler is useless after updates. Sfc /scannow does not help at all.</p>

            None of the suggested procedures made any difference, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
<br />
The main problem is the error message that is associated when Protel99 is trying to access files and databases. Especially when it tries to load library data bases.<br />
<br />
"Format '%x' invalid or incompatible with argument."<br />
"Format '%s' invalid or incompatible with argument."<br />
<br />
When this happens, PR99SE must be killed with the TASK MANAGER. Clicking <br />
the program close produces a W API error.<br />
<br />
The funny thing is, that sometimes it works for a few days and then <br />
<br />
the problem starts to reappear. This is consistent with different <br />
<br />
W10 machines. I have seen it on a W10X64 and W10X32 installation. <br />
<br />
Right now, I can't reproduce the problem at all. I have been running it <br />
through its paces and it is rock solid. Yesterday, it was happening all <br />
<br />
the time. In all cases I start with a clean boot and startup for consistency.<br />
<br />
I really wished you could actually test the application on <br />
your own computers in your company. <br />
<br />
What do you think? Can anything be done to properly diagnoze <br />
the "under the hood cause" of this misbehaviour? <br />
<br />
The problem occurs sometimes every alternate time during loading time. <br />
If I have my PCB library database loaded it may for the first time <br />
load correctly. Then when I close the application and reload, it will <br />
<br />
50% of the time produce the above error message and must be killed with <br />
the task manager.<br />
<br />
This error message seems to be related to the internal Delphi exception handling. Some Windows API the program depends on is no longer responding correctly. I believ, if the conflicting API function could be identified, the probelem may be revertible.<br />
<br />
PR99SE worked properly from W98 2nd edition up to WinXPSP3. From Windows Vista on, it started to fall apart. At this time "File not recognized' occured. This was fixed by someone with a patch to PR99SE. After that PR99SS worked fine until W10 Anniversary edition
 Build 1607.<br />
<br />
Perhaps, compatiblity mode settings could have the possibility to use only legacy APIs in some way. Unfortunately, the program itself cannot be updated.<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>I am still having problems. It got worse with the last 1709 upgrade. It seems to be inconsistent. A collegue has no apparently no problems. Although I can't test it thoroughly there. On a W10X32 it seems to work to some extent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It all has to do with W10 DELPHI API incompatibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It works fine in any O/S from W98 to W8.1. W10 is still a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the Delphi runtime Support generates the format %x error which somehow has to do with path or file system interfacing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sometimes things work for a while. Adding a new schematic can bring on the trouble. Accessing PCBs is tricky. One has to click 10 or more times to get to open a PCB file. Before that, it generates the format %x eror message. After this exercise, the files
 can all be accessed and work done.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>If someone from Microsoft reads this, please concentrate on investigating the Delphi runtime files. They are the key to fix it. Somehow W10 changed the way the interface with Windows. W8.1/7 and earlier work flawlessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, the Task Manager has to be used to terminate the CAD program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it seems pretty hopeless to resolve unless one could update the Application or Delphi runtime code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used a virtual machine to run Pr99 inside W7 or Xp. This works of course properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Gerhard</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Britghtness Issue</h2>
                    <p>I have a lenovo Y700 14" - has dual graphics with Intel &nbsp;HD 530 and AMD Radeon R9 M375.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was using Windws 10 until suddenly after one recent update the brightness settings just vanished from the system - no brightness slider in battery settings; the brightness button is greyed out in the action center; the hardware buttons do not work (volume,
 keyboard lights buttons etc. work).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried rolling back drivers to "Microsoft basic display" AND also updating the drivers to the latest version. And in both cases I hve seen no results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw this post -&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/any-windows-10-intel-core-i5-with-intel-hd-4000/d5b3284b-416c-41a3-8d87-f5766b3406d6</p>
<p>The above talks about changing Regedit values and is for intel 4000 series. Can I use it for the 530 that I have??</p>

Went ahead and tried the answer provided in the link above - where I changed the regedit values. I still do not see any improvement. Please help.

<p>
</p><p>UPDATE 2:</p>
<p>My display device driver had changed from "Generic PnP Monitor". SO reinstalled it for pnp monitor, and the brightness options are back. but they do not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The brightness is at 100% regardless of how much i move the brightness sliders...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and will assist you to resolve this issue&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>The reason behind this problem is incorrect date or time in your computer system. If your computer's date and time is not correct, you'll face this problem.<br />
Sometimes when you install new Windows or change computer hardware, the date and time is changed and if you don't update the date/time, you face this problem.<br />
The fix for this problem is very simple. You just need to correct your computer's date and time using following steps:<br />
1. Right-click on date and time shown in Taskbar notification area (aka System tray) and select "Adjust date/time" option.<br />
2. It'll open "Date and Time" window. Alternatively you can directly open it by using timedate.cpl command in RUN dialog box.<br />
3. Now click on "Change date and time" button and correct date and time settings.<br />
4. Apply the changes and now try to open the HTTPS websites again in your web browser. Now all websites will open without any problem.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong>If you have a working Internet connection, you can click on "Internet Time" tab present in "Date and Time" window and then click on "Change settings" button, enable "Synchronize with an Internet time server" checkbox and click on "Update
 now" button. It'll automatically correct the date and time of your computer system.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
A websites's certificate provides identification of the web server. If the certificate has an error, it might indicate that your connection has been intercepted or that the web server is misrepresenting its identity.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I&nbsp;would suggest you to Reset Internet Explorer 11,refer the steps from the below link.</div>

<p>Thanks Mr.Billion for the instant reply. Perhaps I did not posit my question properly. My problem is not as simple as that. Presently I am logging in to my PC&nbsp;with a Windows&nbsp;local administrator account&nbsp;using a PIN. Now I want to login not with my Windows&nbsp;local
 administrator account, using a&nbsp;PIN, but with my Microsoft account for which I know my password. I tried changing my&nbsp; login preference&nbsp;from that of a Windows&nbsp;local admin account to Microsoft account for which&nbsp;I need both My Microsoft account password as well
 as My Windows local admin&nbsp;password. Now the problem is I have forgotten my password. however I am logging in to my PC with a PIN I have set for my Windows local admin account. But I cannot use my PIN to change my login preference in the accounts settings.
 I cant&nbsp;create a Windows Password reset disk for my future use without remembering my Windows login password. I hope this time I have made my problem clear enough for someone to come up with a proper solution. Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Thank you for coming back to us with details.</span></p>

<p><span>Since, you have forgotten the user account password we will not able to help you related password scenarios due to security purpose. The best what I can suggest you is create a new user account and
 transfer all user profile data’s to the new user account. Once you transfer all the data’s to new user account you can convert the user account to Microsoft account and delete the old user account (If you want).
<span>&nbsp;</span>You can also follow the below steps to transfer all your data’s to the new user account.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Open <strong>file explorer</strong> and double click on <strong>OS (C:).</strong></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for the Quick response. I will eventually use the suggestions you have given. But for the present I'd like to continue logging into my PC with my PIN. My concern is more with recovering my Widows local user login password, which seems not possible.
 However I have a question to ask MS which I personally think as valid: when both a Password and a PIN are equally valid for successfully&nbsp;logging in to Windows local admin account why only the Password is given credence in the matter of resetting of the login
 Password or creating a password recovery disc? Will MS please respond? Thank you.</p>

    <title>Last Windows 10 update has changed the screen aspect ration. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Last Windows 10 update has changed the screen aspect ration.</h2>
                    Last Windows 10 update has changed the aspect ration on my screen. It is now a 4:3 ratio but stretched out to fill the 'normal' widescreen of my monitor (16:9??). How do I correct this and why does every Microsoft update cause something to go wrong. Doesn't
 anybody test these updates before releasing them?

            Option 1:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />Make sure recommended settings are selected for Scale and Layout and Screen resolution.
<br />
<br />Another thing you can try:
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />I recommend you uninstall the KB4048955
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />(This is the update you want to uninstall KB4048955)
<br />
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart then see if stability is restored. 
<br />
<br />The update might try to install again. So, try blocking it.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />If its the icons and toolbars, then Go back to Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />Click in the Scale and layout list box, try another scale such as 125 to see if that works or play around with custom scaling. 
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Perform a repair upgrade
<br />

<p>Thanks for this, Andre.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, nothing works. All settings in display are the recommended ones: don't understand the bit about uninstalling the display driver;&nbsp; can't find any trace of&nbsp;KB4048955, nearest is&nbsp;KB4048954; don't know which version of W10 I have for installing
 the driver block.</p>
<p>I really appreciate your efforts but it seems that every W10 update gives me another problem. I'm reasonably computer literate but need some things explained to me as though I'm an idiot. Of course no-one should need to have all this stress after a installing
 a Microsoft update which is meant to improve things. After years of loyalty, seriously considering going over to the dark side - Apple Mac!</p>

<p>Thanks, Sumit. I would have said it was Intel but not sure and I'm away from my desktop for the next few weeks so unable to check. That said, I don't recall ever getting an update of any description from AMD.
</p>
<p>The additional problem I am now having is with iTunes. If I open iTunes I can't close it; it closes for about 5 seconds and then re-opens! The only way I can get rid of it is to restart my desktop! I've been loyal to Microsoft, at home and at work, for at
 least 25 years but I'm now approaching despair.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Higher standards? More like unreasonable. Have you refrained from swearing on Xbox you're entire career?&nbsp;Highly unlikely. Also to say it really isn't unfair is just&nbsp;absolutely wrong. I know people who've gotten banned just because they're spammed with reports for unsporting conduct etc. from salty players. The system is flawed. Perhaps&nbsp;a strike system&nbsp;within ambassadors would make more sense. Not one and tossed. Also I wasn't even allowed to fight my case due to it being a less than one day ban.&nbsp; Yeah, that's fair.</p>

Just because someone uses language that is considered to be vulgar does not make them a bad person or deserving of a ban or removal from a program. I am willing to bet a vast majority of gamers have sworn in their lifetimes whilst playing xbox and on other platforms.

            <p>Hi FoG - no one in the forums can do anything with regards to the enforcement action on your account. Only an enforcement team can discuss the action.&nbsp;</p><p>As for your removal from the program, you need to take that up with the Misters and Misses that oversee the ambassadors.&nbsp; It's not something that should be discussed in a public forum.</p><p><br /></p><p>Something users need to realize. entry to the ambassador program has gotten easier over the years, but the expectation of an ambassador is still the same - lead by example. Ambassadors are not "holier than thou" as Dorian26r notes in his post, but ambassadors are expected to take the higher road.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>For me, it means playing with my mic muted most of the time when in a game of unknown users and I start getting frustrated. Why, many ask...So I don't slip up and say something I might regret.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Be thankful the requirement to join the Ambassador program is to be enforcement free for one yea

<h2>            Troubles and many with Skype</h2>
                    <p>I use Skype on my MacBook Pro and on my iPhone 6.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Issues encountered: </p>
<p>1. Skype does not synchronise between these two devices. Is synchronisation possible? If so, how to do it?
</p>
<p>2. I have lost all my contacts and the money credit (around 9 euros) I had on Skype on my MacBook Pro. Particularly the contacts are a problem because many of these were my clients or studying buddies. How can I recover that? I have sent new invitations
 to connect, in vane, it doesn't work</p>
<p>3. To some reason Skype has decided to share my screen with the people I somehow managed to connect or reconnect with. How do I deal with this?</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>1. Skype does not synchronise between these two devices. Is synchronisation possible? If so, how to do it?&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A: What specifically does not sync? Are these your messages or your calls? If so, were you signed in to two devices at the same time? There could be a possibility that of a delay when&nbsp; users are signed in to multiple devices at once. To make sure you receive
 messages promptly, please see to it that the connection you are using is stable and that you are signed in to a single device at a time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

</blockquote>
<p>A: Contacts are tied to one's account and would not be removed unless you remove them. It could be that you are logged in to a different account. Do you see your contacts and your credits on your iPhone? If you do, sign out from the application on your MacBook
 and make sure to sign back in using the same account you use on your iPhone. Use the original sign in credentials you used to create your account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. To some reason Skype has decided to share my screen with the people I somehow managed to connect or reconnect with. How do I deal with this?</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>A: We've had a number of reports where in users who initiate a video call to their contact will instead share their screen. Please try the following steps for troubleshooting the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Sign out from the Skype application.&nbsp;</li><li>Open&nbsp;<strong>~/Library/Application Support </strong>* and rename your Skype folder.&nbsp;</li><li>Restart your Skype application.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<h2>            I cant install DotNetFramework 3.5 that includes 2.0 and 3.0</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am using windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Recently I tried to install DotNetFrameWork 3.5 that includes 2.0 and 3.0. I couldn't install it from the optional feature manager, It gave me the error code 800F0906, So I downloaded an offline installer. But whenever I open it, it calls the feature on
 demand user experience toolkit. So that also gives me that error. Though I have an working internet connection.</p>
<p>So any Ideas on How can I install that?</p>

    <title>Which Versions of XML Should I Have Installed&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Which Versions of XML Should I Have Installed&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. <br />
<br />
I'd like to know which versions of MSXML are recommended to be installed on my laptop PC. I messed things up while trying to resolve an XML error within NetSafe Security Suite by Authentium.
<br />
<br />
I have a HEWLETT-PACKARD HP PAVILION dv6000 with VISTA HOME PREMIUM 6.0, SP2, 32-BIT operating system.<br />
<br />
Currently under my installed programs, I have:<br />
<br />
MSXML 4.0 SP2 (KB925672)&nbsp; 3/20/2007<br />
MSXML 4.0 SP2 (KB927978)&nbsp; 3/20/2007<br />
MSXML 4.0 SP2 (KB936181)&nbsp; 8/16/2007<br />
MSXML 4.0 SP2 (KB941833)&nbsp; 11/6/2007<br />
MSXML 4.0 SP2 (KB954430)&nbsp; 11/19/2008<br />
MSXML 4.0 SP3 Parser 7/17/2009<br />
<br />
I think I mistakenly uninstalled MSXML 6.0. Then I downloaded the 4.0 SP3 Parser the other day while trying to determine what should be installed.<br />
<br />
I stopped there, however, when I realized I was in over my head. I use my computer for basic things like internet, email, documents, etc. I don't write programs or anything like that, so I'm clearly just going to make matters worse.<br />
<br />
Please advise me on what to do with&nbsp;the above installed MSXML programs, which MSXML&nbsp;versions or updates&nbsp;I should have, and the easiest way to download the correct applications to get everything straightened out.<br />
<br />
Your help is very much appreciated!<br />
<br />
Patrick</p>

            Thanks so much for the quick response!<br />
<br />
Before I install 6.1 SP1, should I uninstall any of the MSXML 4.0 programs I currently have installed, or will 6.1 SP1 cover it?<br />

            Hi. I followed the link to 6.0 SP1.<br />
<br />
I tried to download msxml6_ia64.msi. It failed, saying "This installation package is not supported by this processor type. Contact your product vendor.<br />
<br />
So I tried to download msxml6_x64.msi. It also failed for the same reason.<br />
<br />
I downloaded msxml6_x86.msi. It said "Setup has installed MSXML 6.0 successfully. Click Finish to exit."<br />
<br />
However, nothing else seems to have happened. It didn't tell me I needed to install anything else or change anything. It also doesn't show up&nbsp;in my list of installed programs. I restarted the computer and still the only MSXML programs listed there are&nbsp;the ones
 I noted in my original post.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on what I'm doing wrong?<br />
<br />
Thanks

            Ok so now go get SP1 (6.0 would not know to tell you to get more advanced versions)<br />

You need the x86 version as you have a 32 bit processor<br />

I think that's the same link that you sent before. Either way, it's not working. It says setup has installed MSXML Parser successfully. But still, nothing happens after that&nbsp;and it doesn't show up in&nbsp;programs installed on the computer.

Try to install it again and see if it does not say already installed.<br />

            I am having the same problem, and I do have the 64-bit system.&nbsp; The downloads say that installation is complete but does not show as installed.&nbsp; Also get the&nbsp;message when attempting the&nbsp;msxml6_ia64.msi. It failed, saying "This installation package is not

    <title>Backup Wizard - Placement of files on External Hard Drive &#40;WD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dtdakid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backup Wizard - Placement of files on External Hard Drive &#40;WD Passport&#41;</h2>
                    I recently backedup all of my pics, vids, and music files to an external hard drive (WD Passport) via Microsoft Backup Wizard.&nbsp; In the past I had used WD Sync or Dmailer Sync, but I was not able to find my files anywhere, not sure why. If anyone knows
 why let me know, but my actually question is....<br />
<br />
When Microsoft Backup Wizard backedup my files from my PC to my external drive it placed the files in an array of folders (i.e. Backup Folder 1, Backup Folder 2, etc) and then you have to go through an array of folders within the folders to access my files.&nbsp;
 The files were not arranged in the same folders/fashion as they were on my PC. Is there anyway I can make this happen so that I can find my files on the external drive faster/easier?<br />
<br />
Any information would be helpful.<br />
<br />
Thank you so much.

            Unfortunately, that's how Microsoft Backup works in Vista.&nbsp; If you need to do a restore, it should restore them to their original locations (not all jumbled like they are in the backup).&nbsp; I'm not sure why this happens, but it's something we need to live
 with with this product.&nbsp; Microsoft Backup products (pretty much all of them) are not the best on the market and have quite a few deficiencies which will hopefully be addressed in future updates and or releases.<br />
<br />
Many people don't like Microsoft Backup and Restore Center and choose a 3rd party product to do backups (I don't myself - but have considered it many times when I encounter problems or read about problems here in these forums).&nbsp; The one I've heard recommended
 most frequently (and that I recommend) is Acronis True Image&nbsp;<a href="http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/trueimage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.acronis.com/homecomputing/products/trueimage/</a>.&nbsp; I'm not&nbsp;sure it it resolves this problem, but it comes with a free
 trial &nbsp;so you can check for yourself at no risk.<br />
<br />
As far as finding your missing files for WD Sync or Dmailer Sync, if you know the names we can do a COMPLETE search of the system (a regular search only searches locations and file types in the index and they may not be there - have you checked All Programs
 to see if they made an entry there for their backup functions).&nbsp; Here's how: <span>
To search the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">entire</span> C: drive in Vista go to Start / Search Box and type in '&lt;filename&gt; or &lt;foldername&gt;'. As you're typing you'll see two hyperlinks appear just above where you're typing and one will say Search
 Everywhere.&nbsp; Click on that.&nbsp; That will do a quick indexed search and bring up a dialog box.&nbsp; Click on Advanced Search.&nbsp; Click on the location drop down menu and find Drive C: and click on it. Check the box "include non-indexed, hidden, and system files (may
 be slow)."&nbsp; Then click on Search.&nbsp; You will now be searching your entire hard drive for the specified file.&nbsp; And yes, it's not a very efficient way of searching the entire drive for a file but that's how it's done in Vista (and it does work at searching the
 entire drive).<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

<p>I have searched extensively on-line but have not found any solution. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            No disrespect, but I find it hard to believe that a corporation that produces software as ubiquitous as windows would not have taken the situation I presently find myself in, into consideration. There must be an easy way to do it. Something similar to
 the migration tool available in previous versions. Something! Anything! Come on!

    <title>I want to migrate WIN7 64bit OEM install to a 120g SSD &#40;no O&#47;S - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I want to migrate WIN7 64bit OEM install to a 120g SSD &#40;no O&#47;S disks&#41;</h2>
                    My 500GB hdd / 4GB RAM system is fine; no problems. It gets backed up to 1TB ext drive regularly. I've just got an SSD put in today and want to move the O/S across to the SSD, and my fairly modest pc/tech skills are being stretched to 'headscratching'
 territory just reading around about trying to do this without Windows7 on disks. Just by the by, the Samsung 830 series SSD came with SSD Magician &amp; Norton Ghost 15.0 programs (that I know nothing about) if they are of a help. I'm ok with everything being
 wiped clean if necessary, if that makes the process easier. Oh... I've got the Win7 product key sticker on the side of the box. So I guess I'm after the easiest recipe to make my life boot from SSD and install all progs on there too. Cheers!

            <p>Option 1:</p>
<p>You can clone the installation to the SSD, provided the SSD is large enough to hold the installation to be cloned.</p>
<p>See </p>
<p><a href="http://www.ssdfreaks.com/content/664/how-to-clone-hdd-to-ssd-with-windows-7s-own-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://www.ssdfreaks.com/content/664/how-to-clone-hdd-to-ssd-with-windows-7s-own-software</u></a>
 or (much easier) use a trial copy of Acronis True Image Home 2012.</p>
<p>Note that immediately after cloning you must shut down and disconnect the original installation. The disk can be reconnected once the SSD has booted successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 2:</p>
<p>Download the corresponding edition of Windows 7 you have a license for from the following link. You can identify the edition on COA sticker attached to your machine, with at bottom or battery compartment (laptop) or top/side if its a desktop computer.</p>

            <p>instead of doing a clean install of windows you can use the back up and restore feature built into windows 7 to create a sytem image of your current setup, which you can use to transfer everything over to the SSD.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-is-a-system-image" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-is-a-system-image</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you have created the image of the SSD you will want to create a Sytem repair disk to boot the pc&nbsp;&nbsp;from</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>once you have the image created you can swap the HDD out for the SSD and use the sytem repair disk to boot the pc, after which you can install the system image you created earlier onto the SSD.</p>
