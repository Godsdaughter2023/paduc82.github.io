<h2>            There is a black white strip along the top of my file explorer.</h2>
                    There is a black white strip along the top of my file explorer. The same thing happened to Microsoft Edge. I believe this happens to all the Microsoft apps. This does not happen with other applications such as google chrome. When i click on the blank strip,
 it goes to the program behind it.

            That is pretty odd. If you haven't restarted, do so.
<br />Do a System File check and run DISM tool and post back the results in the next reply:

<h2>            My Discussions</h2>
                    
<p>I honestly don't know where to post this so my first question is, where do we post support issues with navigating xbox.com? Tons of stuff has been moved, removed or is just down-right broken now and no one has bothered to help me or to fix it.</p>

<p>My second question is how do I now know where I posted all my help questions on support without having to remember which forum I posted in? Why isn't there a "my discussions" on the forum home page and/or why don't the forums I post in show up under "my
 forums" when I post in the support forums?</p>

<p>Finally, what's the chance of any of this getting fixed (or the other issues with xbox.com and kinect that I posted elsewhere)?</p>

<p>Hey there! I couldn't find any links with specific information on this so I'll answer to the best of my knowledge.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Since the update of the new forums things have slowing been getting back to normal. Navigation was much harder when the first roll out of the update forums came out, but using the hyperlinks under the title of the forum in this case 03 - Manage my xbox live
 account is quite an efficient way to navigate once you know where everything is.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Any thread that you make or post in can be kept track off by hitting the "Favourite this thread" &nbsp;option underneath the hyperlinks I mentioned above.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Also when you are out on the main page of this forum look down the right side for options to favourite the forums or change general settings. Hope this helps.</p>

I know that the Xbox one s had the correct plugin and can be used in Europe but am not sure about the games. What I'm most concerned about is preorderding Destiny 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;If i&nbsp;preorder in the US will i be able to play the beta and the&nbsp;game&nbsp;in Finland??</p>

                    <p>So,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two laptops and both are Windows10 running Onedrive. The Onedrive folder on each laptop C: drive are identical and synching properly BUT if I logon to Onedrive online only one of the laptops can see my folders or files in the cloud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked at threads and tried to reinstall, clear browser cache, incognito mode to no avail. My computer with this problem is a Hp Pavilion dm1 (Netbook). The laptop that can see the online folders is a Lenovo i7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried different browsers - firefox, Edge, Chrome. Not working. It appears that something unique to this computer is making it incapable of seeing the folders/files in the cloud that I have confirmed are still there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a solution?</p>

            <p>Hi Kwatts45,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description provided, it appears that you get the "Net-broadcast event window 2.0.0"&nbsp; when you try to shut down the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we require more information on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me answer these questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Have you installed any .net or visual studio&nbsp;programs?</p>
<p>2. Were there any changes made to the computer prior the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a couple of steps which should assist you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Check if the issue persists when the Computer is in clean boot by referring to the following article.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<span>from the KB article 310353.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also check for error messages in event viewer. If you find any error messages then post back the exact error message so that we can assist you better.</p>

            Ciao,
<br />
<br />the Surface Pro 3 was initially shipped with Windows 8.1 Pro, but since the Windows 10 release on July 29, 2015, new devices came with the updated OS pre-installed, eliminating the need to upgrade as is the case on existing devices. The Windows 10 upgrade, among other features, brings a Tablet mode, which can be useful when device is used as a tablet, that is without a keyboard attached.
<br />
<br />You can reset Surface Pro 3, please follow instructions below choosing your OS:

<br />Please let us know if this solves your issue.

<p>Hi there, I need a little help with my email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have two computers (one purchased recently), both using Windows Live Mail as my email client. They are both connected to my Gmail email account via POP, and both seem to function properly (receiving/sending etc.). The problem I have is when I receive an
 email to my inbox on one computer, it doesn't come through on the other. Is there a simple solution for this? I have '<em>Leave a copy of messages on server</em> ' checked on both computers in Live Mail, and on my Gmail settings<span>'<em>When messages are
 accessed with POP</em> </span>' I have it set to '<em>Keep Gmail's copy in the Inbox</em> '. Can anybody help? I doesn't bother me synchronizing sent/junk mail etc, I just want to make sure both computers receive the same Inbox emails, as it's frustrating
 having to reply from one computer or the other.</p>
<p>Has anybody got this successfully setup? I tried doing research but haven't found anything that has worked. Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

<div>It should work the way you are doing it with telling both computers to leave a copy on the server.&nbsp; If one of them isn't doing it, you might try&nbsp;removing the account from that computer, then check to see that the other computer is working
 correctly to leave the messages on the server, and then add the account back again on the other computer and set it to leave messages on the server and then see if that works.</div>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>Firstly, thank you for the link. Yeah, thats why I'm so perplexed. By my rudimentary figuring, hasn't everything been set up correctly already? I've tried tests, opening WLM on one computer and receiving mail, then closing it and opening it on the other
 computer (after sending a new message to myself via another account), and both seem to do the same thing - only downloading what the other hasn't already. That rules out one of the computers not being configured correctly, as both are functioning exactly like
 the other, right? I logged in online at Goggle, and the messages are all there in my inbox, and bolded as per being unread. Shouldn't both the WLM's recognise this as both be downloading? Also, I deleted and re-added the account on the new computer two or
 three times now, and so far this particular issue still exists. Removing the account from the other computer would be a pain as I have lots of stuff, including archive folders and such, already on there.</p>
<p>Has anyone else had a similar issue, or can shed some light on the situation?</p>

<h3> jersey-devil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Libraries</h2>
                    Because I didn't get any response to my questions about how to use Windows 10 libraries, I blundered ahead anyway.&nbsp; I seem to have gotten the hang of how to set up libraries but am still puzzled.&nbsp; Assuming I got it right, I don't see much difference between
 using Quick Access and Libraries.&nbsp; In fact, Quick Access is easier to setup and faster to use, so far as I can tell.&nbsp; The further mystery is why Microsoft elected to hide Libraries, causing the user to have to make Libraries visible.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I've read
 at least one post where the author thinks libraries are the cat's pajamas.&nbsp; I don't get it.

<p>The power of Libraries is that they can combine the contents of multiple folders is a single 'logical' folder and the data displayed in different ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance, because I create and save a lot on my Desktop, I've added the Desktop folder to my Documents library. Then, when searching, I don't have to worry about whether it's in Documents or Desktop, I just search the Documents library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other useful feature is Stacked views. Right-click in the background of a Library folder and hover over 'Arrange by...'</p>
<p>You will see various options, and these option differ based on the Library type (Documents, Music, Pictures)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not at my 10 machine so I can't post screenshots, but will check back.</p>

<h3> emir &#214;ge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio volume changes when used Ctrl &#43; Alt &#43; B key combination</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; I was working on Visual Studio Code and used that key combination to build my script while listening music at the same time. Then I realized that when I use this combination it reduces my speaker volume. No matter what programs are open or closed, it changes
 my volume level. Does anyone know what could be the reason? It is too annoying that whenever I build my project my music volume changes (and I also am curious about what is happening).&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>For the past few hours I've been struggling to get my xbox one to do anything for more than 30 minutes at a time. I've done hard power cycles, a factory reset keeping my games and apps, and a factory reset wiping all of it. The only thing on this xbox now
 is my downloaded copy of devil may cry 5. I still get this stupid error code popping up saying it took too long to load. The xbox store? Same error code. I do a hard restart? Same error code about the home screen. What is the deal? Did they send out a bad
 update? I was literally playing this same game with a loaded up hard drive (several games and apps) yesterday, switching between YouTube and Netflix during pauses in the game, all without any hiccups. Now the thing can't even start up without something crashing.
 Again, the problem has persisted AFTER multiple resets and restarts. Any ideas? I'm really annoyed. This is not the only time this has happened either. A couple months back, the same exact thing was happening, until suddenly it wasn't. I'm sure I'm not the
 only one this is happening too.</p>

<p>Hey there Hafevil!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to get your console to run as smoothly as it's supposed to.
</p>
<p>I would say that if factory resetting it did not help with the problem, that it would probably be best for you to reset your network or port forward your network. Nowadays, a lot of games rely on quick access to the internet in order to run and pick up your
 profile information when you play and network issues can lead to this kind of thing as well. I suggest port forwarding your modem/router settings following the information here on
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/network-ports-used-xbox-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Network ports used by Xbox Live on Xbox One</a>. There's also a great site with various means to port forward different network hardware devices here on
<a href="https://portforward.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">portforward.com</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would try to set that up and see if the issue persists. Give that a shot when you&nbsp;get a chance and let us know how that helped.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<h2>            moving to new country</h2>
                    
<p>hello..&nbsp;<br />
i am egyptian<br />
i bought my xbox 360 kinect 4gb bundle from america about three monthes ago from bestbuy&nbsp;<br />
i moved to my homeland (egypt) now and of course i face a power voltage proplem <br />
in egypt we use 220v equipment... since we are a 220v region .. and all equipment are designed to work like this
<br />
but my xbox power supply properties are : input= 110~127 v ... output=12 v <br />
i asked radioshack (a local electronics mega store) about this problem .. and the answer was:we can give you a small step down adapter but it might blow ... and we we will not accept a blown refund... only big converters work<br />
so i bought a step down converter from ebay ...it worked as a charm ... it came with 3 backup fuses .... but after 3 weeks, the were all burnt
<br />
and i am now suffering searching for fuses that may work on my adapter&nbsp;<br />
on gamevalley (a local mega gamestore) i found a xbox 360 power supply and it was designed to work in egypt<br />
the question now is = should i buy it if the output is 12 v like the original one
<br />
<br />
please reply soon&nbsp;</p>

<p>It should work fine as long as it's the right style and supplies enough wattage and it will be a lot safer than using a step down converter.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you have a newer console which makes it easier to match up the correct power supply than if it was the original 360. Just make sure that it was built for the same console (360 S or 360 E). If you're unsure you should be able to bring in your
 old power supply to your local game store and ask them for an appropriate replacement.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Xbox One - Update Frequency and Download Time&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings Xboxers,</p>
<p>It's been awhile since I've been on these forums. I don't have a whole lot of time to dedicate to gaming anymore, but I try to sign in and play at least once a week. However, I've been running into an extremely high annoyance with the Xbox One. Every time
 I boot the console up, I run into a "It's time to update!" screen. I then have to spend the next 30 minutes starting at a green bar slowwwwwwlllyyyyyy fill until the update is done. Sometimes it's relatively quick, but I feel like there's an unnecessary amount
 of these hideous and slow updates. Even the small patches tend to take much longer than a file of similar size on a PC can handle (or even PS4, for that matter).</p>
<p>Are there known defects to the Wifi on X1?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Bug&#63;  Windows Live Mail encrypts &#40;SMime&#41; outgoing email using certificate of sender &#40;account holder&#41; rather than certificate of recipient &#33;</h2>
                    <p>Using windows live mail on windows 8.1, &nbsp;sending an encrypted email to a recipient who is in my windows Live contacts, &nbsp;as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the sender using Windows Live Mail. &nbsp;My Windows Live Mail has a certificate associated with my account. That is, in the Windows Live mail, "accounts", "properties", "security", "signing" and "certificate" for signing and encrypting, I specify to use
 my certificate. &nbsp;My Certificate matches my email address. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recipient is in the contacts of Windows Live Mail. &nbsp;The contact/recipient info has the digital id (certificate with public key, matching their email address) specified in the contact info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I compose an email to recipient, in the email window, &nbsp;I choose options, "Encrypt". &nbsp; &nbsp;Can chose sign, or unchoose "sign". &nbsp; When I then send the email, the resulting email is encrypted (SMime) with my certificate. &nbsp;This is a bug, as the email should
 be encrypted with the recipient's certificate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, Windows Live should encrypt outgoing email using the digital id certificate of the recipient, but is incorrect because Windows Live Mail is using the certificate of me the sender. &nbsp; &nbsp;(Or I be trippin!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>(My email account is with GMail - so Windows Live Mail account is using imap/smtp with GMail)</p>
<p>(The certificates for both sender and recipient are mail certificates from Comodo.com)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Sending and viewing encrypted e-mail messages requires both sender and recipient to share their digital ID, or public key certificate. This means that you and the recipient must send the other a digitally signed message, which

            <p>Hello.</p>
<p>Yes, correct. &nbsp;Both sender and receiver must share each other's digital certificate. &nbsp;That's what I did, as described in the original question and screen shots - which show correct setup - the recipient's certificate is in my contacts, and I have my own
 certificate with my account - as shown in the screen shots I provided - please see the private messages associated with this forum entry. &nbsp;Everything is set up correctly. &nbsp; &nbsp; There appears to be a bug, as the resulting encrypted email is encrypted by Windows
 Live EMail with the sender's certificate, when sending an email. However, &nbsp;Windows Live EMail should encrypt with the recipient's certificate. &nbsp;Please try it yourself to convince yourself.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that&nbsp;this is&nbsp;not a bug and it is not your certificate that is the one encrypted on&nbsp;the outgoing emails rather than the recipient's certificate.&nbsp;The reason why&nbsp;your certificate is the one encrypted is because it allow recipients to validate
 the legitimacy of email that came from you, being the sender.</p>

            <p>Hello&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your statements regarding certificates is correct. &nbsp;However Windows LIve Mail is not behaving the way you describe. &nbsp;I think there is definitely a bug. &nbsp;<br />
(1) &nbsp;In windows live mail, when sending an email to a contact in which I have their certificate, &nbsp;Windows Live mail &nbsp;shows choices under options, for encrypt, &nbsp;sign. &nbsp;In my test, I choose encrypt, &nbsp;and don't choose sign. Therefore, there is no signing certificate
 with this email test. There is only an encryption certificate. &nbsp;Windows Live mail is using the wrong certificate - it's using the sender's certificate to ENCRYPT when it should use the recipient's certificate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
(2) As another test, &nbsp;when I do test sending encrypted email with window live mail and I do choose both SIGN and ENCRYPT, &nbsp;the resulting email is correctly signed with my (sender) certificate, but it's encrypted with my (sender) certificate which is wrong because
 live mail should encrypt with the recipient certificate. &nbsp;To prove this, &nbsp;when viewing the email, &nbsp;click on the lock/certificate/encyrption icon. &nbsp;Windows live mail shows a window with button 'view certificate". &nbsp;Next, there are three buttons: one for signing
 certificate, &nbsp;one for encryption certificate, and one for sender's certificate. &nbsp; ( I can send screen shot if you like). &nbsp; View each of these. &nbsp; When viewing the encryption certificate, can see that it is that of the sender; however it should be that of the
 recipient. &nbsp; So a bug is evident.<br />
As a further test, &nbsp;when I view encrypted and signed emails that originate from other email software, the encryption certificate is correct. &nbsp;However, only email from windows live mail show an incorrect encryption certificate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(3) When I send encrypted email from windows live mail, the recipient can't read it, as their email client says they don't have a matching certificate. &nbsp;This is because the recipient has their own certificate. &nbsp;However the windows live mail is encrypted
 with the wrong certificate, as I described, so the recipient can't read it unfortunately.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(4) To prove the issue, As a test, if you like, &nbsp;send me your public key (certificate) and I'll save you in my contacts. Then I'll send you an encrypted email and you won't be able to read it, because windows live email is encrypting with my certificate
 - but it should encrypt with yours.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(5) As a test, to prove the issue, is you like, &nbsp;I can send you my public key (certificate), and you could save me in &nbsp;your contacts. Then you send me an email, but I won't be able to read it cause it'll be encrypted with your certificate when it should
 be encrypted with mine.</p>
<p><br />
(6) As a test, you might try it yourself. &nbsp;We understand how it should work, but it's not working to use the recipient certificate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(7) There is yet a new/another "bug" or issue. &nbsp;This is separate issue. &nbsp; When viewing a signed and encrypted email, &nbsp;and then choose to view the certificate, &nbsp;then there a three buttons, one for signing certificate, &nbsp;one for encryption certificate, and
 one for sender's certificate. Choose any of these. The heading in the pop up of each of these says "Signing digital ID properties". This is true for the signing certificate. But this heading in the pop-up windows is incorrect and false (in my opinion) for
 the encryption certifcate and the senders certificate. Heading should say "Encryption digital ID properties" and "Senders digital ID properties", in my opinion, for the latter two. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Thank You,</p>

<h2>            &#34;Your pc ran into a problem&#34; loop Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've seen a few topics about this, but they all offer the same unhelpful advice of "Start-up Repair" which DOES NOT WORK for me. I've tried it several times now. I have also tried resetting Windows, which didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had this laptop for a single day and it's ALREADY doing this. I've done literally nothing to it other than Windows Updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have some advice that is NOT "run Start-up Repair" for fixing this, please? I'm getting quite frantic, as this laptop is very expensive. Thanks!</p>

<p>I didn't get an error like that on the screen, and I can't access Safe Mode either from the Troubleshoot menu. I spoke to a tech guy earlier and he gave me an iso but I couldn't get that to boot from the USB either and apparently there's no way to boot it
 from the Troubleshooting menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a Restore Point, and I can't Reset it either as that doesn't work. I ran chkdsk in the Command Prompt but that came up with nothing. It didn't come with a disc. I don't think I can get a refund under warranty when it's a Windows 10 problem,
 and I can't afford repair costs. Kinda stuck.</p>

<p>To install Windows 10 using the USB, we need to change the boot priority of your computer from Hard Disk to USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend that you reach your computer manufacturer's support to properly guide you in accessing BIOS, since there are different ways to access BIOS depending on the manufacturer of the computer.

    <title>Windows 7 System Instability - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> schmung  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 System Instability</h2>
                    I'm now on my third Win7 install that has once again become unbootable and am currently posting this from Linux. I've completely run out of ideas here and am desperate for help. I've ended up in this situation twice before and each time the end result
 is the same - an unbootable and unusable installation of 7. The problem is that I can't work out where the problem is. My hardware is fine - XP and Ubuntu are both rock solid and I can use them with no problems.&nbsp; However, Win 7 is entirely fine, usually for
 a period of a few weeks, before rapidly becoming very unstable. Now, my first thought that spyware/malware or a duff software install. So, on first re-install I made sure to create system restore points afer every install and to create backup. Alas, the system
 then got to a point where I couldn't boot it and it wasn't seeing the backups. So, I did a completely clean reformat and re-install. The same thing has now just happened. The symptoms each time are roughly similar :<br />
System stops responding. My music stops playing and all my apps appear frozen. Looking in process explroer I can see firefox is waiting on network i/o to finish.<br />
The windows media library becomes corrupted.<br />
<br />
There then follows a period where the system tries to repair itself and eventually boots in normally. It will then promptly hang again and become completely unresponsive, before forcing me to shut it down manually and hitting a cycle of trying to repair itself
 and eventualyl becoming completely unbootable in any way shape or form.<br />
<br />
These are the only two common factors between all three installs. I've installed on different physical hard drives, swapped out my wireless network card and used different anti virus and spyware software on each install only to have this happen a few weeks
 after I install Windows 7. Drivers etc are always updated to their latest revisions from mfr websites soon after I install, so I don't think it's that. My memory is (as near I can tell) fine and as I've said I've no issues with other OS's.<br />
<br />
The windows media library issue I thought may be separate, so I tried using other media players. They crash as well. Ditto firefox - I've tried google chrome, only to have that halt on me as well.<br />
<br />
My initial thought was that it was my wireless network card, but I removed that after the first time this happened and have been using onboard wired network ever since, only for the same thing to happen.&nbsp; I am at my wits end here, I can only assume that I have
 some bit of hardware that it causing Win7 to have some serious issues, or that there is something luriking in my vast collection of MP3s and user data that it doesn't like, but I've no idea what it could be as my virus/malware scan never never turn up any
 problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gigabyte EP43 S3L<br />
Ati Radeon 4830<br />
4gb corsair RAM<br />
<br />
Win 7 64 Home Premium<br />
<br />
Any suggestions gratefully received.<br />
<br />
Edit : as a brief addendum to the above, have gotten abck into windows 7 using CD to repair, but from experience expect this problem to persist and worsen. Last time it happened I managed to close all stuck processes, but system was still unresponsive - I could
 just see resource monitor sitting there, but couldn't interact with anything else. Annoyingly, it didn't actually seem to be doing anything, CPU activity low, memory fine, nothing in disk or network i/o that I wouldn't expect.<br />
<br />
Found these in the event viewer :<br />

<br />
<br />
The program firefox.exe version 1.9.2.3667 stopped interacting with Windows and was closed. To see if more information about the problem is available, check the problem history in the Action Center control panel.<br />
&nbsp;Process ID: 608<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking at them it would seem I've got (or windows is causing) some sort of disk error. This is worrying - as I've stated, I've had these symptoms with windows installed to two different hard drives. Any ideas? Any other logfiles I should be looking for? I
 never used Vista, so what I do know about windows is all xp based.<br />

            Woah! That was a detailed explanation I should say.<br />
<br />
First SUGGESTION would be - TEST your RAM. <br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a> <br />
<br />
You can run a memory test directly from Windows 7 too.<br />

            I've run memtest from&nbsp; windows repair and it all comes out clean, so I don't think it's that. Of course, it could be something that it's not picked up - my only theory as to why I've not noticed it on XP is that it only supports 2gb of RAM and is therefore
 only using one of my sticks of RAM. Not sure about that though as I've no idea how xp goes about choosing how it allocates the system RAM.

            Did this issue ever got resolved actually? I'm suffering from a similar condition. Also tried the Windows memory test (clean) and tried sfc /scannow (had issues the first time, which it fixed. Now clean).

<p>Its a fairly new computer, about 2 months old, I did transfer data from my old computer (Win XP) using the windows 7 tool.</p>
<p>The motherboard was replaced by Dell,&nbsp; after that the Windows Genuine thing said my windows wasn't genuine, I had to use the phone activation system to re-authenticate.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.<br />
<br />
9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispware/security programs can also cause these issues.<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to see<br />
if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be caused by a loose card or cable<br />
and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel - Device<br />
Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display Adapter - NIC<br />
and WIFI - Sound and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow computer to turn off power.<br />
Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Start - type in Search box - MSCONFIG&nbsp; find at top - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else). See next message for my<br />
generic driver update methods.</strong></p>

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
Updating drivers, BIOS, and control software (if any) is a good idea.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate
<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each
<br />
installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually
<br />
by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be
<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and
<br />
then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<p>Thanks for all the info but I'm not sure what parts of your post apply to me.</p>
<p>You are saying it could be a power supply issue but unlikely.</p>
<p>I should try preventing all major&nbsp; drivers from shutting off.</p>
<p>ok</p>
<p>but then are you saying I need to let my computer sit in diagnostics mode for 1 to 2 days to see if its the video driver?</p>
<p>I thought I included the bluescreen info that you are asking for, what did I miss?</p>
<p>Is there a way to narrow down the cause?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>That error can be caused by a weak or over-loaded powersupply so if you see other strange<br />
and/or possibly hardware related issues keep that in mind.<br />
<br />
No, you should just update all your major drivers as the best plan of attack.<br />
<br />
Check using the MyEventViewer and BlueScreenView tools as sometimes the actually driver<br />
"might" be identifiable.</p>
<p>Those are methods for anyone with that error. That yours is so sporatic makes it a little<br />
tougher to narrow down the cause so a frontal attack on the issue is required - meaning<br />
upgrade drivers and see if it helps.</p>

<p>Also, from the minidump file&nbsp;the driver that is being blamed for the DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE error&nbsp;is the athrx.sys which appears to be a driver for the wireless.</p>
<p>However, as you have ZoneAlarm installed, consider that ZoneAlarm drivers may be at the root of the issue as reported in the following thread:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7hardware/thread/d10e3bcd-6a57-42f5-b0e0-7ad11c267c90" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7hardware/thread/d10e3bcd-6a57-42f5-b0e0-7ad11c267c90</a></p>
<p>Consider uninstalling ZoneAlarm and see if the BSODs resolve.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As per the result in Windows Compatibility Center,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Photo Explorer Deluxe - 5 is&nbsp;supported to run in Windows 8.1 as well. However, if you are still unable to run it, you may run the program in Compatibility mode for Windows 8 and check.</p>
