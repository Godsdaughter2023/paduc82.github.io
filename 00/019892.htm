            Personally I try to use Late Binding for any of my Office app&nbsp;code&nbsp;so I can avoid the reference issues completely.

            Yes, you will be able to do a Clean install, you can choose 'Keep Nothing' when you are upgrading from Windows 8.1 or do a Reset after Windows 10 is installed.

    <title>Project Spartan, Feedback app, Store beta do not work in build 10121 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jjocat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Project Spartan, Feedback app, Store beta do not work in build 10121</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 just finished updating to build10121 on my laptop.&nbsp; I was hoping it would resolve some of the issues I have been experiencing since 10041 was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I cannot access the feedback app.&nbsp; When I try I get a message saying I must be registered with the Insider Program.&nbsp; I AM registered.&nbsp; I have tried all of the solutions to this problem I could find and NOTHING works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; I cannot access the Insider Hub.&nbsp; All I get is a message that says Please sign in and connect.&nbsp; This will not work even after I go to the Insider page and sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; I cannot access the Windows Store.&nbsp; Here I get a message the says the server has stumbled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Project Spartan does not work.&nbsp; It says Where to next and then tells me it can't reach that page.&nbsp; No matter what I type in it can't reach that page.&nbsp; I have tried the suggested "fixes" and nothing works.&nbsp; It still can't reach that page.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems obvious to me that though the system recognizes my Microsoft account password when I logon to my computer and the Windows Insider Preview Program recognizes it when I login there, it is not being "seen" by my apps which are connected to that account
 (i.e. the feedback app, etc.)&nbsp; The feedback app worked fine when I first downloaded Windows 10.&nbsp; It seems that every new build is piling on more problems and not fixing any of the old ones.&nbsp; Microsoft is not really going to unleash this mess on an unprepared
 public are they?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10 Technical preview.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try few methods and check if it works:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> I would suggest you to<strong> run the System File Checker
</strong>utility and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>SFC/Scannow</span></strong><span> checks your Windows installation for errors and corrects them. This will help with ensuring that a smooth upgrade occurs.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and select <strong>Control Panel (Admin).</strong></span></li><li><span>At the <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, type: <strong>sfc/scannow</strong></span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: If the issue persists, I would suggest you&nbsp;to create a new user account and check if it fixes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the steps below to
<strong>create a new User Account:</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to <strong>
Settings.</strong></span></li><li><span>Choose <strong>
Accounts</strong>&nbsp;and then select <strong>Other</strong> <strong>User Accounts</strong> towards the left.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>
Add an&nbsp;Account.</strong></span></li><li><span>Enter a <strong>
user&nbsp;name</strong> and hit <strong>Next.</strong></span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>
Finish.</strong></span></li><li><span>Sign out from the
<strong>Current&nbsp;Account</strong> and Log into <strong>the new&nbsp;account.</strong></span></li><li><span>Check if issue persists.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>You can also refer to the Microsoft blog&nbsp;and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/05/20/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-10122-for-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/05/20/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-10122-for-pcs/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope the information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance with Windows related issues. We will be happy to help.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks.

            <p>Thank you for the prompt reply.&nbsp; I tried everything you suggested including creating my fourth user account (I have seen that solution before).&nbsp; I am sorry to say that nothing worked.&nbsp; I still have the same problems I had before I tried your fixes.&nbsp; The
 scan did tell me that everything is good with the installation.&nbsp; It found no violations.&nbsp; Where to from here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know from reading comments and questions in the forums that I am not the only one experiencing these particular problems.&nbsp; Please tell me Microsoft is going to fix these "glitches" before they release Windows 10 for general consumption.&nbsp; I built my own
 desktop and have "rehabbed" a number of computers and I have never seen so many problems caused by an operating system.&nbsp; The technical preview of 8.1 was smooth as silk compared to this.&nbsp; Why so many serious problems with Windows 10?</p>

    <title>Migration from people.live.com to outlook.live.com has destroyed my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Migration from people.live.com to outlook.live.com has destroyed my address book&#33;</h2>
                    <p><span><span><strong>The migration from people.live.com to outlook.live.com</strong> (the full path is https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/people), which Microsoft started somewhere in 2016 (and happened in my case in October 2016) literally
<strong>DESTROYED my whole address book!</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>It’s unusable now, every single contact, the whole address book is totally messed up</strong> and by this all the contacts (in total around 500) on my Windows Phones as well.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As we know phone contacts and contacts on other Windows devices nowadays sync with the contacts under outlook.live.com (formerly people.live.com) or in other words with the so-called Cloud.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>It took me years(!) to create and manage my address book until it was complete and perfect, with all necessary and up-to-date information in the correct corresponding fields. Most of my 500 contacts contain plenty of detailed information.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In the past I had used the interface under people.live.com for this because it was far more convenient and comfortable than on a tiny phone display and its keyboard.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>But with the migration from people.live.com to outlook.live.com Microsoft simply destroyed my indispensable and
<strong>formerly perfect address book!</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>I’m basically living without my address book now, for 6 months already, but nothing changed in the meantime. My address book with its essential, very important contact data (mainly business contacts) remains unusable!</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The whole address management, the whole address book solution with the current Outlook Web-App’s (OWA) “People” section under
</span><a href="https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/people</span></span></a><span> (serving as the central “Cloud”) with all its syncing People-/Contact-Apps
 for Desktop- and Mobile devices is nothing but a catastrophe, a immense chaos, a shocking huge mess and therefore something that seems to be programmed by dilettantes. It’s not just an embarrassing shameful programming performance by Microsoft but also completely
 unacceptable, particularly for business users.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em><span><span>Here now the long list of the countless problems and errors that occur with my address book since the migration from people.live.com to outlook.live.com.
</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span><span>Please note: <strong>All following examples and terms refer to the German version of the Outlook Web-App (OWA) and the People-App!</strong> I don’t know whether these issues apply to the English or other foreign-language versions as well.</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span><span>(And I repeat: Before, when my address book still resided under people.live.com, I had NONE of the following problems.
<strong>Before the migration to outlook.live.com my address book was in perfect status!</strong>)</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><span><span>Private telephone numbers are falsely shown as business telephone numbers in the Outlook Web-App (OWA).<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Business telephone numbers are falsely shown as private telephone numbers in the Outlook Web-App (OWA).<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Telephone numbers disappear in the Phone’s Contacts-App even though these numbers are visible in the Outlook Web-App’s (OWA) people section under https://outlook.live.com/owa/?path=/people.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li>The Outlook Web-App (OWA) and the Phone’s Contacts-App don’t follow/obey the entered format of telephone numbers. For example entered spaces between digits are either ignored or automatically placed at false positions<span><span>.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>In the Outlook Web-App (OWA) one finds a strange input option (hidden under “Andere” numbers) for a telephone number called “Telefon 1 (Organisation)“. What the h… is this, I asked myself. If one enters a number there it will appear in the Phone’s
 Contacts-App as “Telefon Firma”. So, dear Microsoft, could you explain us users, what the difference is between a Business-, Company-, a Work and a Firm-telephone number? At the moment we have all these four terms in use, for the same thing. That’s unnecessarily
 confusing!<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Field names for telephone numbers are not clearly numbered anymore. In the Outlook Web-App (OWA) only a second private or business telephone number is marked as the second. In the Phone’s Contacts-App there is no numbering at all. One has to
 guess which one is the main and which one is the secondary number.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>In the Outlook Web-App (OWA) in the telephone section of a contact one now finds strange fields named as „Recently mailed“ (“Kürzlich gemailt” in German). What does this nonsense mean? A recently mailed telephone number? These fields also can’t
 be edited nor deleted.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Private email addresses are falsely shown as business email addresses in the Outlook Web-App (OWA).<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Business email addresses are falsely shown as private email addresses in the Outlook Web-App (OWA).<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Email addresses duplicate in the Outlook Web-App (OWA). A stored private email address appears after a while, literally out of the blue, as the business or work email address as well, or vice versa, and sits then in a grayed-out field which
 can’t be edited or deleted anymore. Therefore it’s impossible to get rid of these double entries because they appear in grayed-out fields.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Many email addresses of my contacts got lost because it’s suddenly only possible to determine/store a total of three email addresses (only one private, one business and one other email address), not more. I had many contacts with more than three
 email addresses. This is nothing unusual nowadays. Many people in these days have and use more than three email addresses!<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>With some contacts the field family name is grayed-out. Therefore it’s impossible to enter a family name for this contact.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li>Both in the Outlook Web-App (OWA) and the Phone’s Contacts-App it’s suddenly only possible to determine a “Private Website” for a contact and not a “Business website” or “Company website” anymore. That’s unbelievable!! What about important business contacts
 and their company website URLs?<br />
<br />
</li><li>By this, logically, all formerly determined “business websites” were afterwards (after the migration)&nbsp;falsely marked as “private websites”. One should be thankful, sarcastically said, that this data didn’t vanish completely.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Anyway, the contact detail “Private Website” is not synchronized at all between the Phone’s Contacts-App and the Outlook Web-App (OWA). No matter where one enters this detail, in the Phone’s Contacts-App or in the Outlook Web-App (OWA), the corresponding
 field on other devices always remains just empty.<span><span><br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Field names for contact details, both the input field names and the afterwards displayed field names, are NOT uniform in the People(Contacts)-App on PCs, phones or tablet computers and in the Outlook Web-App’s (OWA) People-Section. Field names
 should be uniform on all clients and not differ!<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>A good example for this very confusing non-uniformity with fields is the Name-Section of a contact. In the Phone’s Contacts-App one finds in the Name-Section for a contact a whole lot of input fields for detailed name information which are,
 in exactly the following order:<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Given name, Family name, Second given name, Nickname, Titel, Name affix, Phonetic name, Phonetic family name. These are 8 in total.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>In the Outlook Web-App (OWA), on the other hand, one finds in the Name-Section for a contact following input fields for detailed name information, which are, in exactly this order:<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Given name, Second given name, Family name, Salutation, Suffix, Yomi-Name, Yomi-Family Name. These are only 7 in total. The nickname field strangely appears here in the Further-Section and not in the Name-Section where it belongs.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>I</span></span> think this example shows already a lot. It shows the non-uniformity, e.g. Yomi-Name versus Phonetic name or Titel versus Salutation.<span>
<span>.<br />
<span>.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Further examples for non-uniformity with fields for telephone numbers or email addresses are:<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Andere, Weitere, Sonstige… All these terms are used which all means the same in German.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Persönlich und Privat... which all means the same in German.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Arbeit, Geschäftlich, Firma… which all means the same in German.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Example: In the Outlook Web-App (OWA), if I enter a telephone number in the field “Weitere” and then save the contact, this telephone number afterwards is shown as “Andere” while the Phone’s Contacts-App/People-App shows the same telephone number
 as “Sonstige”. That’s confusion at its best.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>If there are more than two private or business numbers they are NOT numbered in the Phone’s Contacts-App/People-App. How one should know here which the primary is and which one the secondary number?<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>The Outlook Web-App (OWA) confusingly uses several different terms for private and business telephone numbers and email-addresses which in fact mean exactly the same in German:<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>The terms Privat (private in English) and Persönlich (personal in English) and the terms Arbeit (Work or Job in English) and Geschäftlich (business in English). This is very confusing and looks chaotic. How about making a decision and determine
 one term only for both private and business related data in an address book? The terms Privat (private in English) and Geschäftlich (business in English) would be the best choice here because they are the most common for this in German language! Dear Microsoft:
 Please forget the other terms Persönlich (personal in English), Arbeit (Work or Job in English). Because, what’s the difference between a work-number, a business-number, a company-number and a firm-number? Or is there any difference in a private and a personal
 telephone number? I see none. <br />
</span></span></li></ul>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Edited contacts (or contact details) in the Phone’s Contacts-App are very often not saved. After a while the old data from the Cloud is shown again and the changes are gone. Synchronization with the Outlook Web-App (OWA) doesn’t work either.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>An address (and its details) is in the Phone’s Contacts-App not displayed as “Address” anymore but as “Coordinates”. Geographic coordinates are a set of numbers, letters or symbols and NOT an address!!<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>If a profile picture is added for a contact in the Outlook Web-App (OWA) it can’t be deleted there anymore. One has to delete the whole contact to get rid of the picture.<br />
</span></span></li></ul>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>In the Outlook Web-App (OWA) the “Skype Echo / Sound Test Service“ appears in my contacts even though I configured all my devices and clients not to show Skype contacts and filter/keep them out from my normal address book.<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>The unwanted automatic linking of contacts (without being asked!) causes huge problems as well. Contacts seem to be randomly linked with each other, most of them contacts which have nothing to do with each other! This automatic linking is just
 very faulty! Unlinking one of these automatically linked contacts doesn’t work. All faulty entries and date can’t even be deleted or edited anymore. What a mess! Such contacts can only be deleted to get rid of the errors in it and afterwards recreated. There
 should be a user option to turn off this automatic linking!<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>On a Windows Phone, if one needs to see and use the important provider numbers which are stored on Prepaid-SIM cards, one has to import them first to the contacts directory on the phone. But in consequence these SIM card only related contacts
 are shown in the Outlook Web-App (OWA) as well. SIM card only related contacts then appear in my normal address book? What a nonsense!<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span>And last but not least from a German users view:<br />
<br />
</span></span></li><li><span><span><span>With the transition from people.live.com to outlook.live.com and the new GUI (Graphic user interface) also came a stupid renaming. Formerly ones contacts were correctly titled as “Contacts” (in German “Kontakte”). But now they call ones
 contacts “Outlook People”. For English native speakers this might be still ok, I mean, talking now about people instead of contacts. But the German translation of “Outlook People” is absolutely weird. Microsoft translates “Outlook People” as “Outlook Personen”.
 A person in German is a person and not people, dear Microsoft! “Outlook Personen” sounds very stupid in German and doesn’t make sense to a German. In Germany</span><span> people use and have an address book, a telephone directory, a contact list or contact
 directory but definitely no “Outlook-Personen”!! This translation is pure nonsense!! In the Phone’s Contacts-App the titling remains “Contacts” (in German “Kontakte”), thanks God. The easiest would be to stick to the term “Address book”.</span></span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>I was waiting and hoping for 6 long months now for these problems to be fixed. But nothing happened.

<h2>            Internet Explorer Crashes when opening email attachments</h2>
                    
<p>Help...when ever I open an attachment in my email acct (yahoo) Internet Explorer crashes immediately after.</p>
<p>I've searched for an answer/solution but no luck.</p>
<p>I am able to see/open an attachment but after I view it &amp; close, Internet Explorer crashes.</p>
<p>The SAME thing happens with Firefox.</p>
<p>What is causing this?...and What is the fix?</p>
<p>THANKS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notes: I was running Windows Vista now Windows 7 with same problem on both platforms. (IE = 8.0)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Various Virus, Malware, and Adware/Spyware scans do not find any problems</p>

<p><strong><span><span>Method 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above does not help, you may temporarily disable the security software installed on the computer and check.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Disable antivirus software</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable
 your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer
 is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi gadministrator,</p>
<p>I understand you are unable to install Dirsync with error "The Microsoft Online Services Sign-in-Assistant service installation returned FAIL". Actually, we do not need to install Sign-in-Assistant. Please fully uninstall "The Microsoft Online Services Sign-in-Assistant
 service". After that, please just install Dirsync from <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=278924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>If the issue persists, please capture a screenshot of the error here.</p>

    <title>Lumia 950 XL---why no security apps available&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimbo1212  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950 XL---why no security apps available&#63;</h2>
                    I notice that in the Windows (Mobile) Store, there are no security apps (as, anti-virus, anti-malware, anti-phising, etc.) for the Lumia 950 XL (and, from what I have seen, this is the same for all Windows 10 phones).&nbsp; Apple and Android phones have security
 apps available both in App Store or Play Store as well as from third party vendors)---so why no such protection for the Lumia 950 XL?&nbsp; Some postings suggest that 'Don't worry, it's all taken care of' but I would like to know more of an answer than that.&nbsp; There
 does not even seem to be Microsoft Security Essentials for the Lumia 950 XL.&nbsp; Why is it (seemingly) impossible to get a security app for a Windows Phone, either at the Windows Store or from a third party vendor?&nbsp; I would like to see some explanation beyond
 just vague assurances passed on from someone else who heard it from someone else . . .

            <p>ok phising apps rely on essential the <em>stupidity </em>of people to click on a link</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well as the page is a lookalike clicking a link within the same page should have taken them to a legitimate alternative oh but that link is down also</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't comment on any O/S that doesn't use microSD card or routinely disables sharing apps that means syncing phone to phone directly&nbsp;can't be done. (or can I?)</p>
<p>

<h3> squirrel brown  say:</h3>
<h2>            My ads are not visable in my account</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently imported by Google Ads to Bing and noticed that some parts didn't come over like the ads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I created an ad and published it. &nbsp;It then vanished so I created another. &nbsp;Several hours later I noticed I was getting no impressions and was surprised to see I has no ads in my ad set. &nbsp;So I created another. &nbsp;Then I ran a few searches and noticed
 my ad but I wanted to adjust the punctuation and upon trying to edit the ad it had vanished again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went and ran a few more Bing searches looking for my ad and it usually didn't show up for key words I was bidding on despite only 2 other competitors ads showing. &nbsp;They it did show but was displaying an ad that I ah never created. &nbsp;It was one that must
 have been imported. &nbsp;Because I can't see my ads in my account I can't edit or delete them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an advanced Google Adwords user and not a complete idiot. &nbsp;The ads show in the account for a short time after creating them, then vanish. &nbsp;Do I inadvertently have a filter that is hiding them from me? &nbsp;Below is a screen shot of where the ads should
 be. &nbsp;It is the only ad set that I have active. &nbsp;Please help</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

</p><p>In your screenshot I do see a filter&nbsp;for only disapproved ads. The ads were likely being reviewed and are now cleared. If you click on that X next to remove that should clear it.&nbsp;&nbsp;In case there is something on the backend that is causing your account not

    <title>Problems in layout in MS Publisher - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems in layout in MS Publisher</h2>
                    <p>A colleague and I are sharing documents produced in MS Publisher.&nbsp; I am using Windows 7 and he is using Windows 10.&nbsp; If he creates a text box, often the last few lines of text disappear off the page in my version.&nbsp; If I create one, he sees white space at
 the bottom of the text boxes.&nbsp; This is hugely frustrating, because we can't ensure any compatibility between our documents which are intended for publication.</p>
<p>Do the different operating systems display fonts differently? Is this the cause of the problem?&nbsp; More importantly, is there a workaround?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>An issue reported as of Win8, with text rendering about 5% different in size than with Win7 and older. The most common workaround is to install the Win7 fonts on the Win8 or Win10 machine. Here are three posts where the issue was discussed:</p>

 limited to Pub 2013 and probably 2010. If you install Pub 2007 or 2003 in Win10, Win8, Win7, WinVista or WinXP then the files still render text the same and are cross OS compatible.</span></p>

            Thanks for your reply. I am the one with the Windows 7 PC. Is there any way of installing appropriate fonts on my PC so that my colleague with Windows 10 sees the same layout as me? This is causing serious problems in producing our publication and I&nbsp; reluctant

<p>You could try the opposite of what the referenced threads suggest. You could install Win10 fonts on your Win7 machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it were me I would do a test file with just one or two common fonts, perhaps Arial and Calibri. Have your Win10 users send you copies of the specific fonts in Win10 format. You could rename your Win7 versions of the fonts by changing the font file extension
 to<em> .old</em> and then installing the new Win10 fonts. Create a Pub file with the new Win10 fonts and send to the Win10 user to test. If the alignment issue is resolved then you can consider replacing more of the fonts that you both use or even replacing
 all your Win7 fonts with Win10 fonts. If the experiment does not work, then you can go back and remove the Win10 fonts and rename your old fonts by removing the
<em>.old</em> extension. By the way, I would also make copies of the individual Win7 fonts before trying this experiment...just sayn'...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do test Win10 fonts on your machine, please post your results. I haven't read of anyone doing this...just installing Win7 fonts on Win10 machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[edit] I hate Win10 too and will run Win7 as long as I can. I hate the mandatory Win10 patches that almost always end up breaking something in an effort to fix something else.

<h2>            Can&#39;t recover account</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I was wondering if anyone can help me with this......yesterday I went to log into outlook and unusually it asked for my password. I entered this and it said that it appears that someone has hacked my email account. I took steps to recover my account and
 when I had to put the new password in it came up with the same thing. I recovered the account numerous times and was met with the same thing each time. Eventually I exhausted the amount of codes that I could have in a day and have been unable to even try to
 recover the account again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any help that anyone can give me as it's rather frustrating. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>

            At some point a little past midnight on 23 December 2015 (last nite), while I was online with facebook, I lost access to my windows 10 menu, start-up, and internet applications (though I still have a basic operating system enough to use google chrome).
 I checked and there was an update at that time. I had no choice to suspend that update, so I deleted it, but it has made no difference. What can you do for me? I tried putting sfc /scannow in the command prompt but only got a statement of what it was meant
 to do.

            <p>Just one quick check...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have said that "...<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If I change the date in cell C1027 to 11/29/2014 from 11/30/2014 I get the expected return value of 2014Q3."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Can you try this step once again pls ?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">But this time, before trying this step,
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">pls &nbsp;replace the 2014Q3 &nbsp;with &nbsp;"xxxxx" &nbsp;against the &nbsp; "</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Sunday, November 30, 2014".</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">pls

<p>
</p><p>Now check if you are getting "yyyyy" &nbsp;or "xxxxx" ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some how I am getting a feeling that when the formula is put in row number 3, it is actually referring row number 2.</p>
<p>(Not sure - this is just a guess).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get the exact solution, it would be necessary to have a look at your .xlsx file.</p>
<p>You may have to share your .xlsx file on OneDrive (and share the file link here).</p>
<p>You need to replace all your sensitive / confidential data with some dummy data before sharing the file.</p>

            Yes, if you set the Page Range to Selection, the page numbering is suppressed, as, depending upon where the start of the selection is located, the pagination of the output could be completely different from that of the original.

    <title>Mouse problems of a different kind - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> khenlim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse problems of a different kind</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 on a ThinkPad T440p with a TrackPoint. My screen mouse pointer is directly controlled by the TrackPoint and I have always had the Touchpad disabled. This arrangement has always worked for donkeys' years all the way up to Windows 7
 Pro 64-bit. Once I had Windows 10 up and running, things became different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the mouse pointer itself appears to move when I nudge the TrackPoint, its screen appearance now looks different. It seems to have adopted a permanent look of a "pointer attached to the scroll button" and this makes it arduously hard to get to a button
 and click at it due to visual inaccuracy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And here's the funny thing - the screen appearance becomes normal when I work in Microsoft Word and when I'm in an email writing mode (I use Gmail). And it looks like when I have the pointer within this writing window in which I'm writing this post, it also
 appears normal. However when I'm in a common web page or browser window or in any dialog box, it reverts to the "pointer attached to the scroll button" appearance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked through several places on the Net including this one for any such similar problems but haven't found any.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help? Any updates to rid this problem? What's the deal here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you go to the safe mode and see if the problem persists. To go to Safe mode follow the steps below:<br />
a.&nbsp;Click on Windows key, and in the Power Options click on Restart while pressing the shift key.<br />
b.&nbsp;A blue screen will appear with a few options.<br />
Click on Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart.<br />
c.&nbsp;Your system will automatically restart, press 4 or F4 key to go to the Safe Mode.<br />
If you do not face the same issue in the safe mode, try doing a clean boot</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Note:</span></strong><strong><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Important: </span></em></strong><em><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or
</span>when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily
 lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is
 connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Kindly make sure all your drivers are updated.</strong></span></p>

<h2>            Word Templates - Word Wrap &#38; Horizontal Line</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;have two questions related to Word Templates that are used with Microsoft Dynamics GP.&nbsp; However, these questions are more related to general Word functionality so I thought I would post them on this forum.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Is there a way to stop Word from word wrapping a given field?&nbsp; My client would like Word to truncate the&nbsp;field if it is too long as opposed to wrapping the text.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; How do you remove the horizontal lines that appear on the top and bottom of the Word templates if you copy the Original forms that come with the system?&nbsp;

<p>I was able to figure out the second question too!&nbsp; I was referring to the original templates that come out of Microsoft Dynamics GP.&nbsp; It appears the horizontal lines were merely graphics that could be highlighted and deleted.</p>

<h2>            HTC T9296 Windows Phone 7.10 Email&#47;Calendar Synchronisation -- Error Code 8600010B</h2>
                    <p>Message reads:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows Live error</p>
<p>Last updated 15 hours ago.</p>
<p>We're having a problem synchronising with eas.outlook.com.</p>
<p>Last tried 2 seconds ago<br />
Error code: 8600010B (capital B, not a figure eight)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>eas = Exchange ActiveSync. Used in enterprise situations. My phone is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not</span> a company phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contacts and Pictures = still found on the phone.</p>
<p>Mail and Calendar = unable to synchronise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried deleting&nbsp;my hotmail address, it&nbsp;being the primary address. Unable to. Can only synchronise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried adding my primary email address again. Won't allow me to -- said this account already exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other Add An Account choices are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Live (Hotmail, Xbox LIVE, Messenger and others)</p>
<p>Outlook&nbsp; (Exchange and Office 365)</p>
<p>Yahoo! Mail</p>
<p>Google</p>
<p>other account (POP and IMAP)</p>
<p>advanced setup (don't know what that is...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an outlook.com primary alias, but don't want to add that to my phone, as the hotmail address is the&nbsp;email address for&nbsp;the bulk&nbsp;of my online activity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went into Zune to check for phone updates, thinking any changes to how the email works on my phone would be updated that way. Unable to get any updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Switched off the phone completely (powered off). A minute later switched on again. This did not reset the email/calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Signed in to my Microsoft account online using my hotmail signin. The mail is now Outlook.com with changes to how the Inbox looks and functions. Nice. Thank you! There was a message re getting Outlook app onto my phone, but found out that it relates only
 to a Windows 10 phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will check with my phone service provider tomorrow (Monday).</p>
<p>I wonder if this error message is a sign I should update my phone to a Windows 10 phone, although I think I should still be able to use my Windows 7 phone as everything else works fine.</p>
<p>Any comments/suggestions please would be very much appreciated. Thank you.</p>

            <p>I have been exploring the Options settings in Outlook on the Web tonight, 6july.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have solved the issue as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. In Outlook Mail, chose Settings (gear icon) next to my profile image &gt; Options.</p>
<p>2. In the far left pane, under Options, chose General &gt; Mobile devices. <br />
My phone was listed. <br />
Clicked on Details (the pencil icon above the list) and scrolled down to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Access set by: Global permissions.</p>
<p>Directly underneath there is a hyperlink to an item:</p>
<p>"Learn more about fixing sync issues or removing a device"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the instructions and, hey presto, problem solved.</p>
<p>THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.</p>
<p>*a huge sigh of relief.&nbsp; Yay!</p>

<h2>            How to enter into the field test mode of Nokia 5110 and 3310</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia 5110 and 3310 are DCT-3 phones. They should have field test model. How can I get into the test mode? Through RS232 serial&nbsp;cable, MBUS, FBUS? Do I need any software to get into the test mode?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Jane</p>

            Field test mode is something that is only accessible to Nokia service personnel. The end user attempting to do this will void the warranty on the phone, and this is why we're not allowed to discuss it here on these forums.

<h2>            Word 2016 - &#39;Bring to Front&#39; or &#39;Send to Back&#39; options</h2>
                    In Word 2016 - I use SnagIt for my training screen shots, when bringing the screen shot into the word document, I use to have have the option to 'Bring to Front' or 'Send to Back', but now my only option is using the 'Wrap Text' option. The documents have
 been through quite a few Word upgrades.&nbsp; Is this a setting?&nbsp; I noticed the text boxes have the option to 'bring to front'. Any help would be appreciated.

            You can set the default text wrapping style at <strong>File | Options | Advanced: Cut, copy, and paste</strong>. Inline is the program default.
