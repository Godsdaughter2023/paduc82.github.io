<h2>            Generic IEEE 1284.4 Printer driver will not install. </h2>
                    I have the disk, it "rolls back" out of the installation. Therefore, not doing what it is there to do. I cannot find the driver online, available for download. I go in circles on hp.com in the driver area.&nbsp; I have tried EVERYTHING.. What can I do? This
 is pure Insanity. All I want to do is install my H.P. 1012 Laserjet Printer on a Windows 7 computer.&nbsp; Please help!!&nbsp;

<p>I'm guessing you need newer drives than what's on&nbsp;your disk.&nbsp; Here's the links on the HP site for your drivers (HP says to use the Vista drivers for Windows 7 for your device).&nbsp; Install the correct version for your machine:</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 installation taking too long</h2>
                    I purchased Windows 8 Pro from the Microsoft website and began my download. &nbsp;That was around 10 hours ago and my screen is still just blank. &nbsp;Is this normal? How do I know if I did things right and it is still installing? Thanks!

<p>Go to another working computer, download and create a bootable copy and attempt the upgrade again:</p>

</p>
<p>---------------------------------</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather all important application discs and hardware driver discs you might need to be reinstalled.
</li><li>Check the manufacturer and software developers website for updates available and to find out about the status of compatibility with Windows 8. It is possible that if the software is compatible with Windows Vista it will likely work with Windows 8 since
 they share the same driver model. </li><li>If you are using software such as iTunes or Adobe programs, remember to deauthorize and deactivate them before running setup.
</li></ul>
<p>When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. Thankfully, all editions of Windows 7 includes system imaging, which means you can backup your
 entire Windows 7 installation and restore it if it fails. Learn more about how to backup your Window 7 installation
<strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<p>In addition to System Imaging, you can backup just your personal files using Backup and Restore, to do that, check out the following article:</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/2010/12/27/how-to-backup-to-an-external-hard-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://notebooks.com/2010/12/27/how-to-backup-to-an-external-hard-drive/</a><br />

</p>
<p>If you want to backup themes, wallpapers and other minor features, Windows Easy Transfer is another option, you can learn more about it
<strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What you can do before attempting the upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You can do some pre-requisite tasks to ensure a smooth migration from Windows 7 to Windows 8. If you are using a name branded computer such as a Dell or HP, go to the manufacturers website for the model computer you are using and download the latest available
 drivers for that computer. Store them on a disc or USB thumb drive. Important drivers you should try to obtain include Network and Video Drivers. Its possible that they might just have Windows Vista or Windows 7 drivers, those will work with Windows 8.
</p>
<p>Other things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall any security software before attempting to upgrade. </li><li>Disable any encryption software you might have installed. </li><li>Disable/uninstall disk utility software such as DVD/CD burning utilities or third party defragment programs such as Perfect Disk.
</li><li>Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications). </li><li>Disconnect any external devices before installing. </li><li>Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
- Click Start<br />
- Type: CMD<br />
- Right click CMD then click Run as administrator<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.
</li><li>Another thing you can do is disable Start items:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Click Start </li><li>Type: MSCONFIG. </li><li>Hit Enter on your keyboard </li><li>On the General tab, click Selective Startup. </li><li>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box. </li><li>Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.
</li><li>Click OK. </li><li>When you are prompted, click Restart. </li><li>After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Run the System File Checker utility.</strong></p>
<p>SFC/Scannow checks your Windows installation for errors and corrects them. This will help with ensuring that a smooth upgrade occurs.
</p>
<p>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click ‘Run as Administrator’<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow</p>
<p>This will check for any integrity violations</p>
<p>Restart your system&nbsp; </p>

<h3> retepworm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Interlaced and De-interlaced Signals</h2>
                    <p>Hey,<br />
I have a TV I sometimes connect to my computer, duplicating the screen with my monitor. My TV takes interlaced 1080i whereas the monitor is regular 1080p. Previously the signal had to be either one or the other, meaning one screen was getting a non-native display
 and would suffer in quality.<br />
In the last update it changed so that they both had their refresh method sent to them, so the TV got 1080i and the monitor got 1080p. I needed to change it as a game wouldn't run on 1080i, and now I can't change it back. In "Advanced Display Settings" it won't
 let me change the TV to 30hz interlaced, with the error "the display control panel is unable to change the display settings" followed by "the display settings being saved are invalid. Please try a different combination of display settings"<br />
The monitor doesn't give any option for interlaced methods.<br />
<br />
Is there any way I can make them work together?</p>
<p>

<h2>            I installed Windows 7 64-bit on a new computer. I can&#39;t get my Media Center remote control working with Hauppauge WinTV-HVR 2250.</h2>
                    I have a Hauppauge WinTV-HVR 2250 TV tuner installed in my computer with Windows 7 64-bit. The Media Center remote doesn't work, though. The only thing that it does is wake my computer from its sleep state (i.e., when I put the computer to sleep, I can
 hit the power button on my Media Center remote and wake up the computer). However, outside of this, the remote doesn't do anything else. I borrowed my friends Media Center remote to see if that would work, but that does the exact same thing - the power button
 can wake the computer from sleep mode, but nothing else. Any ideas what the problem could be? My tuner came with 2 IR receivers and I tried them both with both remotes and nothing changes. Thanks in advance for any help!

            I finally got it to work. I checked for updated drivers on Hauppauge's website (there is an updated driver but that by itself didn't fix the problem). I stumbled across an IR blaster setup program on Hauppauge's website (http://www.hauppauge.com/site/support/support_hvr2250.html?tab=1)
 that fixed the problem. Once you're on the page click on the "Accessories" tab. The last file on the page is the Windows Media Center remote control receiver/blaster configuration utility. You need to run this to get the remote to work. It would've helped
 if they included that in the instructions (considering they market the device as compatible with Windows 7). Good luck!<br />

<h2>            Your device will be genuine shortly is taking forever</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just upgrade my windows 8.1 pro to windows 10 from the free upgrade offer. But it says my windows is not activated, it says my product key doesn't work with error code Error code: 0xC004C003</p>
<p>
</p><p>i followed the guide to the Activation setting, and clicked on 'go to store', more error, 'something happened and we couldn't make your copy of windows genuine, Try again'. So i click on the Try again button, and now the message 'Your device will be genuine
 shortly' shows up and is taking forever to finish.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE Solution:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Reinstall Windows 8.1 and upgrade to Windows 10 again solved the problem for me.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I bought windows 8 from the Microsoft store, I simply went to this link http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media downloaded the media creation tool, put it in a USB, and reinstalled my system back to windows 8.1 (back
 up files first obviously). After I reinstalled system as windows 8.1, I upgraded to Windows 10 again through the upgrade option, and this time, the product key worked and windows 10 is genuine&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>This isn't an answer, this is a **** canned response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem here is that the "genuine Windows" process in the Windows 10 store doesn't appear to be doing anything. What, exactly, is it trying to do? Is it running a system scan? It doesn't appear to be using any resources at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did notice my product key has changed, but when I attempt to activate Windows manually through the activation dialog, I still get an error that Windows could not be activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone who actually knows what's going on please tell us exactly what Windows Store is doing when it says "Your device will be genuine shortly"?</p>

<h2>            OEKIU  is compressed, Press Ctrl&#43;Alt&#43;Del to restart </h2>
                    
<div>Good evening,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I started to compress my C: drive&nbsp;of my recently Vista-to-Windows-7-Pro upgaded laptop&nbsp;(as in just yesterday)&nbsp;&amp; then I stopped it before completion. I continued to use the computer (re-installing my progams and such) with no problems. I saw that I had
 updates waiting to install, clicked, and supposedly&nbsp;they installed fine (was away from the computer; by the time I got back it had already shut down).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When I tried to start up my computer, the Compaq logo would show then I would get a black screen with&nbsp;''OEKIU&nbsp; is compressed, Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart ''.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I&nbsp;have tried the ''Ctrl+Alt+Del'' several times, searched online and found similar problems but found no solutions to help me (can't get to Safe Mode either).</div>
<div>What to do please...</div>
<div>p.s.: I have the image file (not CD) of the Windows-7 Pro.</div>

            Compressing your system drive is a bad idea. Here is a recipe that I picked up somewhere else. I have not tried it myself but it is supposed to fix this problem.<br />
1. Start your computer from the Windows 7 installation DVD<br />
2. Select Repair your computer.<br />
3. Load driver.<br />
4. Go to Computer and right click drive where Windows 7 is installed.<br />
5. Select Properties and uncheck "Compress drive to save disk space".<br />
6. Close and restart the computer normally.<br />

    <title>Why does the Xbox One X, while in Instant On mode, shut off the Wired - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> same25  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does the Xbox One X, while in Instant On mode, shut off the Wired Ethernet interface&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I noticed recently (last few months) that my Xbox One X shuts off the network interface card (Wired Ethernet), even though it is in Instant On mode.&nbsp; This stops me from being able to turn it on with Windows 10 Xbox App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Monitoring the network traffic, it appears to turn itself back hourly and does what appears to be a check for updates, then shut it off.&nbsp; If I catch it while it is doing its update check, I can turn it on, otherwise, I cannot turn it on with the App.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a new feature to reduce power consumption that turns off the network interface, or is this a bug? Is there a way to prevent the network interface from being shut down to conserve power?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanksm</p>

<p>I m not sure if I am or not, but I don't think so.&nbsp; I don't remember requesting or accepting an invite to the program. I also don't see anything that would allow me to submit feedback.</p>

<h2>            &#38;quot&#59;To use a wired Internet connection, make sure the ethernet cable is connected to both your console and your router or modem.&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there</p>
<p>A couple of days ago my connection to live stopped working.</p>
<p>Ive reset (powered off and left for a minute or two) my Wifi Modem/router a few times,&nbsp; however, the WIFI works on other devices.</p>
<p>I've unplugged the ethernet cable from both ends of the line and reconnected it mulpiple times</p>
<p>ive changed ports at the router end</p>
<p>Ive changed the ethernet cable for a different ethernet cable</p>
<p>And still, when trying to perform the connection test, I get this message.."To use a wired Internet connection, make sure the ethernet cable is connected to both your console and your router or modem.".</p>

<p>Now I acknowledge that I lost power on the day that it stopped working, and would have been through an electrical storm (xbox was off but connected to power and internet, etc)
</p>

<p>Can any one please tender any advice or assistance... or is it XBOX ONE TIME!?!?! which I cannot really afford!!!</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>@RuyKaiShin2005 - Since your problem is related down to the physical layer there is not much you can troubleshoot from your end, part from making sure your router's physical ports are in mint condition and that the Ethernet cable you're using is in working order.</p>
<p>If it still prompts you with: '<strong>To use a wired internet connection make sure an ethernet cable is connected to both your console and your router or modem</strong>',&nbsp;you would need to request a repair for your console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have the option to&nbsp;connect&nbsp;any of&nbsp;your consoles with wireless,&nbsp;then try this method and see if it can connect properly. Otherwise, request a repair for your console at:&nbsp;<a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/pages/welcome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">myservice.xbox.com</a></p>

<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one
 you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps with another computer if necessary).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;shutdown (Start / Control Panel
 / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Are there other users on your system and do they have the same problem or is it only you?&nbsp; Your user profile may be corrupted.&nbsp;
<span>
To fix this use </span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></span></a></span><span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To
 fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>B</span></strong><span>oot into Safe mode with networking and see if
 the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk
 (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE and only if you can still boot normally).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

<p>Hi Halima,</p>
<p>I'll try and give you the short version.&nbsp; I was trying to install Divx Author 1.5 on my computer.&nbsp; The support group after some deliberation decided&nbsp; that I had a "rouge codec".&nbsp; They asked me to run a program called GSpot that might help in find this offending
 codec. I got this error message:</p>
<p>Warning: DirectShow crashed while GSpot was attempting to obtain information about a codec.</p>
<p>This is usually due to damaged, misconfigured, conflicting, or poorly written codec drivers.&nbsp; It is possible, perhaps even likely, that other media players will crash when they attempt to play this file as well, as most of them will also use DirectShow.&nbsp;
 GSpot was able to intercept the crash, and has attempted to identify the codec or filter involved; uninstalling or reinstalling this codec or filter may solve the problem.</p>
<p>The codec was tentatively identified as:</p>
<p>C:\Windows\system32\imaadp32.acm<br />
Unknown video codec #11</p>
<p>So, I need help running GSpot, so I hopefully can get Divx Author to work which is the goal here.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;am running PS6 and want to open and edit AVI files. When I try to do that I get an error message saying "the video file cannot be opened" . This seems to apply to ALL avis - yet I can open and edit MP4, MMV etc. I installed Gspot to track whether
 it was a codec issue and when I try to open ANY file I get this error message : "Warning: DirectShow crashed while GSpot was attempting to obtain information about a codec.&nbsp; This is usually due to damaged, misconfigured, conflicting, or poorly written codec
 drivers.&nbsp; It is possible, perhaps even likely, that other media players will crash when they attempt to play this file as well, as most of them will also use DirectShow.&nbsp; GSpot was able to intercept the crash, and has attempted to identify the codec or filter

 codec but what about the "Unknown video codec #11". What the heck is that and what do I do about it. Any help would be appreciate, Cliff</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ps I should add that the avi files DO open and play in Bridge. I have the latest Quicktime. Everything is up to date and PS and the computer is otherwise working perfectly !</p>

                    <p><span>I was typing on my Asus laptop, when all of a sudden the keyboard starts acting weird. &nbsp;My mouse wheel zoomed instead of scrolled. &nbsp;So idiot me turned off the computer, well now I can't get back into it. &nbsp;It won't let me type my password.
 &nbsp;The "m" key acts as an enter key, and backspace fills up the password space but I don't know with what. &nbsp;Being that it's an asus they have this secondary system, I can get into that and type perfectly fine, absolutely no problems. &nbsp;So it's a windows problem,
 as far as I can tell, but I can't figure out how to fix it. &nbsp;I can't boot in safe mode because it won't let me type my password. &nbsp;Please help.this laptop has my life on it.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly you need to log into your laptop,then only some diagnose can be done for software issues but before that try this first</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try an external keyboard and check if youy can enter your password or&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Go to the Ease of Access control panel (you will find it at the extrem left bottom of your login screen), choose Use the computer
 without a mouse or keyboard, check Use On-Screen Keyboard, click Ok.</span></p>
<p>, If yes then follow the following steps</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to control panel-&gt;Region and langauge-&gt;change keyboards and other input methods</p>
<p>
</p><p>then click change keyboards.... tab and select the default input langauge as &nbsp;English (United states)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.Check and update your keyboard and mouse drivers from device manager&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this will resolve your issue.............</p>

<p><span>Hi&nbsp;<span><span>Rafito97</span></span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Were
 you able to use the</span><span>San Disc Memory Card earlier on this computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 type of card reader you are using? Is it a USB card reader or integrated to the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you using a laptop or desktop?</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try these steps and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1<br />
</strong><br />
You may connect the memory card to some other computer and check if it gets detected.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2</strong><br />
You may also check in device manager, if the memory card is showing up there.<br />
<strong>Open Device Manager</strong><br />

            1. Windows Update Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />The first troubleshooting option you can try is Microsoft's own Windows 10 Troubleshooter for Windows Update. In the Windows 10 Creators Update, you can find it in Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot, click Windows Update then click Run the troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />If you are running Windows 10 Anniversary Update or an earlier version of Windows, click Start, type: troubleshooting, hit Enter then launch the Windows Update troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />You can run the troubleshooter a couple times to see if it helps.
<br />
<br />2. Media Creation Tool or Windows 10 Setup Media
<br />
<br />If the troubleshooter does not resolve the problem, then, the next option you can try is using the the Media Creation Tool or Windows 10 Setup install media to check for and install updates. Simply download the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool or if you have a Windows 10 ISO, double click it to mount it, then start up. Choose the Download and Install Updates (recommended). If setup successfully completes this step, close the wizard then restart your computer.

<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />3. Deployment Image Servicing and Management
<br />
<br />The Deployment Image Servicing and Management can be used to resolve issues with the integrity of your Windows 10 installation, this includes: corrupt or damaged system files.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Exit the command prompt, restart your computer then try running Windows Update again.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />4. Delete the Software Distribution Folder
<br />
<br />If you have reached this far and Windows Update is still not working, then this likely calls for some advanced tinkering. Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - press Windows key + A
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />2. Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver
<br />
<br />3. Now rename the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />
<br />4. Now, let’s restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. Typethe following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                        net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />                        net start cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                        net start bits
<br />
<br />                        net start msiserver
<br />
<br />5. Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it and then restart the computer.
<br />
<br />5. Perform a Repair Upgrade
<br />
<br />If you have carried all the above but Windows 10 Update remains stubborn, then a repair upgrade is the best option. For this step, you should reconnect to the Internet. During installation, before reaching the desktop, Windows 10 will perform some post installation tasks such as downloading the latest Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />A repair upgrade can be done by downloading the latest ISO file for Windows 10 using the Media Creation Tool.
<br />
<br />Mount the ISO file by double clicking it, start the installation then install over your current installation on the drive. Your personal files, applications and settings will be preserved.
<br />
<br />Bonus. Download Stubborn Cumulative Updates Using Microsoft Update Catalog.
<br />
<br />Sometimes a stubborn cumulative update can be problem, it sits there for hours and won't budge. If none of the above helps, you can try downloading the update directly using the Microsoft Update Catalog then install it manually. Learn more about how to install Cumulative Updates manually at the following link:

    <title>Dialup in Windows 10 not connecting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hi-lander  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dialup in Windows 10 not connecting</h2>
                    <p>Hello, all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since updating an older computer (HP AIO) from Windows 7 to 10, I am no longer able to connect to the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using USB modem (USR 5637), I was able to connect under Windows 7 Home. Upgraded the PC to Windows 10 (v1511), and now the modem will dial out, but then fail during the authentication handshake (error 619/628 - port disconnected).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated the modem firmware, removed and re-installed the drivers in compatibility mode, and even tried on two other machines (one new Windows 10 v1511, and one dual-booting Windows 10 v1511 / Ubuntu 14.04) with the exact same results. On the dual-boot
 machine, same hardware/account connects with no issues when in Linux, but fails with the exact same results as above when using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, as this is currently the only cost-effective means for connecting the PC to the Internet, due to connectivity choices in a rural area.</p>

            These do not help, as the modem does not connect in the first place, so Network Troubleshooter finds no problems. There is also no ip address yet assigned to reset, and a wlan report is not going to help with a ppp connection issue.

            <p>USR have informed me that whilst this modem works fine as a fax modem in Windows 10, they haven't successfully got it working for dial-up Internet access. They tell me that they are working on an updated driver (or perhaps firmware). This should become available

            <p>I'm using the same USB modem (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">USR 5637) on a new Windows 10 computer and still having the same problem even after using the latest drivers and flash from USR.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The modem works fine on any other machine not running Windows 10. I've tried reinstalling the modem several times, recreated the connection,
 and tried several AT commands.</span></p>
<p>I installed hyperterminal and I can get a connection through that with the modem, the only thing that doesn't work is the dial up networking software built into Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far to me it seems the problem is the Windows 10 networking software which does work great for PPPoE... it is just not capable of using a dial up modem properly.</p>

            Downgrade back to Win 7 and wait until high-speed connection becomes cheaper in your area.&nbsp; When one of automatic and unstoppable Win 10 updates comes in, it will take DAYS to download it with 56K modem (that probably runs at14K most of the time).&nbsp;

<p><strong>I have a DELL XPS M1530 with Vista as my operating system. I have never had any issues with sound until a couple days ago when I came home my normal audio icon was not in my icon tray but a different one with an x beside it was shown. I have the

 solve the issue. Now When i click on the audio icon and go to the properties of it, it is saying that the microphone/in-line is not plugged in yet everything else is listed as working just fine. I just want my sound back and cannot seem to find a good answer!

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You may have tried to update your drivers however sound drivers rollback so the update may not
<br />
have actually worked - please use the methods below.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - Audio Device<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
If your driver shows 06 you have the windows default and that is part of the issue.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and get latest Sound/Audio drivers - Download - SAVE - go to where you<br />
put them - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN - Reboot <br />
<br />
<strong>Check the Version on Driver's tab in Device Manager as often sound drivers rollback and then<br />
finally install the current version. Reboot and check after each try, not unusual to have to run
<br />
the driver 1-4 times or so. Just make sure the version you installed shows up in the driver's
<br />
tab.</strong><br />
<br />
Then go to Device Maker's site and look for even newer drivers and repeat install procedure.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>After updating driver.<br />
<br />
Right click Speaker near Clock -&nbsp;Recording Devices - right click in box - check Show&nbsp;Disconnected<br />
Devices and Show Disabled Devices - check your mic - highlight them and then on lower right
<br />
properties. Make sure the proper one is enabled and check other settings - on Levels tab make
<br />
sure MUTE is unchecked and APPLY / OK changes.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Also Right Click Speaker near clock - Playback Devices - right click in the box area - check<br />
Show disable and disconnected devices. Highlight speaker and on the&nbsp;lower Right click Properties<br />
check settings for Device Usage enabled and so on. Also do same for Configure on Lower Left of<br />
that box. Repeat this paragraph for headphones if you use them. APPLY / OK any changes.</strong><br />
<br />
Also in Control Panel look for some Audio Manager (maybe named after sound driver maker). Mine<br />
is RealTek Audio Manager, yours can be entirely different name if you have one.<br />

    <title>State of decay 2 ultimate edition game sharing question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xxfsuxdylanxx  say:</h3>
<h2>            State of decay 2 ultimate edition game sharing question</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my friend that is nice enough to system share with me recently purchased state of decay 2 ultimate edition. However, while I do have the game on my games and apps screen it says it comes out on the 22nd rather than the 18th which is the day the ultimate edition users are allowed to play it. I'm worried that since he purchased the game and I'm only having it shared to me, that he recieved the ultimate edition pre order date and bonuses and it gave me the standard edition. Also, the box art on his games and apps screen is different from mine. So the question I&nbsp;have is whether or not the game will be playable on the 18th or the 22nd?</p>

            <p>I have the same error. Upgraded to WIndows 10 from Windows 8.1 (OEM, on my Sony Vaio Duo11). The logon screen appears, but begins to flash every 5 seconds. Then after a short time, this error code appears.</p>
<p>According to the Sony forum, it might be related to some video driver issues?</p>
<p>Or would it rather be some other piece of software, which can interfere with Windows 10?</p>

            I tried again, after resetting to Windows 8.1. Before upgrading, I uninstalled two Apps (Start8 and AeroGlass). This has solved the issue, upgrade went smoothly trough. Everything working perfectly now :-)
