    <title>Windows Mail on Windows 10 Slow sync - final fix anyone&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Mail on Windows 10 Slow sync - final fix anyone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Having checked all recent posts regarding this issue, it persists. I am using Windows 10 on a Lenovo Yoga 13, upgraded from Win8.1. Initially I wanted to use Outlook 2016, but that was so difficult to set up, even with the help of MS support, I eventually
 gave up and liking the look anyway of Windows mail, I thought I would use that. As my mobile device, I simply need to check mail when out and about so Windows Mail is just fine. I have 4 gmail-based IMAP email accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typical scenario, open Mail, note that last email was in some time ago, hit the 'sync' button, watch the dots travel across the top of the screen .... watch the dots ... watch the dots .. oh never mind get out the iphone and check mail within seconds. So
 Mail is pretty useless - I am using my phone anyway!</p>
<p>My windows is bang up to date, I have all the privacy settings enabled, I have set sync to 'as items arrive', even unchecked 'always download full message' to speed things up. Still, it will take up to 5 minutes to sync all 4 accounts, on wireless, and sometimes
 when I am logged into Guest wifi, I will get an error message and sync doesn't happen at all. In all - its just buggy, picky and unreliable.</p>
<p>Compare this with Outlook 2013 on my Win7 desktop, where sync is immediate, on my iPad where sync is immediate, and my iphone where sync is immediate - from all 4 accounts. With no settings to mess with, it simply works.</p>
<p>I read somewhere that MS have introduced 'activesync' with Win10 - I wonder if this is the problem? To be honest, this is the one last straw along with a few other niggles with Win10 that is pushing me back to Macbook Air for my mobile device (and I am no
 Apple bigot, my trusty Win7 desktop is brilliant, and I couldn't do without Office on Windows). Anyone want to buy a nearly new Yoga 13??</p>
<p>Anyone else experiencing these mail sync problems?</p>

            <p>I have checked all the settings advised above for fastest sync before posting this, but decided to play around one last time with the 'Download Email From' setting. The choices here are 7 days, 2 weeks, last month, last 3 months, anytime.&nbsp; The setting was
 at 'the last 3 months' for all my accounts. If I put it down to '7 days', then the sync does get quicker, but I only have 7 days email in my mailboxes, with no way to see any earlier emails.&nbsp; If I set it to 'anytime', it hung for at least 30 minutes.&nbsp; Ideally,
 I would like to have around a month's email available to view, so I set that and it took around 5 minutes to catch up with the last month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way all the Apple Mail apps work is that there are no settings and it downloads more mail the further back you scroll. Seems obvious really. On Windows Mail it is fixed, if I set 7 days then that is all that is there and the only way to see any earlier
 mail is to change the account settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its not how I would expect a Mail app to work. Surely with IMAP its just 'download any unread email, and tell the server when I read it'. Windows Mail sync seems to check as far back as the 'download email from' setting every time,&nbsp; which is why it takes
 so long?&nbsp; And there are too many settings, I should just be able to add the account and let the app do the rest. Any case, I have now set all my accounts to&nbsp; 'Download Email From 1 month' and will see if sync of newest email is now satisfactory during&nbsp; normal
 use - but even then email older than 1 month will not be available to me. Its a compromise which I shouldn't have to make.&nbsp; If not satisfactory I assume I have exhausted all options and will probably switch to an alternative app, or even an alternative laptop!</p>

            With respect, no I will not contact Google. My gmail accounts work fine on all other devices, including Outlook 2013 on Win7, and a range of Apple devices. Windows mail on Win10 is the only one that I have problems with, so logically that is where the
 problem lies, and I am sure Google will be quick to point that out, so I won't waste my time.<br />

This did not work for me. The option to change options for my outlook mailbox was not highlighted. Only the option to change my user name and password. It would seem that something so simple as syncing a mailbox would have been fixed by now. Once again I have
 t rely on my iPhone!

            <p>Ok, so having tried all recommendations and all combinations of the settings, without success, &nbsp;I gave up and installed Mailbird. I cannot understand the reason for all the WinMail settings, they make little difference and all anyone wants from a Mail app
 is to get mail delivered fast and reliably, with good UI. WinMail has a great UI but fails on the rest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to pay for Mailbird if you go above 3 mail accounts but its not much and worth it. No settings to worry about and all my accounts installed with minimum fuss, all mail delivered within seconds of opening the app. &nbsp;No complaints.</p>

<h2>            Speaker volume always set to 37 in windows 10 even after changing it to 100</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 home 64 bit version. I am having issues when setting the speaker sound volume to 100. Every time I reboot windows, the speaker volume is set to 37. Even if I set it to 100, it will reset it back to 37 on next reboot. &nbsp;However, if I
 set it to a value lower than 37, it will maintain that value after reboot. &nbsp;It also gives me a warning of hearing damage when I try to set it above 37.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drivers for speakers is from Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driver date: 10/29/2015</p>
<p>Driver version: 10.0.10586.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it reads as Speakers (Intel SST Audio Device (WDM)). &nbsp;There is another category in the device manager that reads 'Sound, video and game controllers'. Under this category, I see two sub-categories: Intel SST Audio Device (WDM); Realtek I2S Audio
 Codec.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The drivers for both of them are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel SST Audio Device (WDM)</p>
<p>Driver Provider: Intel</p>
<p>Driver Date: 9/3/2015</p>
<p>Driver Version: 604.10135.2441.6105</p>
<p>Digital Signer: Inter (R) Cherry Trail Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Realtek I2S Audio Codec</p>
<p>Driver Provider: Realtek</p>
<p>Driver Date: 9/22/2015</p>
<p>Driver Version: 6.4.10147.4327</p>
<p>Digital Signer: Realtek Semiconductor Corp</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can fix this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Me too. Up until last weekend, there was no problem at all connecting to live games (we have two XBOX360s so, we join each others' games also).</p>
<p>I tried to join a family member's minecraft world that we have been working on. First, it told me that there was a server problem, next, it said that there was no such game and then, it said that it was a "network connectivity problem." Here's the real doozy
 of them all .. the last error message I got said, "This is a full version game - in order to join, you must purchase the full version." The full version was purchased last year, but after getting that same error message a couple times, I thought I'd try it
 and see if it let me join. After the download, I got the same message. </p>
<p>The other family member was getting the same messages so, I figured that we needed to reset the router, modem, phone line, etc. After doing all that, I sent another invite from the world I was already in (like any other time) and when they opened the message,
 their console disconnected then, froze (which has been happening quite often in the last several months).
</p>
<p>This same scenario has happened with Avatar farm (with both consoles). This morning, I tried to join online and it kept telling me I couldn't connect. I then put mine online and no one was able to join - I got disconnected when someone would try to join.</p>
<p>This past weekend we called our internet provider and was told that it's not on their end. I'm guessing that when we get the "server" messages, they're referring to Microsoft servers? We also talked to the company that we got our modem and router from -
 the tech guy said it might have something to do with manually adding the console's IP address to our home network. Anyone have any ideas on that?</p>
<p>Thanks for your time,</p>
<p>have a great day/night! </p>

<p>The SAME thing has been happening to me for the past 2 days now. I cannot connect to my matchmaking lobbies in Forza on my 360, although it will still let me connect to Xbox Live..</p>
<p>Still, it is REALLY starting to get on my nerves...And not to mention the description in the service alert is quite redundant and useless...</p>
<p>Dose anyone have any idea how to fix this/when it will be fixed?..Because it's becoming quite the nuisance having to spend the little time that I have off on here instead of online...

<h2>            Media streaming to Sharp Smart Tv</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>Before the latest update I could stream my media from my pc to my tv.</p>
<p>I could select Media on the tv and access my photos etc.</p>
<p>Now if I use the same procedure I get to see the directories but they are all empty.</p>
<p>I can however cast video to my tv from media player but without sound, and the format changes from 16:9 to 4:3.</p>
<p>Is there a cure for this or is there a Media server software which I can install to do the job?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Go to your Printer Manufacturer's website &gt; Key in your Printer Model Number and Operating System.</p>
<p>Uninstall/reinstall your Printer using the&nbsp;XP Drivers from there for your Operating System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most Printer Manufacturer's will also have troubleshooting steps for you to take listed there, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And printer manufacturers normally have their own support forums.</p>

</p><p><span><span>On my Dell 9110 with Windows 8.1, I use select “This PC” from the start menu it would bring up a list of icons of all the drive I had connected to the
 computer, If I selected a drive or selected This PC there would be a bar indicating which drive I was in or it may just say THIS PC.<span>&nbsp;
</span>At the far right there was a box where I could put in a search, the computer would the do a search and list everything that match my search. Now that little box is gone. How can I get the little that search box back

    <title>When trying to boot up laptop, &#34;Press CTRL &#43; ALT &#43; DEL To - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> atucker500  say:</h3>
<h2>            When trying to boot up laptop, &#34;Press CTRL &#43; ALT &#43; DEL To Restart&#34; message appears.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have a Dell inspiron 14z laptop with Windows 7, and am having trouble getting it to boot up. Upon trying to turn on my computer, after the Dell logo appeared, a message that says Press Ctrl + Alt+ Del to restart appears on the screen. There is no other
 error code or message with these words. I tried a diagnostics scan via pressing f12, but it came back as clean. I tried contacting Dell, but got nowhere, so I am hoping that someone can help me! I wish I had more information to give, but unfortunately this
 is all that I see on the screen. I would like to add that when I do press ctrl + alt + del, it does restart but again, brings me back to the same screen without booting up to windows. Any help is much appreciated!</p>

<p>Use your Windows Repair CD to boot the machine into Repair Mode, then perform a System Restore. If you do not have such a CD, ask a friend to burn one for you via the Control Panel / Backup and Restorte.<br />

    <title>Printing documents stuck in the queue and print spooler wasn&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shoelaced  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing documents stuck in the queue and print spooler wasn&#39;t running.</h2>
                    I'm using Windows 7 with a Lexmark all-in-one printer whose driver I downloaded from the Lexmark site. &nbsp;Worked perfectly for a month or so, but then it would only let me print one document -- if I tried a second, it stayed in the queue forever behind the
 first one which said "printed - deleted," yet would never clear from the queue. &nbsp;I attempted to fix it by reinstalling the driver, but after that the print spooler refused to start. &nbsp;Even when I went into the services and manually told it to start, I'd get
 another error telling me the print spooler wasn't running and I'd go look at it and indeed, it would say "stopped" again. &nbsp;Through a couple more tries of deleting the driver and reinstalling it, I managed to "fix" it in the sense that the print spooler would
 stay running and it would let me print one document again. &nbsp;I've been doing that ever since - printing one document, restarting, print the next, restart....&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Except now, for no reason - no new software or anything, the print spooler refuses to run again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help before I claw the rest of my face off.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>*Update*&nbsp;</div>
<div>Microsoft FixIt is telling me that there are "errors in the print spooler" which indicate a spooler crash, and "the event payload may indicate the faulting module." &nbsp;The it suggests I "update printer policies" and that "isolating the printer drivers from
 the printing service may improve stability of the print spooler."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have no idea what this means....</div>

<span>I would check the status of the Print Spooler Service.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Click on the Start button and select Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Services. Locate Print Spooler in the list. Check that it has started and that the StartUp type is Automatic.</span></p>
<p>
<span>I suspect that it has stopped and that just starting it will not solve the problem.</span></p>
<p>
<span>You may need to show hidden files. Type Folder Options in the search box above the Start button and select View, Advanced Settings and verify that the box before "Show hidden files and folders"
 is checked and "Hide protected operating system files" is unchecked. You need to scroll down to see the second item. You should also make certain that the box before "Hide extensions for known file types" is not checked.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Now access Windows Explorer and select c:\windows\system32\spool\printers. Normally this folder should be empty but there is a problem when files with “spl” and “shd” extensions stick there. Delete
 the files and restart your computer. This may resolve your immediate problem.</span></p>

<h2>            Computer goes into &#34;digital power saving mode&#34; after 2 1&#47;2 minutes</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>For Windows 10</strong> - We upgraded last weekend and now the screen goes blank with "digital power saving mode" in the middle and I have to sign in again.</p>
<p>I have tried changing all the power saver modes in multiple configurations and it is still doing it.</p>
<p>I was on-line yesterday for an hour and a half with a tech to fix this problem. We updated the NVIDIA driver, restarted the computer then had to fix the screen resolution. After that all seemed to be fine. Until today.... Then the problem started all over
 again. I literally set a stopwatch to see how long before it went in this mode and it was 2 min and 27 seconds. Can't tell you how annoying this is!</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Eeshwar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately that is no help. This is the troubleshooting response:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/32a3af59-c12d-4a4c-b550-f93b03c8b7fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/32a3af59-c12d-4a4c-b550-f93b03c8b7fa" /></a>Which
 does not fix the problem. The problem is with a desktop not a laptop and default settings did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Context Menu not visible for admin user when UAC is disabled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> itinfraseclore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Context Menu not visible for admin user when UAC is disabled</h2>
                    <p>We've observed that on turning off UAC on Windows 8 machine, the right click menus of many applications like Dropbox are not visible. This happens only for an administrator account. Non-admins can still see these menus. On further probing, it appears that
 context menu handlers registered at per-user level do not show in menu when UAC is disabled, but those registered on machine level are visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known limitation of Windows? I'm not sure if it's the same for Win 7. We did not encounter this issue on a Windows 7 machine where we tested. Is there a workaround for this that does not involve turning on the UAC or registering the application
 at machine level?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

    <title>Video option and icon do not display for a new Skype account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rosalindmustafa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video option and icon do not display for a new Skype account</h2>
                    My new Skype account only allows me to call.&nbsp; I need to add credit to do that, but that's not what I want . I intend to do video calls, but that option is greyed out and the video icon doesn't display.&nbsp; There is nothing to click on to start a video call.
 Did I set up incorrectly.&nbsp; Skype was already downloaded because I have another account I've been using.&nbsp; Video is fine for that older account. Any ideas about how to get a video option for the new account?

<h3> drbcoaster  say:</h3>
<h2>            Aspect Ratio &#38; Screen Resolution don&#39;t match</h2>
                    I recently bought a 22" Widescreen display for my laptop.&nbsp; Windows is appearing on the screen, but in Display Settings, I cannot adjust the screen resolution to match the maximum resolution of the new display, which is 1680X1050.&nbsp; In fact, I am not able
 to adjust the screen resolution to any setting that doesn't distort the image on the display.&nbsp; Windows is simply stretching the 4:3 aspect ratio, when I would like it to be 16:9.&nbsp; Is there any way to adjust the display settings to allow the correct aspect
 ratio and screen resolution to appear on screen?

<p>
</p><p>I recently updated my Asus N550JV from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 and have unfortunately experienced a lot of trouble after this update. For example, my SD card is no longer detected by the PC. The card is a 16 GB SanDisk card and works fine in my camera.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to run the hardware troubleshooter and I've also made sure to install all available updates, but to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi Angie,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that your system does not recognize the SD card after Windows 8.1 update. The issue may arise if the SD card reader needs any driver (compatible with 8.1) to get updated or if there is some corruption with card reader hardware.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the first place, I would suggest you to try to&nbsp;insert some&nbsp;other SD card into the computer and check if that gets detected. This will narrow down the possibility of a malfunctioning SD card reader hardware.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you have tried the basic steps,&nbsp;please refer to the following&nbsp;<em><span>additional</span></em> methods and check if they are helpful.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To rule out the possibility of a third party software conflict, I would suggest you to clean boot the system and then check if the card gets detected.</span></p>
<p>

</p><p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Another possibility could be a system file corruption. To check with this, you need to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan. Refer to the following steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <em><strong><span>Windows key + X</span></strong></em>, click <strong>

            Hi Benjamin,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community.&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>We understand how you feel about the situation. </span><span>We're sorry for the trouble this has caused.</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">

I suggest you to sign out from the current user account, restart the system and login to the either administrator account or the Microsoft account to check, if that helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>

<p>Let's try to follow these methods below and check, if it helps.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></p>

&nbsp;b. Locate and expand “print queues” in the Device Manager Window.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;c. Right-click on the “print queues” and click on “uninstall” the printer driver.<br />
&nbsp;d. Restart the computer and check, if it works.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
After you have uninstalled the driver, then I suggest you to install the latest driver from the following link below.

            <p>Hi Benjamin - I had the same problem with my Brother printer - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/has-anyone-else-had-problems-with-their-existing/ad0ed1ef-cff9-4fed-a6fc-59aada693907">
full details here,</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>IMHO, forget the initial advice and the start of Method 1. Go straight to that link to Epson's driver update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forget Methods 2 &amp; 3 - for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know how you get on.</p>

                    I am so incredibly fed up with continually getting this problem. I've tried so many suggestions to fix it all to no avail. Microsoft should have a permanent fix for this problem by now as Windows 10 was released ages ago. &nbsp;Shame on you Microsoft.&nbsp;

    <title>Com banned for being DDoSed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> natedoolin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Com banned for being DDoSed</h2>
                    
<p>So last week I, Ntggaming, was DDoSed by a team of players I met in COD:Black Ops 3. This team was good and destroying us with knives, wrenchs and whatever melee weapon so I sent them a message that said "How tf are you guys this good you should be in faze"
 After that I get messages from one of them, which I hadnt messaged saying "hes going to boot you so dont join party" so me not having any invites replied "I didnt get an inv" so me and my buddy were playing normally and later
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>, the previous sender said "<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>will soon, he's going to turn of your router, so don't join unless you want" Later on into the night I played cod and their clan left the lobby. I get an message from
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>saying "u wanna play" so you know since they were good but one was a bit creepy but I joined anyway. Whats the worst that could happen right? Well afer I joined I realized what I had done and immediately left the party. Later my
 wifi goes out so I think its just my wifi not working because I live in the country. Well I turn it off and on mess with my router settings EVERYTHING I COULD. Then it started working so I decided hey lets get on xbox again. I get on my account and cant send
 messages or look at anyones account but could somewhat watch netflix. I messaged my friends through Facebook "GUYS I JUST GOT DDOSED WHAT." I continued to watch netflix and thought wel its gonna be over in the morning so I go to sleep. When I wake up I cant
 message anyone. Xbox Support says notice of enforcement action and then the link to the enforcement website. Now a week later I am still communication banned even though it was a week ban(for no reason other than calling out on people for DDoSing(which is
 illegal)) and NONE OF THEM HAVE ANYTHING HAPPENING TO THEM. Their names are<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> who I sent messages to. I have screenshots of them if needed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For visibility, I will be on vacation all next week. My team will have all of the steps needed to help you guys out, and should be in here daily for that, but you will see different GTs other than my own responding during that time frame.</p>
<p>Thanks a bunch, everyone! Note that I will not be checking private messages, so it will take longer if you send them to me than if you simply post in here. I'm going to verify this post while I'm out so that users can see this information. :)</p>

<p>If you do not have an Xbox One or Xbox 360, and need to connect your child account to your parent account, be sure you are following these steps in this post.</p>
<p>If you cannot see your child there, make sure that you've followed all the steps in this post. When you post back with your child's account, we will dig into it further and post back once it's resolved.</p>
<p>Thanks a bunch for everyone's patience! We'll post a further update once this issue is resolved and users no longer need to post in here. :)</p>
