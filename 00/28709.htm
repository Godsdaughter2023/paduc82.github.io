<p>Hello,</p>
<p>No, there no way to get that report of all of the dates which is users access their mailbox.</p>
<p>You can only get those report using Admin portal click "Report" (Active and inactive mailboxes, New and deleted mailboxes, New and deleted groups, Mailbox usage and &nbsp;Types of mailbox connections).</p>
<p>You may send your feedback for this feature to implement in Office 365.</p>

<p>Thanks Everyone. &nbsp;I did just run the Get-ConnectionByClientTypeDetailReport but it didn't give me all of the information needed by the employee. Plus, even though I put 01/01/2016 for the start date, the report didn't give me anything before 01/13/2016.</p>

<p>Hi GailC,</p>
<p>Thanks for your feedback.</p>
<p>Based on my research and consulting, about the incorrect output of <strong>Get-ConnectionByClientTypeDetailReport</strong> in PowerShell, weâ€™ve noticed this issue and engineers from our relevant teams are actively working to resolve it. Thanks for your time
 and patience.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I understand this PowerShell cmdlet could just be a workaround in this case which is not that convenient to retrieve the report you requested, so we welcome and encourage you to share your ideas through

<h2>            Selecting multiple pictures in Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem: I have a document that for 90% consists of small pictures where each picture stands for a musical sign in Balinese script. I have to use pictures as there is no font for Balinese or Javanese language. It looks like this:&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95cde99b-e2fb-49f9-a1b3-dc61316f1298?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95cde99b-e2fb-49f9-a1b3-dc61316f1298?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>where each symbol is an individual picture (JPG).</p>
<p>The problem is that I only can select one picture at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to select multiple pictures, for example all occurrences of the third symbol?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for suggestions</p>
<p>Danker</p>

            If you select one picture and then <strong>Shift+click</strong> or <strong>Ctrl+click</strong> on another, are both selected? This works for pictures with other than In Line With Text wrapping style. Inline pictures can be selected the same way you select

<p>Hi Rich,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be a solution. I had created a macro for each image to insert it, I also added each image to autotext, and created a custom toolbar with the autotext entries. I have in the mean time replaced these auto text images with the images + alt text.</p>
<p>Now I need to do the macro you provided, and then see if it works. I'll let you know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Answer to your question is no. If I apply text wrapping other than "in line with text" I'd have to do that for each individual picture. I can not do a "select all" and wrap to "square" (for example). One document has about 100 pages where each page contains
 about 100 images. And I have about 40 such documents!</p>

            Well, as I said, if they're inline, you select them the same way you select text.

<h2>            Need to unlock the Design View in Access 2010</h2>
                    I have acquired an Access 2010 Database from a friend but it is locked and I cannot get into the design view. I can only change the layout view and the design view is grayed out. There is no record lock to delete so no luck there. I tried to open the file
 in a new database and remove it through coding but no dice. Can anyone tell me a simple way to get access to the full file?<br />

<h2>            Restore deleted mails in outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>In Outlook I have a favourite folder with all my mails, and accidently I have deleted all mails in this folder whereby all my mails have been moved from my folders to the "deleted mails"-folder.</p>
<p>Can I get my mails restored back to their original folders automatically - I have approx. 5000 mails that I need restored back to approx. 20 folders?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>However, my problem is not that the mails have been "hard deleted". All my mails are still in the "deleted mails"-folder.</p>

    <title>Outlook.com not syncing custom domain email with Outlook 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> artuer0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook.com not syncing custom domain email with Outlook 2010</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I use Outlook 2010 desktop on Windows 10 for email. I have a number of email addresses using a custom domain that I sync with Hotmail/live/outlook.com using the Hotmail connector. Most but not all of these stopped synchronizing. The accounts still work
 fine on the web so the issue is synchronizing with my desktop Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I send/receive I get two errors. (1) 0x8004102A There was an error synchronizing your folder hierarchy. Error 80041004. (2) 0xDE00005: There is an error synchronizing your mail account. Please verify your account is configured correctly by first accessing
 your mail on the web. Error 3219. Server. an error occurred in looking up the user's information in mserv.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received an email awhile back from Microsoft telling me that I would have to delete and re-add the accounts due to some server changes. I did that&nbsp;a number of times and&nbsp;continue to receive the same error. I also tried to add the account without using the
 Hotmail connector (and also deleted and restored the Hotmail connector)&nbsp;and&nbsp;it just hangs trying to get configuration information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is frustrating as I believe I have followed all of the instructions Microsoft gave me with no success. I wonder if there are manual settings I can use to set up the accounts. I would appreciate a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I asked this question in the Outlook 2010 forum but no one was able to help ( http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-outlook/outlook-2010-cannot-sync-outlookcom-custom-domain/c3cfcb77-bbd8-4772-856a-92714a237725). I tried using a new
 profile per suggestions in that forum and that didn't help. I thought I would try here.</p>

<h3> hoff_____  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2013 Error&#58; &#34;Cannot Access the File&#34; When Opening Workbook</h2>
                    <p>I have a large Excel 2013 file that I'm modifying. When I open the workbook I receive two types of errors about 4 times each:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Microsoft Excel cannot access the file https://dl-web.dropbox.com_________________. There are several possible reasons: The file name or path does not exist, the file is being used by another program, or the workbook you are trying to save has the same
 name as a currently open workbook.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) We can't connect to 'https://dl-web.dropbox.com_____________________'. Please make sure you're using the correct web address.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have nothing in "Edit Links" or "Existing Connections". How can I fix this so that I do not have to modify each computer that I pull this file up on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I locate which cell is referencing this file in dropbox?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!!</p>

    <title>Emails show up in the Outlook Inbox but not at MSN Inbox, and only on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a1_2 canadian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emails show up in the Outlook Inbox but not at MSN Inbox, and only on the new Win10 netbook</h2>
                    <p>Why do I see the latest emails when I go to Outlook off the Edge browser on my new Windows 10 Netbook, but when I&nbsp;log into my normal and long-standing MSN Explorer Mail site, the Inbox emails stop after 10 days ago.&nbsp; What's really aggravating is that I was
 just reading those missing emails a few minutes prior via MSN!&nbsp; I had occassion to log out, then opened for a few minutes Outlook to recheck something, got frustrated again with the layout of Outlook and opted to return to our familiar old MSN, and the latest
 emails were no longer listed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also often wondered why after viewing emails on our iPad and deleting some, they still show up at MSN when we go to the site from one of our 3 computers, a Windows 10 netbook, a Vista laptop, or our old XP desktop.&nbsp; And some emails we create and send,
 or reply to,&nbsp;on one computer&nbsp;don't always show up when accessed from another one.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'd think if you access the presumably one server that holds&nbsp;your&nbsp;mail, MSN, it wouldn't matter how you get there or with what device you do it,&nbsp;as long as you open and manage your own registered MSN site.</p>

            <p>Okay, I just went to my MSN Explorer email Inbox as usual, on the new Windows 10 Netbook, and the listed emails are no more recent than March 11th.&nbsp; So I restarted the computer and logged back into MSN, and got the same result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went to our Vista laptop, which&nbsp;had been&nbsp;in Sleep Mode for a couple days, woke it up, and started and logged into MSN.&nbsp; It loaded all emails including those unread that came in today, March 22nd.&nbsp; If I go back to the Windows 10 Netbook and open Outlook,
 all those same new emails are in the Inbox there... just not when I go to my MSN email Inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I note another strange thing, on the Netbook only, on&nbsp;its MSN email Inbox page, every single email listed, which is from March 11th back, has the Forward arrow displayed to its right.&nbsp; Weird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently the issue is with this new Toshiba Netbook?&nbsp; The darned thing is kind of unstable anyway, as I have a lot of trouble with the text cursor jumping out of place inexplicably while typing, and the screen changing suddenly from one task window to
 another.&nbsp; Either the touchscreen and/or the touchpad is overly sensitive.&nbsp; But I'm not sure whether to blame the machine or the Windows 10 software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I need to reload the new Netbook with the MSN software?</p>

            <p>No answer to this phenomenon?&nbsp; The Windows 10 Netbook MSN Explorer Junk folder gets current mail, but the Inbox is still stopped as of 2 weeks ago, and there are Forward Arrow icons in front of each and every listed old email. That shouldn't be happening
 either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to use the old XP and&nbsp;Vista computers, or my iPad, to read my current emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just, with some difficulty, uninstalled the MSN Premium and reinstalled it.&nbsp; It still behaves exactly the same.&nbsp; All Inbox emails stop at 3/11/16, most if not all of them previously read,&nbsp;although the Inbox shows there are 23 unread emails!&nbsp; When Junk
 emails come down, they show up in the Junk folder just fine.&nbsp; I can read ALL the emails via this Toshiba Windows 10 machine, including&nbsp;the dozens&nbsp;since 3/11/16,&nbsp;off Chrome or Edge/Outlook just fine.</p>

            <p>Still this problem exists.&nbsp; Except now an occasional email appears.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>They mostly stopped as of March 11th, but one from March 30th appeared, one from April 13th, and another one today, the 16th.&nbsp; This is really weird.&nbsp; My other computers and iPad display
<p>
</p><p>It's only on that machine and only via MSN that not all emails display.&nbsp; The other odd thing that may be a giveaway of something to anyone knowledgeable, is the Forward arrows that appear in the left column, in front of every single email listed in the Inbox.&nbsp;
 Including listed emails I haven't actually forwarded or replied to.&nbsp; And only the Inbox.&nbsp; The Junk folder for example works fine.</p>

<h2>            Office 2016 Keeps losing connection to server</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have one user who is using Windows&nbsp; 10 PRO and having issues with Outlook 2016 connection to server. Her Network connection seems to be working just fine as she can browse the internet and so forth, but She keeps getting a yellow exclamation mark off and
 on throughout the day on her Outlook 2016 that says cannot connect to server. I've created a new profile to see if that has done the trick but it hasn't. Any help is appreciated.

    <title>Where are Notes and Tasks on my Android&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r3dplanet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where are Notes and Tasks on my Android&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an Office 365 account via GoDaddy through which I use Outlook 2016 on my notebook computer. I use Mail, Calendar (with heavy use of the notes in the Calendar), Tasks, Contacts, etc. I have an enormous amount of information for which I need constant
 access for the work that I do. I have 1500 clients and keep detailed notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing Outlook for Android on my new Galaxy S8, I cannot find Tasks or Notes. What gives? In fact, I'm finding that all sorts of things don't work - it doesn't show my mail folders created in Outlook, I cannot delete contacts, I cannot search in
 the Calendar. Is this normal behavior or am I missing something obvious?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;R3dplanet,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, Outlook for Android has no options for either Task or Notes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, for folders created in Outlook client, they should be synced to Outlook for Android only if the account has been configured via "Exchange mode"( It calls Exchange ActiveSync in mobile). Simutaneously, if you have reconfirmed both the account has
 been configured via "Exchange" (Outlook client) and "Exchange ActiveSynce"(Outlook for Android), the Calendar and Contacts should be also synced to Outlook for Android. And, they can be searched and edited/deleted in mobile. You may refer to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Set-up-email-in-the-Outlook-for-Android-app-886db551-8dfa-4fd5-b835-f8e532091872?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&amp;fromAR=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
configure Office 365 account in Outlook for Android</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your situation meets what I have mentioned above, the issue should be related to Outlook for Android App. As a result, it is recommeded that you contact the built-in app support for dedicated help. You can refer to to the following screenshot to contact
 the built in app support.</p>

            <p>Nope, unfortunately still working with the user to resolve this issue. We've tried uninstalling per this TechNet:</p>

<p>
</p><p>And then re-isntalling but still seeing the same behavior. Someone in another thread recommended repairing disk permissions, but seeing as El Cap should do that automatically and it has been removed from Disk Utility, I don't think that would fix this issue...</p>

<p>
</p><p>If I run Lync from console, I get no errors, and the application exits normally after the message: "Telemetry initialized". I did have my system crash before this started occurring, so I would have thought this is due to some issue with a cache.<br />

            Some news - I got Lync working again by selecting the "Open at Login" option from the right click menu on the Lync icon, then restarting the computer. Maybe the issue has to do with launching Lync once some other service gets started...

    <title>hyperlink problems with PowerPoint Mac 2008 &#40;and PC 2007&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcy_8613  say:</h3>
<h2>            hyperlink problems with PowerPoint Mac 2008 &#40;and PC 2007&#41;</h2>
                    I'm trying to use hyperlinks on a shape (an arrow with the word details in it) to have the option of viewing hidden slides or not during a presentation. I created the slides on a Mac, PowerPoint 2008. Our office routinely saves our files as 1997-2004 version
 so they can be used by clients on either Mac or PC with whichever version of PowerPoint. (We do the same on the PC - we have 2007, but save as 2003.)
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The issue is that these hyperlinks seem to only want to work intermittently. Sometimes, if set up on the PC, they all work on the PC but then won't work when tried on a Mac. Then I'll re-create them on the Mac, they work on both Mac and PC, but then some
 (not all within the same presentation) won't work on the Mac.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Has anyone found any solutions to this sort of issue with hyperlinking? We have a major presentation next week that will be on a PC (at a clients, so we don't know for sure what version it will be) and need to be confident that our presentation hyperlinks
 will work. Thank you.</div>
                </div>

            Do you have a lot of hyperlinks? The old format of PowerPoint had a limit on the amount of space that hyperlinks could take up. Once that limit was reached, the hyperlinks behaved similarly to what you describe. Solutions include splitting up the presentation
 or shortening slide titles.

<h2>            Units of measure</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a Band 2 and I want to know if is possible to change the unit of measure in metric, when I set the band's language in English. I have notice that when the language is Italian I have the distance on the band in meter, but when I set language in English
 I have the distance in Miles. I have already tried to change the unit of measure with the app, but they change only on the app and not on the band.</p>
<p>So I'm trying to set the band in English to use Cortana and set the units of measure in metric.</p>
<p>It's possible?!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Regards</p>

    <title>Populating fields based on combo box or subform - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 985hunter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Populating fields based on combo box or subform</h2>
                    <p>My frmAccount has a subform, subAcctAppointment, and they have a relationship through ClientID field.&nbsp; Ideally I'd like to be able to click the checkbox in the subform for one record in the datasheet, and have an event populate the fields in frmAccount,
 so I can save the appointment info to tblAccount. I tried the following based on what I used previously to populate from a combo box that works well.&nbsp;I put the following in an event for the checkbox "on click"&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't work.</p>
<p>

</p><p><span>Me.txtAcctClientID.Value =Me.subAcctAppointment. ClientID</span></p>

<p><span>Me.txtAcctApptID.Value =Me.subAcctAppointment. ApptID</span></p>

<p><span>Me.txtAcctApptDate.Value = Me.subAcctAppointment.ApptDate</span></p>

<p><span>Me.txtAcctAmount.Value =Me.subAcctAppointment.Revenue</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Then I tried to use a combo box, however it shows all appointments and not just those for the client I pulled up in the main form (frmAccount). I can't find a way to filter what appears in the combo box to show only for the ClientID showing in the main form.
 &nbsp;I don't like this method as well, but if the first one can't happen for some reason, I will take an alternative. But if this one won't I may be sunk! Any helpful ideas out there?</p>

            Are the controls in the parent form to which you are attempting to assign the values
<em>bound </em>controls?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The parent form is based on a table which models an Accounts entity type, while the subform's underlying table is modelling an Appointments entity type. So far so good.&nbsp; However, if the controls are bound, you now appear to wish
 to assign attributes of a specific appointment to the referenced row in the Accounts table.<br />
<br />
In relational database terms this would be fundamentally incorrect as the values are not attributes of the Accounts entity type.&nbsp; If the controls are
<em>bound</em>, what is the rationale behind what you are attempting?<br />
<br />
Even harder to understand is why you would wish to assign the ClientID value to a control in the parent form.&nbsp; As the form and subforms are linked on ClientID the key of the parent form's recordset is already the ClientID value, so what is the purpose of trying
 to assign it to the control?<br />
<br />
If the controls in question are <em>unbound</em>, and are intended merely to show appointment data from whichever row is selected in the subform, then I can to some extent see why you might want to do this, in which case the code would be:<br />
<br />
Me.Parent.txtAcctClientID = Me.ClientID<br />
Me.Parent.txtAcctApptID = Me.ApptID<br />
Me.Parent.txtAcctApptDate = Me.ApptDate &nbsp;<br />
Me.Parent.txtAcctAmount = Me.Revenue<br />
<br />
though I can't see any useful reason for assigning either the ClientID or the ApptID values to unbound controls in the parent form.&nbsp; Bear in mind also that if the controls are unbound they values in them would persist if you navigate to a different account
 in the parent form, unless you clear them with code in the parent form's Current event procedure.<br />
<br />
I think it would help if you could explain what you are trying to achieve in real life business terms rather than how you are attempting to do so in terms of the user interface.<br />

            <p>Hi Ken... it was very kind of you to take my question so earnestly, so allow me to rewind a bit. This app tracks client info and their appointments. The users&nbsp; book the appointment on frmClient and subAppointment. This part works well. Now they have asked
 for the functionality to track amounts owed and payments. This way their clients can run a tab and pay every month or two if the client is trusted. The&nbsp;amount owed and the date incurred is kept the appointment table. I need to search for a client's appointments,
 pull up each one into the revenue (amount owed) field on the main form and then save the data to frmAccount so I can keep a running balance of what the client owns. I hope that makes sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my main form, I copied from frmClient with its subform frmAppointments where the user books appointment with a particular client. It only shows that one client's appointments. After I copied frmClient and renaming it to frmAccount, I&nbsp; added fields from
 tblAccount where I have AcctAmount, AcctFees, AcctTotal, AcctPayment, Acct Balance, AcctCLientID, AcctApptID, etc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to have a way of looking up appointment info for one client at a time, and saving that data from the Appointment table to the Account table to track what is owed, when they pay, and how much they pay. Does that help?</p>

            <p>Forms don't hold data, tables hold data. So you don't save data to a form. So you need to rethink your process a bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your tblAccount should look like this:</p>
<p>tbAccount</p>
<p>AccountID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>ClientID (FK)</p>
<p>ApptID (FK)</p>
<p>PaymentAmt</p>
<p>PaymentDate</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what fees are or how they differ from Payments. You don't need to store the balance as that should be calculated. You don't need to store the total as that is in the Appointment table.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I have to as one question before we go further. What happens if a Client has mutipe appointments before paying off. Is the client going to make one payment or multiple payments (for each appt). Are you going to apportion the payments or the client?</p>

            The balances per account should not be saved in a column in a table.&nbsp; This leaves the database wide open to update anomalies, and as Murphy's Law infallibly states, 'If something can go wrong, it will go wrong.'&nbsp; The balances can be computed from the transaction
 amounts.<br />
<br />
Computing balances is pretty standard.&nbsp; Essentially the debit balance following each transaction is the sum of all debits less the sum of all credits per account up to and including the transaction.&nbsp; The current balance is that following the latest transaction.&nbsp;
 There are various ways of computing balances, of which the most efficient is by means of a JOIN of two instances of the transactions (appointments in your case) table.&nbsp; Less efficient, is the use of a correlated subquery to return the balance.&nbsp; Neither of
 these return an updatable result table, however, so if the query is to be used as the basis for an editable form it is necessary to resort to the VBA DSum function, which is the least efficient of all.<br />
<br />
You'll find examples in Balances.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />

<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file illustrates how to compute balances in a variety of scenarios.&nbsp; Note that the queries bring the TransactionID primary key into play to act as the tie breaker in the event of two or more transactions occurring on the same day.&nbsp; This might
 not be necessary in your case if there can be one appointment only per account in any one day.<br />

            <p>Hi Scott &amp; Ken,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My original request was to better filter my combo box to include only those appointments belonging the client in the main form. I finally figured out to go to the row source for the combo box and click the [...] button. Then in the query screen I located
 the ClientID field and added the criteria below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Field:&nbsp; ClientID</p>
<p>Table:&nbsp; tblAppointment</p>
<p>Criteria:&nbsp; [Forms]![frmAccount]![ClientID]</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked to restrict the combo box to only the one client's appointments. I found I still had a problem that it would not refresh the data when I clicked to get to the next record, and I had to hit 'refresh'. Then after experimenting I found that a macro
 to refresh worked when I put the refresh in an event on the form's properties&nbsp;(not on the field's)&nbsp;'On Current'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to your other points, I do see what you mean about the balance field not being in a table, and not all transactions would be tracked this way. If the client pays cash, then the revenue field in tblAppointment is the only record of the revenue/payment.
 Scott had a question too about payments; the client can make one payment for several appointments. This new functionality is so the client can run up a tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am posting this in case you have any further caveats for me, and for others in the future who may have a similar challenge.&nbsp; I still don't know how to populate 'txt' fields from a subform to save the data to a third table (not the table providing the main
 or subform data), but eventually, maybe I will figure out that too if I ever need it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Thanks guys!</p>

            The Requery method of the combo box should be called to reload the recordset for the combo box's drop down list, not the form's Refresh method.<br />
<br />
If a single payment can be made in relation to multiple appointments then payments should be modelled by a table which references Clients, i.e. it should have a PaymentID primary key column and a ClientID foreign key column, along with the non-key columns such
 as the payment date and amount.&nbsp; The Appointments table should, in addition to a ClientID foreign key column, also have a PaymentID foreign key column.<br />
<br />
I'm not clear from your last post whether you are recording the balances in a column in a table or not.&nbsp; You should not do so.&nbsp; Whether payments are in cash or by other means is irrelevant to the computation of balances.&nbsp; Provided that each payment is recorded
 in a row in the payments table balances can be computed.&nbsp; My online demo, to which I referred you earlier has examples of queries for simple credit and debit accounts.&nbsp; In the case of a loan account for instance you'd also have to take account of interest
 accrued.<br />

            <p>In your original post you said this; "h<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ave an event populate the fields in frmAccount, so I can save the appointment info to tblAccount." I think that is what ken and I both focused on because this is
 not good design. the Only thing you need about the Appt in tblAccounts is the ApptID as a foreign key.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As far as filtering the combobox for the current client its unclear where this combobox is. Yes filtering the Rowsource for the current ClientID is the way to go.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">But now that you have said that a client can be paying for multiple appts with a payment, then you need 2 tables:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">tblFees</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">FeeID (PK Autonumber)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ApptID (FK)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">FeeAmount</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">SchedPmtAmt</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">SchedPmtDate</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">and&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>tbAccount</p>
<p>AccountID (PK Autonumber)</p>
<p>ClientID (FK)</p>
<p>PaymentAmt</p>
<p>PaymentDate</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the Fees table records what the client is being charged and the Accounts table what they have paid.</p>

            Yeah I am with you now. I need&nbsp;to separate the payment table from the charge table. That became evident to me yesterday. I have changed some of the design already based upon what you both have said, and I will have to do the remaining changes to normalize
 it better. Thanks for all the suggestions and advice.

<h2>            Nokia Asha 300 language change</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to find the answer to my question here but was not successful.</p>
<p>I am going to buy a Nokia Asha 300 phone soon in the UK but I need it with Polish settings. I know this device does not support this language by defaul if bought in England so is there any way to install Polish language on it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks for your help</p>

<p>With a Windows Phone, you would be able to add additional languages from within the menu. With a Nokia Series 40 like your Nokia 300, the set of languages it tied to the currect firmware product-code. Consequently, if you swap the whole firmware and install
 one for another product code, then, yes, you are able to do so. This can be done with cracked tools on the Internet, or officially at your local Nokia Care point. Consequently, it might be easier to ask an acquaintance to bring a phone from Poland.</p>

            Even after explaining also they didnt do as you said. So without a proper technician in the nokia care centers our live goes on like this. So avoiding the Nokia care is the final solution.

<p>You could try re-sync-ing your Nokia Messaging account to see if that works. I forgot the exact term though but it's somewhere in the options...or settings... It will basically remove all the email data in your phone and re-sync to your connected mailboxes
 fresh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will not be able to download a separate Mail for Exchange application to install in your Nokia E72 because the MFE functionality is integrated (built-in) with the Nokia Email Client that is part of your phone OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words, your Nokia E72 came pre-loaded with the ability to use MFE. When you set up an email account, there should have been an option for you to select "MFE" which will work, if your email account provider has an Exchange server for you to connect
 to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, with generic email addresses which is by default a POP3 type connection for example, you may have to manually set up the MFE connection. So the way I do it is to trick the phone into thinking my email address is non-standard by typing
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***... This will prompt the phone to ask me for an email type.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way to "update" your MFE is if the latest software update for your phone has improvements to the email client software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for third party mail software, it will vary because phones don't have the same operating system. There's no universal compatibility with one software. Every mobile software developed must be tweaked to work with different models and brands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not an easy thing to do and consumes time &amp; money.&nbsp;So most developers will focus on the devices that are&nbsp;the most popular among consumers... &nbsp;If Nokia E72 isn't listed as a compatible device, then you will not be able to use free mail software. You
 can email the software company that develops the mail software you are interested in to see if they have plans to include E72 as part of their compatible devices</p>

<p>First I would like to thank you for your answers. The problem was, because I tried to use Gmail account setting it just on Email program from my phone. But it won't work on that way. It would work only if you set up Gmail account on
<a href="http://email.nokia.com/account/home.action." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://email.nokia.com/account/home.action.</a> When I set up it from there it started working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have another question :) When I delete mails (Gmail) from E72 and when I sync with Gmail, server doesn't put the deleted mails into the Trash folder in Gmail, but it put it in All mail folder. How can I set when I delete mails from E72 and when sync is
 done, server move deleted mails into the Trash folder on Gmail? And also when I delete mails from Gmail account on the Web, how can I set that the Email client on E72 move these mails into the Deleted itemes folder after the sync is done?</p>

<p>i have a question in regards to this issue and your response. &nbsp;i just got my nokia e72 and wanted to set it up just like i did with the older version that i had. &nbsp;i was able to set up gmail and hotmail, but i was not happy with the way some of my music was
 not synced well and decided to do a hard reset (i thought it shouldnt matter since i didnt have much saved info. anyways). &nbsp;now, i cannot set up my gmail and when i do manage to do so after so many tries, i only have emails form 2007. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so, i was wondering, when i hard reset my nokia, did i delete any useful information that would have let me access my gmail properly?? like when you said "Nokia E72 came pre-loaded with the ability to use MFE. When you set up an email account, there should
 have been an option for you to select "MFE" which will work"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>oh, and i still can't upload any music because it cuts off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>does any one have any idea how i can overcome this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think your problem is solved because your phone now receives your mail through the NM servers. When you first setup your mailbox, it was probably defined as IMAP mailbox with direct connection to the Gmail IMAP servers.&nbsp;I found that there is a BUG in the
 E72's IMAP client - some messages make it crash during the synchronization (I already posted about this several times in the other boards).</p>
<p>I had the same problem with my Gmail account - the phone was downloading only the messages before certain date. So I decided to check the first message after the last downloaded message - it was different by the others because it contained attachment with
 extension EML (email file). After I deleted this message, the phone downloaded everything and started to work perfectly. Then I sent some test e-mails with other EML attachments to my mailbox - the problem appeared again - the phone was unable to download
 ANY messages after the test message with the EML attachment. Same happens with attachments with extension MSG (e-mails exported from MS Outlook).</p>
<p>All other e-mail clients I tested do not have any problem with the same Gmail account - Outlook 2003, Android phone (Built-in Gmail and IMAP clients, K9mail), and even Nokia E71 =&gt; it is bug in the E72 IMAP client.</p>

    <title>N95 camera is fast becoming annoying - any tips&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skyline_stu  say:</h3>
<h2>            N95 camera is fast becoming annoying - any tips&#63;</h2>
                    Appreciate any help that can be offered with this one, as it's slowly destroying my will to keep an otherwise marvellous phone.<br />
<br />
So, I've had a chance to use my camera some more on my N95, intial pictures looked reasonably promising, but overall, for anything other than close ups or very distant scenery shots it seems average at best. Classic example being my attempts at photographing
 my car. Impossible task for the N95 it seems regardless of the brackets being green.<br />
<br />
I moved to this phone from a sony ericsson K800i, and despite the adverts and famous lenses etc, as well as being 5mp as opposed to 3.2 on my Sony Ericsson (I know this doesn't have any bearing on the image quality), I'm really unimpressed having spent the
 last week trying to get some decent pictures of my car, so far the Sony has it beaten hands down for quality of pictures, which I'm sure shouldn't be the case.<br />
<br />
Now I know these phones are never going to generate top of the range SLR quality pics, but for a camera which markets it's apparantly fabulous camera as a key component, I'm left a little, no, very underwhelmed.<br />
<br />
A couple of examples below.<br />
<br />
This picture was taken with my Sony Ericsson, nothing extraordinary.<br />
<a href="http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y201/MeLLoN_Stu/Skyline/DSC00079.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y201/MeLLoN_Stu/Skyline/DSC00079.jpg</a><br />
<br />
Same car, same time of day, similar weather conditions, not quite as intense sun hence the lack of colour in the paint, and the nokia gives me this...<br />
<a href="http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y201/MeLLoN_Stu/Image053.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y201/MeLLoN_Stu/Image053.jpg</a><br />
<br />
<br />
I've tried every setting, every scene mode, used my own settings in every possible combination, and it's just not playing ball, regardless of time of day, lighting conditions, weather etc.<br />
<br />
I've updated the firmware more times than I can remember, and this is the best it gets. It just seems unable to replicate what you see on the screen.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to accept it might be me, I'm no pro, but it doesn't take an art critic to know that my sony ericsson's pictures are better if that's the best I can extract from the N95 with the brackets showing green, the focus sorting itself out and hinting that
 the shot should be spot on.<br />
<br />
Any tips for getting the shot above taken by the N95 better? Am I too heavily reliant on the autofocus, is there an ideal setting for taking pictures of cars at 10 feet away as the phone seems to love showing me the proverbial finger in the form of red brackets.<br />
For every ten attempts I make at getting the autofocus to do it's thing, 9 of them give me a red bracket, unless I'm stupidly close up, regardless of settings.<br />
<br />
I just want to get a few nice pictures, nothing more, nothing less.<br />
Any tips?<br />
<br />
Heeeelp!! lol<br />
<br />
Cheers for reading, apologies for the long post / rant / explanation.<br />

            The most important thing in Digital Cameras or ones that have been built into phones are the CMOS sensors.<br />
Megapixels do make it a finer and sharper picture, But that just means how many pixels are in the image not how good it's going to look.<br />
<br />
The bigger the better, The quality of the lens matters too especially the Carl Zeiss lens - Thats why it has a camera cover, So check the lens is clean, if it's not then clean it with a tissue.<br />
<br />
I'm doubting the CMOS sensor on the N95 is average for it's camera.<br />
<br />
Also make sure when focusing on the picture that it's a green not a red.<br />
<br />
Maybe changing the settings so it's right for the condition you are taking the picture.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work then maybe you should have your N95 checked into your nearest Nokia Service Centre for a check up and maybe you should show them the evidence with the two pictures you took.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.

            Thanks for the advice :)<br />
<br />
The lens is spotless and I always try and get a green bracket though it sometimes takes a long time for it to happen, almost as if i'm asking to much of it to focus on a big silver car that's 10 feet away lol.<br />
<br />
I've tried just about every setting, and I'm yet to get 3 clear, consitant shots.<br />
<br />
Perhaps a trip to the service centre is in order.

            Apologies if you've already tried this but have you changed the sharpness setting? In any mode other than automatic, the sharpness is, by default, set to hard for some reason. Try changing this to normal. Btw, this is in F/W version 11 or less, I believe
 the newest revision has this sorted.

    <title>Outlook 2016 goes to blank white screen after email is sent - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 goes to blank white screen after email is sent</h2>
                    <p>Hi all.&nbsp; Hoping someone out there has experienced this and can advise on fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>User with Windows 7 Pro 64bit and Office 2016 32bit installed, all patched to latest and greatest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every now and then, the user sends an email, and Outlook goes white screen, like its not responding, but does not show that.&nbsp; Outlook is closed and then things work again. The ribbon is all present and Outlook seems to keep working, but everything else goes
 blank white.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is not about blank emails being sent, it is about how Outlook 2016 appears to go blank screen when an email is sent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried new profile, cached and non cached mode, turned off hardware acceleration in Outlook, even changed the video card, same issue.&nbsp; It is a Dell Optiplex 9060 (I think), and iCore 7, 16GB RAM, NVMe 2.0 storage - it is not a slow PC. EMail is Exchange Online
 Plan 2 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone advise on what this may be?&nbsp; I have tried to search this issue online for some time now, and only thing that comes close is about sending blank emails, and that is not the issue at all.&nbsp; Can't find anything close to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.&nbsp; Many thx.</p>
<p>
</p><p>D</p>

<p>Hi DGMPL,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, I would like to gather more details about this concern. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are the sent emails have attachments?</li><li>Since you mentioned that you're using an Exchange email account, have you tried adding a different email account type (POP/IMAP)? This would help us isolate if the issue is with the account or the application itself.</li><li>Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, please run the application in safe mode. This would help us identify if an add-in or extension is causing the problem.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find the shortcut icon for your Office application.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Press and hold the <strong>CTRL</strong> key and double-click the application shortcut.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <strong>Yes</strong> when a window appears asking if you want to start the application in
<strong>safe mode</strong>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If running in safe mode and the issue still occurs, I suggest that you run a repair. Here's the
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> for the steps.

<p><strong>Thx WilliamBoatright.</strong>&nbsp; Your study of the issue with out of order replies is intriguing.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my user tested it and it still happens with new emails or replies.&nbsp; The user then closes Outlook and then things seem to go back to normal.&nbsp;
 The user reboots their PC every night, so nothing is left running, but the issues seems to happen about every 3 to 4 days, very random.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is almost like a cache of some sort runs out in Outlook, like it exhausts some sort of memory threshold.&nbsp; I had read in other blogs that this does not happen with Outlook 201x 64bit version, but then if going that route, you suddenly make other add-ins
 inoperable or incompatible with the 64bit version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Reply to Jomel Ber:</strong> It is not feasible for the user to run in Safe mode.&nbsp; The user has a lot of custom colors and associations on emails that it would just confuse the user and be frustrating.&nbsp; Since it does not happen on a reliable basis,
 it also would mean having to stay in Safe mode for several days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure where else or what else to try.&nbsp; I was really hoping someone else out there came across a solution.</p>

<h2>            Word 2010 printing &#34;white&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to print words from Word 2010. I have a blue background. I can only see the words against this background as they are printing in white.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has only just happened. Have I altered a setting somewhere?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst others are trying to print in white, I would be happy to print in the default back again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can print from outside word correctly, however, even the Word documents that used to print in black have now changed to white.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am printing on an Epson XP-700. My Epson R 1900 prints them in black.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any&nbsp;suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks Tom</p>

            <p>Hi Everyone,&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your replies and suggestions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After three head cleans under Epson's instruction, they have decided it is a printer hardware fault.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily the machine is only six months old.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers Guy</p>

    <title>Locked out of my email account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> soniagrant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locked out of my email account</h2>
                    <p>I have had an ongoing issue with being locked out of my email account for almost a week. &nbsp;I reported, via email, the fact that my email account had been blocked since receiving a WhatsApp message. &nbsp;Once I opened this message it proceeded to send similar
 messages to all my contacts. &nbsp;Microsoft then blocked my account and suggest I complete a renewal password form. &nbsp;I have completed numerous forms but all have subsequently been rejected. &nbsp;Its very fraustrating as there seems very little help available when
 you cannot remember all the details used to create the account, the account in question &nbsp;was originally opened back in early 2000s so a lot of the information has been lost or has changed. &nbsp;Is there any way to access my email using some other verification
 process?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The helpdesk email service have simply suggested completing yet another form? &nbsp;HELP! This is driving me mad</p>
<p>
