<p>Hi Monica,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate you responding to look into the&nbsp;issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have answered your questions below:</p>
<p>- Yes, my account has been migrated to new Outlook interface. In fact, the issue started after the migration and everything was perfect before that.</p>
<p>- No, I did not set up any rules or sweep filters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please find below the screenshot, you would notice that read and unread emails they all look the same. The 1st, 2nd , 4th and 14th email are read emails and the rest are all unread. The
 issue is that the unread are not highlighted / bold. Even the four emails I have read were not highlighted before being read. Please advice solution as I have been missing out and responding so many important emails on daily basis due to this specific issue
 and I cannot track them. Frankly, your email was one of them and thats why I am responding it late.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desperately looking for your response to resolve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi Ali,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a workaround, you can access your mailbox inside your Microsoft account. To do so, see the steps below:</p>
<p>

            <p>Do you use an email client to access your outlook.com account? Or do you use an email app on your phone/tablet to access your outlook.com account?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, and if the email client or app is configured to use the POP protocol when fetching new mail from the outlook.com server, then this is a known problem .... when new (unread) mail is fetched from the outlook.com server using the POP protocol, &nbsp;the outlook.com
 server marks that mail as being read (on the server) .... even though the user has never opened the mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has been aware of the problem for months .... but has not fixed it. They may never fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are comfortable making changes to your email client or app, the work around is to create a new profile that uses IMAP to fetch mail from the outlook.com server.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been a hotmail account holder for the last 18 years I guess. Everything worked fine as I used to check emails on my computers by visiting www.hotmail.com. It all started some four months back that new emails are not bold / highligted as it used to
 be. And whenever I check for new emails, I find nothing bold as before. Though I receive 20 emails everyday. I was advised by Microsoft Community member to go in the Microsoft Mail &gt; Option &gt; Mark as Read - and select "Do not automatically mark read". But
 the problem persists, interestingly mails in the junk folder are fine and new emails are bold unless read but Inbox never show bold emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

</p><p>I tried your advice but the issue persists, the problem is not accessing / viewing inbox but the thing I have been facing is that my new emails (which are not read by) are not bold / highlighted as it used to be. I usually receive 20 new emails on daily
 basis but they are not bold. It all started happening some four months back.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 Home Premium for self employee</h2>
                    I am self-employed and I'm working from home. I'm still using Office 2003 and now I have decided to upgrade as I saw great price for Office 365 Home Premium. I want to ask if I can buy Office 365 Home Premium for my small company as it will be used for
 comercial purposes. I don't need any features Office 365 small bussiness offers. I hope I can use Home Premium, so I don't have to go to free alternative, as Small Bussiness is too expensive for me.<br />

<h2>            Unable to call certain contacts</h2>
                    
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'm quite pleased with my Lumia 800 but I am having one strange issue;
<strong>I am unable to call certain numbers. Until now it has happened with 2 numbers only and it can't be a problem of the SIM card because i tried putting it in another phone (also Nokia btw) and I can call them perfectly...</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the numbers rings once normally and at the second ring it starts ringing as if it was unavailable (occupied). The other number just sends the call to voicemail as if the phone was switched of...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of the other phones even shows some kind of information saying I had tried to call it..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been thinking if there is any way to block certain numbers for outgoing calls and if I had activated it by mistake...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two people I cannot call can call me perfectly so there is no block for incoming calls for these two numbers... Also I can send them sms without any problem...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Model is Lumia 800 from german Telekom bought 2 weeks ago&nbsp;online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>Check the phone numbers carefully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've also had trouble calling and texting contacts and the only way to make them work is to edit the number and entre it again in a standard format with country code, area code and number.</p>
<p>Look at a number that works and then check one that doesn't work and write the phone number in exactly the same way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've found this very irritating because my list of contacts has work in every phone I've owned for 15 years or so, until this one decides it's going to be extremely fussy</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it's not that then dunno</p>
<p>Regards<br />

<p>It's not that mate... I really wish it was... but I've tried everything and it doesn't work out... I've deleted the contact from windows live AND facebook and called only the number and made sure the number is correct; I've tried +351 [space] and the number,

    <title>Microsoft Office Doc Corrupting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> squiglyat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office Doc Corrupting</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been working on a project for several years with no issues with MS word, took a break for a bit over 1 year but now that I come back to the project every time I try to do anything with the project, tables in the document keep corrupting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially thought it was that file so I opened up a backup, same table corrupted in that one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then opened an older backup, after a few minutes the table corrupted again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried doing the normal "repair" fix and saving it as other formats. Tried removing the table and inserting in a fresh copy of it and tried removing it entirely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In each it still corrupts. The last, other areas start corrupting after a few minutes. In no instance does the file open already corrupted though either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing that works is constantly manually saving every 30 seconds and Alt F4ing Office when it corrupts. When I open the doc', the table resumes normal format and the doc can be used / edited and saved until it corrupts again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any known fixes for this or am I just typing out 26k words again?...</p>

<p>Sorry, was tired and annoyed when I typed that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can load and edit the document for about 5 - 10 minutes at a time. I am then presented with the error dialogue stating "A table in this document has become corrupted" and the only option in the dialogue is Okay.</p>
<p>The first corruption is always with the same table and when it corrupts, all of the same style tables look to be the same but if I try to edit or delete them after the corruption Word crashes. Forcing it to close gives me the option to do the normal "Close",
 "Check for remedies" and "Restart programme". Restarting the programme attempts to fix the corruption and gives the option of repaired version and original version.
</p>
<p>The original version loads from the last save not including any last edits while the fixed version isn't (Includes edits). However the fixed version, the tables that errored become scrunched up to the left side of the page at the minimum field width. This
 causes every piece of data there to be forced over about 100 pages from 4 pages. If I try to delete this, Word locks up and I can't edit anything without again reloading it. If I use an older version of the file it does the same. If I load it through Dropbox
 instead of directly from my system it does the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I delete the table that seems to be the problem when I first open the document the error seems to be moved onto other pages and always effects tables. Other tables usually have the data in them moved around. each part is not scrambled however, just all
 moved location. And again, I can't edit the table once it errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error happened before Christmas however I was rebuilding my system and formatting my boot drive; which required me to reinstall Office365 (which I hoped would fix it also and did not)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Included in the attempted fixes listed in the explanation above I have also tried to save the file to a different format, reopen and use the new format version. Load from HDD instead of SSD. Copying the table into a separate document (which does not appear
 to corrupt) and replacing the table with the copied (seemingly stable) table. Pasting a working table over a corrupted table. Replacing the corrupted table with older version of the table. Pasting the table into an older version of the document and leaving
 the document to just sit open with no interaction (Just to see if it would corrupt on its own).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In every case I am not editing the tables and instead revising earlier parts of the doc.</p>

            Assuming that the error message is correct, you can isolate the corruption to a particular table by systematically splitting the document into halves and resaving. That way, you'll be able to tell which half of the document continues to generate the error
 message.<br />

<h2>            When I open an e-mail in a new window and then delete, how can I automatically have the next e-mail open in the same window&#63;</h2>
                    I could do this in Thunderbird, but can't figure out if Outlook can do it.&nbsp; It was very handy not to have to click on the next e-mail and have it open in a new window.&nbsp; Every time I clicked on an e-mail to have it open in a new window, if I deleted the
 e-mail, it would automatically fill with the next window.&nbsp; This was so much quicker.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

            Actually I just stumbled upon the setting to do exactly this. The very last option in Options -&gt; Mail is gives you the option of close, next or previous when you delete an open email.<br />

<p>Your summary info says 365 Home, but you mention 2016 Pro Plus?&nbsp; Which is it?&nbsp; If Pro Plus, how did you get it, it is a VERY limited distribution office bundle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One work around is to start Outlook running as administrator. Let the configuration happen, then shutdown Outlook normally then restart windows to see if the fix is permanent.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I'm having is the micro SD card I have on my Surface 3 is constantly unmounting or unaccessible via certain apps like Music. I've have put a bunch of music on my micro SD card but when trying to use that as a library for Music it either doesn't
 show up or if in the case I have just reinserted the SD card it will play but only for about 10 seconds before an error occurs 0xc00d11cd (0x80004005)</p>
<p>
</p><p>ANy chance of having a look at the micro SD card drives, its seems to be an existing issue with Windows that a lot of people have problems with.</p>

<h3> jackibar2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrading to Office for Mac 2011 and Entourage Quesiton</h2>
                    I currently have Office for Mac 2008 and would like to upgrade to 2011, which I understand does not include Entourage any longer. &nbsp;That is fine. &nbsp;I don't use Entourage any more except for my archived emails.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What do I need to do when upgrading to make sure I can still open my current version of Entourage to access those emails? &nbsp;I'm assuming when I run the installer for the new version it will overwrite my current "Identities"... ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks so much for any help!</div>

<br />
You only need to purchase the H&amp;S version if you don't need Outlook for Mac.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003YCOJAI/?tag=enthelpag-20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Office for Mac 2011 Home &amp; Student</a> -Family Pack $99.99<br />
<br />
(Does not include Outlook. Only installs on 3 computers. You can continue to use Entourage with Word, Excel, PowerPoint 2011.) There is a one pack available if you only need to install on one computer.<br />

&nbsp; <br />
I suggest you move your data into Apple Mail so you will always have access to your archives. Look under File &gt; Import Mailboxes and select Entourage. Entourage has to be able to open for the import. Entourage works under Mountain Lion but eventually it will
 break with an OSX update. Moving your data to Mail will ensure that your data is always available.<br />

<h2>            Merging text cells by unique ID</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have a large document ~30,000 rows of posts from an online forum, in the spreadsheet they are all categorised by a unique id code to the poster, e.g. if one person posts two comments the ID on both will be 45 or their number. I am trying to merge
 all posts by each user into a single cell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As some users have ~400 comments I am looking for a formula or addon that will make this easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also using a mac and have version 15.38 of 2017 excel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Josh</p>

<p>Hi Joshua,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To combine the row text, we can use <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/CONCATENATE-function-8f8ae884-2ca8-4f7a-b093-75d702bea31d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
CONCATENATE function</a>. However, for such a large range of cells, manually filtering the ID then creating the formulas can be a tired work.
</p>
<p>For your requirement, we would suggest you post a new thread to the
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_excel-msoffice_custom?tab=Threads">
Office programing category</a> to see if they can help you better with the VBA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rena</p>

<span>I&nbsp;have created a table that only contains text, (it's a dictionary). I've made sure that every single cell in the table is formatted as text. However, certain cells are displayed as "#NAME?"
 and under the exclamation mark next to them, there is a text saying "</span><em>The formula contains unrecognized text.</em><span>".
 Two examples of the cells displaying "#NAME? instead of the entered text are: </span>
<strong>-goer</strong><span> and
</span><strong>-fold</strong><span> (including the dashes). The question is simple: how do I make Excel display my text and my text

            Thank you Ronaldo, that works. However it's only a workaround. This really seems like a bug, because the whole table is formatted as plain text and yet I keep getting this formula error. I mean, why should Excel think that I'm trying to use a formula if
 the cell is formatted as text..

            Not sure why it doesn't work for you. It works OK for me, I don't have to put the apostrophe in. Cell formatted as text just displays whatever I type into it.

Microsoft does have an Enterprise solution for PIM synchronization. Microsoft Exchange can sync your PIM information (including) between a Windows phone and a server. Microsoft My Phone is a consumer service only.<br />

Currently, the service is available to sync only with Microsoft servers. <br />
All syncronizations with MyPhone servers are done using security protocols and users data are always private.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 preview - install on separate partition&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm quite computer savvy so know my way round a Windows installer. Can I use the ISO to install the Windows 10 Tech Preview onto a separate partition and dual-boot with my existing Windows 7 (SP1) install (assuming I burn it to DVD first) ?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Rather than use a partition, why don't you install it on a VHD. It will look and act like it is installed on a partition but if you want to blow it away all you have to do is delete the VHD. No need to play with partitions if you don't want to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>here is one example of how to do it - <a href="http://henkhoogendoorn.blogspot.com/2011/09/guide-to-install-windows-8-on-vhd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>I just finished setting up a Multiboot with Windows 8.1. You should be able to with Windows 7 as well. I created a separate partition on my SSD boot drive for Win10. Then I downloaded the ISO for Win10. I used the Windows 7 DVD/USB Boot Tool (<a href="http://download.cnet.com/Windows-7-USB-DVD-Download-Tool/3000-18513_4-10972600.html)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.cnet.com/Windows-7-USB-DVD-Download-Tool/3000-18513_4-10972600.html)</a>
 to extract the ISO onto my 16GB USB (must be 4GB+). After the USB Tool finished creating my boot drive, I restarted my computer. VERY IMPORTANT. DO NOT SIMPLY RUN SETUP SINCE IT WILL OVERWRITE YOUR CURRENT OS. I NEARLY DID THIS BEFORE I REALIZED SOMETHING
 FISHY WAS GOING ON. You must restart and boot into the USB drive. Then you will be given the regular Windows installer window. Choose where to install and accept all the agreements and such. You will then be presented with a VERY nice Multiboot GUI screen
 to select what version to boot into.</p>
<p>Again, this is working fine for me with Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 TP. Windows 7 should be absolutely no different since you are installing a newer version of Windows. If you were trying to install an older version (say Vista or XP), it would be a different
 story.</p>

            I plan on doing this as well after work, however I always come across issues.<br />
<br />
Shrinking a drive is a pain in Windows Vista and newer. because of the issue with "unmovable files"&nbsp;<br />
......<br />
Love how i got 250GB free space but can only shrink... 6GB......<br />
*sigh* yes there's ways around it... just hate how windows can't do it using disk management<br />
(BTW yes, i've done disk cleanup and defrag and reboot and even cmd defrag commands and only increased it to ~20GB... where's my other 230GB?)<br />
<br />
However i'm doing this on my surface pro 2, so I'm going to write the ISO to a flash drive and install it that way on a separate partition instead of DVD.&nbsp;<br />

            Just run Hyper-V and install it on a Virtual Machine instead. Much easier. It took about 30 minutes start to finish to get up and running on the 10 Tech preview that way.

            <p>Question: That nice multiboot GUI screen, does that just replace the previous bootloader? I currently have a dual boot with Win7 and Ubuntu, and tomorrow I plan to install the preview.&nbsp; Will the Grub loader installed by Ubuntu simply be replaced by the pretty
 new windows Multiboot GUI? Any thoughts on whether it'll have issues with the Ubuntu install?</p>

            <p>Assuming&nbsp;your current OS and the Windows version you want to install share the same architecture (32-bits/64-bits) you can just run the executable "setup.exe" from the "sources" folder within the ISO.</p>
<p>

</p><p>It is good to take a backup of each account if you may have to setup email accounts separately again. I would recommend you to make a backup of each account to a .pst file. Refer the below article to know how to move .pst and ost file to different locations.</p>

<h2>            Word 2010 Macros disappear when Word is closed</h2>
                    
<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>I've been using Word since the beginning of time and using simple macros in Word to increase efficiency.&nbsp; I recently upgraded (or downgraded) to Word 2010 and now the macros disappear when I close Word.&nbsp; I've checked everywhere to fix this annoyance and&nbsp;changed
 the&nbsp;Trust Centre settings to enable macros, made sure I'm saving them in the correct template, even checked the add-ins.&nbsp; What was once a simple and elegant little function has morphed into a complicated labryinth of settings.&nbsp; I thought software upgrades
 were to make the process more intuitive and simple but here I've spent over an hour trying to find a solution.&nbsp; The 90 days of support for Office is a joke. After phoning in to 1-800-668-7975 I went through 10 questions&nbsp;with the 'electronic host. ' Finally
 you get a person who refers you to the Word Professional support person who then tells you to go to a website and search the forums. I've been a support of Microsoft products for years but I think this is the beginning of the end for Microsoft. Windows 7 is
 certainly a big improverement over the last two OSs but Office Word 2010 is a pain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Word 2010 stores macros in the same manner as earlier versions - in templates, documents and by default the normal template.<br />
If you have an old normal.dot file with your macros from an earlier Word version, rename the Word 2010 normal template (normal.dotm) to oldnormal.dotm with Word closed.<br />
Put the old normal.dot file in the same folder as oldnormal.dotm and restart Word. Word will read the old template and create a new normal template. From Word Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Save - Check the option to prompt to save the normal template (and preferably
 the option to create backups). Close Word and you should get a prompt to save the normal template. Save it!<br />
Remove the old normal.dot from the folder and restart Word. Your macros should be available. Whether they will work correctly in Word 2010 rather depends on what they do.<br />
If you don't have an old normal.dot file - just complete the other steps. You will have to add macros to the resulting template.<br />
By default the Word Startup and User Templates folders are trusted folders. If you have moved those locations from the default settings you will need to add the folders to the trusted folders list.</p>

<h2>            Error Code 85010014</h2>
                    
<p>Please Help!</p>
<p>More than one month ago I encountered&nbsp; this error when I tried to sync my outlook.com calendar and contacts. My local Nokia Care reset the phone (LUMIA 920) and 3 days later the same error appeared. I do not want to go through the same trouble resetting
 again, setting up everything etc. My primary email account with live.com works fine sending and receiving&nbsp; mails but it can not sync. Microsoft told me that if this account works fine, I have to turn to NOKIA to resolve the issue. I have tried all the proposed
 solutions I saw in the net. No joy! At a pinch I would not mind to perform a 3rd reset (!) provided I could save first my contacts and calendar so I could reinstall them.</p>

            hi mate, have you checked you are up to date with the latest version of firmware for your device, and the latest Nokia system app updates from the Store? also check your Microsoft account at
<a href="http://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.live.com</a> and see if there appears to be anything wrong at the backend.

            Hi Sam<br />
<br />
Say hello to Melina!<br />
<br />
Found it hard to find because i think it had been moved from the PowerPoint Forum. Whoever did this - not a good idea, even though it might seem logical. PowerPoint coders hang out first in the main forum.<br />
<br />
I think the code comes from earlier version and doesn't expect the new layout of the slide master.<br />
<br />
This should work for you I think:<br />
<br />
Sub fontSwap()<br />
Dim objDes As Design<br />
Dim objCL As Object<br />
Dim objSM As Object<br />
<br />
On Error Resume Next<br />
ActivePresentation.Fonts.Replace Original:="Rockwell", Replacement:="Arial"<br />
For Each objDes In ActivePresentation.Designs<br />
Set objSM = objDes.SlideMaster<br />
Call fixfontMaster(objSM)<br />
For Each objCL In objDes.SlideMaster.CustomLayouts<br />
Call fixfontMaster(objCL)<br />
Next objCL<br />
Next objDes<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Sub fixfontMaster(obj As Object)<br />
Dim oshp As Shape<br />
For Each oshp In obj.Shapes<br />
If oshp.HasTextFrame Then<br />
If oshp.TextFrame.TextRange.Font.Name = "Rockwell" Then _<br />
oshp.TextFrame.TextRange.Font.Name = "Arial"<br />
End If<br />
Next<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />

<p>I would like to be able to add a new client when their information is not found a combo box that references the client table.&nbsp; I would prefer not to have the user move to a different form to enter that data.&nbsp; I have been experimenting with the NotInList

<p>Note:&nbsp; The user is already working on a form that shows the key client information that must be entered - I would like them to be able to add the new information from there.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
<div>Well in the typical case when there's just one field you want to enter, such as last name, then you can pop up a little message box in the person can type that value in.&nbsp; The problem if you're going to prompt for few field values, what happens if you prompt
 for one field, and after they hit OK and they have additional fields to be prompted for they realize that just made a mistake? I think it's quite obvious in the case where there's going to be more than one field entered, then I think you have no realistic
 choice but to throw up a form for the user to edit enter and look at the data before they hit OK. This also makes the user feel more in control, and the worst thing you can do is build some software where the user enters one value hits OK and then cannot go
 back and edit it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let the user enter the data, look at it, sip on their coffee, and make sure they're perfectly happy and the they can hit OK. In other words if the user cannot edit what they'd just entered, you're going to make life quite difficult for them. You really
 can't edit data much else then using a form.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would thus suggest that you build a nice little form based on the two or three fields that you want to be edible by the user. You can then tie this little form into the not in list event. If the user answers yes to the NotInList event to add a new record,
 you pop open the little form. Furthermore at this point the user will no doubt have used a lot of forms in the past, and presenting something familiar to them allows them to work with great ease and not have to learn some different kind of system of doing
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Before I Post any more code, I should point out that access 2010 has the ability for you to specify what form will manage the data for combo box, and thus you can manage their list of values in a combo box without having to write any code it all. About
 the only thing I don't like about the built in feature is it allows the user to edit existing values, and you might not want that (however, in many applications users are Encouraged to clean up those lists and in fact this edit list ability is exactly what
 is wanted. However I'm just pointing out that you can specify a form to manage the list of data in 2010 without any code at all.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Anway, when you use a form, it is still very easy to have ms-access do ALL of the extra work and heaving lifting work for you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here is what I use when I need a form:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Private Sub Distributee_NotInList(NewData As String, Response As Integer)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; if MsgBox("Do you want to add this value to the list?", _</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vbYesNo) then</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DoCmd.OpenForm "frmAddClient", , , , acFormAdd, acDialog, NewData</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response = acDataErrAdded</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; Else</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Response = acDataErrContinue</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; End If</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>End Sub</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note that by setting response = acDataErrAdded, then ms-access does a </div>
<div>re-load, and a re-query of the comb box list for you. In other words, quite </div>
<div>a bit of stuff happens to ensue that the combo box is re-loaded, and re-set.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>However I've just been talking about trying to make your application a little bit more user friendly, therefore whne the frmAddClient loads, we should put in the NewData value into the correct field so the user does not have to re-type it. (and it helps
 the user "see" things a lot better". So,in our forms on-load event, we will take the value of NewData, and set the correct field. The code for this is:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>if isnull(me.OpenArgs) = false then</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; me.CompanyName = me.Openargs</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>endif</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>That is all you need. So, now the form will be opened, and the not in list value</div>
<div>will be entered into the form, and user can then enter rest of information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, to make life a bit easier to your users,</div>
<div>there are a good number of things you should set in frmAddClent to make life</div>
<div>better.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>They are:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Set the forms "cycle" property to current. This means the cursor when on the</div>
<div>bottom of the screen at the last field it does not jump to another record. It</div>
<div>is horrible when a user bumps the tab key, and access goes to another</div>
<div>record (if they bump the page down or tab to the next record, the screen</div>
<div>goes blank and users think all the information was just lost when what</div>
<div>occurred is they simply moved to new record which you don't want).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Set the forms cycle property (other tab) to current. In fact,</div>
<div>this is a good setting for most forms, and NOT just this add example.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since this is just a add form, then turn off the record navigation at the</div>
<div>bottom, as again this serves only to confuse the user.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Further, turn off the forms ability to "add new" records. Yes, you read this</div>
<div>100% correct. You want turn off the forms allow additions property. The</div>
<div>reason for this is that the above "open" form will OVER RIDE this setting.</div>
<div>This is ideal, since once again, hitting page/down key, or even the mouse</div>
<div>wheel will not cause the form to jump to another record, and confuse the</div>
<div>heck out of the user (this is along the same lines as the tab key setting</div>
<div>above as per "cycle" setting).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note if you need this form to do "double duty" and want to use it in other</div>
<div>places in the application to allow the user will add MORE THEN ONE record at</div>
<div>a time, then put the following in the forms on open</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>if isnull(me.OpenArgs) = false then</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; me.Company = me.Openargs</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; me.AllowAdditions = false</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; Me.NavigationButtons = False</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>endif</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>That way, this form can be used else where in the application, but for our combo</div>
<div>box, the navigation buttons, and accidental adding of MORE THEN one record</div>
<div>will not occur.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>All in all, you don't have to do any of the additional suggestions I include</div>
<div>but just use the initial not in list code. However, the additional tips are</div>
<div>just polish that make your application a lot more slick and user friendly.</div>

<h2>            Nokia 6500s Firmware update to version 7.12</h2>
                    Just updated today! Works perfectly! I had problems with the phone randomly switching off if someone sent me a text whilst I was listening to music when the music player was locked (if that makes sense). However, this is sorted now!<br />
<br />
I upgraded from 4.84.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else noticed any differences? Has anyone found ay problems?

</p><p>It is only the MS ID log on page that does not support autofill.&nbsp; Microsoft has not replied to whether this is by design or a bug to be fixed. Guess we all will have to wait and see.&nbsp; The me too is for the log on to this site but who know perhaps MS will
 require a MS ID to log into this forum &lt;g&gt;</p>

            <p>I have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Forum Moderators and Community Moderators here cannot fix this bug. Only Microsoft developers can fix this bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps to report this problem to Microsoft developers ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to this page:&nbsp; http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/id-support<br />
<br />
2. Click on "I am having trouble signing in"<br />
<br />
3. A page will open where you can describe the problem signing in (i.e., auto-complete not working when typing the first few characters of your ID into the new Microsoft Account sign in page).<br />
<br />
4. Click the Submit button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will get email with a case number. Then you may get email with a scripted reply telling you to enable auto-complete in your browser. Verify that auto-complete is working in your browser by signing on to other sites you use (such as netflix,
 gmail, facebook, etc and typing the first few characters of your ID). Then respond to the email you received and tell them that auto-complete works on other sites ... it just does not work on the new Microsoft Account sign in page. Be persistent and eventually
 your case will get escalated to a higher level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If enough people complain, Microsoft will fix this problem.</p>

            <p>This is sort-of useful. But many of us don't have time to waste on these things.
</p>
<p>With all the other new problems in Hotmail, Outlook etc... it has become easier to leave Outlook and Microsoft altogether.<br />

            <p>Cynicidal Couchpotato,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This bug has been going on since the new Sign On page was deployed around March 24.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reported the bug here (in Microsoft Community), on the UserVoice site, and on the Answer Desk site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has acknowledged that the behavior in the new Sign On page (lack of support for auto-complete) is a bug, but all they will say is "we are working on it".</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you said, the old Sign On page supported auto-complete ... so Microsoft already has code to fix this bug .... how long can it take to put the old code back in, test it, and deploy it&nbsp; .... or better yet, just restore the old Sign On page.</p>

            This obviously isn't a bug but rather a security decision by Microsoft. &nbsp;I disagree with the decision, but it's still just that. &nbsp;As far as "fixing" the code, the code that blocks autofill is pretty much just 2 words (autocomplete = "off") and if you remove
 the words it allows autofill without affecting anything else. &nbsp;So it is really a pretty simple thing they have done. &nbsp;I've taken care of this on my Mac using Tampermonkey with Chrome (Greasemonkey with Firefox) and an extremely short script. &nbsp;The first part
 is just the basic script header. &nbsp;The actual script is literally 2 short lines which remove the part of the code that turns off autofill:<br />
<br />
// ==UserScript==<br />
// @name &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft Autofill<br />
// @namespace &nbsp; &nbsp;http://tampermonkey.net/<br />
// @version &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;1.0<br />
// @description &nbsp;Fix Hotmail<br />

// @match &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;https://login.live.com/*<br />
// @grant &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;none<br />
// ==/UserScript==<br />
<br />
var elmLink = document.getElementById('i0281');<br />
elmLink.removeAttribute('autocomplete');
