    <title>Preparing Automatic Updates then black screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Preparing Automatic Updates then black screen</h2>
                    <p>I have a Sony laptop running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the other day, my computer wasn't responding (ctrl+alt+del didn't work) so I held the power button for a reboot. Once it turned back on, it showed the "preparing automatic updates" screen for a minute or two and then switched to a black screen. Note that
 is not a loop. Is this what it's supposed to be doing, or did something go horribly wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I'll just let my computer do what it is doing............</p>

<h2>            Product key doesn&#39;t show 20 digits</h2>
                    Hi, I am about to reinstall win 8.1 from back up dvd. From various posts I came to know that 25 digit product key is essential for successful installation of windows. But in control panel, under system , view basic information about your computer heading,
 the message windows is activated and below it 20 digit alphanumeric string is given as product id. I wish to know whether this is same as product key and I can use this id in reinstallation process. Thanks

</p><p>That key should work with the version of windows that you have installed.&nbsp; Just makes sure you install the same version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW I am unsure what you mean by backup dvd.&nbsp; If you want to install windows you need to do it from a windows dvd.&nbsp;

            The above may be possible. But, unless you give us some Infos about your game (name, release date, possibly: CD-version or downloaded, etc.etc.), we're poking about in the fog. "An older game program" isn't a really helpful description...

            <p>Hi,.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those lines suggest either Graphics Driver corruption or failing Graphics Hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should&nbsp;have had a problem using that Laptop with Windows 7 right from the start</p>
<p>Dell supplies no Windows 7 Drivers for it and offers no Support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dell supplies Drivers&nbsp;up to Vista for it, but not Windows 7.</p>
<p>Vista Drivers will sometimes work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            You can execute following to gain space on your computer
<br />
<br />1. Use Storage Sense to delete unnecessary files
<br />Type Storage in Windows Start Search Box &gt; Click Storage &gt; Click Change how we free up space &gt; Down below there is button Clean now under Free up space now which you should press
<br />
<br />2. Use Disk Cleanup
<br />Type Disk Cleanup in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Disk Cleanup &gt; Check relevant options (you can also clean system files)
<br />
<br />3. Analyze disk space
<br />You should analyze your existing space with help of third party softwares and remove un-necessary files. TreeSize is most popular one but my personal favorite is WinDirStat.
<br />
<br />TreeSize Freeware version - <a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />
<br />WinDirStat (Released under GPL license) - <a href="https://windirstat.net/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windirstat.net/download.html</a>
<br />
<br />4. Check for log files in CBS directory
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Check the size of CBS.Log and if size is huge &gt; 
<br />Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Delete all of the files in the CBS folder (or rename and move to a backup drive) &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update. 
<br />
<br />5. Microsoft has also some suggestions to improve disk space.

            <pre>Problem 1: Lack of free space.
Press Windows key + R
Type: C:\Windows\Logs\CBS
Hit Enter
Delete any log files found in that folder.
Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage
Under Storage sense, click Free up space now
Wait while it scans for temporary files.
Check any location with large amounts of space.
Click Remove files.
Also see how you can use TreeSize to find and free up space:
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/
Search through any folders that might be on your desktop that might be taking up space. 
Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

            Hi Jennifer.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can use one of these tools to see a graphical image of the disk space usage to try to pinpoint the problem:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/113012/10-best-free-tools-to-analyze-hard-drive-space-on-your-windows-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/113012/10-best-free-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Check also in C:\Windows\logs\CBS if there is an inflated CBS log of multiple gb size as this is a known issue.
<br />
<br />There are tips here for managing smaller drives: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

<p>Example:</p>
<p>Steve Miller - Book Of Dreams</p>
<p>The song Jet Airliner is preceded by an intro (called Threshold) which rips to a separate file because the CD says they are separate tracks even though they&nbsp;play together seamlessly as one song.&nbsp; This creates a very frustrating situation when using the shuffle

 which I also want to deal with.&nbsp; I am willing to re-rip my affected music if neccessary.&nbsp; I just need someone to show me how.</p>

There are downloadable programs on the net for joining files <br />

have...you can import the two MP3 files into Movie Maker...</p>
<p>Drag the two files to the Audio/Music track...</p>
<p>Be sure to drag both files to the left to eliminate any open areas<br />
before or between the files.</p>
<p>Go to...File / Save Movie File...Next / Next / Next...the result <br />
will be a single WMA file.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Photos app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aunt violet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Photos app</h2>
                    <p>Hello to everyone!</p>
<p>First of all I'd like to apologize if it's not the right place to post my question.</p>
<p>I don't like Windows 10 photos app at all, but I use it only to transfer quickly my photos from my camera memory card to my computer. I have managed to select the folder where the photos must be transferred, but the app automatically put the date where they
 were taken as a title. It's fine, but the date is written like in USA, that is&nbsp; year, month, day. I'd like, if possible to have it written as we are familiar to dates in Europe, that is year, day, month. Could you tell me if it's possible and how? Thank you.</p>
<p>Then another question, how could I delete from the app all the automatic albums and everything, without deleting all the pictures from my hard disk?</p>
<p>I have my own created folders for my photos and, as said above, I use photos app only for transferring photos from my camera.</p>
<p>Thank you again in advance for your help.</p>

            Hi Aunt
<br />
<br />Honestly, the functionality of the Photos App does not suit your needs, and that functionality in the Photos App cannot be changed . . .
<br />
<br />You should stop using that and transfer your files into your PC manually, you will have much more control over the process
<br />
<br />When all else fails, the manual approach is your best option to transfer the files, the built in Photos App can be a bit unreliable, and you will have more control over the files are transferred . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Windows Fie Explorer (folder icon on your Taskbar) 
<br />
<br />On the left click 'This PC' 
<br />
<br />On the right double click the SD Card/Camera or the DCIM folder (whichever shows up) 
<br />
<br />Then simple select the files you want to transfer and drag them into the Pictures folder in the left pane of File Explorer 
<br />
<br />That's it!

<p>You are absolutely right, Dave!</p>
<p>Unfortunately often Windows impose changes on us, which rarely improve our habits. The trend is deciding&nbsp; at our place how we can organise our folders and so on. I remember how easy and satisfying was importing pictures from my camera in Windows 7 and even
 in XP, without all those useless functions of the new app. Luckily we are not all completely addicted to social networks and we might simply be interested in working on our photography in a professional or semi-professional way.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful day and thank you for answering and confirming what I had thought.</p>

                    Windows 8 RP and CP worked just fine with the Windows 7 touchscreen driver for NextWindow Voltron touch screen, but in Windows 8 for OEM the functionality is gone, even after driver installation. This is a common touchscreen(HP, Dell, Gateway AIOs, etc),
 and as stated it worked with all betas.&nbsp; Would anybody know of a solution?

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can verify that, but for a different computer. The problem is the OEM version!!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I found in the Support section:</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>"System builder versions of Windows 8 require Windows 8-certified hardware to enable touch."</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>So, there is a difference of the OEM and Upgrade oder Retail versions. By reading other posts, it seems, that it's controlled by differnet licence keys, not by different release versions...</p>
<p>That's why it worked in Preview versions and work in the Upgrade versions too without problems, but not in OEM - it's just "restricted"... &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 activation voided after replacing motherboard - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 activation voided after replacing motherboard</h2>
                    Hello, I had windows 10 installed from the free upgrade a few months ago, and recently my motherboard died so I had to replace it. After replacing it, I get a windows activation error. I found my pc's original product key in the registry and entered it,
 but some of the characters are invalid. Help would be greatly appreciated.

            <p>It will invalidate it if the previous qualifying license from which you upgraded is an OEM Windows 7 or 8 license which came preinstalle with previous motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If its retail license, try reactivating by telephone:</p>
<p>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> then click<strong>Run</strong>, then type:
<strong>slui.exe 4</strong></p>
<p>2. Next press the 'ENTER' key</p>
<p>3. Select your 'Country' from the list.</p>
<p>4. Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.</p>
<p>5. Stay on the phone (do not select/press any options) and wait for a person to help you with activation.</p>
<p>6. Explain your problem clearly to the support person.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

<h2>            IPconfig doesn&#39;t display wireless adapter data</h2>
                    I was wanting to look at my ipconfig data and all the tunneling devices were listed as disconnected. There were no other items listed. The data about my wireless adapter was not displayed, nothing about the default gateway, or subnet mask etc...&nbsp; What
 could be wrong? I could go online and browse like I should but no information about ip addresses was displayed.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>If the Wireless card is Off, or its Drivers are Not installed corretly No data will be displayed.</p>
<p><strong>Try this.</strong></p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wireless card entry.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a></p>
<p>If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wireless card's Drivers.</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Wireless Network Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Make sure that if there is a vendor's Wireless Utility the utility is Not Running together with the Windows native Wireless utility.</strong></p>
<p>Make sure that No Firewall is preventing/blocking the Wireless components to get to the Network.</p>
<p><em><strong>If everything above is OK and it is not connecting to the Wireless router. Log from any computer that is, or can be connected to Wireless Router with a Wire, disable the Wireless Security, make sure that the Wireless broadcast is On, and try
 to connect with No Wireless security</strong> </em>.</p>
<p><strong>When working turn On the Wireless security.</strong></p>
<p>*Note, People sometimes make mistakes in writing and retyping the security passphrase.</p>
<p>Alternative way is to copy it from the Router's menu, and then paste when asked by the Wireless card.</p>
<p><strong>---------------------</strong></p>
<p><strong>Working TCP/IP stack should look this way.</strong></p>
<p>TCP/IP and its variables typically look like this.</p>
<p>Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/status-nic.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/status-nic.jpg</a></p>
<p>Description is the card manufacturing data.</p>
<p>Physical address is the card's MAC number.</p>
<p>The xx should be a number from 0 to 255 (all xx same number).</p>
<p>yy should be from 0 to 255</p>
<p>zz should be from 0 to 255 (all zz the same number.</p>
<p>The lease date should be valid to the current time.</p>
<p>*Note 1. IP that starts with 169.xxx.xxx.xxx is not valid functional IP.</p>
<p>*Note 2. There might be an IPv6 entries too. However, they are not functional for Internet traffic or LAN. They are needed for Win 7 special HomeGroup configuration.</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 S Wireless Connection</h2>
                    
<p>No clue if anyone else has experienced this before, but I've noticed that whenever I turn my Xbox 360 on, it will sign me in, but every time I try to connect to Xbox Live, it fails. It works after I do a connection test, though. I've tried different networks,
 also. Same result. Any tips?</p>

<p>And post back your details in full (the bits that are in bold on that post) so that people may help</p>
<p>If you are wireless can you also state whether you are using the white or black external adapter or the Xbox 360S Internal adapter</p>

<p>I'm using the internal wireless adapter that's built-in the Xbox 360 S</p>
<p>No, there isn't any issues with Xbox Live that I know of that would be affecting my connection to Xbox Live.</p>
<p>I haven't been banned on Xbox Live, before, and I can assure you that I am not banned now. I can connect, but only after running a connection test, which passes every time (Including just now).</p>

            Hi<strong> tomdeevh</strong> ,<br />
<br />

I tried both the updates and the Surface Toolkit. Nothing changed.....still getting the same amount (1.5-2%/hr) of battery drain while shutdown.

<p>I have tried everything on your list except for reset. I just ran the battery troubleshooter and it indicated that sleep was taking longer than expected to close down - which is strange because I had gotten rid of sleep. It no longer shows on my start-up
 options. However the troubleshooter stated that the longer than expected sleep was fixed. I am now waiting to see if the battery drain is resolved / diminished. I will let you know.</p>

<p><span>Hi Rick88,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Windows Vista Answers Forums!</span></p>
<p><span>You may try the following steps and check whether you are able to backup files.</span></p>
<p><span>First try to disable the Antivirus and Security Software temporarily and check.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Then try to
<span>try to <strong>perform a clean boot</strong> and verify if any of the services or startup items is causing this issue. To perform a clean boot we will have to run System Configuration Utility.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To perform clean boot, follow the steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click
<strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>msconfig</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. On the
<strong>General tab</strong>, click <strong>Selective Startup</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Under
<strong>Selective Startup</strong>, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Click the
<strong>Services tab</strong>, click to select the <strong>Hide All Microsoft Services</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>Disable All</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Click
<strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. When you are prompted, click
<strong>Restart</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. After the computer starts verify whether you are able to do backup.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If
<span>&nbsp;</span>your <span>&nbsp;</span>issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot, then follow the steps mentioned in the following KB article to narrow down the exact source:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also, see the section on how to return your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps under “Reset the computer
 to start as usual”.</span></span></p>
<p><span>For more information on this error, refer the following link:</span></p>

    <title>How can I remove the RealPlayer program from my computer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sandybc  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I remove the RealPlayer program from my computer&#63;</h2>
                    While trying to update RealPlayer to the latest version. While updating my laptop suddenly went into a blue screen.&nbsp;
<div>The blue screen told me to restart it and if it came back to do something else. Well I restarted my laptop and everything seemed to be fine except I can not remove RealPlayer anymore.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I've tried doing it through control panel but I get a message that says"Uninstaller Shell executable has stopped working" "A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if i a solution is available"&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any way this program can continue to work properly and be removed?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Windows 7 laptop - Toshiba Satellite L635&nbsp;</div>
<div>And the version of RealPlayer is shown as 15.0.6 by RealNetworks in the programs list&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

<p>Is there a way to move the scrollbar from the bottom to the right side of the menu window of Windows Explorer? My old Windows 2000 had it on the right.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><span>Hi beelloyd,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you have the scroll bar at the bottom on all the Explorer windows?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you maximized the window?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have resized Windows Explorer or any window and have made it appear small, try maximizing the window by clicking the “<strong>Maximize</strong>”
 button and check if it helps. You will see the scroll bar on the right or the bottom of the window depending upon the size of the window and the content.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Microsoft Pop-Up wont go away - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amanda sage  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Pop-Up wont go away</h2>
                    I am using windows vista on a new dell computer.&nbsp; I've asked the computer to ask my permission to allow updates &amp; programs to run.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
A box will pop-up, several times during a computing session, stating that Microsoft is trying to run a program, csc.exe, from Microsoft Publishing, do you wish the program to run.&nbsp; I don't know what the program is.&nbsp; Whether I tell it to run or not, the box
 keeps popping up &amp; asking if the same program can run.<br />
<br />
Can you tell me what csc.exe is?<br />
Can you tell me how to stop the box from popping up?<br />
<br />
Thank you.

<p><span>Hi Amanda Sage,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Windows Vista answers forum.</span></p>
<p><span>The file csc.exe uses Microsoft .Net Framework, if there are any issues with the .Net Framework installed
 on the computer then we might see an error to run the program csc.exe.</span></p>
<p><span>You can check if there is any Microsoft .Net Framework update available in Windows Updates and install it
 if available.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists after installing the Microsoft .Net Framework update, then you can probably try
 to remove all the previous versions of Microsoft .Net Framework from the computer and then re-install them on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>To remove all the previous versions of Microsoft .Net Framework
</span><span>download the .Net Framework cleanup tool and run it to remove ".Net Framework - All Versions" and then restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Link to download .Net Framework cleanup tool:<br />
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/attachment/8904493.ashx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/attachment/8904493.ashx</span></span></strong></a></span></p>
<p><span>After restart run Windows Updates to re-install all the versions of .Net Framework on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>The error should not pop up again after re-installing all the versions of .Net Framework on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Please let us know if it helps.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />
