<h2>            Windows 10 install &#40;Sits at 0&#37; while coping files&#41;</h2>
                    <p>OMG I really hate Windows 10. I think I am about to just give up on it and go back to Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off I hate cortana. So I deleted her. It messed up a lot of search options. Why the hell it searches the internet when I am typing in a program Name on my computer drove me up the wall. Anyways cortana seems so ingrained with windows 10 that lots of
 stuff just stopped working. And I couldn't just restore her. Looks like once you delete the permissions of trusted installer you can't re-add them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I decided to re-install the OS. And can't get it to work. Like I just had Windows 10 installed on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I couldn't get the installer to even recognize my NVME raid. It would just die while loading the drivers. So I deleted the raid, and re-created it. Than it at least started to recognize it. Than it failed to partition the raid. So I ran diskpart
 using SHIFT+F10. And cleaned all the drives with no problems. Than I go to install the OS. And it just hangs on Windows setup. Copying Windows Files (0%) for hours. Been bashing my head on this stupid crap for far to long. Like 2 days now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an NVME raid setup with 7 m.2 cards in it. All running at raid 0. I can reformat every single drive individually. And run diskpart/clean on each one just fine. But it just hangs when I try to format them as a raid. I recreated the USB boot drive like
 10 times so I don't think its that. Hell the usb worked on a different computer last week. A computer I built for my brother.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing different from the first install and the second is what PCI exspress lanes the m.2 cards are installed. Originally I had two of them in the dim.2 slot. One on the mother board and 4 in the 3rd PCI express x16 slot. But latter on I added another
 GPU. So I split the 4 m.2 drives up. Only 2 in each of the PCI slots 2 and 4. As those only had 8 lanes each. This is so I can maximize the PCI lanes in use. This worked fine even without re-installing the OS. It was only after I got feed up with cortana,
 and broke her that all this **** started happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a threadripper machine that I spent way to much money on. Built this just so I could play around with DirectX 12. But I am hating windows 10 so much. I am about to just give up. And try windows 7 on it. I really don't get what I am missing. Maybe
 I should try an older version of Windows 10 on the USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The forced windows updates. And this cortana ****. Plus the **** windows bar with **** tiles in it. Got to be one of the worst window OSes out there. But it is the only one that supports DirectX12. So I am trying to put up with it. But it only makes me hate
 it more.</p>

<p>So no suggestion on why it just sits at 0% while copying windows files on the install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a microsoft owned and operated window based website. With options that I selected to help narrow down the problem. That I am getting. Just so I can get the **** install to work. If the website can't do that. It will only be like every other ****
 false advertised thing out there.</p>

</p><p>This is an install of Win 10 problem. How the hell you don't understand that. And are trying to give a solution is beyond me. I am not giving feedback. I am not updating. I am reformatting the whole **** OS. Because I **** up cortana. It is 100% clear

<h2>            Desktop Window Manager causing Display Driver to constantly crash during games.</h2>
                    <p>Hey, sorry if this is in the wrong section, wasn't really sure where this belonged.<br />
<br />
I'll start off by explaining the problem first and then post all the technical stuff after.<br />
<br />
I did a clean re-install of Windows 10 about a month ago and ever since then have been running into a problem with trying to play any games. Basically what happens is I will be in game (the amount of time the game will last before it crashes is irratic lasting
 from a few minutes to several hours) and then the screen will go black and then put me back to the desktop. A message will appear saying the "Display Driver stopped responding and has recovered". After this point a few different things have occured.<br />
<br />
1: It will begin to flash several times with the mouse replaced with the loading cog and then will log out leaving me at the log in screen.<br />
<br />
2: It will do the same as above but the Display Driver has corrupted and needs to be reinstalled.<br />
<br />
3: The monitor loses connection to the computer and requires to restart and 80% of the time the Display Driver has corrupted and requires to be reinstalled.<br />
<br />
This has happened to every single game I have played except for Stellaris which I was able to run for 4 hours with no problems.<br />
Besides Stellaris it has crashed on every single game I have run so far including Arma 3, Pollen, Guns of Icarus Online/Alliance, Elder Scrolls Online, Project Cars and Dark Souls III.<br />
<br />
<strong>Fixes I have tried:</strong><br />
* Clean reinstall of Graphics Driver.<br />
* sfc /scannow (No issues were found).<br />
* Virus and malware scans (No malicious content found).<br />
* Flashed bios update (Success but no effect).</p>
<p>* MemTest (1 pass, No errors).</p>
<p>* Downgrading Drivers.</p>
<p>* Disabling any overlays and capturing software.</p>
<p>* Hard Drive scan (Smart scans passed).</p>

            <p>To test graphic card there is several tools:</p>
<p>With GPU-Z you can monitor temperature and monitor Video engine. For that purpose download some 4K video</p>
<p>from YouTube open GPU-Z and play that video &nbsp;with Windows 10 app Movie &amp; TV. Look in Task manager CPU
</p>
<p>utilization.</p>
<p>With Aida64 you can control many characteristics, one of them is &nbsp;OpenGL Compliancy. All versions for your card</p>
<p>must be 100%.</p>
<p>Good hardware monitoring tool is HW64info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion your graphic card is OK, I am suspicious about your PSU Corsair CX600. It has only one 12V rail</p>
<p>46A , it is not enough for 130W CPU and 190W video card plus HDDs and other devices.</p>
<p>It would be good to try this: Set your graphic card to Silent mode 910 MHz (it is now on 980 MHz, it is Gaming mode)</p>
<p>and try to play some games. If the crashing is rare try to borrow 750W PSU and work few hours with it.</p>

<h2>            windows media player makes squeaking noise like tape being re-wound</h2>
                    Hello.<br />
<br />
I use a Windows 7 Home Basic 64 Bit Toshiba Satellite Laptop. <br />
<br />
I've noticed that everytime I try to play an avi file on windows media player it makes a high pitched squeaky sound like a tape being re-winded and there is no audio, although the picture still shows.
<br />
<br />
When I tried to play the same avi file on another laptop similar to mine ( Windows 7 Home Basic 64 Bit) the avi file played normally ( both audio and video quality were fine).
<br />
<br />
I've been told that this is a codec problem, and I'd like to know what I can do about it.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Magic Duels - Achievements not unlocking&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Is this happening for anyone else currently? Not sure if it's just this game, something to do with my network connection, or what.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the course of the last couple of hours, I've unlocked three achievements for Magic Duels. However, when I fulfill their criteria, I'm not getting the pop up notification that I usually do. When I go to my home screen and check my Achievements tab and
 look at the game, it shows those three as 100%, but still locked and greyed out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My console's connected to the internet and it's showing all my connections as fine. Not sure what the problem could be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is definitely weird. Two of the achievements that wouldn't unlock for me were "Necromancer's Assistant" and "Solo Battler". I went back and did what was required for each of them again, and they quietly unlocked. (No pop up notification, they just showed
 up in my achievements list). I've since unlocked several other achievements straight away, as normal with no trouble, but the "Millstone" one continues to show as 100%, but still locked and greyed out.
</p>
<p>I'll try going back and fulfilling the requirements again and see if it'll unlock. Curious if anyone is experiencing similar problems in other games, or if it's limited just to this one.

<p>Yup, just tried it again, and Millstone popped. Strange. Oh well, I guess things are back to normal, it seems.

    <title>Question about aspect ratio for BF3. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ctk iz sick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question about aspect ratio for BF3.</h2>
                    
<p>I play on a 480p old-school big screen TV from 2000 (lol, I need an upgrade). I got Battlefield 3 on black friday, and when I played it the next day, when I started up the multiplayer disc, there was the prompt to install the HD content for the game for
 'optimal visual quality.' I installed it since I wanted good quality graphics, and when I went into a multiplayer match, the game screen was letterboxed (or just put in widescreen I think) and I wondered why that happened. I'm more used to fullscreen 4:3,
 but the letterbox 16:9 isn't too much of a problem. I just wish I could have it fullscreen 4:3.</p>

<p>Basically, can I change the screen format for the game to fullscreen or close to it? I've experimented with screen adjust in the options and the vertical direction can barely be changed. Help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>i don't think you can do anything about it. the last game i played on a 4:3 screen that had this same problem was burnout paradise (another ea title). i never found a way around it except using a zoom feature on that tv at the time but it really didn't do
 much.</p>

<p>The HD pack is for textures. Has nothing to do with resolution of the screen and aspect ratio. Some Xbox 360 games support both 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios. However, some games only support 16:9 and on a 4:3 device it will letterbox to adjust to 16:9. The
 downside is you have less pixels to work with but still get the widescreen advatage (larger peripherals basically). It is up to the developers. Splinter Cell Double Agent did this as I can remember. At least it doesn't stretch and distort the image. I bought
 my TV 3+ years ago thinking it was 16:9 720p. Turns out it is 16:10 so every game stretched from 16:9 to 16:10 and distorted the image. After buying a VGA cable and setting it to 1440x900 (a 16:10 ratio), it now sets up a letterbox for me so it runs 16:9.</p>

<h2>            Two issues about Wireless Displays&#58;  &#40;A&#41; Won&#39;t find display&#59;   &#40;B&#41; Windows 10 help finds sources not from MS or on topic</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the Microsoft Windows 10 help and it says the Amazon Fire TV is a WIRELESS DISPLAY, as you connect through:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desktop Pop-Up Menu =&gt; System =&gt; Customize Your Display =&gt; Connect to a Wireless Display</p>
<p>
</p><p>The help, though, took me to Bing and the results included lots of non-Microsoft sources. &nbsp;In fact, I didn't see any MS sources from the results. &nbsp;(I no longer have the results, as I didn't think I'd need to record my every step.) &nbsp;The pages I found say
 the "Connect to Wiresless Display" was a list of 4 devices, one of which I own - Amazon Fire TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking on "Connect to a Wireless Display" didn't find anything and the Windows 10 HELP again took me to BING, but this time I got a page full of stuff about BLUETOOTH and nothing about Wireless Display Connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not connecting an audio device, I'm trying to connect my Wireless Display OR discover what is a Wireless Display and then choose which one to purchase based upon features and price.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly, IMHO, it is a BIG mistake for at least three reasons for Windows 10 to use online help:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What happens with the Internet is down?</li><li>The results I get typically aren't on topic.</li><li>From what I can tell people could design webpage Bing would find as Windows 10 help and return on selected topic, but have information such as telling people to move to Linux or worse stuff.</li></ol>
<p>So, two topics:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Online help issues with and not with Wireless Display and with the security of Windows 10 help and offline . . .</li><li>How to use Wireless Display, as doing the **** doesn't work with Windows 10 help . . .</li></ol>

            <p><span><span>Hi Bertram,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We appreciate you for being a part of Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We need to know the make and model of your computer. So that, it will help to check the compatible wireless display which will support to work in your device.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may project to a wireless display with Miracast. <span>Miracast is a wireless technology your PC can use to project your screen to TVs, projectors, and streaming media players that also support Miracast. You can use this to share what you’re doing on
 your PC, present a slide show, or even play your favorite game on a larger screen. However, if you upgraded your PC from an older version of Windows, you'll need to make sure your PC supports Miracast and is ready to project. Also, if the display you'll project
 to doesn’t support Miracast, you’ll need to set up the display by adding an extra piece of hardware to it before you can start projecting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>While you use the Bing search or any other search engines to find the search results about particular topic it may contain non Microsoft help articles also. If there is any Microsoft help article related to your query, then the search engine will display
 the Microsoft help/support articles on the top of the page results. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Reference</strong>: </span></span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to refer to the below help article if you have any queries related to Fix connections with Wireless display.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-connections-to-bluetooth-audio-devices-and-wireless-displays#v1h=tab02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-connections-to-bluetooth-audio-devices-and-wireless-displays#v1h=tab02</span></span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The above article also contains the steps to fix the connections with Bluetooth audio devices. You may ignore that steps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you would like to know more information about Windows 10, you may refer to the below help article.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/support</span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: The article keeps updating if there is any new help article added related to Windows 10.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I hope the above information helps. Kindly let us know the required information if you need any further assistance with Windows. We are glad to assist you.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Bertram,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First try to install all of the&nbsp;Windows updates available and if issue persists, try to update the Wireless drivers by following the steps provided in the article mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 to: Install and Update drivers in Windows 10</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>If issue still persists, then install the drivers for Windows 8/8.1 from the manufacturer's website in compatibility mode and check if that works.<br />
<br />

<h2>            I get &#8220;Your PC needs to be repaired&#8221; and &#8220;Error code&#58; 0xc0000225&#8221; in Windows 8.</h2>
                    <div>
<p>When I boot my Windows 8 laptop (see details below), it displays this message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recovery</p>
<p>Your PC needs to be repaired</p>
<p>A required device isn't connected or can't be accessed.</p>
<p>Error code: 0xc0000225</p>
<p>[ A text saying I should use recovery tools on my installation media to fix the issue. ]</p>
<p>Press Enter to try again </p>
<p>Press F8 for Start-up Settings</p>
<p>Press Esc for UEFI Firmware Settings</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I press Enter or F8, the central part of the message changes to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The application or operating system couldn't be loaded because a required file is missing or contains errors.</p>
<p>File: \Windows\system32\winload.efi</p>
<p>Error code: 0xc0000225</p>
</blockquote>
<b>My specific situation: </b>
<p>I have an ASUS UX32VD (R4002H) bought just days ago with Windows 8 preinstalled. I was going to swap the internal HDD for an SSD and was messing with the partitions to make them fit into the smaller SSD before cloning. I am not sure exactly what operation
 I did prior to the crash, but I probably tried to move a partition (which probably was unnecessary anyway).</p>
<p>I have not made recovery disks (yeah, I know).</p>
<p>When I started SystemRescueCD on the laptop and ran testdisk (for the first time in my life), the partitions seemed OK (to my eye), except for something called Backup Boot(sector|loader|?) that was marked as Bad on one of the partitions. I fixed that, to
 no avail.</p>
<p>I have no physical representation of a serial number (is that a thing of the past?) and I don't know anything about it being somewhere on the disk. I have no installation media, I didn't get anything like that with the computer.</p>
<p>I have contacted ASUS support, but the answer wasn't very technical.</p>
<b>My obvious question: </b>
<p>How can I get out of this mess? I would prefer if I could repair the partition table or whatever is wrong and get back into the installed OS, but if that is not possible, how can I reinstall Windows 8?
</p>
<p>If I need to run a system repair distro from a USB stick and run command line programs, that's no problem.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Original title : I get “Your PC needs to be repaired” and “Error code: 0xc0000225” in Windows 8: how can I fix it?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Update:</b></p>
<p>I have resolved this issue. What I did was a combination of the advice on this page:</p>
<p><a href="http://qliktips.blogspot.se/2012/11/fix-windows-8-boot-issue.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://qliktips.blogspot.se/2012/11/fix-windows-8-boot-issue.html</a></p>
<p>and setting the correct attributes and properties on the various partitions and volumes using FDISK. I had a strange partition that I removed and one or more volumes was of the wrong type (GUID).<br />

    <title>Windows Live Mail 2012 email addresses appear &#34;offline&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m jkelly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live Mail 2012 email addresses appear &#34;offline&#34;</h2>
                    I'm running Windows &amp; using Windows Live Mail on my PC, i.e., I don't log into hotmail etc. My problem I'm hoping someone has had similar experience with, is that some of my Windows Live Mail 2012 email addresses appear "offline", some of the time - mostly
 in my category folders when I'm sending out info letters to various groups? My category folders contain anywhere from 10 to 100 email addresses and I have accumulated 250+ categoryr.
<br />
<br />
Someone told me I should simply run the "repair" utility, but I am very concerned that I could lose some or all of my over 4 GB's of emails, contacts etc., as I'm using POP. Someone else mentioned something about clearing out the WLM cache, but not sure how
 to do that and again, don't want to accidentally delted any of my emails etc. <br />
<br />
To be honest, its a little bit scary given I have over 4 GB's of email data on my PC (I back it up, but suspect any reinstall of that data would be a nightmare as it probably wouldn't import back in all the proper folders etc). ALSO, I don't actually feel comfortable
 understanding the differences bewtween things like WLM and WLM in the cloud or hotmail, or messenger etc?<br />
<br />
Any ones help would be appreciate.<br />

            <p>Hi M JKelly,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reproduced your issue using Windows Live Mail 2012 and contacts added while on Offline mode appears to be offline. You can access those contacts if you are offline. This will serve as your back up address book.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you signed-in to one of your account, contacts that will appear in Mail are contacts saved in your account online. From there you'll be able to see which contacts are online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks. </p>

<p>You can not change from Win7 32 to 64 without the installation CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do you want to do this?</p>
<p>

If there was a SP2, you'd be able to get it from Microsoft.&nbsp; You can't, so there is no SP2 for Windows 7 at this time.<br />

I can give you Internet searches for just about anything - doesn't mean any of it is true.</p>

<p>Can it be established if it is the Intention of MS to release an SP2 for Win 7 32 &amp; 64 bit versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a pain in the butt, performing a new install of Win 7, with the greatest amount of time being devoted to the Latest Updates. How would you be on a Dial Up Connection, which many in the bush still have to live with.</p>
<p>An please do not tell me to go with Win 10 - a complete disaster, in line with Vista when it was first released. In my business situation, I could not afford to have Win 10 on my machines.</p>
<p>I will be sticking with Win 7, but it would be great to have SP2, to get rid of this enormous amount of Updates that have accumulated since SP1.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found a couple things you can look at about this issue.&nbsp; This <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/946414" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> discusses the error message in relation to updates, however it may also help in your situation.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also saw several references that according to Bethesda you can rename your InstallShield file and then reinstall Fallout 3.&nbsp; However I was not able to confirm that on the Bethesda website.</p>

<h2>            My computer says my disc is blank when it isn&#39;t...</h2>
                    I have a toshiba satellite l300 with windows vista and a dvd-r with pictures on it and whenever I try to look at the pictures it tells me that the disc is blank, but then if I try to put anything else onto the disc it tells me that disk has been write
 protected. <br />
I know for a fact that the pictures are on the dvd because I can play them using my xbox360 and also my dvd player, and I have also looked at them at my friends house using their computer.<br />
Does anyone know why my computer says the dvd is blank when clearly it is not?<br />
I didn't burn the dvd it was given to me so I don't know anything about how it is burnt but I do&nbsp;know that the pictures ARE on there and I really need to figure out a way to get them onto my computer.<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>Some disks will not work on other machines to due to different alignment issues.</strong> Do other disks work on your machine or just that one or a few? If only&nbsp;a few then the tolerance of the machine and your unit are on opposite sides of the allowed
 spectrum. You might even find that some disks you burn work on another computer when the ones burned on it will not work on yours. This is because your drive is actually several devices in one box and the tolerance of each part can be set different. Drives
 can be re-aligned however normally it really is not worth it to do so.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If you have issues with all disks check the below :<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab - click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL - REBOOT this will refresh the default driver stack.<br />
<br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />

<h2>            How do I use a MIDI to USB cable with a CTK-481 Casio keyboard and a Windows 7 64Bit Computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have an old CTK-481 Casio keyboard that I have longed to be able to connect to my computer. So, I got a MIDI-to-USB cable from online, and I am trying to connect it to Synthesia on my Windows 7 64Bit computer. However, it doesn't respond. It doesn't
 say anything about installing anything.</p>
<p><u>Details about the Computer</u></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a Windows 7 64Bit Home Premium monitor computer manufactured by Hewlett-Packard (HP)</li><li>The Model ID is MS227.</li><li>It has 6 USB ports, 2 on the side and 4 on the back.</li></ul>
<p><u>Details about the keyboard</u></p>
<ul>
<li>It is a Casio Keyboard, and it's model is CTK-481.</li><li>It has a Transpose/Tune/Midi button, but I tried that and it didn't do anything.</li></ul>
<p><u>First Use:</u></p>
<ol>
<li>Unboxed cable</li><li>Inserted MiDi ports into keyboard (I tried both the regular way and the IN to OUT and vice versa method.)</li><li>Inserted USB end to Computer</li><li>Turned on computer</li><li>Started Synthesia (only to see no keyboard)</li></ol>
<p>If anybody can help, please respond immediately.</p>

            With the computer on, try plugging in the USB cable into a different port and check if the device gets detected and installed correctly or not.<br />
<br />
If an error message comes up, let us know the exact error.<br />
<br />
If the icon indicating new hardware doesn't show up in the notification area, check if it's listed in the device manager.<br />
Go to Start and type <span style="font-weight: bold">devmgmt.msc</span> in the search box and press enter to bring up the device manager.<br />
<br />
First look for any device that has a yellow ! or a red X icon on it. If the name says Unknown Device or looks like it could be related to MIDI, right click on it and select properties. Let us know the name of the device and what the message says under Device
 status.<br />
<br />
If there are none, check under the Sound, video and gaming section for the device.<br />

    <title>Xobx One X HDR Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drhov3y  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xobx One X HDR Issues</h2>
                    <p><span>Hey,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p><span>OK so I got a whole new setup for 4K. It includes the Vizio P55-F1 (4K and Dolby vision) and A Sony STR-DH790 (4K 60hz and Dolby vision compatible). When I hook up my Apple TV 4K
 to the receiver and then the TV I get a 4K signal with Dolby vision enabled.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p><span>However, with my new Xbox One X, when I use the cable provided (or the ones that work with my Apple TV) it says that my tv can’t handle 4K 60hz, it can’t do HDR (when I do that check
 tv thing). If I plug it directly into my TV it seems to work fine though.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p><span>Not it sure what is going on (firmware is up to date on all components). I want to use the receiver for ease of changing inputs and don’t want to use the tv speakers and not my sound
 system (can I use the arc channel to bring audio to the receiver into a spare input?).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p><span>Any suggestions?</span></p>

<p>Hi DRHov3y,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post, I believe the Xbox One X needs certain information from the television for it to process that 4k is supported, with a receiver in the middle of this path that information could possibly not be getting to the console. I do recommend
 contacting Sony for information about possible adjustments that can be made to hopefully broadcast the correct signals to the console. For more information on the Xbox One X and 4k check out this article:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/troubleshooting-4k-and-hdr-on-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshooting 4K and HDR on Xbox One X and Xbox One S</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps, thanks again.</p>

<p>I solved this issue by changing the hdmi input setting on the av receiver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>on my sony str-dh790 remote control i pressed “amp menu” then “up” or “down” button to select “hdmi” then “up” or “down” to select “sig.fmt” and then find your input (game in my case) select it and choose “enhanced” (for hi-res and hdr).</p>

<h2>            Fails to connect to Internet, with the error &#8220;Code 12&#58; This device cannot find enough free resources that it can use&#8221;.</h2>
                    <p>I get the device status of&nbsp; "This device cannot find enought free resources that it can use (Code 12)" for a Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection Properties.</p>
<p>I have reformated and reinstalled Windows 7(32).</p>
<p>I have reinstalled Windows 7 on a new harddrive.</p>
<p>I have updated all drivers.</p>
<p>I have diabled all startup programs.</p>
<p>I have updated the BIOS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the only way I can connect to the internet is to unplug the laptop (no Battery) for 60 seconds and then reboot.</p>
<p>Most of the time this will work.&nbsp; This leads me to think BIOS. But I see nothing there to change.</p>
<p>Original Title: This device cannot find enought free resources that it can use (Code 12)</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

This error can occur if two devices that are installed on your computer have been assigned the same I/O ports, the same interrupt, or the same Direct Memory Access channel (either by the BIOS, the operating system, or both). This error message can also appear
 if the BIOS did not allocate enough resources to the device.</span></p>

<h2>            xbox live cannot connect</h2>
                    
<p>I am unable to get onto xbox live. I have tested my connection (I use wireless internet) and everything is fine until it tries to get onto Live. Here are the things I've tried.</p>
<ul>
<li>Configuring the network to match the settings used by other wireless devices in the household
<ul>
<li>Result: Didn't change anything </li></ul>
</li><li>Restoring the network to factory defaults
<ul>
<li>Result: After shutting down and turning the system back on, all settings were magically back to what they were before Restore
</li></ul>
</li><li>Unplugging everything, waited 10 minutes, then plugged it all back in.
<ul>
<li>Result: Nothing happened </li></ul>
</li><li>Reformatting entire xbox via System Settings -&gt; Storage -&gt; Memory Unit then "Y" -&gt; Format
<ul>
<li>Result: Didn't do anything. At all. Nothing was deleted. </li></ul>
</li><li>Clear System Cache
<ul>
<li>Result: Didn't do anything </li></ul>
</li><li>Deleted all programs, game files, profiles, etc., then reset system
<ul>
<li>Result: When I turned the system back on, everything somehow un-deleted. </li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>A few other notes. There is a random error code that I get when my system attempts to update that I can't find any information on:&nbsp;4451-000-3080-0300-D000-0185. My main profile disappeared a couple days ago (this is when I could no longer get into Live).
 And there are a few corrupted files that I never noticed before including a Corrupted Profile, a Corrupted Saved Game in my Netflix file, 3 Corrupted Saved Game in my Showtime Anytime file, a Corrupted Downloaded Items and Saved Game in my Your Shape: FE file,
 and a Corrupted System Item in my System Items file. I have tried deleting these, but they just reappear when I turn my system back on.</p>
<p>Thank you for any help anyone can give me. I am very sad without Live :-(</p>

<p>This awfully sounds as if your hard drive is failing. Please try the following as quickly as possible:
</p>
<p>Get yourself a known working USB hard drive (at least USB 2.0, and at least as much storage as your current Xbox hard drive, but not more than 2TB). Make sure there is no important data on that drive, as we are going to delete all the stuff on the drive!!!</p>
<p>Connect the USB drive to your console and go to the storage settings. Have the console prepare that USB drive as a storage device.
</p>
<p>Now transfer all non-corrupt data over to your USB drive.</p>
<p>Turn the console off and remove the internal hard drive. </p>
<p>Try to do an online update via XBox Live, or try doing the update offline with another

                    Toshiba laptop, Win XP Pro, Mitsumi ps2 external keyboard. I want to use this keyboard in addition to the internal keyboard. Will it work simply by using a USB adapter or do I need to do something else? My laptop has no ps2 port.

            <p>Only if it was designed for one.&nbsp; The brand new (as still in the original box but not really NEW) &nbsp;Mitsumi keyboards I've seen are designed with DIN (aka AT) and mini-DIN (aka PS/2) plugs and do not come with an adapter.&nbsp; They preceed&nbsp; the widespread use
 of USB.&nbsp; Later keyboards use lower signal levels and are designed with hot-plugging and passive adapters&nbsp;in mind.</p>
<p>As above, most adapters are passive and only connect the PS/2 wires to the equivalent USB contacts.&nbsp; What you really need&nbsp;is a PS/2 to USB
<em><strong>converter</strong></em> which has an integrated circuit (IC) that does active signal conversion,&nbsp; I know the

    <title>Skype doesn&#39;t notify you of a new message if PC not active when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rseiler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype doesn&#39;t notify you of a new message if PC not active when the message was sent</h2>
                    <p>I was surprised to realize that neither Skype 8 nor Skype UWP (latest versions) will notify you of a new (i.e. unread) message in that scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To test this, on Win10 I installed Skype UWP and 8 and configured them with separate Skype IDs. Message notifications were enabled in both. I pinned both to the taskbar for good measure and rebooted the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While it was rebooting, I quickly sent messages to each Skype ID from another PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the PC came back up, I saw both Skypes appear in the tray area (and the taskbar, of course).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, that was it. Until I actually clicked into each program, there was absolutely no way to tell that either had an unread message. There were no visual cues in the tray icon, the taskbar icon, or the Win10 notification center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I sent _another_ message at that point, then a notification pops up for both programs. In the case of Skype 8, once the notification disappears, you have no idea that there was a new message at all. That's incredibly unfortunate, since this is a common
 scenario. Skype 8 is surprisingly poor at persistent notifications unless you have a chat window open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case of Skype UWP, however, a visual cue is left behind in the notification center, the tray icon, and the taskbar, so clearly UWP has a huge advantage here in terms of notifications. No need for a chat window to be open to see these benefits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in summary, both Skypes fail in notifying you in the original scenario (PC asleep or off when a new message comes in). And in the case of persistent notifications even when Skype is running, Skype 8 is sadly deficient.</p>
