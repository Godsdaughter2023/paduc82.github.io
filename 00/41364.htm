<h2>            Recent update caused bluetooth to disappear</h2>
                    <p>Hey!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently updated my PC to the most recent Windows 10 version, I was tight on space but recently upgraded my&nbsp; hard drive for more room so I hadn't updated since October. Anyways, I have a Gigabyte GC-WB867D-I REV as my wireless card. It also has bluetooth
 which has worked fine until this update. I have done the troubleshooting and Device Manager and it's not even detected anymore. I have gone to the Gigabyte site and downloaded the drivers from there, I have downloaded the drivers from Intel as well to no avail.
 My wifi is still working and picking up both 2.4 and 5Ghz signals so I'm at a bit of a loss. My only use for bluetooth is connecting an Xbox One controller for gaming so it's not too major but it is a disappointment. Any advice would be very much appreciated.
 Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Erik</p>

            Hello, I’m Virginia an independent advisor here.
<br />If your Bluetooth is disabled then do the following to enable it.
<br />Uninstall the device from device manager and restart bluetooth service. 
<br />Start &gt; services.msc 
<br />Right-click "Bluetooth Support Service."
<br />Choose Automatic.
<br />Go to device manager and&nbsp; right-click on your computer name and click "Scan for hardware changes"
<br />Install the bluetooth device drivers from the manufacturer's website, if any. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

            Have you restarted your PC?
<br />Can you connect Bluetooth devices under the new settings&gt;devices&gt;Bluetooth?
<br />Have you checked that the device is hidden? Device manager&gt;file&gt;show hidden devices?
<br />If it appears try this:
<br />Device Manager:
<br /> Click on Network Adapters
<br />Right click on Intel Wireless -&gt; Properties -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Scroll down to Transmit Power -&gt; Change value to Medium or Medium-High

<br />Or:
<br />Step 1: Go to control panel. Uninstall Bluetooth from the Program List.
<br />Step 2: Go to your Bluetooth's developer website and download the driver/driver setup that applies to your computer/laptop, then run it.
<br />Step 3: Once installation is complete, a restart may be required(do it).
<br />Step 4: Open up your Device Manger and locate/click on your Bluetooth tab.
<br />Step 5: Right-click on anything under the Bluetooth tab and make sure to install if not already installed.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
This is an opinion sort of thing as some people can tell the difference, and others can't.<br />
<br />
If your going for competitive gaming MLG (Major League Gaming) uses HDMI on all of their gaming equipment, so, if your looking to compete you'd probably want to use those same standards.<br />
<br />
It's said that there's a very very slight delay when using HDMI vs VGA as VGA is "instant" in a sense. I've used both, I wasn't able to tell the difference.<br />
<br />
So, really it's best if you try each out yourself and see what your most comfortable with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[quote user="o TeChNiCS o"]Im heading towards HDMI for my new monitor because of picture quality , but what i want to know is which produces more input lag VGA or HDMI or do they produce the same.??[/quote]The LCD's response time is going to be a bigger
 factor than any potential "lag" caused by the conversion of an analog signal back into digital.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure your 360's output matches your monitor's native resolution. Anything else and the monitor's scaler&nbsp;may kick in. Scalers introduce latency.[quote user="Hassassinade"]It's said that there's a very very slight delay when using HDMI vs VGA as VGA is
 "instant" in a sense.[/quote]Where have you read that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A CRT connected via VGA is faster than an LCD by virtue of how a CRT works vs how an LCD works. The CRT/VGA vs LCD/DVI comparison&nbsp;was one of the more popular ways to determine an LCD's latency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When connecting to an LCD over HDMI or VGA, though,&nbsp;there should be virtually no difference. Any difference there may be would be in HDMI's favor as it doesn't have to be converted back into a digital format on the LCD end.</p>

<p>I've used both. In my expirience, the HDMI is better, but thats bias based on my clumsiness. When putting in and taking out the VGA cable over time, it got a few scrathces on the part the plugs into the xbox. I noticed a lot more "visible noise" in my picture,
 and I'm sure it was due to that, as a new VGA cable made it clear again. As for competitive gaming, I wouldn't use anything that has a response time higher than 5ms.</p>

<p>It depends really. VGA is analog and can get interference, but it is instant. HDMI is digital, so it read the monitor providing you have the enhanced display discovery on. The only problem is if the monitor's HDMI decoder is having problems. Other than that,
 go HDMI.</p>

<p>[quote user="Eap123"]It depends really. VGA is analog and can get interference, but it is instant.[/quote]VGA is not "instant".&nbsp;When connected to a CRT, VGA directly drives the display, but unless you've got a CRT lying around that's a mooot point. VGA does
 not directly drive a fixed resolution display like a CRT or Plasma TV. It has to be converted back into a digital format.[quote]HDMI is digital, so it read the monitor providing you have the enhanced display discovery on.[/quote]VGA, HDMI, and DVI all support
 display detection.[quote]The only problem is if the monitor's HDMI decoder is having problems.[/quote]If you mean HDCP, that implies a bigger problem. You may mean the display's scaler. Whenever possible the 360 should be set to the native resolution of the
 display in order to avoid activating the scaler.[quote user="Poke Potion"]Is this about the Xbox brand VGA cable? Cause I was going to buy one so I could stop using my current TV and use this monitor when my new one comes in.[/quote]If you go for a 360 VGA
 cable, get the official one. I've used knock-off $15 cables and they ghosted quite badly.</p>

</p><p>When I get the updates from Microsoft about the account (when I try to change the password) it highlights that I am trying to recover his current Microsoft / hotmail account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) why is my Skype linked to his hotmail (current account)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) why, then, even if it is, won't it let me send a password reset email to that hotmail address, but rather to one that is no longer used by him (previous account)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q:&nbsp;why is my Skype linked to his Hotmail (current account)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>it is possible that when your husband sign in to Skype, he accidentally linked your account to his Hotmail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Q:&nbsp;why, then, even if it is, won't it let me send a password reset email to that Hotmail address, but rather to one that is no longer used by him
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>Please be advised that the code will be sent on your security info, which means that it will be go through to the old email that is linked to your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Security info</strong> is an alternate email address or phone number that you add to your account. If you forget your password, or if someone else is trying to take over your account, we send a security code to that alternate email or phone number.</p>

    <title>Bluetooth connection asks for pin, none is needed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth connection asks for pin, none is needed</h2>
                    <p>So, I've got a Canon bluetooth mouse, which has worked for years, and is still working now. I've used it on two laptops; a Surface 4 pro, and a Dell laptop from work. The mouse only seems to be able to 'remember' one device, so if I switch between the surface
 and the laptop (which I do every few days, usually), I usually need to remove the device and then reconnect. The mouse has a pairing button, which makes it visible and accepting of connections. It never asked for a pin, and the manual doesn't specify one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few weeks back, when switching to the laptop, the laptop suddenly asked for a pin. I thought it odd, rebooted the thing, and tried again. It then asked again. I checked for updates (there were none; it had updated the night before), shut down antivirus
 and everything else, and it still asked. I removed the bluetooth adapter from device manager with its drivers, rebooted, waited for windows update to reinstall the whole thing, and tried to reconnect the mouse; still asked for a pin. Thinking the bluetooth
 adapter may be broken, I tried to connect my phone, a bluetooth speaker, and a bluetooth keyboard. All worked. I then tried to put in default pins (0000, 1234, 9999), and it still refused to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then thought the mouse was broken, and went back to the surface. I tried to reconnect it, expecting similar behaviour, and it connected normally, without asking for a pin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then suspected the update somehow botched something, but there was no previous bluetooth driver to roll back to; it does not seem to have been updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have an idea on what may be at play here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(P.S. please do not post full copy-paste default 'solutions' before reading the whole post, while assuming I am an amateur)</p>

<h3> jakooth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Myst IV 360 Compatibility</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just bought the Myst IV Xbox copy, cause I wanted so much, to sit on the couch and play this amazing game one more time on the big TV with my 360.</p>
<p>I was so disappointed, to see that it is not backward compatible with the 360.</p>
<p>Really strange, when the previous Exile version is working.</p>
<p>It says to check for update on the xbox site, but I can not imagine how you update this from here.</p>
<p>If anyone care about this, please provide us with a patch. Now days we ended with non stop shooters and beautiful games, like Myst are gone forever.</p>
<p>At least give us a chance to enjoy it one more time, the way it is supposed to be played!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ivan</p>

<p>Hi William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There is a possibility that your Windows build and the imaging device driver is not compatible, that is why you are experiencing an issue with using Windows Hello. For us to provide further troubleshooting, we would need to know which build and edition of
 Windows 10 is installed on your device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Notebook battery calibration does not work - notebook turns off when battery indicates about 40&#37; of charge</h2>
                    <p>I've tried all recommended calibration options, including detaching AC power =&gt; running HDD test from BIOS until battery depletes and .... everything the rest, according to suggestions, checking out options in Power plan, running HP tests, which shows me
 the following:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b25a1ef1-c86c-4047-b033-92078428177f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b25a1ef1-c86c-4047-b033-92078428177f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But eventually I can't resolve the problem. I can see the battery lost 28% of initial capacity (it used to be repacked some time ago, btw). I just want this current capacity to be considered as 100% by Windows OS and not to have my HDD turn off suddenly!</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />Check if its working...
<br />
<br />Other things you can try....
<br />
<br />1. Run Windows 10 Battery Diagnostics
<br />
<br />If your battery isn’t fully charging, the first thing you can try is the Battery troubleshooter in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />    Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />    Scroll down then click Power
<br />    Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Complete the wizard then restart your device to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Most laptop computers include their own factory diagnostics utilities, too. It is recommended you also use those to test your battery. Accessing the diagnostics will vary by manufacturer, so, consult the documentation that came with your computer. Before you run a test, you might need to first fully charge the device to 99 or 100 percent, disconnect the AC adapter, boot into the diagnostic utility then run the test.
<br />
<br />2. Check if Your AC Power Supply is Properly Connected
<br />
<br />Sometimes the power cable connected to your AC power supply brick might be loose. Check to make sure it is fitted and secured properly.
<br />
<br />3. Try a Different Wall Outlet and Check for Low Voltage and Electrical Issues
<br />
<br />The other day, my house had some serious electrical issues going on. You would be amazed how much voltage issues can affect the performance of your system. Plugging in my laptop into an outlet within my room dimmed the light, while an outlet in the living room caused it to wink.
<br />
<br />Another room it remained constant but charging was horribly slow. This, of course, meant I had low voltage issues and with so many appliances competing for the little bit of faulty energy, it made it even worse. Ultimately, I ended hiring an electrician to sort out the issues. After fixing it up, my laptop started charging normally.
<br />
<br />4. Test with Another Charger
<br />
<br />I mentioned the AC power adapter earlier. It’s possible your charger might be the culprit. If you have a working spare laying around the home, give it a try to see if it charges. You can also borrow one from your work colleague if you don’t have any. If you don’t have access to another charger, try yours on another laptop to see if it charges the device.
<br />
<br />If you are mixing and matching laptop power adapters, make sure you choose the correct power supply (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=outlet+tester" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=s...</a>). Read the brick and make sure it has the same polarity and voltage as the adapter for your laptop.
<br />
<br />5. Remove All External Devices
<br />
<br />If you keep external devices such as a smartphone, a USB external drive, mouse, printer and anything else attached to your system while charging, it will take longer for your battery to reach 100%. Make sure you disconnect all of those devices so your system won’t be competing with all the other electronics.
<br />
<br />6. Check Your Connectors for Dirt or Damage
<br />
<br />If your laptop has a modular battery, remove it then check for any damage or to see if it needs cleaning around the contacts and inside the battery compartment. Also, check if there are any dust particles inside the charging port that might be preventing the battery from charging.
<br />
<br />7. Check for BIOS and Chipset Driver Updates
<br />
<br />Sometimes your system might be overdue for an update for components such as your BIOS and Chipset. Updates can help resolve bugs that might be preventing the battery from charging efficiently.
<br />
<br />8. Press and Release Power Button Reset
<br />
<br />Sometimes unknown glitches can prevent the battery from charging. An easy way to fix it is to power down your computer, hold down the power button for 15 to 30 seconds, plug in the AC adapter, then start the computer.
<br />
<br />9. Disable Apps and Check Battery Usage in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Going back to Windows 10 a bit, recently, I noticed my Surface Pro was taking an unusually long time to charge and the fans started to rev up. Little did I notice the culprit was right there on my Taskbar all along. Slack’s Windows client was waiting in an attempt to connect to the Internet. So, checking your apps to determine whats running in the background can help you not only conserve battery life but limit what prevents it from charging faster.
<br />
<br />There are a couple ways to do that. Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps. Scroll down then toggle off the apps that might be preventing your device from reaching a full charge.
<br />
<br />Still in Settings, open System &gt; Battery &gt; Battery usage by app. This will tell you which apps are using the most battery and you can make a decision what to do, whether to let Windows decide if it should run in the background while not sacrificing battery life.
<br />
<br />10. Replace Charger or Battery Module
<br />
<br />Ultimately, if you don’t see any improvements after trying all the above, then it’s maybe best that you replace either the charger or battery itself. This will require contacting your laptop manufacturer and placing an order. Batteries and the chargers are not necessarily cheap, especially if its an older system. But, if you have no choice, its something you will just have to do to get your system back in working order.

            <strong>1. Run Windows 10 Battery Diagnostics&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
The Windows troubleshooter does not find any problems: it says display and HDD sleep time was not optimal and it adjusted it. So it's nothing.<br />
Yes, there are manufacturers utilities - I have attached the screenshot from HP diagnostics. It says battery has 72% of original capacity. But it says it's ok.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. Check if Your AC Power Supply is Properly Connected&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
Yes, it is.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. Try a Different Wall Outlet and Check for Low Voltage and Electrical Issues&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
I have tried various outlets and it makes no difference.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. Test with Another Charger&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
I don't have another charger. It's an old notebook (I guess more than 10 years old) and it has ORIGINAL charger, that seems to work ok (otherwise i suspect it would not work at all or not charge the device to 100%)...<br />
<br />
<strong>5. Remove All External Devices&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
Don't have any, plugged in...<br />
<br />
<strong>6. Check Your Connectors for Dirt or Damage</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
They seem to look fine.<br />
<br />
<strong>7. Check for BIOS and Chipset Driver Updates&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
As I said, it's an old notebook, so it has the latest BIOS for a while. Also, there are no any updates for drivers - I regularly check and all drivers are the latest.<br />
<br />
<strong>8. Press and Release Power Button Reset</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Of course I tried different things like this...<br />
<br />
<strong>9. Disable Apps and Check Battery Usage in Windows 10. Going back to Windows 10 a bit, recently, I noticed my Surface Pro was
</strong><strong>taking</strong><strong> an unusually long time to charge and the fans started to rev up. Little did I notice the culprit was right there on my Taskbar all along. Slack’s Windows client was waiting in an attempt to connect to the Internet. So,
 checking your apps to determine whats running in the background can help you not only conserve battery life but limit what prevents it from charging faster.</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I would not say there is something wrong with battery drain... Since it's 72% from original capacity, I think it drains adequately. The problem is it turns off SUDDENLY - i suspect
<br />
<strong>- Still in</strong> <strong>Settings</strong>, <strong>open</strong> <strong>
System &gt; Battery &gt; Battery usage</strong> <strong>by app. This will tell you which apps are using the most battery and you can make a decision what to do, whether to let Windows decide if it should run in the background while not sacrificing battery life.&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
There are only standard Windows apps there, I doubt they somehow influence my problem.<br />
<br />
<strong>10.</strong> <strong>Replace</strong> <strong>Charger</strong> <strong>or</strong>
<strong>Battery</strong> <strong>Module</strong><br />
<br />
It's a last resort. I already did it once - I took my battery to the service, where they reprogrammed the controller and enriched the battery to initial capacity...

<p>
</p><p><span>Once you’ve got the correct Skype Name, make sure to log in to Skype using the Skype Name and the password for it. From there, you may check the contacts and your previous conversations if it is there.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you have multiple Skype accounts linked to the registered email address, make sure to check them one by one. In the event that you encountered any sign in issues, please update or change your Skype
 account password to access the Skype account again. </span></p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Youtube Videos, Films Etc.. Not Playing Properly.</h2>
                    Before I updated to windows 8.1, videos and everything work working fine, then once I updated after a day or two I noticed, videos would play but the screen would sometimes stick and this began to annoy me. Also sometimes the youtube video itself would
 in a way freeze the browser for a couple of seconds, the only way to resolve this issue is when I restart my laptop then everything works fine, but if i just start it up normally I get these problems. Sometimes when watching videos I could skip parts with
 ease, but now I have to wait for sometime. <br />

                    Having Issues Getting Started On A Warranty Claim For My Arc Mouse. I've Checked The Warranty Conditions And Defiantly Fall Within The Required Categories (Not Accidental Damage, Damaged Within Normal Working Conditions), But Phone Support Has Been Less
 Than Useful. Two Of The Three Agents I Spoke Too Couldn't Even Find The Mouse Despite Me Having Its Serial Number And The Third Told Me That They Can't Replace It Due To Physical Damage, (The Warranty Disagrees Though). I Have A Receipt And Genuine Cause To
 Use The Warranty But Am Not Be Allowed Too. Any Further Help That Can Be Given Would Be Appreciated.&nbsp;

    <title>Star Wars Empire at War&#58; Gold Pack unplayable on Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wval  say:</h3>
<h2>            Star Wars Empire at War&#58; Gold Pack unplayable on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I'm having the (seemingly common) problem of my copy of Star Wars Empire at War: Gold Pack not working on Windows 8.1. The game installed successfully (from a DVD), but when I try to run the game, I get a plain black screen with the game's mouse pointer.
 I ran the program compatibility assistant multiple times, with no successful loads. I then used the program compatibility troubleshooter, as described here:
</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</p>
<p>After running the program compatibility troubleshooter, I was able to run the first part of the gold pack, "Star Wars Empire at War," however, I was unable to run the included expansion pack "Star Wars Empire at War: Forces of Corruption." When trying to
 load the Forces of Corruption expansion, I get a plain white screen (not black) with the game's mouse pointer. I then tried changing the separate program file for Forces of Corruption to the same settings as the main program file. It still did not work. I
 then manually changed the compatibility settings, trying all of the available combinations. This still did not work.</p>
<p>Other posters have said that they got an error message saying to please upgrade to Win 2000. I haven't gotten this error message, just a plain black or white screen with the game's mouse pointer.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with my DVD, as I had installed the game on a PC running Vista and currently have it running on Linux Mint. There is also nothing wrong with the DVD drive as it works for other games. The computer's specs are also more than enough
 to handle this game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a bit frustrated by this, as Microsoft is listing this program as compatible here:
</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Star+Wars%3a+Empire+at+War+Gold&amp;vendor=LucasArts&amp;Locale=1033%2c2057%2c3081%2c4105%2c16393&amp;BreadCrumbPath=empire+at+war&amp;LastSearchTerm=empire%2bat%2bwar&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=Windows+8.1
</p>
<p>and here: </p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Star%20Wars%3A%20Empire%20at%20War&amp;vendor=LucasArts&amp;Locale=1033%2C2057%2C3081%2C4105%2C16393&amp;ModelOrVersion=1&amp;BreadCrumbPath=empire%20at%20war&amp;LastSearchTerm=empire%2Bat%2Bwar&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=Windows%208.1
</p>
<p>and here:</p>
<p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Star%20Wars%3A%20Empire%20at%20War%20-%20Forces%20of%20Corruption&amp;vendor=LucasArts&amp;Locale=1033%2C2057%2C3081%2C4105%2C16393&amp;ModelOrVersion=1&amp;BreadCrumbPath=empire%20at%20war&amp;Type=Software&amp;tempOsid=Windows%208.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this program is supposed to be compatible, why isn't it loading? Why isn't changing any of the compatibility settings making a difference? Is this going to happen on all of my "compatible" Windows games? Is there a Windows emulator for Windows that will
 let me play Windows games? Something along the lines of Wine? Or is my only option for playing my Windows games to use Linux? I don't mind switching or dual-booting if that's what it takes, I just want to know if that's my only option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help</p>

What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
<br />
There could be various reasons like hardware requirements might not meet, third party programs conflict, settings are not correct…etc.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to boot the computer into clean boot and check if the issue persists.
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Clean boot will
</span><span>eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict

            <p>Lenovo h535 It more than meets the requirements for this game. Moreover, the game runs fine on my Linux Mint system which has much worse specs than my new Win PC. The game only requires a 1Ghtz processor/256MB RAM/32MB 3D Graphics. If my computer couldn't
 handle the game, it couldn't handle Win 8...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue persists in clean boot. I also tried running the compatibility troubleshooter with multiple settings in clean boot with no difference: I still get a plain white screen with the game's cursor.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my computer more than meets the requirements and I guess there's no 3rd party software conflict since clean boot didn't work. What settings do I need to have to play this game? What is the 'etc'?&nbsp;</p>

<br />
What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to update the drivers for the graphic card from the manufacturers website and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
b. Click on “Device Manager”.<br />
c. The Device Manager will then display a list of installed devices in the right pane of the console.
<br />
e. Expand the category for Display Adapter. <br />
f. Right-click the device and select Uninstall. <br />
g. dialog box will pop up asking you to confirm ‘Uninstall’. Click OK to proceed.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</span></span>

            <p>I had already emailed Lucas Arts about this problem. They sent me a link to patches. The patch for "2GB RAM &amp; MP Lobby Updates" makes this game run.</p>
<p>http://help.starwars.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/STAR-WARS-Empire-at-War-Update-Files?section=Star-Wars#fix</p>
<p>I suggest this link be added to the Windows 8 Compatibility website if this patch is required for compatibility.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now having this same problem with a couple other Windows games. I have started troubleshooting them as well, but it doesn't look like any of them have patches. I did find that there is an XP emulator for Windows 7 that would work like Wine, but the
 website says this is not compatible with Windows 8. </p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/install-and-use-windows-xp-mode-in-windows-7</p>
<p>Where is the version for Windows 8? Or, is there a LTS release of Windows 8 I can download that will play all of my games? Or is there a way to downgrade to Windows 7 or Vista?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have MANY Windows games and would like to be able to play them without 6 days of troubleshooting for each. The ONLY reason to have Windows is to play these games. There's no reason to sacrifice performance and security for an OS that will not run supposedly
 compatible software without so much hassle.</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
If you know that the game was compatible in previous versions of Windows, then You can try installing the game in compatibility mode.<br />

<h2>            ASUS laptop &#34;dead sleep&#34; and can&#39;t properly shut down</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with my ASUS K555LA laptop and its shutdown and sleep modes. The laptop doesn't shutdown properly when I click the shutdown button in the Start menu.&nbsp; I get the "Shutting down..." screen and the display turns off, but I can hear it running,
 and the HDD lamp is still on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar problem happens when I close the lid and try to get it back up, it's dead, display is off, and it doesn't react to anything. The only way I can get it operating again is by holding down the shutdown button for several seconds and force shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Naturally I googled possible solutions, and found that unchecking the "fast startup/boot" option in the Power options menu solves the issue, but I don't have the option. I also tried turning off hibernation mode in Command Prompt (<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">powercfg.exe
 /</span><strong>hibernate off)&nbsp;</strong>but the problem persists. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried Troubleshooter, but it only detects a problem with Time before display is off is too long, and the same with Time before computer goes to sleep is too long - nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 Pro with all the latest updates installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate your help!</p>

<p>Power settings were set on default. I changed the Power plan to High performance to avoid the dead sleep.</p>

<p>- open Control Panel</p>
<p>- open Power Options</p>
<p>- click choose what the power buttons do</p>
<p>- at the top, next to the shield, click 'change settings that are not currently available'</p>
<p>- go down to Shutdown Settings</p>
<p>- Uncheck 'Turn on fast startup', even though it is recommended</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked for me and did not impact my startup speed</p>

I asked for a supervisor 3x before i was able to get 1<br /><br />The supervisor Aaron not only misinformed me (he said that the entertainment for all plan was only attached to the xbox live account &amp; not attached to a console which i verified with a nice telephone csr named Lady to be false), he was also rude. He would not listen to anything unless it was on the xbox.com website. I referred him to a user on xbox forums that had the same problem as mine and persisted in saying that it was that user's account that had the problem not the console. He was then very rude and said that I should only buy from official retailers. I got mine from cowboom a bestbuy co. He then ended the chat PREMATURELY.  chat started 10:43:12 on 1/12/14. i have the print

<p>The agents you talked to do not work for Microsoft.I think they outsource all complaints to scrubs working in their own homes probably in India where they can get away with paying less than minimum wage.You should get an email from them in a few days with
 a survey about your experience.Use this opportunity to complain about the chat agent.So theres no way to get the console unbanned?..What if you pay the contract off? Maybe that would unban it and then you would get 2 years of live.idk</p>

<p>Yeah, I would advise calling Xbox Customer Support. &nbsp;Most of the people I've spoken with are from the United States, both in chat and on the phone, but some of them seem not to be. &nbsp;This particular chat support agent and supervisor didn't seem familiar with
 the Entertainment For All plan, or how non-payment on that plan restricts any Live access on the console. &nbsp;If the console has been switched off due to non-payment, you'll need to contact Xbox Customer Support by phone, and see if there's a way to pay off the
 balance to switch it back on, though if it were me, I'd probably sooner seek my money back from the person I bought the console from, and look into getting another one. &nbsp;Used consoles can be risky. &nbsp;Even when they're not banned, something can be wrong with
 them. &nbsp;They might work for a week, and then show signs of flaw. &nbsp;Always better to go through an authorized dealer. &nbsp;Doesn't have to be Microsoft themselves, but at least someone registered with the Better Business Bureau.</p>

<p>My console isn't banned. I was just afraid it WOULD get banned and i was making sure. I talked to a nice telephone CSR named Lady who actually knew her stuff. She was able to conclusively assure me that my console was not attached to a contract.
</p>
<p>what I'm complaining about right now are the two CSR I dealt with initially. Azy tried my patience big time. When i reached the 30 minute mark and i realized that he didn't even UNDERSTAND me, i kinda lost it. Then he had the gall to ignore my requests for
 a supervisor twice. It was a simple query but he just wasn't listening at all.</p>
<p>Then the supervisor didn't seem to even want to help me because i didn't buy my Xbox from an official retailer.
</p>
<p>well i didn't buy my Xbox from some random guy on the street. I bought it off cowboom.com which is a company of Best Buy. An official retailer. They sell the preowned ones that get returned to them.</p>
<p>And I hadn't been scammed and taking it out on them. I just wanted to avoid being scammed by making a simple query. The other CSR who knew her stuff knew exactly what what to do and helped me really fast but these two were just incompetent. And prejudiced
 against buyers who buy used. Well I've been a gamer for 3years now and i have bought 3 consoles so far. All of them had been used. I am a loyal customer and just because i buy my consoles used doesn't mean i have to be made to jump through hoops to ask a question.
</p>
<p>it is a fact of life that many of their customers actually sell their xbox and other people buy them. And there are preowned buyers who are getting scammed because of the contract thing. I don't expect them to take responsibility. But i would hope that they
 would help the customers who want to avoid getting scammed by answering questions about their system.

<p>kind of sounds like you were the one being difficult. "why do you need my account anyway? its not like the xbox is under my account?</p>
<p>Leslie Ann: at 10:56:25</p>
<p>i just need to know if the console is under contract or not?</p>
<p>Leslie Ann: at 10:56:30" Sorry your paranoia isn't being properly acknowledged. would you like for us to give you some misinformation instead ? XD

<p>anyways you still got a used console cowboom ebay or whatever doesn't matter how reputable you think they are. If you purchased a used console there is a probability you can buy one that is banned, under an entertainment for all bundle that has been locked,
 and many other things. if the seller is not willing to take responsibility then you might actually be out of luck and as Aaron and Azy said you should try to only buy from authorized retailers for Microsoft otherwise you can purchase at your own risk. Let's
 say your console was banned, well since the ban is not reversible by phone or chat support you would be referred to the enforcement team who would just shrug their shoulders and say "tough luck" or what if you did get a console that was locked for entertainment
 for all balance you would get a phone or chat agent that say "tough luck" since I am sure they are not about to give you the billing information of the previous owner. And the moral of the story get it from retail heck I just read a post about some guy who
 bought a used console from gamestop that was banned and the answer to him what the same tough luck. the only rudeness here is asking a question you already know the answer to and acting entitled while you are at it.

<p>to be honest I think it's not fair, but that being said there isn't anything the chat or even the phone agents could have done other than give more speculation. I buy a lot of used stuff too mostly retro consoles but I am not about to purchase an amiga computer
 then turn around and call the amiga customer support if it doesn't boot on (is the amiga c.s. line still available ? :p) it wouldn't make sense. :)</p>

    <title>Running Age of Mythology on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Running Age of Mythology on Windows 10</h2>
                    I just recently installed Age of Mythology onto my Windows 10 computer and cannot get it to run. The installation went smoothly with no problems whatsoever. When I click 'Open' on the program, it briefly shows up in Task Manager as a background process
 along with a process called "-f1d055.tmp (32 bit)" but both disappear within seconds. My copy of the game is 100 percent legitimate, I bought it from Microsoft themselves. My computer displays no other inability to run programs. Can someone please help me?
 This is so frustrating.
