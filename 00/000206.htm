<h2>            Subscription emails not being received &#40;Mega.co.nz &#38; others&#41;</h2>
                    <div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I have recently experienced that I didn't received emails from few websites like mega.co.nz &amp; Korektel.com, both email were related to subscription confirmation, whereas when i tried to subscribe on my yahoo email ID, i received their emails instantly. Please
 confirm if there is some issue with web services ?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from putting those domains on your safe senders list as recommended by Frodo1337 of the Shire, please check also the filtering settings on your account just to eradicate that it contributes to your issue as t<span>here
 are some cases that it happen due to the contacts being added or accidentally added to your blocked senders list which tends to prevent emails coming from that sender to go to your inbox. Kindly refer to the link below for your guidance:</span></p>

To confirm if it’s an account or client problem, please confirm it the issue occurs when adding the account in other workstations or adding other’s account in his workstation.</p>
<p>Also, please run <a href="http://diagnostics.office.com/#/?env=VP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Office 365 Support and Recovery Assistant (SARA)</a> and check how it works.<br />
if SARA doesn’t fix it, please provide the logs of SARA, <br />
I have sent the private message to you to collect them, please provide the detailed test result from Microsoft Connectivity Analyzer via the private message as well.<br />

<p>Hi Jordan,</p>
<p>Thanks for the information.<br />
Since the tests result shows “Your account seems to be locked” and the account is synced from on-premises AD, I’d like to confirm more information as below:<br />
1. Is the account locked in on-premises AD? If not, does the issue occur if you reset the password for the user in on-premises AD?<br />
2. Do you have hybrid environment? <br />
3. <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn975125.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connect to Office 365 PowerShell</a>, and use the following cmdlet to check the account status.<br />

<p>Hi Jordan,</p>
<p>Thanks for the update.<br />
The issue is weird since the account is not locked in on-premises AD or Office 365 while the error is the account is locked.
<br />
Given the situation, could you disable and re-enable the account in on-premises AD and then check again?<br />
Note: Once the account is disabled, please use PowerShell cmdlet to check if the account is blocked in Office 365 before re-enable it in on-premises AD.<br />
If the issue persists, could you backup the mailbox content and re-provision the mailbox (remove the license and assign it again)?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Franky</p>

    <title>Italics formatting changing to an italic font - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chuck42vat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Italics formatting changing to an italic font</h2>
                    A client of mine is having a problem in Word that whenever he formats text as italic, the font actually changes to the italic version. So, for example, if he formats text that is in Arial as italic, the font in the window changes to Arial Italic. Then,
 he can't use Find to locate italic text (using formatting in the Find box), because Word doesn't see it as having italic formatting.

<div><br />
<div>If you open Font Book (should be inside the<b>&nbsp;Applications </b>folder) and look at Arial, are you seeing the different styles grouped together (as shown below) or are they each a separate font?</div>

                    <p>So all of a sudden I can no longer block email senders in my junk mail folder in my hotmail account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks like senders have worked out how to do this with underscores???&nbsp; Something microsoft may need to jump on and get ahead of the game.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The sender uses quotes and angle brackets at the start and end of his email address.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is tricky because it looks very similar to the way Outlook displays spam email addresses in the junk folder which looks something like this:</p>
<p>&lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see Outlook uses the angle brackets at the start and end of the address whereas the tricky spammer used quotes and brackets like this:</p>
<p>"&lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something really needs to be done because the spammers are catching on and I'm beginning to get flooded with these types of emails.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>The Microsoft email spam/junk email filter is a learning system. What it cannot determine to be junk and passes on can normally be flagged to train it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you all have been complaining about this for over a month now I have to believe that somebody has seen it, knows about it and is indeed working on it. Use the available channels you can to ask and if necessary start a case. If there is not free telephone

<p>
</p><p>It's possible that none of us here have an adequate answer. This is a user site, not official support and not all of us will know how the coding of the site works or much about the company's software/servers (would you WANT anybody to)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have to wonder if the reason doesn't involve:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Your version of Windows/browser (my 7/IE 11 is fine in that respect)</li><li>What account it comes in to (do you import an account that is getting the spam)?</li><li>Your device (handheld, Apple or otherwise)</li><li>If you import have you gone to that email and tried finding it there and then deleting it?</li></ul>
<p>I am leaning strongly on it possibly being in Junk/Spam on the imported email site as well and either being technically viewable but not addressable on outlook.live.com - the new mail site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The underscoring may be the way that email server and/or Outlook's mark these messages when they are blacklisted (marked as potential/actual spam).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now...if you CAN delete them, would&nbsp;they also disappear in that other account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if they are marked as junk there first and then try it, then kill the rest of any imports THERE&nbsp;if you can. It seems like that's an avenue to go down,&nbsp;since I don't know your providers and they will be different ones no doubt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as someone else has learned the server here removes anything that looks like an actual email address for protection of the users, so the example should ideally be&nbsp;truncated/modified but not give your address or other legitimate addresses away. That is
 ultimately hard when many of them found in spam can be harvested address or real accounted spoofed for spamming. 'x at y dot com' might work.</p>

<p>Yes I can delete it but cannot not block it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5-10 per day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not forwarded it to Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>10 do not use IE</li><li>It comes from Outlook, Hotmail address</li><li>Laptop PC</li><li>Don't import, if I understand you question.</li></ul>
<p>After these points,, not sure I understand or can respond to your other points.&nbsp; I just want Microsoft to fix what wasn't broke before the recent update.&nbsp; What I don't understand is if I can't block it because it is not a real email address, why does Outlook
 accept it in the first place?&nbsp; Sorry, I am not a techie, but I can work with a system that I can understand.</p>

            I am receiving between 25 and 40 per day. I've stopped using my Microsoft account but check back periodically and try to block them to see if Microsoft has done anything about the problem. Unfortunately I see no change after several weeks. Thankfully there
 are other providers that do not have this problem.

            Looks like it's buy buy Microsoft, will drop back in a month or two too see if you have sorted a problem that wasn't their until the Outlook up-date messed it up, maybe you need help from other providers tec people obviously you can't seem to fix it yourself.

            <p>Since your problem does not exist on my computers with Windows 7 and IE 11 I can only guess based on what you all offer. Get 7, get 8.1, get Linux, but get out of 10 or Edge at the&nbsp;least. Edge is shaving cream not a browser. Fred Sanford wouldn't take it
 in his junkyard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been there, did that, went back to 7&nbsp;over a year ago. 10 and edge are the psycho lover you are irrationally stuck with even though they drive you nuts and try to harm you and break up your friendships.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that enough analogy for you? You have a lemon that will not sweeten.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>===========</span></p>
<p><span>1. <span>&nbsp;</span>Create a text box.</span></p>
<p><span>2. <span>&nbsp;</span>Then right click on the border, and choose "copy."</span></p>
<p><span>3. <span>&nbsp;</span>On the edit menu, click "Paste Special" and paste it as a picture.
<br />
<br />
Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>=========</span></p>
<p><span>1. <span>&nbsp;</span>Create a text box.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Insert a WordArt into the text box</span></p>
<p><span>Now you would be able to rotate not only the text box but also the text within it.</span></p>

    <title>Not receiving Insider builds &#40;on fresh install&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yorickdowne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not receiving Insider builds &#40;on fresh install&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I'm not being offered the current Fast Ring build. In fact, I haven't been offered an OTA insider build since Win10 went GA. I've seen @donasarkar's tweet, and the followup tweet stating that blocked accounts are now unblocked. I think I may still be blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently on a dual-boot install that was newly created a week ago.</p>
<p>Win10 GA -&gt; Win10 AU -&gt; build 14965 via ISO</p>
<p>winver shows me that "this product is licensed [...] to: &lt;my-account&gt;@outlook.com"<br />
Settings shows me that "You're all set to get Insider Preview builds", and I am on "Fast" ring<br />
Windows Update claims that "Your device is up to date"<br />
<br />
This is what I've already tried:</p>
<p>- Checked registry settings relevant to Insider. All seems in order.</p>
<p>- Waited 24 hours, without PC going to sleep</p>
<p>- Switched to Slow ring, and back to Fast ring</p>
<p>- "Stop Insider Preview builds", reboot, then Resume</p>
<p>- Ran the WU troubleshooter</p>
<p>- Ran the WU troubleshooter found at https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058</p>
<p>- Manually ran through the steps at that same URL</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing going. I suspect my account (or this license?)&nbsp;may be blocked, as I have a history of not getting builds:</p>
<p>- I was running a dual-boot of Win 8.1 and Win10 Preview before Win10 went GA. The Preview was on an Insider key.</p>
<p>- After Win10 went GA, the Win 8.1 was upgraded. The Preview received an update to GA, but was not ever offered Insider builds again after that. I eventually (after 3 to 4 months)&nbsp;deleted that partition and gave up on Insider.</p>
<p>- With WSL out, I am back in the Insider game. Just that, whatever was keeping me from being offered Insider builds in 2015, doesn't seem to have been an issue with that install, as I now have the same issue again.<br />
<br />
I've since tried one more thing, which didn't really shed a whole lot of light.<br />
- Created a new MS Live account, enrolled it to Insider<br />
- Created a new admin account in this Win10 install using that new MS Live account<br />
- Logged in as that account and chose "Take Control" for insider builds, then linked that new account in that settings window<br />
- Waited several hours<br />
<br />
Still no go. Is there such a thing as&nbsp;a license tied to an account being blocked from receiving builds? I'm at wits' end here.</p>
<p>

<p>The domain aedc.edu is saved in Google Apps and the diogo.edu is local domain which we use only for webpage and we do not have any email account here.</p>
<p>I validate these two domain in Office 365.</p>

<p>How can i migrate all email account from google apps with the domain aedc.edu to Office 365 but using diogo.edu domain</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***(google apps) -&gt; Office 365(*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) without lose any users messages and contacts?</p>
<p>Is possible??</p>

<p>Hi Jorge,</p>
<p>Yes, you can migrate your emails by IMAP migration. All the mailbox items are migrated from the Google Apps to Exchange Online, but for contacts and calendars, you need to export them to a PST file and import then to Office 365 account manually.<br />
The Exchange Online mailboxes aren’t provisioned during the migration process. You need to create the mailboxes in Office 365 before the migration (here *** Email address is removed for privacy ***).<br />
During the migration process, you need to create a CSV file to identify the mailboxes you want to migrate in an IMAP migration batch. Please note that that you need to create all of the O365 mailbox with the new domain for IMAP migration<br />
You can refer to Step 2 for the detailed instruction in the official article:<br />

<p>Hi Jorge,</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>For creating a CSV file, you can create a txt file then rename it with .csv extension. And add the information of EmailAddress, UserName and Password.</p>
<p>Here are the required attributes for each user:<br />
<strong>EmailAddress</strong> specifies the user ID for the user's Exchange Online mailbox.<br />
<strong>UserName</strong> specifies the logon name for the account to use to access the mailbox on the IMAP server.<br />
<strong>Password</strong> specifies the password for the account in the UserName column.</p>
<p>For example, I want to import emails in *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (Office 365 account), the password of the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is password_1. The content of the csv file should be include:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>EmailAddress</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>UserName</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Password</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">password_1</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Camera App crashing, living images not working</h2>
                    I have the 640XL and when it had 8.1 everything worked perfectly, camera app and living images, since upgrading to 10 living images worked sometimes only. After the latest 10 update it stopped working altogether. I can still preview the living images i
 captured before but can't capture any new ones. Since the latest update the cam app is also shaky, crashing at times and since yesterday it crashes everytime i open it. Is anyone else having the same issue? is there a solution for this? is there a way to uninstall
 and reinstall the camera app?

            Hi. The pre-installed camera app cannot be removed from the phone. Since the issue happened after the recent SW update, we suggest trying to check for application updates as well, particularly for the Camera app. You can go to Store &gt; Menu &gt; Downloads
 and Updates &gt; Check for updates. We'd like to hear the outcome of these steps from you. :)&nbsp;

<p>Hi Miles,</p>
<p>Did the sender get a Non-delivery report (NDR)? If yes, please send it to us for further troubleshooting.</p>
<p>According to my experience, this issue might be related to our MX records.</p>
<p>Please contact the administrator let him sign in your DNS host’s website to check whether the MX records are configured correctly.</p>
<p>The MX record you'll add includes a value (the Points to address value) that looks something like this: &lt;MX token&gt;.mail.protection.outlook.com, where &lt;MX token&gt; is a value like MSxxxxxxx.</p>
<p>For example, if your domain is Office365.com, the MX record should be Preference:5; office365-com.mail.protection.outlook.com.</p>
<p>If the issue persists after editing the MX record, please send us your custom domain via private message for further troubleshooting.</p>
<p>I have sent you a Private Message to collect it. Please perform the following steps to check it:</p>
<p>1. Go to the <b>Your details</b> section on the right side of the community site.</p>
<p>2. Click the <b>Private Message</b>.</p>
<p>3. Click the subject title of the response to read the message.</p>

    <title>USB Boot with UEFI tablet - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB Boot with UEFI tablet</h2>
                    <p>Bought new PIPO W2F 8 inch tablet UEFI and GPT 32G eMMC, 2G DDR3.&nbsp; After backing up and cleaning with diskpart, refuses to boot anything but win8.1 setup or 9926 setup from an 8G USB key, with the eMMC wiped.&nbsp; If win8.1 or 9926 is installed, it always goes
 to boot windows first, even when I go to UEFI and put the USB first in boot order.&nbsp; I tried cleaning the eMMC and booting Lubuntu 64, it goes to the efi shell instead, even when UEFI sees the USB stick and has it first boot order.&nbsp; Mind blower is, my laptop
 will boot lubuntu just fine, or the WinPE emergency usb key for EaseUsToDo backup, but tablet will not (laptop is BIOS with MBR).&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last resort - installed Win8.1 to go on a 120G usb Maxtor.&nbsp; attached to tablet.&nbsp; went to disk management, set Maxstor's 350M boot partition active, rebooted, it booted from the Maxstor, set up win 8.1 and EaseusToDo.&nbsp; Now I finally can back up (and more
 importantly, fully restore) the tablet.-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, it gets worse...I tried using System Backup from File History.&nbsp; It does backup well.&nbsp; But when I try to restore, it won't see the 64G SD Card I backed up to in Advanced Options in Emergency Restore.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever happened to "Press F8 to select Advanced Options' on Windows Setup?&nbsp; Maybe I'll have to backup to a 32-64G USB stick for Emergency
</p>
<p>restore to recognize an external disk which just may contain a system backup.......I shouldn't have to "crash" the boot of the tablet twice in order to get emergency mode...and I shouldn't have to clean the eMMC to get a bootable USB key to boot, but I know
 that's not your fault, but U just might want to inform your Intel support team they may have a big problem here.....</p>

            <p>Dear Micheal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry for asking a non relevant question but I desperately want to fix my tablet right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same one as yours. When I tried to upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 itself, it got screwed up and the tablet ran into a boot loop of trying to restore Windows 8.1, basically, I cannot get the tablet boot to windows right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, I can access the BIOS by using keyboard with OTG USB, but the strange thing is I cannot boot from USB stick.</p>
<p>I used the tool Rufus to create an UEFI compatible bootable USB but it does not boot after I choose to boot from USB, in which I always encounter the problem of :</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Recovery</p>
<p>Your PC needs to be repaired</p>
<p>A required device isn't connected or can't be accessed.</p>
<p>Error code: 0xc0000185</p>
<p>[ A text saying I should use recovery tools on my installation media to fix the issue. ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press Windows key for UEFI Firmware Settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please tell me how can you make a bootable USB stick (with the settings of BIOS)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>

    <title>Win 10 Build 10041 Crash after installing Realtek HD Audio Driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wickens001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 Build 10041 Crash after installing Realtek HD Audio Driver</h2>
                    <p>Since installing Build 10041 on my Acer Aspire laptop (dual boot with Win 7) I have been unable to configure or use sound from my stereo speakers. 'Updates' attempted to install a new driver, but the installation failed. Recently I noticed a 'solution' on
 the Forum, whereby it was suggested that the problem of driver installation could be fixed by changing the timeout setting via the Policy settings. I set the timeout to 1800 and the subsequent installation was successful. I was then able to load, configure
 and increase the sound volume via the setup panel. However, when I attempted to test the sound via the setup panel, the system crashed and then looped by restarting, then saying that it was taking some information and then restarting again (Blue Screen display).
 Unfortunately this crash and/or subsequent reloads caused my Win 7 boot to fail -&nbsp; no error messages, just black screen with a few random coloured lines at the top. However I managed to fix the Win7 boot using a Win7 Repair Disk - nothing lost thankfully.
</p>
<p>Any ideas on what to do next for Win10 - or do I just wait for the next ISO to made available?</p>

<p>I've been digging into this, and you're right... By the stats, slightly over 50% of the occurrences of this crash are on Acer Aspire machines.<br />
</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure it's a bug in the Realtek driver. We're talking to Realtek about it now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Good news - the new 5/21 v2.78 Realtek driver installs on my Acer Aspire 6530 and seems to work without the RTKVHDA.sys crash (at least for the first 20 minutes). &nbsp;I am going to re-enable Windows Update and see if the new updates don't break something else.</p>

If the User Info still will not store in Preferences, go to the Tools&gt; Envelopes dialog. Shaded or not, if the Use My Address box is unchecked you can click the Contact Index Card [immediately left of the Font button]... What happens when you do? If the Contacts

<h2>            How to get rid of Text-Enhance Virus</h2>
                    <p>How do I get rid of the piece of garbage virus?&nbsp; It is called Text-Enhance and underlines various words on a given web page.&nbsp; As the cursor goes over said word a small window pops up with a question, etc.&nbsp; It says you can opt out of this but that is not
 true-it still remains like a vicious bloated tick!&nbsp; It doesn't show up with the regular software so it can't be deleted that way.&nbsp; I have run Microsoft Security Essentials, SuperAntiSpyware, Malwarebytes, to no avail.&nbsp; I have tried a "recover" and the blasted
 thing is still there.&nbsp; I go to Google and there is very little meat about this other than a lot of frustrated people.&nbsp; What gives?&nbsp; Is this so new no one has a solution to this envasive slop?&nbsp; I know one thing-I would like to see people who make garbage like
 this taken out and given a terminal enema!!!</p>

    <title>Shared Photos Won&#39;t Preview or Show Thumbnails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rzultowski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shared Photos Won&#39;t Preview or Show Thumbnails</h2>
                    Before yesterday, anytime I opened a shared folder of photos, it would show a bunch of thumbnails in a grid, and I could click on one and then scroll through. Yesterday afternoon, it stopped working. Now if I click on a shared folder all I get is a list
 of the file names. Clicking on one at a time will show a single photo, but there is no way to scroll through. Occasionally a message will appear in the bottom lefthand corner of the screen asking if I want to return to "classic" view. If I click on that, I
 get the grid of icons (not thumbnails-grid image)<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6fea859-64d0-4dc2-98bb-edf05d1821a5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c6fea859-64d0-4dc2-98bb-edf05d1821a5" /></a>,
 but clicking on one just gives me a message saying "hmm, no preview available" (error image)<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/064063d3-130e-4084-b0a6-4a18ce51c54e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/064063d3-130e-4084-b0a6-4a18ce51c54e" /></a>.
 &nbsp;Can somebody please solve this? IT has no idea, and I have to go through large groups of photos all the time, so this is a giant pain.

            <p><span>Hi RZultowski,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The reason why the photos won’t preview or you can’t see them when opened may relate to the URLs of these photos are changed.</span></p>
<p><span>So, I suggest you check the these photos whether still in the previous location with whom you can touch with.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If these photos persist the previous location and haven’t moved to any other libraries, I’d like to confirm the following information with you:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Do these photos in this group are shared from another libraries? </span>
</li><li><span>Please share a new photo to the group to check the outcome.</span></li></ol>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The photos are in the same location - the library was just created a week ago, and the photos were not moved from any other libraries. I uploaded another photo to the library, and the problem persists. But I have this problem with all photo libraries that
 are shared with me - not just this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it worked in the morning, and then suddenly not in the afternoon - so weird. The other weird thing that happened at the same time was my Chrome browser suddenly looked zoomed in/magnified. No idea what happened there. But the photo library problem persisted
 in IE and Firefox, so probably not related.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Sorry - was out of town for a long weekend. To answer your questions above:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I cleared the browser cache and cookies - no change.</li><li>No one else in the group has a problem.</li><li>I click on the group "video" - click "files" - then click the "photos" folder</li><li>Yes, it is a folder within the video group. And I have the same problem with any photos I want to view.</li></ol>
<p>And yes, it does look as if you can scroll to the next photo, but I get the same "hmmm, no preview available" when I attempt it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the classic view notification (lower left):</p>

            <p>Hi RZultowski,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your updates. <br />
<br />
First, I’d like to explain that you may see two user interfaces in Office 365 Group and they display pictures differently:<br />
<br />
In modern libraries experience, you can see the thumbnails in a grid as mentioned in your first reply. If you click one picture, it will be displayed with arrow keys to let you scroll to the previous or later one as shown below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e07b20d8-c805-459c-999c-06f2a469a05f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e07b20d8-c805-459c-999c-06f2a469a05f" height="271" width="416" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In classical libraries experience, the pictures will be displayed in grid of icons with no thumbnails and there are no arrow keys to scroll pictures as shown below:
<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8db2922-3d97-4f50-bbaf-2fa32a46ffb3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8db2922-3d97-4f50-bbaf-2fa32a46ffb3" height="284" width="281" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/288e26c3-fee0-44db-b9fc-5b53502b6740" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/288e26c3-fee0-44db-b9fc-5b53502b6740" height="227" width="387" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the issue you encountered, I attempt to make a summary to clarify the situation. Please correct me if I misunderstood.
<br />
<br />
1. This issue happens to all the pictures in this group folder and other users don’t have this issue when view these pictures in the browser.<br />
<br />
2. Pictures can be displayed well as a single photo in modern user experience, but there is no way to scroll through.<br />
<br />
3. If you click one picture in classical libraries experience, you will get the error message “ Hmmm.. looks like this file doesn't have a preview we can show you.”.<br />
<br />
4. The issue occurs randomly.<br />
<br />
For the point 1, could you trying logging in to your account in a different client and see if there is any improvement? This can help identify whether the issue is related to the client or the cloud account.<br />
<br />
For the point 2, could you provide a screenshot after you click picture in modern libraries experience for our reference?<br />
<br />
If possible, could you check how the pictures display in a different group?<br />
<br />
Moreover, to further investigate the issue, we'd like to collect a network trace log and your tenant information as we may involve the related team for assistance. I have sent a private message to collect them. You can check it via the link below:<br />

            <p>Answering your summary:</p>
<p>1. Correct. And it is not just restricted to this folder. Any photos I try to view do this.</p>
<p>2. No - I cannot view photos in the modern view, that's when I get the "hmm, no preview available"&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The classic view is a list (like your second photo above). I can view those singly, but can't scroll</p>
<p>4. The issue is not random - it happens with any photo library I try to view</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have logged in through Mozilla and IE and Chrome - the issue is the same on all three.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the modern view (I assume this is modern because of the prompt in the lower left - circled in red):</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a833e5e-e26b-4194-8df9-8b8f926905ec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a833e5e-e26b-4194-8df9-8b8f926905ec" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here is the classic view:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9154eb2e-8785-492d-8df4-4d9e07010d29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9154eb2e-8785-492d-8df4-4d9e07010d29" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please note, both of these screenshots are from a different group then the previous one. I created this group yesterday. No one else has any problems viewing the thumbnails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will respond to your private message once I talk to the IT department as I will need permission to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Macro for compiling data from a workbook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> betsynovice  say:</h3>
<h2>            Macro for compiling data from a workbook</h2>
                    <p>I received help with creating an Excel workbook with multiple named sheets via a macro used with an Excel list of page names.&nbsp; I have done all of the work I wanted to do on the individual sheets.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would like to do now is compile all of the information on the worksheets into a single Excel spreadsheet.&nbsp; Does someone have a macro that can help me do that?</p>

<p>Norman, I tried running it, just to see what happens.&nbsp; I got an error message, and when I clicked on Debug, it highlighted the following line:</p>

<p>Hi Betsy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If. as you indicated, you wish to copy columns A:B from each of the detail sheets, then this instruction should be fine and it works without problem in my test workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I would expect a runtime 1004 error if the macro encountered an empty sheet.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t call particular number on Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> briannokell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t call particular number on Skype</h2>
                    <p>I can call virtually any of the numbers I try on Skype with the exception of one particular number that is in Kansas. I am calling from Washington State, and using Skype in the form of an older Netgear SPH200D phone. I put it into service recently after
 a few years of non-use but it started right up and worked mostly well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't connect with one particular phone (316) 588-XXXX. When I call, it shows 'failed to connect' as the error. This is a regular call that my 93 year old mother makes every other week, and tomorrow if it doesn't connect, I may try a computer to connect
 to Skype, or we also have a TV with a Skype app. If they don't work, it can use a cell phone also but the Skype phone when it works is really handy. If anyone has experience with certain area codes, exchanges or if there are some types of phone service that
 are not compatible with Skype (VOIP?) that info would be helpful too. Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to fluctuations in the public switched telephone network (PTSN) we cannot always guarantee the quality or reliability of calls made from Skype. Such issues are usually temporary, so if you have problems calling a specific number, we suggest trying again
 later. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if using a different device didn't work, the number might not&nbsp;be supported by Skype. Unfortunately, Skype does not support calls to all number ranges in every country and/or phone provider. There are certain premium-priced or geographic/country
 specific numbers which are forbidden and cannot be reached using Skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In&nbsp;the event that you're able to call the number using&nbsp;a different device but can't connect&nbsp;using your Skype phone, you might want to check
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/skype_accountms-skype_number/my-skype-dual-phone-ata-is-not-receiving-calls-why/e449db3c-4b63-4e81-8d14-3dac0626713b">
this thread.</a> I also recommend to set up <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is-caller-identification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up?q=caller+ID" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Caller ID</a>. Most of the phone providers are blocking unknown callers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

            If I understand you correctly, what you want is more <em>'as you select' </em>
than <em>'as you type'</em>, i.e. as each selection is made in an unbound combo box, or an unbound check box is checked/unchecked in the case of the Boolean (yes/no) columns, the form's data will be refreshed progressively.&nbsp; The simplest way to do this is to
 base the form on a query which references each of the controls as parameters.<br />
<br />
Let's assume you have a table MyTable with two text columns FooText and BarText and two Boolean columns IsFoo and IsBar.&nbsp; Your form is named frmMyForm and the unbound controls are named cboFoo, cboBar, chkFoo and chkBar.&nbsp; The query would be like this:<br />
<br />
SELECT *<br />
FROM MyTable<br />
WHERE (FooText = Forms!frmMyForm!cboFoo<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR Forms!frmMyForm!cboFoo IS NULL)<br />
AND (BarText = Forms!frmMyForm!cboBar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR Forms!frmMyForm!cboBar IS NULL)<br />
AND (IsFoo = Forms!frmMyForm!chkFoo <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR Forms!frmMyForm!chkFoo IS NULL)<br />
AND (IsBar = Forms!frmMyForm!chkBar<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR Forms!frmMyForm!chkBar IS NULL);<br />
<br />
The FooText and BarText columns could equally well be of a number or date/time data type; the SQL would be exactly the same.&nbsp; Note that the chkFoo and chkBar check boxes would need to be triple state so that they could be left Null, which shows as greyed out.<br />
<br />
You have two options when designing the form:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; The form can be bound to the above query, and be in continuous forms view, with the unbound controls can be in its header.&nbsp; In this case you'd requery the form in the AfterUpdate event procedure of each combo box with:<br />
<br />
Me.Requery<br />
<br />
2. The form containing the unbound controls can be unbound, and within it would be embedded a subform based on the above query.&nbsp; In the AfterUpdate event procedure of each unbound control, instead of Requerying the form, the subform control (i.e. the control
 which houses the subform) would be requeried, e.g.<br />
<br />
Me.sfcMySubform.Requery<br />
<br />
The subform can be in datasheet view or continuous forms view.<br />

            The&nbsp; query's WHERE clause has an exclamation mark instead of an ampersand.&nbsp; It should be:<br />
<br />
WHERE AgencyINFO LIKE "*" &amp; Forms!splitAgencySearch!SrchText <strong>&amp;</strong> "*";
<br />
<br />
If&nbsp; by 'I'd like the search bar to filter by any text in any column' you mean having a single unbound search text box in which you'd enter a text value which might be in any column then the query's WHERE condition would be like this:<br />
<br />
WHERE [Organization Entity/Agency Name(Legal Name)] LIKE "*" &amp;&nbsp; Forms!splitAgencySearch!SrchText &amp; "*"<br />
OR [Subsidary Name]LIKE "*" &amp;&nbsp; Forms!splitAgencySearch!SrchText &amp; "*"<br />
&lt; and so on for other columns&gt;<br />
OR Forms!splitAgencySearch!SrchText IS NULL;<br />
<br />
You'd then requery the form in the SrchText control'd AfterUpdate event procedure.<br />
<br />
I can't comment on the use of a split form as its not something I would use.&nbsp; For that sort of functionality I'd design it myself by correlating a subform with its parent form, and vice versa.&nbsp; You'll find an example in FindRecord.zip in my public databases
 folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
In this little demo file the simulated split form includes a single unbound navigational combo box, but it would be feasible to include other controls to restrict the rows returned, or a single control as described above.&nbsp; The parent form and subform would
 both be based on a query which references the unbound control(s) as parameter(s).<br />

            I only had Windows 7 installed 2 years ago, why is that not part of the Ultimate package? &nbsp;With it being called Ultimate, I would have thought it would have been the best of everything at the time?

<h2>            Onenote not visible in sharepoint</h2>
                    <p>I have sharepoint 2010 and web apps on W2008R2 <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have created a doc lib for onenote</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>From onenote 2010 on a W7 PC I create a shared notbook in the onenote library on sharepoint.&nbsp; That appears to work OK and I can create notes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>From internet explorer I can browse the sharepoint library.&nbsp; There is now a folder with the new notbook name,&nbsp; but the folder is empty.</p>
<p>From another PC running onenote,&nbsp; I try to open the new notebook - but when I browse to the new notebook I see "There are no documents of the specified type in the document library"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am connecting as administrator.</p>
<p>I assume there is some sort of permissions issue.&nbsp; Of course I have searched the web but can't find any cases of a similar problem</p>
<p>If I go to the doc library and upload a .one file from my PC,&nbsp; the webapps feature works fine and I can read the notebook.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>ps - I have checks the sync status and it is failing with 0xE000076C<br />

    <title>Missing contacts when syncing. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dale rockwell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing contacts when syncing.</h2>
                    <p>Phone Manufacturer: Samsung<br />
2. Phone Model: SGH-i917R<br />
3. Mobile Operator: Rogers (Canada)<br />
4. Phone Operating System version: Windows Phone 7.5<br />
5. Zune software version: Haven't installed yet.<br />
6. Computer Operating System version: Windows 7 Ultimate</p>
<p>1. I just got a Samsung Focus Windows Phone running the latest version on Window Phone software.</p>
<p>2. I added my hotmail.ca account.</p>
<p>3. Upon syncing not all contacts came to the phone; some do though.</p>
<p>4. When I go into the account from settings the only content it shows as being able to sync is "email".&nbsp; Also the account cannot be deleted.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; I also have a facebook and twitter account linked to that account.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; I also have my work exchange account set up on the phone.</p>
<p>6. I added an old hotmail.com account and the sync options include the tasks, calander, and contacts.&nbsp; Other than the email address (.ca vs .com)&nbsp;both hotmail accounts use the same setting and servers adnwere set up via the Windows Live account set up option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why are only some of my contacts syncing?</p>
<p>Why does the hotmail.ca account only have the option for syncing email?</p>
<p>Most accounts have the option of syncing and deleting the account.&nbsp; The hotmail.ca account does not have a delete option.&nbsp; Why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The first Windows Live account added to the phone cannot be deleted without a hard reset because it's the account that controls apps, Xbox Live, Zune Pass and all other Microsoft services on the phone.<br />

            The first Windows Live account is special as stated above. Also, calendar and contact syncing for that account cannot be turned off, hence no options for it.<br />
<br />
If you search for the missing contacts from the People Hub, do they appear?<br />
<br />
In People&gt;tap the ... at the bottom right&gt;Settings&gt;filter my contact list, is Windows Live off by any chance?<br />

            <p>I checked the filter the the hotmail account is included.&nbsp; When I search from the people hub it does not find the contact.&nbsp; I also forced the sync just to be sure.&nbsp; No luck.</p>
<p>What is also interesting is&nbsp;I decided to add one of the missing contacts on the phone and it did sync back to hotmail.&nbsp; I then&nbsp;deleted the original from Hotmail on the web.&nbsp; I then made a change on Hotmail web to that contact created on the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't
 sync the change back to the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then made a change to one of the contacts that did sync and it came down to the phone.</p>

<h2>            Nokia 5610 Memory Card problem</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I have Nokia 5601 with latest firmware upgraded to V 04.81. I am facing problem when I try to copy data say music files onto my memory card (came with phone 1GB microSD) either via PC suit or via data storage mode it returns me I/O device error whenever it
 cross the 40% usage and after that I cannot copy any thing on the card and phone hangs up until I remove the batteries and start the phone again. At first I thought problem is with memory card but I have another microSD card and it phone returns the same error
 whenever it reaches the capacity of 40% say 432MB out of 969MB.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions and advice please so that I can get rid of this error.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

 the phone it's not responding. but the memory it's not even half full. just 461MB. i restored the factory settings but nothing, i formated the card and nothing.if i delete from the card it will work. and it will accept what i wanna copy in it, but till the
 memroy it's at 460MB, not more.and if i update the library for the music player it sais that no songs were copied, or that 3 videos were deleted, and i don't have anu videos on it. I'm going tomorrow to he O2 shop.i hope they'll do something
        </p>
