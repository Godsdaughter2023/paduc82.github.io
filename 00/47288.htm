<h2>            Open File Location Command Returns Search Results</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows 7 Professional Service Pack 1 64-bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a folder that contains numeours shortcuts to&nbsp;files. I right-click the shortcuts and use the Open File Location command to locate the actual file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some cases, the command opens a list of search results from several days ago. That is, I used Windows search to find a list of .chm files. Now when I use Open FIle Location, the list of search results is returned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have other shortcuts in the folder. The file types that the shortcuts reach are the same for all, that is, all the shortcuts&nbsp;open .chm files. These other shortcuts work as expected when I use Open File Location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recreated one of the problem shortcuts. This did not fix the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone tell me how to resovle this problem so that I can use Open File Location with all shortcuts?</p>

            <p>Sumanth BM,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Store and display recently opened items in the Start menu and the taskbar option was turned off already. The Store and display recently opened programs in the Start menu is turned off also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I clear the Recent Items folder that you mentioned?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran Fix It. The message was "We did not detect any problems and therefore no fixes were applied."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you help further?</p>

            <p>tresysion,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for taking time to reply. I reviewed both sites you provided but didn't find a resolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I have found is interesting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used the following steps to create the shortcuts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Execute a Windows search for *.chm files. I suspect the file extension is irrelevant.</p>
<p>List of results is presented.</p>
<p>Using Alt+drag, created shortcuts for the file names in the results list.</p>
<p>Right-click a new shortcut and click Open File Location. The search results list opens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The behavior is the same if I copy the file name and paste a shortcut. The behavior is the same if I right-click the file name and click create shortcut.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's worth noting that I have used the steps above with Windows XP numerous times with the desired results so the defect is related to Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some way, the properties of the shortcut remember the search results, that is, the shortcut is attached to the search results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reviewed the properties of the shortcut. The values in the Target and Start in boxes are correct. There's nothing to indicate a connection to the search results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I locate the actual file, which requires extra work when working with numerous files, and create the shortcut, the Open File Location command works as expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help. If you have any more ideas, please don't hesitate to share.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Hi Anna Bon, good to hear or read you. Hope you can figure this one out. Spent days trying to troubleshoot the problem. I'll address the questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Had a remote to the mouse in the USB working at one time recognizing the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;After connecting a Android (UT OH, apple) to remove the content (files) of the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Around then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Not noticed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Hmm. Thinking. It won't recognize anything plugged in it now. Says working properly. Driver OK. Wonder if it became contaminated? Uninstalled the port USB in Device Manager. Then reinstalled them several ways. Always comes back OK. But nothing recognized
 in the USB. Try new downloaded Driver? Could it be turned off in BIOS or CMOS. Not use to Win 10. Pushed the wrong thing and rebooted to a test screen. Never seen before. Finally keyed in the windows key reactivated operating system for user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;My friend is an elderly man that prefers the mouse. Was his old phone I talked into getting his pictures of his plane to store in the computer so he could give it away. He should be responsible to for letting me do it. Needs the mouse to navigate. I Placed
 an order for his business the other day. I'm not on the Internet every day. But if you can help. Please do. This ones got me dumbfounded. Couldn't blame it on his wife's Cat walking on the keyboard. Didn't do it to XP on my laptop when I plugged it in. Show
 you where I am. I'm using 2000 on a jukebox PC. Inspire me Anna Bon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; That is exceptional advise. I will apply the technique as I enter the laptops OS. There is some measure of it solving this awkward impairment on the machines interaction. I'll keep you apprised on what occurs either way.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Anna, I followed the directions and the USB still doesn't pick up any device I plug into it. In the device manager status says it working. I updated the drivers but it did not connect to internet to get it. Uninstalled USB's then rebooted. Nothing responding
 (mouse Logitech, SanDisk flash drive,) Light works when plugged in. Not showing USB icon in task-bar bellow right. Laptop is a Gateway NV79C52u Windows 10. Is there something in the BIOS or CMOS that could disable it. I'm writing from that computer now. Hmm
 m. What could it be.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Super Slow Speed When Downloading From Marketplace - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Super Slow Speed When Downloading From Marketplace</h2>
                    
<p>I'm running my Xbox One with a wired internet connection, and when I test the speed via the console I get the following speeds: Download 69.1mb Upload 19.7mb</p>

<p>Whenever I buy something from the store it takes an absolute age to download, as an example, I started downloading the Black ops 3 Beta at 10pm UK time today, as i write this the time is 11.57pm, and my download progress is only 14%. It has been like this
 now for the last week or so, usually it's pretty quick to download from the store, it also took me around 20mins to download Don't Starve, which is only 392mb.</p>

<p>All of my settings on the console and the router are correct, so if someone could tell me what is causing this and how to fix it I would really appreciate it, as it stands i can't really use the marketplace as I don't want to be leaving my console on all
 night to download something that should be quicker than what it currently is.</p>

I have a File Server running ADFS

<p>I go to devices and printers and do a troubleshoot, but it does not show a problem with the printing.</p>
<p>I even click to resume, but it continues to show document printing. This little HP printer for my laptop works well</p>
<p>when it wants to. Why is it stopping before completion? Thank you!!</p>

<h2>            Take off paywall for free to play games</h2>
                    Hey everyone,so theirs this thing going around about how Microsoft should take off the paywall for free to play games like Xbox one.Seriously Microsoft I know it's something you might not want to do but its something that you need to do.Like games such
 as fortnite is free but I want to actually be able to play it for free.Just like how you guys patched the way to play fortnite without gold.People need to be able to play games actually free and I promise if you guys do this your community would love your
 so much&gt;You may even get more members and xbox and people may say xbox is good again.And realized there are more people that hate xbox rather than people who actually have one.So maybe this will help xbox.Thank you

            It's unlikely that something like this would come to pass with titles requiring online capabilities (like all F2P titles) since the versions you play on your Xbox console are being passed through the platform's servers. It's a different story with PC and
 mobile versions of similar F2P games...

<p>highly unlikely this will ever happen with xbox live because full price games would then also be questioned on needing xbox live gold to play them when you have had to pay for the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the cost of a membership is of concern then you should try the microsoft rewards page and also the app on your console as you can earn rewards such as memberships for doing a few things everyday.</p>

<h2>            Epson Perfection 2450 photo scanner does not work on Vista computer.</h2>
                    I had used the driver for my Epson Perfection 2450 photo scanner on Windows XP service pack 2 and 3.&nbsp; the driver is Epson 12242.&nbsp; It is not working on the Windows Vista computer.&nbsp; I did the trouble shooting through windows without success. Has anyone found
 a solution for this one?

<h3> expertbigwheelpilot2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why will my windows 8 license expire soon&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>Today (Saturday February 14, 2015) my computer gave me notice that my windows 8 license will expire on Monday.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I only get two days notice?</span></p>
<p><span>Why does windows 8 license expire?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I purchased my desktop from i-buy-power.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The order date was June 12, 2013 and the shipping date was June 21, 2013.<span>&nbsp;
</span>ibuypower.com is a large distributor of computers so licensing is legitimate.<span>&nbsp;
</span>“WIN8 PRO 64bit DVD” and “MS Windows WIN8 Pro Royalty” is listed on my original computer invoice.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft community search suggested if I change major components on my computer I will have to purchase a new license.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have not changed anything in my computer.<span>&nbsp; </span>I just added a USB printer and two USB paper scanners.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I stayed with windows 8 because I cannot use windows 8.1 because I am dependent on legacy software and devices that 8.1 may have abandoned support.<span>&nbsp;
</span>windows 8.1 may have abandoned support for Windows Mobile Device Center that I use to sync my HP iPAQ RX3115.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Why does windows 8 license expire?<span>&nbsp;
</span>What do I do to remedy this?</span></p>

<p><span>I do not believe the cause of this was malware.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I did not find out about this with an error message.<span>&nbsp; </span>I found out by an alert in the “Action Center”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There was no link or request for money.<span>&nbsp; </span>I follow very strict security practices so I doubt I got malware.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I use avast free for my virus and malware protection.<span>&nbsp;
</span>As far as I know I use default settings with some minor adjustments.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In other words I do not have avast set to do anything aggressive that would interfere with the operation of my computer more than default settings.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Richard Diver, thank you for your comments on win8.1.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I think I will stay with win8 till win10 is available for purchase.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I just do not want to risk problems if win8.1 upgrade causes any problems.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I just do not have the energy to solve any problems.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for all the help.</span></p>

<h2>            Hotspot &#40;netsh wlan start hostednetwork&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to share my Windows 10 Lenovo laptop's internet connection through the cmd via netsh wlan start hostednetwork.</p>
<p>I already know you first have to enter set hostednetwork mode=allow ssid="ssid" pass="pass," but then when I enter netsh wlan start hostednetwork, I receive the error "The hosted network couldn't be started.</p>
<p>The group or resource is not in the correct state to perform the requested operation."</p>
<p>I have looked online for months to no avail for a solution, I have already tried hidden network adapters in device manager and anything else I have seen suggested, I have deduced that I am missing Microsoft hosted network virtual adapter, but cannot find
 it in device manager, or through the add hardware process, or the Microsoft website. I am routing my phone's data to my laptop through an app called pdaNet+, and while the computer allows me to access the internet, in the wifi settings, it says "connected,
 no internet," I know this is not the case however, because I am currently typing this question on the microsoft website through that connection.</p>

            <span>Hi DorksBilly.</span><br />
<span>Your network card hardware probably doesn't support the Hosted Network.</span><span>
</span><span>Alternatively, you can use the integrated Windows Mobile Hotspot feature.</span><br />
<span>Open CMD or PowerShell and type<strong> netsh wlan show driver</strong> press enter.</span><span>
</span><span>Look in the list, Supported Hosted Network, if it says NO, your network card does not support this feature.</span>

            Hi  DorksBilly 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />    Open Mobile hotspot settings (Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Mobile hotspot)
<br />    Turn on mobile hotspot
<br />    Under "Related Settings", click Change adapter options
<br />    Take note of which adapter is connected to the internet and which adapter is your mobile hotspot (typically named "Local Area Connection* [#]")
<br />    Right click the adapter that is connected to the internet and click Properties
<br />    Go to the Sharing tab
<br />    Uncheck "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection". If it is already unchecked, skip this step.
<br />    Click OK
<br />    Again, open Properties &gt; Sharing for the same adapter.
<br />    Check "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection"
<br />    (If you get a popup that says "Internet Connection Sharing is currently enabled...", click OK.)
<br />    Under "Home networking connection:", select the mobile hotspot adapter
<br />    Click OK
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network adapters
<br />Right click then uninstall all virtual adapters
<br />
<br />Open Start then type: regedit
<br />Right click Regedit then click Run as administrator
<br />Navigate to the following registry key:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WlanSvc\Parameters\HostedNetworkSettings\
<br />
<br />Delete the following key: 
<br />HostedNetworkSettings
<br />
<br />Restart then try again.
<br />
<br />Run the Network adapter troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Network adapters
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart to see if it works.
<br />
<br />If not, you can try updating both your Network adapter drivers or uninstall them.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand network adapters
<br />Right click your adapter, click uninstall
<br />
<br />Exit Device Manager then restart
<br />
<br />Windows 10 will re-detect them and reinstall them.

<h2>            100&#37; CPU utilization of Surface Book</h2>
                    <p>I'm having recently bought Microsoft Surface Book with 8GB RAM and i5 processor. Often I'm facing issues of 100% CPU usage and my PC gets hanged with very few running applications like word, PPT. This is not very common for any type of laptop. Specially
 for this expensive laptop I cannot even imagine.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I even find it gets hanged for fraction of second which is not normal as I am not running any heavy software on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know the reason and importantly the solution ?</p>

<p>Hi Gaurav,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be experiencing high CPU usage because of a software problem. An app or service may be behind this. When did this problem start? Was anything installed recently? You can check the CPU consumption of your apps in Task Manager. If you see that a particular
 app has high resource usage, then I suggest that you update that app, or remove then reinstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please check for updates in Windows Update and install the available updates. To further update and scan the system, please run Windows Defender. Learn more about installing definition updates through Windows Defender by going

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another computer with identical hardware.&nbsp; Motherboard's serial numbers are consecutive. My other computer displays "Windows 10(C:\Windows):Current OS;Default OS" in MSCONFIG.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I reinstall Windows 10 or Windows 7?&nbsp; I made a backup of the system after install but I think a restore won't fix the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; The partition should be removed and a reformat with Windows 10.&nbsp; I'm okay with doing this as long as Windows 10 can be
 reactivated. I believe the only way to fix this without problem in future.&nbsp; What should I do?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a new user account and made it admin also.&nbsp; Ran msconfig and it comes out the same "Windows 7(C:\Windows):Current OS;Default OS".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I included my disk management setup.&nbsp; Does this look normal?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have another computer (identical hardware) which is setup the same way.</p>
<p>msconfig shows "Windows 10(C:\Windows):Current OS;Default OS"</p>

            <p>I try creating a new boot.ini from the repair console, and Run bootrec.exe /fixmbr from CMD. This did not work.<br />
<br />
It seems that this is not a problem only found in Windows 10. This happen on Windows 7 PC's upgrading to Windows 8.x also.<br />
<br />
Windows 8.x answer: Upgrading Windows 7 to Windows 8: If this does not seem to create any problem the best advice "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" and just ignore it. Windows 8 shares a few components with Windows 7 and it's compatible or do a clean install
 maybe if this bothers you.<br />
<br />
The problem never has caused any error or performance issues. This "problem" has been corrected when Windows 10 1511/10286 update installed. Now msconfig in boot section reports "Windows 10(C:\Windows):Current OS;Default OS"</p>
<p>
</p><p>My&nbsp; "Problem" seems not a issue but glad it has been corrected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You for you help.</p>

<p>This is the level of service you receive from Support when you file a complaint. They dont read your email and delete it, so one else knows.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<div>
<p><span><span>First, I’d like to say up till now, I had been pleasantly happy with the service from Xbox Live, until of course I decide to go to gold and
 play online with the same email address I have used to setup my development licence (Full) (<strong>[mod removed]</strong>) - Live username is
<strong>[mod removed]</strong></span></span><span><span>I setup the above account, I purchased live membership and I even buy 2500 points at the same time. Lastly I treat myself to a map pack for COD: BO and all is good,
 until I notice that I only have 500 points remaining from 2500 when the pack cost me 1200. Not right I thought, but I left it as nothing I could do at that time. So I waited until today to call you, I was told on the phone that it was an error, that my bank
 had an issue (No information was given to me of this, and my bank are pretty good to be fair). ‘Possibly your address is wrong’ I was told and that my I would be refunded the 2000 points it cost me. I was puzzled by this as the transactions all went through
 using MY bank card and at no point did I have issues. The Customer Service Rep then said he would remove the block on my account (Didn’t know there was one!) and that I would now be able to re purchase items again.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I asked about the pack I downloaded, to be told that I could see if it worked, and not to worry about it. I questioned it again and was told
 not to worry. I ended the call happy that I was going to get a refund and somehow was lucky that I have been given a map pack too. Good service all round I thought.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Unfortunately that’s where it all went wrong. I have now received an email from you saying that my account is suspended for theft. First off,
 that’s a lie, second, your accusing me without providing proof of wrongdoing and it’s in text, so that’s libel surely?. I don’t want to get funny about this, but I also pay for another live membership from the same bank account already and I also pay for a
 Microsoft Development Licence which I am completely signed up for so all in all over £260 pounds spent on Xbox related things and yet you treat people like this? Such bad service, I’m disgusted to be honest.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I’d like the following points answered please:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Who can I complain too, in writing, email and via the phone? Do not tell me there is no one, because that is simply bad service and a lie.
 If this is not answered I will continue until I speak to someone high enough to get this fixed! I will not settle until I have been apologised too for being accused of stealing when clearly you have no proof and I have not committed any theft and I am either
 FULLY reimbursed or re activated.</span></span> </li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span><span>I can provide copies of email addresses, bank statements and also my cards. I have all the account details and I can even play a recorded
 copy of the phone call I had today (06/06/2011) back to anyone I need too to prove that all was, as far as I am aware, on the level. I have proof of Microsoft Development Licence too which just as I’m sure you aware you have to be seriously vetted before you
 are given full status. I have this. </span></span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span><span>At what point did anyone think "Ill contact the user...." before suspending my account? Or does this not happen because either you don’t
 have time, so a simple rule of "Well, it looks too complicated to investigate correctly so we will just ban him..." or you don’t have the manpower to contact people?</span></span>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Refund of amounts paid? Seeing as I don’t have use of Xbox live because of something that isn’t my fault, by law I’m entitled to a refund.
 In my view, I’m happy to lose the two days I was allowed to browse your store and play 6 hours of COD: BO. So, let’s say you owe £5.00 instead. Apparently according to the phone call today I’m getting a refund of £17.99 already, but I need confirmation that
 this is going to happen and lastly the 500 points I had left over need to be refunded too.
</span></span></li></ul>
<p><span><span>Personally, I’d like to just be re-instated, I don’t care about the map pack that much, but if it makes you happy ill delete it and buy it
 again, using the same card I used last time, the same one I use for my shopping at Tesco’s and also on Play.com. Neither of this come round and takes the milk and Blu-ray’s back so why are you different? It’s more about the insult than anything. To think I
 can throw this much money at you, do nothing wrong, not be notified you believe there is an issue and then accuse me of stealing whilst quickly running away without giving anyone any route to complain or reopen an investigation.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This whole experience is disgusting and I need answers; I’m 34 years old and I’m not going to give up after one post. I expect a phone call
 (you have my details) or an email with the answers to my questions or at the very least an apology with re instatement. Anything less with make this whole debacle worse.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I’m very angry about this, It needs sorting and please, do not add insult on insult by treating me like I’m just another Xbox live user, I’m
 not, and I WILL take this as far as I need too to reach my goal.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Shaun Hall.</span></span></p>

<p>Mate, I'm very sorry to hear about this. It sounds like a grand miscommunication. Have you spoken to anyone in phone support since you received this notice? It doesn't look like it, from your post. Because all billing issues are handled exclusively by phone
 support, I urge you to call them at your earliest convenience to work this out. Feel free to keep me posted here (you can send me the SR number you receive in a PM, along with a link to this thread). I hope we can get this resolved for you ASAP.</p>

    <title>W10 Store &#34;Something happened on our end&#34; error, but only for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ikovac  say:</h3>
<h2>            W10 Store &#34;Something happened on our end&#34; error, but only for apps you never installed before. Same account on Win 8.1 phone store works&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I decided to post this since I have a slightly different problem that gives this "popular" error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simptom:</p>
<p>I have numerous Windows 10 (1607)&nbsp;and Windows 8.1 devices. I've been getting this error for a week now<strong> on W10 devices only</strong>! All worked fine and without any changes from my side I started to get this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. On Win 10 devices (5 PCs and tablets and Lumia 950XL)<strong> I can install all previously downloaded apps (My apps), but not any new
</strong>since I get this error.</p>
<p>2. On Windows 8.1 phone<strong>&nbsp;I&nbsp;can install even new (not previously downloaded) apps</strong>. Then they become "My apps" and then I can even install them on Windows 10 devices (PC and phone)! Now this made me curious - since it means the error is not
 on my side!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried (<strong>after the error started to show</strong>):</p>
<p>1. Win10 PC - Checked Location, region settings&nbsp;- all match my language and region - Croatia</p>
<p>2. Win10 PC - wsreset didn't help</p>
<p>3. MS account - Since I recently bought Lumia in the US, I noticed that my MS account&nbsp;billing info also updated to US address and everything. My country setting was wrong and&nbsp;I changed it and even&nbsp;tried migrating account to another country (Croatia) on XBOX
 web pages - got error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now&nbsp;I know there are more things I can try, but what is the point of trying fixing one device W10 store&nbsp;when my old&nbsp;Win 8.1 phone&nbsp;store works with the very same account?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like Win10+my account&nbsp;is the culprit since PCs, tablets AND Win10&nbsp;phone have the exactly same error at the same time. It is unlikely&nbsp;that they are all broken locally in the same way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the best way to try to solve this? Wait for the update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ivan</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have the exact same problem and this attempt made no difference. It seems to be a BITS cache issue that arrived just after the recent anniversary update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even went so far as to reinstall Windows 10, which after signing into my account, I instantly lost the ability to download new apps. I can only download apps I already own. Creating a new account is out of the question since I have many apps, movies, games,
 and so on that I've purchased. Besides, what is to say that after making a new account, if it breaks again, I'm back in the original situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a loss since it clearly seems like something that needs to be patched by Microsoft.</p>

<p>I still think its the Windows anniversary update that caused these problems since my account was perfectly fine just before. Now even after a fresh install, when I sign into my account, I'm unable to download any new apps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I solved it (at least for me :))! <strong>It is a setting in XBOX One Online Safety</strong>! Don't ask me why - because I don't know. To me MS just forgot to tell us this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So go to XBOX settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://account.xbox.com/en-US/Settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>And check <strong>Buy and Download </strong>section. I had it on Nothing since
<strong>I DON'T HAVE XBOX ONE</strong>! But it caused Windows 10 Store not be able to download anything! I remind you Windows 8.1&nbsp;doesn't have this issue! So I set it to Free and VOILA - I can install Free apps from all of my Wind 10 devices (checked on laptops,
 tablets and Lumia 950xl). Set it to Anything if you regularily buy stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>So I guess some Windows update integrated XBOX app and Store app settings and broke this for all people who had it on Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope it fixes this nasty issue for you guys too.</p>

    <title>Xbox One Stereo Headset Mikrofon reagiert schlecht - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One Stereo Headset Mikrofon reagiert schlecht</h2>
                    
<p>Grundsätzlich bin ich ja zufrieden mit dem HS, aber das Mikrofon reagiert nicht sonderlich gut. Als Beispiel beim Standard Chat Headset kann man flüstern und die Leute hören einen trotzdem gut. Beim Stereo Headset können einen die Leute nur hören, wenn man
 normal laut spricht und jetzt kommt das absurde, denn so ist es Partychat wenn man jedoch im Spielchat ist, muss man richtig laut sprechen und selbst dann reagiert es manchmal auch einfach garnicht.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ist dieses Problem bekannt und steht bereits eine Lösung vor der Tür?</p>

    <title>How to get help in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> perdrix52  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get help in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I try to get help in Windows 10, I get directed to a Bing search page which has nothing whatsoever to do with the window I selected Help from (or pressed F1 in).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This (to put it bluntly) is total rubbish.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 had (normally) very useful help screens which came up when you asked for help, but this is useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how can I get help that actually displays something relevant to what I'm doing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't relish trawling the internet search results (which 4 times out of 10 are totally incorrect) for information on how to use the part of Windows I'm in right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was all triggered by selecting Help from the menu of:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Security and Maintenance\Change Security and Maintenance settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>Grrrrr Snarl.</p>

</p><p>Ah Bing.&nbsp; I love to hate it.&nbsp; Unfortunately the help content that win 7 had has/is being moved to online help in an effort to keep it up to date and to slim down the footprint of win 10.</p>
<p>

</blockquote>
<p>ZigZag3143's comment was specific; however, perdrix52's question really goes beyond the shift to online help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me rephrase Dave's very cogent point: How can I get <strong>SPECIFIC</strong> topic-relevant help in W10?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, either the local .HLP/.CHM help engines would, at least, try to display their closest topic of relevance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today's "new &amp; improved" Help is fed from Cortana into Bing; if Bing can find a relevant help item, it shows it first within a box, then all other search items. (Editorial comment: that helps for the specific question asked; however, if you need follow-up
 or branching details, this is unsatisfactory.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't have a help&nbsp; topic, then it just shows search items. (No joy here, sports fans!)</p>

            I agree with the posters above. &nbsp;I am less concerned with transitioning to online help, but I wish there was still offline help as I am not always connected. &nbsp;But having every help button reference a specific link ID that then points to a generic Bing
 search is crazy. &nbsp;It should point to the help file for the app and for the dialog I am on. &nbsp;For example, I am in Windows Media Player -&gt; Options -&gt;Player tab, I hit help because I want to know what a particular setting is, and it is useless. &nbsp;At lease do a
 Bing search for "windows media player 12 options." &nbsp;Even when you hit alt, help, it directs you to nothing.

            <p>Let's start with the&nbsp;<em>worst</em> way to get help with Windows: Microsoft support technicians. Their hearts may be in the right place, but they are third-party contractors reading from scripts. They don't have the knowledge to help you, and will often
 mislead you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <em>next</em> worst way to get help with Windows is: the Help file. That's true of a lot of software. Developers know that most people don't read the Help file and, even if they did, the Help file can't cover every situation that might come up. So the
 Help file is pretty basic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving on, the next worst way to get help with Windows is from community forums like this. As you can readily tell by reading through posts, most people who post here are pretty helpless when it comes to technology - which is not really their fault - and
 need heavy-duty hand holding, which you can't get in a forum like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be fair, Microsoft doesn't tell you in its advertising that it requires a fair amount of knowledge and preparation to upgrade an operating system. Nevertheless, these people should either have a professional upgrade their operating system or wait until
 they can buy a computer with Windows 10 pre-installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all that, here is the&nbsp;<em>best</em> way to get help with Windows: search the internet. The web has tons of good information that goes into much more detail than you can possibly expect in a community forum. Searching the internet takes time, and it
 requires the ability to discern when the advice you're reading is bad. Still, it is an invaluable source of help and the number 1 best way to get problems answered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I installed Windows 10 I spent days reading about it on the internet, which empowered me to have a complete plan of attack. No surprise, my upgrade succeeded on the first try and Windows 10 works very well on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, whenever I have a problem I go straight to the internet for a solution and I almost always find one that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For anyone who thinks they shouldn't have to learn how to use technology ... that everything should be laid out for them ... get ready for lots of frustration.</p>

Yep, you are absolutely right about your speech there. To do things, you must work hard and take risks and Microsoft Support always confuse me.

            <p>BullDogXX,</p>
<p>I found your comments rather troublesome. Not because I didn't think you were right but because I have only Windows Edge and Google Chrome on my computer as browsers and both of them are kind of locked up. As a matter of fact I doubt that I'll be able to
 get back to this point once I ask to be taken somewhere else on the internet because I cannot release any screens from Window Edge or Google Chrome. Once a window is opened to the internet the 'tab' at the top of the screen is the only thing that tells me
 it's open&nbsp;and, although there are "X" marks on each of them when I scroll my mouse over them - no clicks are acknowledged and the screens stay locked on my browser (either Windows Edge or Google Chrome). When I try to release Windows Edge by right clicking
 on the icon on the task bar at the bottom of my screen I get "Microsoft Edge" on the top line followed by "Unpin this program from the taskbar" and at the bottom of the pop-up menu is "Close Program" ... No matter which of these I click on - NOTHING HAPPENS!
 I cannot close Microsoft Edge ... But I can close Google Chrome - even though when I reinitialize it there are still some tabs opened. I did manage to use "Control" "Shift" "Esc" to bring up the task menu and to release Microsoft Edge and One Note ... but
 that was the only way I found to close these programs --- and Microsoft Edge now has 11 open tabs that WILL NOT CLOSE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm totally frustrated.</p>

Sometimes the ONLY thing to do is refresh or reset. It's a new OS w/ lotsa new stuff. W/ these forums, Microsoft is learning new things.
