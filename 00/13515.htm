<h2>            Outlook 2016 not syncing with Gmail</h2>
                    
<p>I have used Outlook 4ever and never had a problem. Now with the office 365/outlook 2016 and g-mail they just don't want to&nbsp; talk to each other, . I get partial downloads, sync problems etc. I have read all the forums and am so confused. I don't want to lose
 all the files as I just put them all back after a computer crash so I an not going to delete the account and "reset".</p>
<p>There are a lot of discussions about this on-line...also now that my 2016 is enabled my old outlook (2010) no longer works. Please help via a reply to someone who is not a "super tech" but knows enough to handle some clear instructions.</p>
<p>So frustrated and nonproductive....I did not ask for 2016 to be downloaded and would have been happy with the previous working version.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<h2>            Excel 2007 print problem on Windows 10</h2>
                    I recently upgraded from Windows 7 to 10. When I now print a&nbsp;Excel (or word) document&nbsp;it no longer fills the page and the printed area is too small to read easily. I have checked&nbsp;the obvious stuff like margin tabs and paper selection.&nbsp; The print preview
 appears correct and fills the entire sheet, but when printed it does not print as shown on the print review, but is inset on all sides. Other applications are printing normally.&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp;

            <p>Hey Maggielawrence,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another possibility for getting this error is that you are trying to use a link that is bypassing the normal security passage into the secure section of the website. In a typical secure website a user logs in, they are redirected/authenticated, and then
 allowed to access the secure section of the site. </p>
<p>Note: When working within a secure website that is using secure information, another problem can occur from using the back/forward buttons instead of the navigation buttons that are provided within the website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have tried to access the site from the beginning (entry) page and still receive HTTP 403 Forbidden, then you may have been blocked from the website. In this case the next step would be to try contacting the company directly to assess why you are receiving
 the HTTP 403 Forbidden errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helps. </p>

<h2>            why does msn.com load as a blank page in IE 10&#63;</h2>
                    My problem is with IE 10, which I downloaded last night, to upgrade from IE 9. I am running Windows 7 64-bit. The only problem I am having is that I CANNOT get www.msn.com or www.my.msn.com to load. I just get a blank page. Even when I try to connect with
 msn.com through Bing, I get the same result. I have searched the MS support website and online for almost 3 hours, and can find that people are also having similar problems, but I am having no luck with finding a solution for me.&nbsp;I need to get access to my
 msn.com page tonight. I am overwhelmed! Can anyone help?

            Your hp Compaq h3850 is a very, very old pocket pc that runs the <b>windows mobile 2002</b> OS.&nbsp; The only thing you could do with this device is sync it to a computer, in which case the only software you'd use would be a full version of Outlook and Activesync
 4.5.&nbsp; However, <b>Activesync 4.5 can only be used on an XP computer</b>.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Since you have a <b>Windows 7 (64 bit) computer</b>, you'd need to install the 64 bit version of Windows Mobile Device Center (which is the version of ActiveSync that is compatible with Vista or Windows 7 computers).&nbsp; Unfortunately,
<b>Windows Mobile Device Center is not compatible with windows mobile 2002 devices</b> and can only be used to sync windows mobile 2003 and later editions of the windows mobile OS.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The bottom line to all this is that <b>you are stuck with a device that <i>can not</i> be synced to your Windows 7 computer</b>.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Your only course of action would be to find an old XP computer that has some version of Outlook on it (if you want to sync contacts, appointments &amp; tasks to the device) and install ActiveSync 4.5 to it (the computer).&nbsp; ActiveSync will also allow you to sync
 files to the device.<br />
<br />
You can go ahead and <b>uninstall</b> the <b>windows server solution phone connector add-in</b> and the
<b>Windows Phone SDK 7.1 software</b> since these pieces of software have never been used to sync any windows mobile devices and so is not needed and will never be used.<br />

<p><span><span>Hi Michelle Jasmine,
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It’s possible that you are unable to redeem the new subscription due to improper cancellation of the previous program from
 the account. Because, once the previous subscription has canceled accurately, this shouldn’t be the reason to unable to redeem the new subscription.
</span></span></p>

<p>MS support is the best place to go, we don't have any access to the activation or payment systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In theory, expired subscriptions are not supposed to have any impact on new subscriptions</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">I have read about one possible cause, but I doubt it applies to an existing subscription, simply because the option has not been around long enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, SOME stores get a kickback on the renewal next year.&nbsp; One "feature" of this type of subscription is that you have to contact the store you purchased it from to cancel the subscription. BUT, there is no indication on the MS site that this is what you
 have to do.</p>

            Hi Obagba,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your post. According to your description and updated information, you are unable to send or receive emails in Outlook 2016 client on your computer, but Outlook 2016 on other devices work well with your same account. In this case, it might be related
 to the Outlook 2016 client on your computer and we suggest you use mail web client to deal with emails temporarily as workaround.<br />
<br />
Besides, we suggest you can try to create a new Send/Receive group in Outlook by following steps:<br />
<br />
1. Click <strong>File </strong>&gt; <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced</strong>.<br />
2. Click <strong>Send/Receive</strong> under the <strong>Send and Receive</strong> section.<br />
3. Under Group Name, click the group and click Copy.<br />
4. Under Send/Receive Group Name, type the new group name, and then click <strong>
OK</strong>.<br />
5. Under Group Name, click the old group name.<br />
6. Under both <strong>When Outlook is Online</strong> and <strong>When Outlook is Offline</strong>, click to clear the check box for
<strong>Include this group in Send/Receive (F9)</strong>.<br />
7. Click <strong>Close</strong> and restart Outlook.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, we suggest you check if your Outlook need to be updated. You can follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
1. Go to <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Office Account</strong>.<br />
2. Choose <strong>Update Options</strong> under Product Information &gt; <strong>Enable Updates</strong>. Or, if updates are already enabled, click
<strong>Update Now</strong>.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, to further look into it, could you please provide us the detailed version information of the Windows system and your Outlook 2016 client (go to
<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Office Account</strong> &gt; <strong>About Outlook</strong>)? And we need to confirm if you have installed old version Outlook on your computer as well.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jay<br />

</p><p>So I deleted the iMap account and created a new one as POP3.&nbsp; Then I imported my old .pst file to the new account and whahla!!! All my old emails and folders appeared.&nbsp; One thing I also had to do during setup was run the repair tool on the imported .pst
 file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What took the longest to figure out was just exactly which folder to put the old .pst file.&nbsp; Of course the folder is hidden and I had to do a search in file explorer for the current iMap file, then I knew where to put the imported .pst file.&nbsp; Took a VERY
 long time, but everything is now working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to me that this should not be as difficult as it was for someone just moving an Outlook 2007 POP3 account to a new computer with Outlook 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps I performed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Export old email account (creates a .pst file) to external device.
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; You will need to know if this old account is POP3 or iMap</li></ul>
</li><li>Find the new "Outlook" data folder</li><li>Copy the exported old email .pst file to the new Outlook data folder</li><li>Create the new Outlook account
<ul>
<li>Remember to create the same as the old account either POP3 or iMap</li><li>NOTE: Outlook 2016 defaults to iMap.
<ul>
<li>If you want POP3 you have to create the account manually by checking the box</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li>Import the old .pst file to the new account
<ul>
<li>May need to run the repair tool during this process (I did)
<ul>
<li>It should come up automatically if needed</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li>Be patient as Outlook will take a bit of time to load everything properly.</li></ol>

<p>You went wrong in your first step by exporting your pst, the import/export process loses data &amp; settings.</p>
<p>You then compounded your error by copying that pst to an incorrect location (\My Documents\) is not a hidden location</p>

<p>Well... I never said I copied the file to \My Documents, that was in your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the hidden folder, at least on my new PC, was&nbsp;C:\Users\chack\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook where AppData is indeed a hidden folder.&nbsp; Once I copied the exported .pst file there, I ran the import and the rest is history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what you are referring to, everything I read (googled) on MicroSoft sites and user group sites used the export and import functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you would be kind enough to explain in detail the proper steps to port an Outlook 2007 email account (either POP3 or iMap) to Outlook 2016.&nbsp; That would be very helpful to the next person that runs into this issue.<br />

<p>Well&nbsp;just trying to&nbsp;figure out what "my organization" is</p>

    <title>BUG&#58; Excel loses several hours of work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joe momma61  say:</h3>
<h2>            BUG&#58;  Excel loses several hours of work</h2>
                    <p>On three separate occasions in the past month, I have had Excel instantly revert to a previous state.&nbsp; All work is lost, sheets that were added are gone, sheets that were deleted are back.&nbsp; This affects all running copies of excel.&nbsp; The revert happens instantly,
 these changes are coming from memory.&nbsp; It happens too fast to be loading files from the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started my&nbsp;day working on a large spreadsheet.</p>
<p>At 11:25 AM, I created a new workbook.&nbsp; I entered a small amount of data in it and saved it.&nbsp; I left it open.</p>
<p>I then went back to working on the other larger spreadsheet.&nbsp; I worked on this spreadsheet until about 3:05 PM, when everything reverted back to some point prior to 11:25 AM.&nbsp; Everything I had done from some point earlier that morning was reverted back to
 a previous state.&nbsp; The new spreadsheet that I created and saved at 11:25 AM was empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time this has happened I am in the process of pasting data.&nbsp; I can't say for certain, but I think each time I have been doing a special&nbsp;paste.&nbsp; I know I was today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a subscriber to Office 365 and the version I am running is 1810 (Build 11001.20108 Click-to-run)&nbsp; Monthy Channel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Side note, when I went back to excel to find the version number, the Home Screen has changed.&nbsp; There has been an update.&nbsp; Is the update the reason for my lost data?</p>

            Hi there,<br /><br />Did excel crash? Or instantly revert the data?<br /><br />If this crashed you should be able to utilize the auto recover feature.<br /><br />You may also want to look at your auto save settings, more information can be found here:<br /><br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-autosave-and-autorecover-to-help-protect-your-files-in-case-of-a-crash-551c29b1-6a4b-4415-a3ff-a80415b92f99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-au...</a><br /><br />If instantly reverting I would look at performing a repair on office, to do this:<br /><br />In the search bar type appwiz.cpl and press enter <br /><br />This should load the list of applications installed on your machine<br /><br />Amongst the list you should see office.<br /><br />Click on this and select change<br /><br />Then select quick repair<br /><br />Reboot your machine<br /><br />Failing this chose the other repair option reboot and try again!<br /><br />Let me

<p>Jordan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel did not crash.&nbsp; The change is instant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at the auto-recover and auto-save features.&nbsp; There is nothing to recover as there was no crash.&nbsp; I did have an auto-saved version so only about 30 minutes of actual work was lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try a repair, but I don't expect it will accomplish anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were to speculate on what happens is MS has a new version ready to go, so their&nbsp;"upgrade" program takes an image of what you are working on.&nbsp; They download and perform the upgrade (which takes several hours).&nbsp; Then they give you back the image that
 the upgrade routine made of your data.&nbsp; This is why I got a new home screen right after this "event".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice if MS would wait for a reboot or do this when I am not actively using the applications they want to upgrade, but their upgrade is obviously more important than anything I could be working on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            As with any reputable company, you would not receive a mail of this nature from Nokia, and Nokia would
<b>never</b> ask you to confirm personal information by e-mail or telephone - remember that if you had signed up to any genuine Nokia promotions, your information would already be on file.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are interested in receiving information on genuine offers and promotions from Nokia, we recommend that you register with My Nokia, which is currently being phased in around the world. Please see your local Nokia website for further information.

<h2>            Style lock on Word doc goes awry changing all formatting when e-mailing to others.</h2>
                    Prepared a Word document template for a proposal, all styles were formatted and saved in the document.&nbsp; This template was e-mailed to others to insert content and, as a precaution,&nbsp;the styles were locked so that the recipients would be limited to using
 our styles.&nbsp; After sending out the document, was made aware that the locked style formatting had switched around without warning.&nbsp; Text styles in the body, headliners, tables, captions and other areas were affected. Is there something I'm missing here...did
 I miss a step in the "style locking" procedure?&nbsp; Please let me know.&nbsp; Thank you in advance for your input and advice.

            <div>
<p>In answer to your questions:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How does the template work in your system?</p>
<p>&gt; Since I generated the document in my system, I had/have control in turning off the styles lock, so from there on I was/am able to manipulate and return the styles to what they originally looked like.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>&gt; For the moment, I have left the styles lock settings turned off.&nbsp; But in a week or two, after all information has been collated, tables-captions-graphics positioned and finalized, the document will be sent to an affiliate who will print the document for
 presentation to a client.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>&gt; This is where I am very concerned the styles will fall apart again (even with the styles locked) and at this point, time will be of the utmost importance to meet a deadline.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>&gt; At this early stage, I can't exactly say how big the final document will be, possibly as small as 20 pages or as large as 100 pages.&nbsp; BTW, there are 3 volumes, each with its own content.<br />
</p>
<p>&gt; I'm disappointed that Microsoft includes these type of parameter controls in Word and problems like this arise...should it be this difficult to ensure that one's document comes out the way he/she wants to?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Do others get an option to modify the styles?</p>
&gt; Only my coworker has the ability to modify styles, he also has the password to unlock the settings.&nbsp;
<br />
&gt; For others we are sending the document out to, no, they will not have the option to modify the styles.&nbsp;
<br />
&gt; That is my reason for the styles lock to prohibit any (text) styles switching and style generation to and from our workplace.&nbsp;
<br />
&gt; The settings on the Style Manager box (Restricted tab) are as follows: a) Limit formatting to permitted styles, b) Block Theme or Scheme switching, c) Block Quick Style Set switching.&nbsp;
<br />
&gt; The "Allow AutoFormat to override formatting box was not checked.<br />
&gt; Specific styles were restricted from use in the styles listing - only styles I designed and a few recommended styles were kept on the list.&nbsp;
<br />
&gt; I did notice that when finalizing the above process, I tried typing a few words in the document and the text came out as blue Times New Roman or larger font sizes in Calibri/Cambria<br />
But, here is where I'm thinking I may have missed a setting on the styles manager. Should I have made any adjustment to the Set Defaults controls (although the default is Calibri 10 pt.)? Your thoughts?
<br />
<br />
<p>Did you use any fonts which may not be available in all the computers?</p>
<p>&gt; Am only using Service pack 2 fonts (Windows XP/Word 2007) - Calibri and Cambria.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Do all the customers to whom you have sent the file use office 2007?</p>
&gt; Unknown.&nbsp; But the corruption appeared to happen when my coworker e-mailed the document out.&nbsp; He is also using Word 2007 on an Windows XP driven laptop.<br />
<br />
Would appreciate more comments from all.&nbsp; Thank you!<br />

<h2>            Getting e mails from myself that I didn&#39;t send-outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>I have searched the net and this seems to be a common problem but I cannot find a solution for it. Does anyone have a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have over the last few weeks noticed e mails in my spam folder that look like they have come from my address and even have my name in them. They have all been written in Portuguese.</p>
<p>
</p><p>last night I changed my profile name and this morning have received another e mail with my revised profile name on the header, again in Portuguese so whatever or whoever is doing this must be monitoring my e mails. I have done all the normal stuff, scans,
 changed password etc but nothing found and no change. I only read my e mails "on line" I never bring them down onto my devices so I can see it's a machine problem, more an on line problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that this practise is not harmful but all the same it' a bit worrying.</p>

            <p>Hi Peter, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What you’re experiencing is called “<strong>Form spoofing,” </strong>and it’s a favorite tool in the spam artillery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Form-spoofing is annoying, but it’s not dangerous. It’s the sender entering your name and address into the From field in their mail program instead of their own. Outlook, for one, makes this a snap. During the setup process, when asked to enter one’s own
 email address, spammers choose this option.</p>
<p>Since the name of the game for spammers is hiding their tracks and making sure you receive their mail, from-spoofing is natural. By putting your address in the From field, they obscure the true sender and nearly guarantee that your spam filter won’t block
 their email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To prevent such emails from reaching you, take these steps:</p>
<p><em>1. <strong>Set up a filter.</strong></em> You can create a special rule to automatically route anything sent from your email address to the Trash folder. You’ll still see emails sent by you in your Sent folder, and if you have intentionally added yourself
 as a recipient, you can always dig that piece of mail out of the trash.</p>
<p><em>2. <strong>Verify.</strong></em> You can also set up a sender verification tool that asks every new sender to verify that they are a real person before the mail reaches you. (From then on, everything from that address is processed as legitimate and sent
 directly to you.)</p>
<p><em>3. <strong>Take caution.</strong></em> Simply receiving these emails does not put you at risk, but just like any email from an unknown source, you should think twice before clicking on any links.
</p>
<p />

            Hello,<br />
<br />
There are several reasons why you're having an issue with using the Search feature in Outlook. Regarding your concern, it turns out that rebuilding index didn't work for you. Did you rebuild the index by doing the same steps provided on this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Reset-indexing-by-rebuilding-your-Instant-Search-catalog-213a2728-0ef4-427a-9bb2-aed329a59b17" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> about rebuilding your search catalog?<br />

<p>
</p><p>Hi! Ariel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answer.</p>
<p>The issue is fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did was:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I forced to update office at office accounts / office updates.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;I Run scanpst, was found errors, I fixed the error but I suspect that some were not fixed.</p>
<p>- I Run the index rebuild, no luck,&nbsp;a few second after was completed.</p>
<p>- Created a new pst from the scratch&nbsp;and move about (9.000) e-mails between old and new pst.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The old pst was gigantic with 9 Gb and about 100.000 emails, maybe the size was an issue too.</p>
<p>The new pst has about 900 Mb and&nbsp;9.000 e-mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

<h2>            N78 GPS problems after firmware update</h2>
                    
<p>I have just updated my N78 firmware to 13.052. Before the upgrade the GPS worked really well but after it struggles to lock on and hold position. It took an hour to find satellites earlier and as soon as i picked the phone up it lost its position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else had a similar problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible to reload the previous firmware?</p>

            no it is not possible for an end user to go back to the previous firmware. try to do this i take it you have a back up as you just recently updated your phone. reinstall the current firwmare and right after that plug in *#7370# on your home screen, the
 default code is 12345. also make sure that you take out your memory card. you might also have to reinstall maps and make sure you have most up to date map verrsion on your phone. if all this does not work you might have to take it to nokia care and have them
 have a look at your phone.&nbsp;

<p>I did not try to erase phone memory an reinstal the firmware as suggested</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but since the 30.011 update I am experiencing a lot of strange things as</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) I cannot get GPS position without network or AGPS via APN connection to the internet</p>
<p>2) I cannot change the ringtone any longer, unless I&nbsp;ask for&nbsp;factory settings and remove the memory card</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but when I put the memory card it hangs on opening the ringtone list :(</p>

<p>I had the same experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday roaming across forums I saw a post suggesting a phone reset as simple as tooking out the battery for ten seconds and restarting the phone.</p>
<p>Well, I opened the back cover, took out the battery for around ten seconds and closed the phone being careful to align the pins of the internal GPS antenna to the back cover&nbsp; GPS antenna.</p>
<p>Then I restarted the phone and after two minutes it sees four satellites, and after five minutes nine satellites, completing the fix in less than five minutes.</p>
<p>Today, the GPS is still working (I tried the fix ten minutes ago with the same times).</p>
<p>Therefore, I consider the problem solved.</p>
<p>Moreover, the internal GPS now works also with Google Maps, and this according to my opinion demonstrates that probably the problem is not Nokia Maps 3.0 , because I am using Nokia Maps 3.0 and Map Loader 3.0 .</p>

<p>Try a hard reset.</p>
<p>Hard reset (the three key code/reset). Turn off the phone. Press and hold three keys together, the green/talk key, the * key and the number '3'.Then, turn on the phone and don't let the three keys before you see the nokia hands logo/nokia boot up screen.Warning!You
 will lose ALL your phone's data/files!</p>

            I actually figured out the same thing. Apparently I changed my back cover and it didnt have a GPS antenna in it. So it took like 10 minutes to load 2 bars of signals for GPS in both Ovi map 3 and Google Map and when i moved my cellphone it lost the signal
 instantly. Then I read a reply from marcap53 and found out that is the problem. BACK COVER &gt;&gt; CHECK IT NOW !!!

            Today I send my N78 to nokia to look after my GPS problem and some other little problems. I will see in 2 or three week when my n78 will come back.

<h3> vsquaredx5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office365 - Outlook 2016&#59; Multiple Calendars in the To-Do Bar &#38; Calendar size</h2>
                    <p>I recently started a new job and I want to keep my personal and business calendars separate. Both my personal and business accounts are Office 365 Exchange accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">heavy</span> Outlook user and have come to rely on the To-Do bar to keep track of my appointments throughout the day. I was surprised to find out that the only calendar that appears in the To-Do bar is the one
 in the default account.&nbsp; I was using Office 2010 and determined pretty quickly that there was no way around this hurdle.&nbsp; I did find a 3rd party Outlook add-in for Outlook 2013 and 2016 that claims to&nbsp;address the issue.&nbsp; I&nbsp;upgraded to Outlook 2016 and downloaded
 the trial version of the add-in.&nbsp; The good news is the add-in seems to work but&nbsp;it creates a second To-Do&nbsp;bar that is not nearly as&nbsp;"pretty" as the native Outlook 2016&nbsp;To-Do bar. I removed the add-in and am hoping this functionality is somewhere on&nbsp;Microsoft's
 roadmap!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue I have with&nbsp;the To-Do bar is the size of the monthly calendar and the fact that you are now limited to one month... In Outlook 2010 you could add more than one monthly calendar (I liked having the current month and the next one showing) and
 the calendars were smaller in size.&nbsp; The new calendar is much taller than those in Outlook 2010 which impacts how many&nbsp;&nbsp;appointments and tasks you can&nbsp;display below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given how many comments and complaints I have found on the net about these issues,&nbsp;my fingers are crossed that&nbsp;both issues will be fixed soon...&nbsp;In the meantime, does anybody have any suggestions?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi VSquaredX5,<br />
<br />
