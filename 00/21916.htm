<h2>            Exporting from Windows Mail on one computer to import to Outlook 2013 on a different computer</h2>
                    I bought a new computer and have put Outlook 2013 on it. I have exported emails from Windows Mail in the Windows Mail format, saved those files on a flash drive but am unable to import them into Outlook on the new computer. How do I do this?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the description, it seems like you are trying to restore the email messaged exported from Windows mail to Outlook 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook 2013 will support or import the data if it is in .PST format or a text file (.csv). Hence you may try importing the data to
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-other-programs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows live mail</a> and then export it to Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you import the data into Windows live mail, refer the following link to export the data to Outlook 2013:</p>

                    <p>Original Title: Outlook app on my android phone</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi, </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Few days ago I installed new Outlook app on my android phone and since&nbsp;then&nbsp;I&nbsp;can't&nbsp;get it to work.</div>
<div><br />
First time I installed application from link on hotmail app and later Outlook app from Play Store.&nbsp;<br />
I tried&nbsp;reinstalling&nbsp;it again but its not working.<br />
Problem is that the application works well&nbsp;when&nbsp;I&nbsp;sign&nbsp;up, validating account&nbsp;until&nbsp;Setting up Account.&nbsp;When&nbsp;I press OK, it just switches me on to&nbsp;sign&nbsp;up page again without any text or error description.<br />
And it is the same situation again and again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Mail is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div>Phone is Samsung Galaxy S II</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I&nbsp;don't&nbsp;know what could be the problem and I could use any advice or&nbsp;suggestion.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanx.</div>

<p>I've followed the steps you mentioned but nothing works. Nothing. I haven't been able to access my emails through my phone for weeks. I'm ready to just switch to another email provider if I can't fix it this week. This is too much hassle.</p>

            <p>Currently in grad school, I also have Live @ EDU address, which over the summer got switched over to Outlook.com for web use for those using browser access to their mail, students used to go to something like mail.carlow.edu for their mail, now they're directed
 to outlook.com and type their "organization" credentials - which leads them to what looks like the enterprise version of Office 365.</p>
<p><br />
Outlook 2010/2013 (desktop) is a bit different than Windows Mail (Metro app) for Windows 8 as far as entering account information to set it up.
</p>
<p><br />
The first piece of info you'll need is your server name.&nbsp; If you login to your school email account through the web interface, then you should see your server in one of two places:
</p>
<p><br />
1) in the address bar:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad01b5c1-31cf-476c-bc03-b13b905e0d61" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) in Help &gt; About (hover over the carat next to the Help button on the far right under your name in the Inbox screen, and you'll drop down the menu, About is there.&nbsp; In the window that pops up, you'll see "Host Address" and the first part (before /owa if
 present) is the server address, which will look like:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bluprdXXXX.outlook.com</p>
<p><br />
If you just want to set up Windows Mail (Metro/RT) this is the server name you'd use.&nbsp; Mine works perfectly for me.</p>
<p><br />
If you want to use Outlook, you'd use this same server, but be careful as Outlook will read this as an Office 365/Exchange Mail address, and will use your school account as the default for calendar items, tasks, etc.</p>
<p><br />
If you're like me (I prefer Outlook to use my @msn.com mail account for calendars, tasks, etc..) then you can also setup Outlook to use your school email in IMAP mode.&nbsp; That Help &gt; About window also contains your POP and IMAP information that you can enter
 in your Outlook account setup, as I've done here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f22355f3-ba4c-4b5c-9f3e-21e7eefcdcf2" /></p>
<p><br />
Either way, you should be able to setup your school email without too much problem.</p>
<p><br />
Hope this helps!</p>
<p><br />
~ Vince</p>

<div>I understand that reconfiguration did not help you with your concern as you are getting an error that password is not recognized.</div>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure whether have you found the solution yet, but I'll share my findings anyways as I had the same frustration with signing in an email account connected with an educational institution (i.e.: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***) on the Outlook app on Android.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your university switched to Outlook for emails, chances are your email account is now an Office 365 account, not an Outlook.com account. This is why you can login with a *** Email address is removed for privacy *** or a *** Email address is removed for privacy *** email address if you selected the Outlook.com account
 option, but NOT your student email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When installing the Outlook app on your Android, you will be asked to add an account, where the screen shows you different options such as Office 365, Outlook.com, OneDrive, Yahoo! Mail, iCloud, Gmail, etc. Since you are trying to add your student email
 onto the app, select the Office 365 option. You should be able to enter your student email details and access your email account on the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes</p>

<h2>            How do I link an SQL Server to Access&#63;</h2>
                    I have been granted 'read only' access to the SQL server at work. I am looking to link certain data from the SQL server to access to update in realtime. I only want to view the information from SQL in access and not edit it. How can I create a link from
 the SQL Server to Access to have the data update and be viewed in Access in realtime. In addition, is there a way to link this data from Dynamics CRM other than by creating a dynamic Excel File? Thanks

            <p>Normally one would create a new ODBC connection to the SQL database, and use External Data... Link to link to that ODBC connection. I don't have 2010 at the moment so I can't walk you through the exact steps, but try searching the Help for ODBC; it gives
 some pretty clear examples.</p>

            <p>There are lots of ways to ensure that the SQL is not editable; start with the permissions on the SQL instance (see your DBA for this). Access recordsets can be opened as Snapshot, queries can be set to read-only, Forms can have their Allow Edits properties
 set to No - you can set up all sorts of protections; but the first and easiest step is to define a user in SQL Enterprise Manager and give that user read-only privileges, and use that user when defining the ODBC connection.</p>

            Right that is how they have my uder ID set up as read only credentials so with that being the case there shouldnt be any data pushed back to SQL, but at the same time I should still get the real time updates as data changes in SQL<br />

Hi Johanna,</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thank you for reporting the issue to us. To narrow down the issue, we still need the information below for our investigation:</p>
<ol>
<li>The OneNote version. Please go to OneNote &gt; About OneNote to check it. For example: 15.39.</li><li>The OS version. For example: 10.13?</li><li>When did the issue occur? Was there anything changed before that? For example: The Office version update or OS update.</li><li>Does the issue happen to all notebooks (even a new created one)?</li><li>Does the issue happen when you click “Record audio” or after you record for a while?</li></ol>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thanks,</p>
<p>
Rena</p>

<h2>            Lumia 620&#58; problem ending calls</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Since I bought my new Lumia 620 two weeks ago I'm very happy with it. But, there's a problem that has been happening to me since I bought it, and today it happened very times.</p>
<p>When I want to end the call, I take my phone out of my ear and tap <strong>'finalizar llamada'</strong>
<em>(the spanish for 'end call')&nbsp;</em>. And, the screen becomes unresponsive. I can't use it, if I want to shut down the phone I can't because I need to swipe to unlock, and I can't turn off the screen also.&nbsp;</p>
<div>Sometimes the call ends, after some time, like 30 seconds, or sometimes I leave the phone and in 5 minutes the screen is still unresponsive. I'm not covering the proximity sensor or anything, but I don't know if it's a hardware, software or whatever problem.
 The only thing I know is that the only solution is to take out the battery, or make a reset (<em>volume down + power)</em>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks and please answer ASAP!</div>

<p>hi mate, have you checked you are up to date with the latest firmware and Nokia system app updates from the Store? also try performing a soft reset, and if that doesn't work, a hard reset. failing that, you will need to take your phone to nokia Care for
 inspection.</p>

<h2>            Text overlapping on PowerPoint</h2>
                    I have an issue with PowerPoint. I have installed custom fonts on an iPad through a configuration profile. However using PowerPoint, the custom font letters overlap and appear on top of one another. Does anyone know any fixes for this?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Compatibility issue is one of the reasons why you are having issues using custom fonts in PowerPoint. However, for us to fully identify the root cause, we need to gather additional information. Kindly answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is this the first time that you encountered this concern?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li><li>Is this happening to a specific font?</li><li>Can you send us a screenshot of the issue you are experiencing in PowerPoint? Make sure that you remove all personal information.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you update your PowerPoint application if there's an available update. If none, we recommend that you uninstall and reinstall the app. Once done, check if you will still experience the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the result for further assistance.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I have never come across this issue before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The things I have tried to do to troubleshoot is change the file type from otf to ttf and I have tried to change the text settings on the iPad itself as I read that online somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Yes the fonts are Neue Haas Grotesk display pro and Neue Haas Grotesk Text Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Screenshots are below, first one shows one letter I have typed. However if I type more than one letter you can see what happens in the second picture.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e849b675-45c1-4f37-954b-d93a29b7a79a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e849b675-45c1-4f37-954b-d93a29b7a79a?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cf6f7361-6776-4a98-b8c7-3e6650d547af?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cf6f7361-6776-4a98-b8c7-3e6650d547af?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;</p>

            Since the issue still occurs after reinstalling the PowerPoint application, we suggest that you uninstall and reinstall the custom fonts on your device. Once done, check if the issue still occurs. If so, we highly recommend contacting the font developer
 since it is possible that it is not compatible with your device or it is a bug with the font. They are the ones who can advise the most appropriate resolution for this issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have other questions or concerns in the future, we're just a click away.

Use the Replace utility to replace ^p with ^p, clicking on Replace All.&nbsp; A message box will then appear advising:</p>
<p>Word has completed it search of the document and has made&nbsp;# replacements.</p>
<p>Note that the answer is probably one more that the number of times that &lt;ENTER&gt; has been pressed because there is always one end of paragraph mark, even in a document with no text.</p>

<h2>            Want Past Outlook Notification To Appear When Computer Turns On</h2>
                    <p>Hi ... I'm looking for a way to have Outlook give notifications for overdue events when I wake up my computer.&nbsp; Say I have an event at 8:00am, but don't open my machine until 8:15, I'd like to get the event, even though the time has passed ... This is very
 handy as a reminder ... "Make coffee" or "Call John this am", etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate the help!</p>

<p>Hello Fred, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The feature you're looking for is available on the Outlook application. Once you set a reminder on the application and was not able to log in, the next time you log in to the application will show the reminders you missed. You can set a reminder in Outlook
 through this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-or-remove-reminders-7a992377-ca93-4ddd-a711-851ef3597925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.

<p>Perhaps I explained poorly ... I have an appointment set for 8:00am.&nbsp; I wake up my computer at 8:30.&nbsp; Nothing happens ... I know if I check alerts I will see the missed appointment, but I was hoping that the overdue alert would just go off on its own when
 the computer woke up -- without any intervention ... My calendar is open, and I was hoping that outlook would alert me to this event even though the time passed ...&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'll try to be more clear.&nbsp; I set an appointment for let's say tomorrow at 8:00 am.&nbsp; I put my computer to sleep at the end of the day.&nbsp; The next morning, I wake my computer up at say 8:30.&nbsp; Even though Outlook is open, I do not get an alert.&nbsp; Outlook ignores
 the overdue appointment.&nbsp; If I click on the bell, the alert is there as overdue, but again, I received no visual or audio alert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Online repair did not fix the problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's simple, shouldn't Outlook give an alert for all overdue appointments that occurred while the computer was asleep?&nbsp; Is it not programmed to do that?</p>

<p>Hello Fred,<br />
<br />
<br />
We appreciate your response. You should still get notifications for overdue appointments. In order to isolate the issue, we'll need a few more information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which email client are you using? Is it <a href="http://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook.com</a>? If it's an Outlook app, which version is it? To check, see <strong>

Are the appointments shared?</li><li>If you are in <a href="http://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook.com</a>, which browser are you using? Is it possible for you to replicate the issue on a different browser or device?</li><li>If you are using an Outlook app, have you tried checking for and <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">installing Office updates</a></strong>?</li></ul>

<p>Hi I'm using Outlook Live calendar and e-mail.&nbsp; I do not get ANY alerts (there were various different appointments) for overdue appointments, if my computer is asleep, and I share none.&nbsp; Not sure what a different browser would do, as Outlook will provide
 an alert even if my calendar is closed as long as my computer is awake.&nbsp; In fact, I will receive an alert even if my browser is closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same goes with my other PC.&nbsp; I will receive an alert when the computer is awake, but will not receive an overdue alert if the computer is asleep when the appointment time is past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what you mean about checking and installing updates ... Updates are installed automatically with Windows 10 whether I want them or not, but I am up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried this yourself and found that your Outlook Live DOES provide alerts for appointments that passed while your machine was asleep/off?&nbsp; Pretty sure I'm not unique ...</p>

            Updating only applies to Outlook app such as Outlook 2016. Because you are using Outlook.com, you can disregard the last question on the previous reply. Notifications for overdue appointments still show up in Outlook apps, and it appears that this feature
 is not available on Outlook.com. However, if you would like to suggest additional features in Outlook.com, you may leave a feedback on

<h2>            Windows 10 issues</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded and updated my Windows 7 to Windows 10 preview. After the update was completed, I found the following:</p>
<p>- Screen resolution was limited to either 1024 by 768 or 1280 by 1024</p>
<p>- Nvidia programs could not be found</p>
<p>- Internet connection was not transferred to the new installation</p>
<p>- Start button not active</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying a number of things to resolve the issues, I reverted back to Windows 7.</p>
<p>From the things I saw, Windows 10 will need a lot of work before release.</p>

<h2>            Contact deleted - but they&#39;re still there....</h2>
                    <p>Having issues with a Lumia 950 XL.<br />
Mail and Calendar app was connected to Hotmail (personal) and Exchange 2007 (work) email Been working fine for 9+ months. Since an app update (Mail and Cal) approx. 2 weeks ago, it has been horrendous - app crashing, won't re-open, won't sync, won't open emails,
 says its deleting emails but go back in and they're still there... just awful.<br />
Factory reset phone in the end (losing all sorts of important data - little bit annoyed).<br />
Still wouldn't work...<br />
So I setup my Hotmail on my work's Android Phone, until I could replace the Windows phone with an Android of my own (had enough at this point).<br />
Removed Work email off Windows phone... and it all sprang into life! So well done MS, you've stopped an MS Phone, running an MS OS, with an MS Mail App, working with an MS Email Server... great step forward.</p>
<p>Anyway, removed Hotmail off my work (android) phone... thinking it was 'fully gone' I then deleted all the contacts it had copied over.<br />
To my amazement, and NOT pleasure, it turns out, that even without a Hotmail account being added to my Android phone, it IS still linked to Hotmail... they weren't copies of contacts, they WERE my Hotmail contacts. I have deleted 20+ years of Hotmail contacts
 - great! Some REALLY important information in there.<br />
After 24 hours of depression, and trying to recover deleted 'People' through Hotmail, I can't get them back... so I've learnt to live with it.</p>
<p>But... I then got a call off someone who's contact details had been deleted. But it had their name... took the call, finished the call... and opened up the 'People' app on the phone... sure enough, that person is NOT in my contacts any more.<br />
Went through the motions of calling him back, but clicked on the little 'mans head with lines' - ie, the 'Contact' - and am told 'unable to find contact' - so I can't view the number, because the contact doesn't exist... I can only see their name (or what they
 were in my Contacts as. I can call the person, because the phone recognises these contacts...<br />
They're there... all my old contacts... but I can't see them... how the hell do I get them back? Its like having £1 million on a shelf that's 1 inch too high, with no stool/ladder... I know they're there, but I can't get at them!</p>
<p>ANYONE had a similar issue, who can help?</p>
<p>Thanks, Mark</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When you add your Hotmail Account to your Windows phone, your contacts will sync automatically. We suggest that you follow these steps to resolve this issue you're experiencing. Go to
<strong>Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Email &amp; App Accounts</strong> -- Delete your Live account under the "<strong>Email, Calendar and Contacts</strong>" header. Afterwards, open Mail app and re-add your Live account. Then, try to check if the issue persists.
</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>I can try that if you like, but I honestly can't see it making any difference - the Contacts no longer exist in Hotmail/Outlook.com, so by removing the account from my phone, and re-adding/resynching it, will surely only add the contacts I've added back
 in since Android destroyed my life.</p>
<p>The contacts appear to be on the phone somehow - I can browse back through calls I've made, and people are there, as names, that are no longer in my contacts - but because they're there as a name, I can't see their number... unless I call them - but that
 calls them!</p>
<p>I&nbsp;select 'Details' and it simply says 'Contact could not be found' - or words to that effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But of a bugger really!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I remembered the other day that i have an old Lumia 1520 with about 95% of my contacts on.</p>
<p>Is there a way of syncing from the phone to hotmail/outlook.com rather than hotmail/outlook.com syncing to the phone (and risking overwriting everything)?</p>
<p>

<h2>            N8 &#38;amp&#59; Nokia Bubbles</h2>
                    
<p>I've been testing out the Beta for Nokia Bubbles which is available from the Nokia Beta Labs page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More information about Nokia Bubbles can be found here in a YouTube video:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRuY_9ZMsY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSRuY_9ZMsY</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/RSRuY_9ZMsY?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/RSRuY_9ZMsY?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Nokia N8, and I really hope Nokia DON'T implement this by default in the new firmware update!<br />
<br />
All I want on my lock screen is the date / time and a small icon which tells us that we have a missed call or a new text message. That is all. For everything else, we're perfectly capable of unlocking the phone via the physical UNLOCK SLIDER on the right side
 of the handset. After all, that's what it's there for, and only takes a fraction of a second to give it a flick!<br />
<br />
Those bubbles floating around make me feel nauseous. By the time you've pressed the Home button, located the bubble you require (Which can be in a different place each time), and dragged it to the required area, you may as well have just unlocked the phone
 manually! This is a stupid idea, and has caused me no end of frustration, and I much prefer to do things the standard way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lock screen should not have any interaction at all. It should be LOCKED, as the name suggests. If you want to interact with your handset, that's why we have an UNLOCK SLIDER!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia need to stop wasting time with things like this and actually put more effort into fixing the problems in the firmware which the N8 initially shipped with!</p>

            You can give feedback for nokia at betalabs. Nokia betalabs make these to test them out. It's BETA labs. And btw i think that this app is awesome. Also remember that it is an experimental application. I think it's an awesome app.

<p>Its experimental and its totally optional. I think its a funny gimick, 2 'clicks' to call someone, 2 clicks to Ovi Maps, its like a mini Home screen before the real Home screen. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;I'm in the same camp as GeminiPhoenix. It's nothing more than a silly gimmick with no real world application. As for two clicks to ovi maps, how about one click like I already do. The maps applications shortcut is on my home screen. Quick slide of the unlock
 slider then press maps. Job done.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I had it installed for a couple of hours before I realised what a useless waste of time it really is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the best.</p>

            For years Nokia has been lambasted for having dull interfaces. They have been escorted for not matching the Android UI. Now the develo something truly interesting, and ww have people who slam it. It shows that one can never please everyone. It shows also
 different strokes for differnt folks.

<p>I think nokia Bubbles are so brilliant and looking so good.&nbsp;It runs so smooth when you turn the phoone around..It´s build with Qt 4.7 &amp; Qt mobility 1.1 so If I´m not misstaken this is how the UI can look when they release the new UI?..If so we will really
 have something to look forward too...</p>

<p>&nbsp; I bought the Nokia N8 knowing full well the GUI was going to be dull, so the last thing I want</p>
<p>is a silly childish gimmick dominating my user experience. If I wanted eye candy in the GUI, I would have got an Android.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Why in the world would Nokia want to emulate Android when Symbian^3 is perfectly fine as it is,</p>
<p>albeit a little dull.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The point is, I would prefer real functionality rather than a pretty user interface un-necessarily using the phones resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'm not sure who would actually enjoy moving bubbles around the screen in order to use a particular function of the handset. Maybe a 12 year old?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Agree</p>
<p>It's a nice little extra,</p>
<p>and an effective demonstration of the full 360 rotation of the graphics</p>
<p>If someone doesn't like it then they don't have to download it</p>
<p>but complaining about it is just sad</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;You are correct, nobody has to download it but the point is will it be a feature forced upon us</p>
<p>in future firmware upgrades? Is it indeed a taste of what Symbian will become?</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope not, for the reasons I've already stated.</p>

<p>I have to say that I really like bubbles. I use it and it takes no more time to call my girlfrend or send her sms. Menu button, contact bubble - point to my girlfrend, and it's ringing,&nbsp;thats it. It takes same number of steps without bubbles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If You find difficult to play with bubbles to unlock the phone, then just push menu button and side-lock button and there You are, home screen.</p>
<p>Please do not ruin the fun for rest of us. Bubbles is really fantastic app and I hope that symbian update will be as good as bubbles :-)</p>

<h2>            Unread mail view in Outlook Mobile WM6.1 &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, i use WM6.1 on a HTC TyTn II and wonder how or when the "Unread mail" view will come to WM ? My ordinary Outlook 2003 has that function. And i really miss it in my phone, because i am using a lot of folders in my mail. And the only time my phone tell
 me if i get a new mail, is if it is a mail that not is sorted to a folder. Can i fix this in some way?</p>

<p>

</p><p>If you want to receive the notifications real time, you need to keep Skype running at Start up. But if it is okay&nbsp;for you to receive the notifications only when signed in to Skype, you&nbsp;can remove Skype at Start up. You may just add Skype on your dock to
 easily access it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post. <br />
Thank you!</p>

<p>OK. Thank you for the quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Mac mini. I was putting it to sleep, but I had problems with it. The other day I was locked out so I had to nuke the hard drive &amp; do a clean install. I decided at that time to shut down my Mac every time that I've finished with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if it isn't running at startup &amp; someone skypes me, then I'll have to sign in, right? And you know how impatient people get! I guess that I'm better off waiting a few seconds longer for my Mac to bootup.</p>

<p>No need to sign out of Skype if you will reboot your device,&nbsp;so that once your computer opens you are still signed into Skype. Make sure you are using the latest version to avoid any issues.</p>

    <title>outlook 2007 mail format &#40;Signature&#41; settings don&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stynkey  say:</h3>
<h2>            outlook 2007 mail format &#40;Signature&#41; settings don&#39;t work in windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Cannot create Signature using Outlook 2007 and Pop3 mail server under WIndows 8.1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've installed my Microsoft Outlook 2007 (and all of MS Office Pro 2007) on my new Windows 8.1.&nbsp; My ISP has both&nbsp;Pop3 and IMAP email servers. Everything seems to work fine in Outlook with IMAP email, but when I change back to POP3 (which I did because I
 want my local folders&nbsp;working the way I'm used to, with&nbsp;more comfortable&nbsp;delete and junk mail processing), I can't seem to create a signature to use with my mail.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>With the IMAP email account, these options under Mail Format all worked fine&nbsp;(also using Outlook 2007), but since changing back&nbsp;to the Pop3 mail,&nbsp;I lost the default signature I had created for new messages under the IMAP account.&nbsp; I thought I should just
 be able to add it again, but now&nbsp;when I click on Signature (to add / edit signatures), the&nbsp;program just hangs then displays the message, "Office&nbsp; Something went wrong. We couldn't start your program. Please try starting it again".&nbsp;&nbsp;The message&nbsp;also says to
 try the "Repair" option from Programs and Features in the control panel, but there is no "repair"&nbsp;option displayed when I select this program in Programs and Features.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Note: The same problem occurs if I click on Stationery and Fonts, but the other sections in this form all seem to work ok (Message format, HTML format, and&nbsp;Editor Options).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I ran the compatibility troubleshooter for this and the results are the same.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Please let me know if anyone knows how I can get this to work with Outlook 2007 and Pop3 mail server under Window 8.1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Additional Note:&nbsp; When creating a new email message, I am able to use the Insert feature and select the one added when I was using the IMAP server, but it also hangs here if I select Signature to create a new one or set it as default for all new messages
 for my Pop3 account.</p>

            <p>How did you change from IMAP to POP3?<br />
It sounds like somehow you damaged your mail profile and Outlook has issues building your accounts list.</p>
<p><br />
Try recreating your mail profile via the Mail applet in Control panel.<br />

<p>Also, make sure you have applied SP3 and additional updates for Office 2007.</p>

            <p>PROBLEM RESOLVED!!!!</p>
<p>Thanks Robert, but your suggestions didn't work and after months of pulling out my hair I just gave up using the signature or stationary features for many months.
</p>
<p>HOWEVER.... I was searching again last night for a potential solution and I finally found the answer to this problem at:&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.slipstick.com/problems/the-stationery-and-font-button-doesnt-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.slipstick.com/problems/the-stationery-and-font-button-doesnt-work/</a>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>It's posted as a fix for Outlook 2010 &amp; 2013 Signature &amp; Stationary problem but if you read through all the user comments it's easy to figure out how to apply it for Outlook 2007 as well).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I failed to mention in my original question (sorry) that my new windows 8 laptop came with an Office 2013 trial which I didn't like and uninstalled prior to installing and using Office 2007.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Apparently, when you switch versions, Office (or Outlook) install doesn't reset the registry key value to point to the correct version, so you have to do it manually with regedit (all in all, just a simple resolution once you know about this problem).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case for Outlook 2007, the value in registry key: </p>
<p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\Wow6432Node\CLSID\{0006F03A-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}\LocalServer32&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>had to be changed from:&nbsp; C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15\root\office15\outlook.exe,&nbsp; (the path for the "uninstalled" Outlook 2013)</p>
<p>to: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office12\OUTLOOK.EXE (the path for Outlook 2007).</p>
<p>Now the Signature and Stationary options are all working just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A big thank you to Diane Poremsky for posting this fix on the slipstick.com site.</p>

<p>I'm having the same error message too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first installed PC Suite 7.1 on my laptop running Windows XP SP3 it has no problem connecting to internet. But when I install the same PC Suite 7.1 on another 2 laptops one running XP SP3 another running Vista it doesn't work. All laptop have the
 latest Windows update. All tested with Nokia 5800 Xpress music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried switching off and on phone, restarting Windows, repair, uninstall and re-installing PC Suite 7.1, uninstall and reinstalling all related drivers (Nokia connectivity cable driver, Nokia USB modem driver package, etc etc);</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried with Ovi Suite 3.0 also failed. As soon as I click connect, it says 'Disconnected'. Wasted half a day on this issue. Sad.</p>

<blockquote>Hi Guys, sadly I have the same problem for the last few weeks, so I can't&nbsp;get to Internet using my phone.. Neither USB nor Bluetooth in the PC Suite One Touch Access works any more.</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of the recommended manual configuration resolves this either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No problem browsing the www from the phone directly, just not from the PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something has definitely changed in the last few weeks, but what ? Might it be at the same time that I installed the latest version of PC Suite? I am on V 7.1.60.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybody with some Ideas please - I really need this to work when I'm out of the office !?</p>

<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Sadly I am also encountering the same problem here.</p>
<p><span>I'm using Nokia Suite latest version...I'm getting "<span>Failed</span>
<span>to</span> establish a <span>
network</span> <span>connection</span>" error while
<span>connecting</span> my N8 mobile using GPRS one touch access
<span>to</span> internet in Nokia&nbsp;suite and I'm getting this error only for my Windows 7 OS (64 bit) on PC. However, I'm using same software as well as same handset in windows XP and everything works fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I tried almost everything from my side in windows 7 OS (I have administrator rights)...uninstallation/installation PC Suite of multiple time....tey changing modem and
<span>network</span> settings...also tried using access point name and extra initialization commands in settings.... (btw...I'm using&nbsp;Starhub cellular operator, Singapore).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It would be appreciated...If someone from Nokia technical department can help on this issue....also other users can provide inputs if someone fixed this issue...will be helpful for me....</span></p>
<p><span>I really need this option while i am out of my home / office network conectivity.</span></p>

<p>does ?</p>
<p>If not, we need to double-check your APN. Therefore, which network operator do you use, in which country? Is it on contract (postpaid) or pay-as-you-go (prepaid)? Because you mention a Nokia C3, is that the Nokia C3-00 or Nokia C3-01?</p>

    <title>WINDOWS 10 - Quarantine - Unable to remove legit programs from it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robbie73  say:</h3>
<h2>            WINDOWS 10 - Quarantine - Unable to remove legit programs from it</h2>
                    <p>Dear MS,&nbsp; (and the community),<br />
Right off of the bat, I am going to tell you I am absolutely <span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">
<strong>LIVID</strong><em> </em></span>at Windows king Defender under Windows 10 and it's running amok and controlling with MY files.<br />
I had set up all my exclusions across several drives and disabled Windows Defender as best I could, and left Windows 10 machine alone for a few months. Mainly because it's actually my gaming and multimedia/music making rig and I was not very creative for that
 period. <br />
</p>
<p>Anyway, it's a high spec machine and I needed it's rescources (disk/ram/cpu/grpx) for a video editing project so fired it up and checked for updates, which I completely regret now. That is because the new build/update, completely removed ALL my settings
 for Windows Defender, Firewall and Cortana (my own little workaround, Corana and Edge are rubbish in my opinion). So quite a lot of configuration time lost, well, stolen effectively. And it'll all need doing again, so double the time and effort.
<br />
<br />
Anyway, the consequence is Defender has now not only quarantined some useful "Potentially Unwanted Programs", but removed entire directories where they reside, so took help files and other "innocent" files with them.&nbsp; 'Ok', I think to myself, I'll restore them
 from Quarantine.&nbsp; But thats not working.&nbsp; No Errors. It's just not restoring them. I even recreated the directory structure and make sure all the permissions were set correctly, but nope. Defender won't restore them.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
NOW: I realise that Windows 10 is "Licensed" from MS rather than owned by me, but I want to say that no matter the OS or providers terms, here's are some fundamental facts that Miscrosft should begin to respect:&nbsp;<br />
I have granted the privilege to Microsoft, at MY COST to run THEIR Software on MY HARDWARE, using MY Electricty etc, but even more importantly, alongside
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">MY DATA</span>.&nbsp; They can do what the hell they please with the operating system, but
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">MY DATA is mine</span></strong>. No matter what anybody says.<br />
What's particularly infuriating is that all my efforts to prevent MS doing such was completely overridden, without my knowledge or consent. The programs are effectively stolen (or held to ransom if I can stop defender doing this and release them, stolen if
 I can't). </p>
<p>And I bet there will be no official apology. <br />
<br />
I'm reasonably technically savvy and I do a lot of computer work for friends and relatives, and the files that were apparently "Potentially Unwanted" were, on numerous occasions very useful tools that saved a lot of time and frustration over the years. They
 are not illegal or anything of the kind. MS decided it didn't like them so removed them.
<br />
So if I restore them from my backups, (oh gawd..I'll have to check those as Defender may have poked it's nose in those as well!!) they'll be removed again and won't be able to be restored, again.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Defender is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">BROKEN</span>. In a bad way, by it's designers. Not a good way way where regsvr32-ing a .dll will help.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can one of you MS staff (ha, as if they bother in having an appearance in these places. MS does not want to respond to feedback, let alone see it) or a friendly community helper help me unquarantine the files that Windows defender decided to remove please?
<br />
And also prevent it happening again please? I do not want Defender AV running against my data, what-so-ever.
<br />
<br />
Ultimately, I would like to be able OPT-in or OPT-out of what Defender does with MY DATA. I don't think it's that much to ask.
<br />
<br />
(Sorry readers for the 'rant'. It's not really a rant, I've not even started on the telemetry and data slurping yet!)<br />

            Hello Harish,<br />
Thank you for replying and taking the time read about my frustrations and offering to help. I do appreciate it sincerely.
<br />
<br />
<span><strong><em>1. May I know the edition and build of Windows 10 you are currently running on your system?</em></strong></span><br />
<br />
I just discovered that none of the text on the 'immersive settings' pages can actually be copied/pasted! It would be good to have that ability, perhaps I will feedback via the feedback app. But I can't imagine many people thinking it as a high priority or even
 very functional so won't get many votes. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I've digressed again...sorry! I reverted to good old Run&gt;MsInfo32. I have put what I hope is the most relevant information below:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
OS Name&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Microsoft Windows 10 Pro<br />
Version&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;10.0.17134 Build 17134<br />
OS Manufacturer&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Microsoft Corporation<br />
System Name&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;WIN10<br />
System Type&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;x64-based PC<br />
Processor&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;AMD FX(tm)-9590 Eight-Core Processor, 4700 Mhz, 4 Core(s), 8 Logical Processor(s)<br />
Hardware Abstraction Layer Version = "10.0.17134.285"<br />
Installed Physical Memory (RAM)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;16.0 GB<br />
<br />
I have to rush to an appointment now, but i shall definitely read up the links that you have provided.
<br />
Thank you again.<br />
<br />
