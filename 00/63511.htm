<p>Hello, MADDUCKY013,</p>
<p>Im assuming that you want to place a name of your Xbox on your home network.</p>
<p>To answer your question, you will need to change your Host name on your Xbox 360. To do this, go to the Settings tab on your home screen - &gt; System - &gt; Network Settings - &gt; Choose your Network Name - &gt; Click on Configure Network - &gt; Switch to the Additional
 Settings tab - &gt; Select Advanced Settings - &gt; Select Host Name - &gt; Place a unique name for the Xbox 360 console.</p>
<p>Please note: This feature is used only if the ISP requires a name displayed on your router. However, if your ISP does not require a name then feel free to change it as it will not affect your Xbox Live connection regardless.</p>
<p>I hope that this clears up any confusion on your behalf or ours.</p>
        </p>

</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is now unusable as the start menu will not allow me to get even to File checker!!! What are you doing about this??? Lots of people now have this problem, why don't you answer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you run file checker without a start menu, as this is the only clear advise I have seen yet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC upgraded to Windows 10 from windows 7, which was working perfectly fine until this upgrade. The Critical error message says it will try to fix it next time you sign in. Please believe me, it does not!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please get back to me with a clear and easy solution for people with little or modest computer skills. My home business is dependent upon having a working computer.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Thanks for your reply, which I have looked at in detail. This is WINDOWS 10 WINDOWS 10 WINDOWS 10</span></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<p>Your answer Method 1 is for windows 8 or 8.1 not windows 10 which operates differently and is what we are trying to fix. You can not swipe corners in Windows 10 and Start menu is not working. How can you perform an SFC routine when you don't have a working
 start menu on windows 10? You have given references to fixes available on Windows 8. This problem is on windows 10 not windows 8???</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<div>
<span>Your answer Method 2 &nbsp;Please see my comments above, once again you give a fix for Windows 8 not windows 10.</span></div>
<div>
<div>
<br />
<span>Your answer Method 3. I would like to try the first two before doing anything complicated.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Please give me a reply that applies to Windows 10 not windows 8 without a working start menu.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

            <p>I feel your pain. Maybe you have already seen my post from last week but here it is again anyway:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<div>
<div>SHAME ON YOU, MICROSOFT:</div>
<div>There are hundreds if not thousands of worldwide posts already on the internet complaining about that major issue, that is the Critical Error-Start Menu and Cortana aren't working. We'll try to fix it the next time you sign in" (which of course doesn't
 work, what a joke!).</div>
<div>
<p>I have tried countless of so-called "solutions" found here and there on the net, including several suggested by your "brilliant" software engineers (who I suspect very well know the troubleshooting won't fix anything, which is quite insulting as far as I'm
 concerned), wasting hours and hours trying to figure out how to fix your mess, or even trying to revert back to Windows 7, all to no avail. (I just read the troubleshooting steps suggested by the support engineer in this thread and I was laughing so hard you
 have no idea. Sfc scan, PowerShell, DISM, whatever other bs...IT DOES NOT WORK! Microsoft knows it, the support engineers know it: &nbsp;the real and true problem lies much deeper than an obscure command in a PowerShell or a surface scan. It is a major software
 design fault that can only be fixed by the culprit itself, that is Microsoft, who rushed to deliver a seriously defective software to the general public without proper checking, and now the numerous victims of Microsoft's incompetence are stuck with damaged
 computers.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Man, I had a perfectly fine working Windows 7 before installing this piece of garbage. No wonder it's free!</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>MICROSOFT, you owe it to your customers to have your I.T. SWAT team work around the clock to come up with a fix ASAP via an update that automatically installs without having the end-user perform some complicated computational cyber-gymnastics to repair
 your useless catastrophic non-operating system.</div>
<div>You also owe it to your customers to keep us posted about development via press releases so we know what's going on and when exactly can we expect to get our computers back to normal. Anything less would show contempt and arrogance and will guarantee you
 a PR nightmare, you can be certain of that. Simply hiding behind some vague casual statements from a brain-washed spokesperson is not enough, such as this gem early on in August:</div>
<div>"Microsoft has acknowledged the issue and Jen, who works for Microsoft, stated that they are looking into the matter and that a fix is on the way. We've fixed many of the underlying causes for this issue, but there are still some eluding us, and I'm sorry
 to hear that this is impacting you guys" (no kidding, Jen!)."We have telemetry and crash reports that we're watching for this."</div>
<div>
<p>Thanks for the update, Jen from Microsoft. So, Jen, any news since then?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Signed: An incredibly frustrated and angry customer</p>

                    Hi, I just installed a new GPU and after rebooting my computer, I'm not being presented with a login prompt, when I interact with the PC it just goes to this screen and I am not able to progress further. I have tried multiple times the "shift" + restart
 method to boot the computer in safe mode but it has just done a normal reboot each time. Any advice would be much appreciated concerning this problem, thanks!!<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/69d2386c-1c76-4fd4-9ace-9de20c11cf86?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/69d2386c-1c76-4fd4-9ace-9de20c11cf86?upload=true" /></a>

<h3> cuzinchuck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forcing a normal boot out of Safe Mode without using Admin logon</h2>
                    <p>1) In windows 10, I entered into Safe Mode to run anti-virus software.&nbsp; However, I forgot my hotmail password, and that's my only admin logon.&nbsp; I had been using the 4 number easy logon for so long, the old password slipped my memory. without that password,
 I can't get into any admin functions like msconfig to force a normal reboot that way.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I was able use my Guest Account to log into Safe Mode with Network.&nbsp; Via the web, I changed my hotmail/Microsoft account password. However, the new password will not propagate to the local machine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to either get back to Normal boot mode, or, force the local machine to take my new hotmail password.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Or, go back in time to remember my old password. Hmmm, I suspect this is beyond the scope of this community, probably not too far beyond it, though. :) )<br />

            <p>The 1st thing is to create a new, local Account with Admin privileges. That way you know you can at least get into the computer by one means or another in normal mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Log in as that user so the computer is connected then try switching to your main account. You can always delete the local account once it works.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Manually forcing a Normal Boot.&nbsp; If there's a way to do this, I imagine a Microsoft technician might be able to help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Force my local machine to take my newly reset password for my Microsoft account of the same name.&nbsp; Works for my Hotmail, One Drive, and this forum..... can I get it to propagate to my local machine?</p>

            <p>I gave up trying to do this myself.</p>
<p>I made an appointment with a tech at a Microsoft Store. He plugged in a thumb drive full off debugging tools, mysteriously logged in as an admin. He went to the msconfig screens and &nbsp;showed me the where it had been set up so if it was in Safe Mode it would
 reboot only back to Safe Mode. He changed that setting, mysteriously cleaned up a couple more settings. When he was done the computer rebooted into Normal Mode and I could log in, first with my four number passcode, then with my Microsoft Account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Took about fifteen minutes total, and he didn't charge me a penny. Still I'm upset about Windows 10 and it's weird Safe Mode default rebooting, and the lack of a "Normal Mode" option in the Advanced Boot Options page. &nbsp;Bad design, Microsoft!</p>

            Safe mode is not the default for Windows 10, its just a Startup&nbsp;option which appears to have been set ( never found one configured this way). Its a flag in the registry that for some reason was wrong. The assumption is that if it gets set the user know
 how to unset it hence no specific option in Advanced troubleshooting mode.

    <title>Turn Off Caps&#47;Num Lock Indicator - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elegant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turn Off Caps&#47;Num Lock Indicator</h2>
                    So I have this REALLY annoying indicator and I can't figure out how to turn it off. It just appeared today after my keyboard locked up out of the blue. I have not installed new drivers in over a week or 2. This is also on a Desktop assembled by hand with
 no pre-installed software.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3c95a052-a77f-479e-a744-a5df7b68d2a5" /><br />
<br />
I have no idea what it's from. I'm using a G19 Logitech keyboard with 8.50 LGS drivers and I do not see any indicators in its settings (SetPoint is not installed nor does it exist as a process). The Control Panel is off no help as it's settings of holding down
 the Num Key for 5 seconds doesn't work and also disabling it doesn't work.<br />

            <p>Hi Sayan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I entered sfc/scannow at the command prompt and got the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"There is a system repair pending which requires reboot to complete.&nbsp; Restart windows and run SFC again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of the changes made by the application I mentioned in my previous note, I am unable to reboot my computer.&nbsp; When I turn off the machine, and turn it back on, I briefly see an image of "HP" (it's an HP laptop) and then the screen goes blank and remains
 that way.&nbsp; I can access the Windows command prompt by repeatedly turning the unit off then on again, which causes the computer to do a self diagnosis.&nbsp; This results in an option to either try to restart the unit, or take other actions.&nbsp; When I opt for taking
 other actions, I am able to choose advanced options, which allows me to try system restore, or the command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned before, I am unable to perform a system restore, and the sfc/scannow command will not work without a reboot.&nbsp; Additionally, the DISM.exe commands you provided are not recognized by my computer.&nbsp; I get the message:&nbsp; "Option is unknown" when
 I type in these commands.</p>

            <p>Hi Sayan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I created a Windows 10 ISO using the site you referenced.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I inserted it into my PC, nothing happened.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I then used the Advanced Options menu “Use a device” and selected “EFI DVD/CDROM”<span>&nbsp;
</span>and received the following error message:<span>&nbsp; </span>“The selected boot device failed – press enter to continue”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When I pressed enter, it went to the Boot Manager, with only one option.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When I selected that option it returned me to the normal bootup procedure which resulted in a blank screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, I am able to access the Automatic Repair menu by turning on and off my machine a few times.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It performs a “Diagnosing your PC” and gives me the following message:<span>&nbsp;
</span>“Your PC did not start correctly – Press “Restart” to restart your PC, which can sometimes fix the problem (it didn’t) or try other options to repair your PC”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When I tried “Startup Repair” I get the following message: “ Startup Repair could not repair your PC.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Press “Advanced Options” to try other options to repair your PC.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Log File C:\windows\system32\logfiles\srt\srttrail.txt”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the command menu I looked up the above file:<span>&nbsp; </span>This message is at the end of the file:<span>&nbsp;
</span>“The operating system version is incompatible with Startup Repair”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>Where do we go from here?</span>

            <p>Hello Herbert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted on the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since you are booting using a DVD, there is a chance that it might be corrupted ( eg : scratches on the surface making it unreadable)<br />
There is also the case that your PC hardware cannot understand the read files ( mistake while burning the DVD)
<br />
And finally, your system driver for DVD can also be bad. <br />
<br />
First, try the same DVD on another system( don't install , just make sure its readable.)
<br />
If the DVD has no issues, check out your bios settings and make sure it reads the DVD drive.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Sayan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had no luck with the second DVD that I made. &nbsp;It was not readable on either of my PC's, the sick one or the good one. &nbsp;Might be because I'm still using XP on my good PC. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My "broken" PC spent the last week at a computer shop where they tried to make it respond -- no luck there either. &nbsp;They suspect that there are one or more corrupt Windows 10 graphic files that will not let the System Restore function work. &nbsp;It certainly
 seems like this is the case since the System Restore function identified the following file as failing to extract:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">C:\Users\Herbert\AppData\Packages\MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bb</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Obviously, this is a Windows 10 file. &nbsp;Without reinstalling Windows 10 and dumping all of my applications, is there anyway I can repair or delete this corrupted file?</span></p>

</p><p>I ended up resetting my PC and reinstalling Windows 10.&nbsp; I've checked the system restore function and it works fine so the copy of Windows 10 in the recovery partition on my hard drive wasn't corrupted.&nbsp; Now I'm in the process of reloading each of my apps

<h2>            Low disk space error</h2>
                    Running Win7 with external hard drive. I have moved all files and program files to hard drive to create more disk space but still show 0 space available. How can I clear out stuff I don't need? It won't let me do a system restore because there is no disk
 space available. Can I manually crash the laptop and reinstall Windows? How do I do this? Is there a better way? I am really desparate!!&nbsp; :(

<p>Thanks Bill that is very helpful but I have a similar problem and that is the partitioned drive F: shows that it has "Other" files taking up most of the space on the drive with 39.3MB free of 499MB.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run the Treesizfree program you mentioned to see what files are on it, it says F:Recovery yet when I click the drive it shows no folders so it seems it was recovered? folders and they have taken up most of the space on the drive yet it cant be accessed.
 How do I access the folders in this case? Thanks Dez</p>

<p>Leave the Recovery partition alone.</p>
<p>If it is the manufacturer's recovery drive, we don't need to see what's on it.</p>

<h2>            2 days until automatic activation&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p><span>I have completed, (I thought), an upgrade on my HP laptop from Vista H.P. 64bit to Windows 7 H.P. 64bit less than 20 hours ago. I was about to start updating
 my programs from Vista to 7 when I first decided to right click on my desktop computer icon just to verify that I was in the Windows 7 O/S. Well it did show that I was in Win 7 H.P. 64bit and then as I scrolled to the bottom of the window, I see a little pair
 of keys on a key ring and alongside it reads the following: "2 days until automatic activation. Activate Windows now". Then if that isn't strange enough, just below that sentence is this: "Product ID: *****-OEM-*******-*****" followed by "Change Product Key"
 in blue font.&nbsp;I replaced the numbers with&nbsp;asterisk, (for obvious reasons),&nbsp;which represent exactly how many digits in each set, (they are all numbers), with the "OEM" placed as shown. I have not clicked on the "Activate Windows Now" and won't until I understand
 what is going on. Of course, I don't think I have much time left before it will apparently activate itself. Can anyone tell me what this all means? BTW, the Product ID is not the one that I was given with the purchase of my upgrade and I did use it, (the key
 that I did receive),&nbsp;in the upgrade process. If it helps, I have apparently lost several of my HP&nbsp;options/functions that I had before this upgrade such as Quick Launch Buttons and PC Doc. In several attempts, I have failed to recover that at this time. However,
 if these 2 problems are unrelated, then I am only concerned about the "Activate Now" part of this description. Because of the apparent 'count-down' I would appreciate the soonest responses and suggestions as is possible. Thank You.</span></p>

<p><span>Thanks Andre,</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That was a great help! I succeeded in authenticating/verifying the Windows download and I also succeeded in getting the Quick Launch
 Buttons going with your absolutely 'above and beyond' help! Thank You.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>I have been loading and adjusting the laptop with the upgrade and followed all the instructions that Windows provided and simultaneously
 I was also installing a new all-in-one HP refurb for my wife. I also have a more powerful HP desktop which came with Windows 7. The goal, of course, is to have all 3 with the same O/S so we can easily share certain programs and have one trouble-shoot plan
 if something should go wrong. My wife's all in one has been doing fine with all the new downloads I've been feeding it but bouncing back &amp; forth between the Laptop and her desktop was a little more than I really wanted to handle. I just didn't think it through
 before I started.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>That said it's been the upgraded laptop that has been making me work hard. The laptop is a HP Pavilion dv-9925nr refurb with a 2.0
 GHz AMD processor and 4 GB RAM. It came with Vista H.P. 64bit and I probably should have left it. Because when I go to the HP support site and get myself to the place for a Vista to Win 7 upgrade they ask me for the model number of the Laptop and then tell
 me to pick the program I'm upgrading to from a short drop down list. Well they don't have Windows 7 64bit, (or even Windows 7), in the list. So I click on the phrase "click here if your choice is not shown" and a box opens and states that this laptop cannot
 be HP upgraded if the choice is not in the list! I ran the Windows upgrade assistant to check compatibility and it did not bring that point up. All it said was that there was a compatibility issue with the quick launch buttons. Before I did the upgrade I was
 sure that I had 'PC Dock' by HP in the system. But I've done searches for it and can't find it. I may have just imagined it because I use my Desktop, (which has PC Dock), a lot more than my laptop, at least for the last 8 or 9 months. I'm guessing that it
 may have just been in my imagination although my wife's refurbed HP also has PC Dock. I don't know what to think but I've been at it since 8AM and it is now 1:00am. I think I just need to rest a while. But thanks again, you've been great.</span></span></p>

<p>The 2 days before Automatic Activation means, in 2 days, Windows will attempt activate automatically over the Internet. The actually amount of time you have to activate is about 27 days, you can do this either by telephone or by Internet whichever one you
 find most convenient. You should activate Windows 7 though, since this is an indication that your license has not be validated. If you want to activate by telephone, please use the following method:</p>
<p>Activate Windows 7 manually:<br />
1. Click Start, and in the Search box type :&nbsp; slui.exe 4<br />
<br />
2. Press ENTER on your Keyboard<br />
<br />
3. Select your Country.<br />
4. Select the Phone Activation option, and hold on for a real person.</p>
<p>If you did not enter the Windows 7 Product Key during installation:</p>
<p>You can re-enter your key by going to Start, type “slui.exe 3” in the search box and press enter.</p>
<p><em><span>If it helps, I have apparently lost several of my HP&nbsp;options/functions that I had before this upgrade such as Quick Launch Buttons and PC Doc.</span></em></p>
<p><span>You should be able to get the updated drivers from HP's website:</span></p>

<p>I have been having a small problem with one of the apps on my Yahoo homepage. I called and got a tech who in analyzing my problem stated there was a breach of my computer with a foreign address. She showed me where there were a number of foreign address
 being established but not looking. The problem with Yahoo has been going on for months and I have yet to have any security breaches in my financials and such. She also stated the only way I could fix this was to have a Micro Cert Tech fix it at $499 a computer!
 This is a bit outrageous and I am sure there are other ways to fix this so-called problem. Also she went into running processes and showed where there were many stopped processes and others that were running. She stated there are too many there. Looking at
 them they all appeared legit. Any thoughts on this and a way I can fix it? I am pretty good at computers so there shouldn't be a problem on my end. Thanks for any help. I have been using Avast as my AV for many years and have had no problems with viruses or
 such</p>

                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought an Asus Tranformer Book t100ta, and I want to do the free upgrade to windows 10. It has 32gb on the Tablet and a 500Gb Hdd on the base. I upgrade using the 500gb drive to save the previous windows installation (windows 8.1 with bing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything goes fine until 46% installing windos and 37% 'installing features and reivers', I stucks there forever. I don't know what to do. I tried a lot o times and always is the same</p>

    <title>External Monitor Keeps Going Blank - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregraff  say:</h3>
<h2>            External Monitor Keeps Going Blank</h2>
                    <p>Each time I plug in my external monitor (LG 34UM95) into my Surface Pro 4 (i7 16gb) after a while it starts going blank for a few seconds at a time. Nothing shows in the event logs about this at all. I have all the latest updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell it only seems to happen when the screen is set to "extended" rather than "second screen only".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had issues with this kind of behavior?<br />
</p>

<p>After numerous updates the device seems to be slowly improving with regards to general stability but this issue has persisted for me long with the 'antenna-gate' style Wifi failure when USB3 devices are plugged in.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed this behavior nearly as long as I've had the device. I bought the monitor roughly 2-3 weeks after I bought the SP4, so the middle of January is when I first noticed it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've not tried it on other displays apart from my previous screen, which was an old HP TFT. I didn't keep it plugged in for long due to a strange issue where my wifi connection would stop working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have the dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disconnection and reconnection doesn't seem to make a difference, although like I mentioned above, if I switch the device to "second screen only" mode that seems to stop it from occurring. That's obviously not ideal as it mean's I'm losing the use of the
 tablet's screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to occur more frequently when trying to view things like video or trying to play games. I think the first time I saw it was when I was trying to run Netflix on the tablet when browsing the web on the external screen. Before the big firmware/driver
 update I used to see a notification to inform me the graphics driver had failed and was restarted after the screen when blank a few times. Since the update I've not seen that error but the screen has still been going blank intermittently.</p>

            <p>I've found a web page where I can consistently replicate the issue. On this occasion it didn't require both screens to be in use to trigger it. I was running in Second Screen Only mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a video about half way down the page, as soon as it comes into view and starts playing the screen goes blank for around 5-10 seconds, briefly comes back on and then repeats until either the window is closed or the video goes out of view. Have tried
 in MS Edge and Google Chrome. Only seems to occur in Edge.</p>

            <p>I have a surface 4 pro, LG 34UW95 monitor connected to a surface 4 dock.&nbsp; After starting up, I get the second screen as one would expect.&nbsp; Once I login the external display will blank out continuously every 1-2 minutes.&nbsp; In the past I have gotten this to
 stop by changing the refresh rate to something other than what it is currently set to (for example if it is 50, I change to 30... if 30, I change to 50).&nbsp; Sometimes this trick doesn't work and I have to plug the mini-dp into the surface directly.&nbsp; The only
 thing that is consistent, it happens every time video comes from the dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already researched this issue to no end.&nbsp; I have tried different adapters, purchased&nbsp;multiple active adapters, changed cables, purchased recommended cables, applied the necessary updates, patches, firmware updates.&nbsp; This happens in mini-dp to HDMI
 or mini-dp to DisplayPort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I reimaged the machines from the system restore back to factory defaults.&nbsp; I applied the 4/19 updates and the issue continues.&nbsp; In verifying the driver versions (for items applicable to the dock or video), everything appears to be updated).&nbsp; The only
 exception to this is the "Surface Integration".&nbsp; In the 4/19 release it states it is 1.6, but my version is 1.59.&nbsp; Not sure if this was a mistake or if it didn't update for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other interesting info:</p>
<p>When using mini-dp to DisplayPort, the sound is scratchy.&nbsp; Does not playback through the monitor correctly.&nbsp; HDMI is fine with sound.</p>
<p>

            Anyone sorted this out.&nbsp; This is a showstopper for me (one of the reasons I bought the surface pro 4 was to drive a 4K monitor).&nbsp; I bought it last week so can still probably send it back in the next few days.&nbsp; I'm guessing it isn't really getting resolved.&nbsp;
 I am connected to an AOC 2879 monitor via a mini displayport connection with no dock (straight into the surface pro 4).<br />

            I suggest they fix the MS Answers forums to prompt for fundamental system information when a new question is asked, but so far that hasn't worked out.<br />
<br />
The Dell Dimension 8400 has a SATA hard drive, so using the Recovery Console CD you made from xp_rec_con.iso will not work with SATA drives - that will only work on IDE drives so you are going to have to run chkdsk another way.&nbsp; It was a good thought though.<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think happened to it?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; avast!. Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
It is possible that the file really is missing or corrupt and, but hopefully it is just a little corruption in the NT File System (NTFS) and a chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; will clear it up but you are going to cross your fingers and run it another way:<br />
<br />
Make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD which you can download from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a><br />
<br />
The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete bit it is worth it.&nbsp; Then unzip the download to extract the Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.<br />
<br />
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD.&nbsp; You have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it, but I have never used it and prefer to use ImgBurn.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a><br />
<br />
When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install anything from UniBlue or the Ask toolbar (never install the ASK toolbar for anything).<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a><br />
<br />
It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the Mini XP option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already
 used to using.<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop.<br />
<br />
One way to check the disk for errors is to open My Computer and right click your afflicted drive and choose Properties, Tools, Error-checking, Check Now... put a check mark in both the boxes and then Start.<br />
<br />
Sometimes that doesn't work, so you can also click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<b>cmd</b><br />
<br />
Click OK to open a Command Prompt window and enter the following command (assuming XP is installed on your C drive)<br />
<br />
<b>chkdsk&nbsp; c:&nbsp; /r</b><br />
<br />
This disk checking can take a long time (perhaps several to many hours) depending on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what the disk checking finds to do.
<br />
<br />
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Depending on the the speed of your system, the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what chkdsk finds to do, it may take a long time for chkdsk with error correction to complete (several to many hours) or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'.&nbsp;
 Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something so don't interrupt it.&nbsp; It will finish eventually one way or the other.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards
 sometimes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may have to run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; it more than once.</p>
<br />
When the chkdsk runs clean, remove the CD and restart your system.<br />
<br />

            <p>I did use the xp_rec_con.iso before with this computer and it worked, I was able to run chkdsk.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't copy the file, I burned it to a CD.</p>

<p>&nbsp;This problem just happened, only thing I know of is that Windows wouldn't shut down normally so I turned off the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have McAfee antivirus and also run Malwarebytes and SuperAntiSpyware daily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been to the Hiren's page and the only thing that downloaded was "Open It" which opens a zip file.&nbsp; I can't find any place to download Hiren's Boot CD, everything I click on takes me to ZIP OPENER.</p>

            When I see that message, i usually interpret it to mean that XP just can <i>
find </i>the file - because the file system is corrupted.<br />
<br />
That is why I always ask these questions to get a little history:<br />
<br />
<i>If the system used to work properly, what do you think happened to it?</i><br />
<br />
<i>Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)</i><br />
<br />
You describe an improper shutdown.<br />
<br />
Since your Windows would not shut down normally and you turned off the computer, that can corrupt the file system.&nbsp; XP is
<i>trying </i>to load, but probably just can't find the file.&nbsp; The error is also easy to reproduce - while XP is running, pull the plug on your system a few times and you will see that exact error.&nbsp; It is also usually easy to fix with a chkdsk with error correction,
 but maybe your situation is more complex and even chkdsk may not help - sometimes that happens.<br />
<br />
I checked the links in my other reply about Hiren's and everything looks okay to me (I have posted that same message 1000+ times here), so maybe you can work on that some more, maybe you have a geeky friend that can help, some other folks here may have some
 other ideas too, or you might have to take it to a shop you can trust and maybe they can fix it.&nbsp; You are on the right track though.<br />
<br />
If the file is really missing or corrupt, Hiren's has tools that can usually help fix that too which is why I like to use it.&nbsp; The XP Recovery Console is fine for some things, but sometimes you need to use something else.<br />
<br />
If your HDD is really messed up, you can usually use Hiren's to salvage off your personal files too (can't do that from Recovery Console).<br />
<br />
<i>Geeky </i>- I don't mean that in a negative way....&nbsp; I'm a little geeky myself sometimes :)<br />
<br />
Severe weather here so I think I will sign off.<br />

            <p>Greetings Robear - </p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this post has been dead for almost two years, but that's what I'm ticked about actually!&nbsp; Based on how irritated I am right now at the "sudden" end (to what was turning out to finally possibly lead me to some answers about Windows Update problems
 I've been experiencing), I can imagine how annoying and disappointing it would be to be in your position and have someone you are assisting to play a disappearing act on you like DaveHotMail did above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also want to mention that you are one of the very few MS folks who actually was following up with the original poster and trying to assist them.&nbsp; I've been reading MS community Q&amp;A for quite some time and have noticed a very nasty trend of MS employees
 having a very low rate of follow-up after posting a series of troubleshooting steps to assist.&nbsp; The original poster responds and then the MS employee never comes back...lots of "yoo-hoo?"s out there!&nbsp; The MVPs and VIPs do MUCH MUCH better than the folks who
 are getting paid by MS to "assist" and I for one definitely appreciate it when I see it and wanted you to know I greatly appreciate your willingness to dedicate your time to help others, to follow-up, and also for putting up with what is likely a large amount
 of OPs who go ghost in the middle of you helping them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was irritated by Dave's sudden disappearance because I have the same original error code from Windows Update and was following along with your feedback from 20 months ago and then ---- SILENCE.&nbsp; It has to get pretty old for you if considering how irritated
 it makes me and I'm not the one who put all the effort into trying to help Dave.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if Dave just got frustrated with the basic level of questions, found an answer elsewhere and just didn't have the courtesy (oh, let's give him the benefit of the doubt and say he meant to but forgot) to tell you he fixed his issue, or what.&nbsp;
 I hope he is okay....&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This was actually the first thread I had followed in MS Community regarding this issue.&nbsp; I honestly haven't put a whole lot of effort into fixing this continuing error because what I<strong> really want to do is get my Windows 10 Upgrade installed</strong>.&nbsp;
 I notice you are a Windows 10 launch expert as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was quite impressed with your manner of helping, your thoroughness, and timeliness, so if&nbsp;you are still actively assisting people in MS Community I'd like to post a new question about problems installing&nbsp;Windows
 10 on my Samsung RF510 laptop.&nbsp; After complete download, install, and reboot, hangs on Win10 logo.&nbsp; So please advise if you've still got the time to help I'd appreciate you letting me post the question and getting your assistance getting Windows 10 on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Bill</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.&nbsp; Great guidance on registry cleaners!!&nbsp; Has this situation changed at all since March 2014?&nbsp; Meaning are there any non-destructive registry cleaners that have since been released, especially public domain or from MS?</p>
