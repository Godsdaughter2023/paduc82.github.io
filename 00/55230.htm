<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Make sure any switch for WiFi are on (some have - some don't) - then go into Settings or Setup (BIOS/CMOS)<br />
as you Bootup (Start the Computer - watch screen for how to enter) and make sure WiFi is enabled (you may or
<br />
may not have this).<br />
<br />
The Error Code :<br />
<br />
This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device. (Code 31)<br />
Windows was unable to load the driver. Try updating the driver for this device.</p>
<p>On the General Properties tab of the device, click Troubleshoot to start the troubleshooting wizard.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager <br />
<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Do you have access using a wire network cable to your router or by plugging the the modem directly into your<br />
computer.<br />
<br />
If so make a Restore Point :<br />

<br />
Go to System maker's site and get the latest WiFi driver - Download - SAVE - do not install<br />
<br />
Then go to the device maker's site (who made the device such as Intel, Realtek, or so on) and<br />
get the newest driver - Download - SAVE - do not install.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it - driver's tab - write
<br />
down version - click Update Driver (may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then<br />
Right Click on Wifi Device and UNINSTALL - When you see it CHECK the box that says REMOVE DRIVER<br />
Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
When it asks to search for drivers allow it. After that is done<br />
<br />
Go to where you put the drivers above - System Maker's - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN - when complete<br />
REBOOT - this is your rollback<br />
<br />
If there was a Device Maker's newer driver do same for it.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even newer versions. (The<br />
ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated drivers as Vista loves<br />
updated drivers.<br />
<br />
I would also disable auto-updates for drivers. If Windows Updates suggests one just HIDE it as they<br />
are almost alway old and you can look for drivers manually as needed.<br />

<p>Hi Ian Blackwood (Ian.Blackwood),</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your post. Based on your description, did you mean other users can’t join in a Skype for Business meeting since participants in a Skype for Business meeting is full? If I have any misunderstanding, please feel free contact us. For further help,
 please help us to check following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>What version of the Skype for Business the customer are using? Please send it to us.</li><li>Did all Skype for business meeting created by this customer only can hold 10 people?
</li><li>Did all users can’t join in this meeting? External users or internal users?</li><li>Are this customer using Skype for Business server or Skype for Business online? If he is not familiar with it, please ask him contact the organization admin.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default, the limitation of participants in a Skype for Business meeting is 250 people. If there are only 10 people in Skype for Business meeting, other people can join the meeting. Meanwhile, please provide the complete error message to us, you can also
 send some screenshots to us for further analysis.</p>

            <p>Hi Jacoub,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the issue in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description provided, it looks like you cannot access C drive, which says don't have permission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we need some more information about the issue to assist you better:</p>
<p>Please help me answer these questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. How many user accounts are created in Windows 8?</p>
<p>2. Have you set any BIOS password when the computer boots up?</p>
<p>3. Is the issue specific to a particular troubleshooter?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try these steps to fix the issue with the C drive prompting for the Administrator permission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Press Win + X key and select " command prompt (admin).</p>
<p>b. Type the following commands and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">TAKEOWN /F c:\</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">ICACLS c:\ /grant administrators:F</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Type each of the commands mentioned above and press Enter.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Method 2:</strong></font></p>

            Thank you for response. I had made I believe four different users. But deleted them. Probably didn't help. My first on was Jacoub on C:\ and I see this the one that I am denied access to. Also I have made and deleted a few "trusted PC,s". the first one
 I have no idea how to get back on. If you haven't noticed im computer rookie and am horrible with over clicking not knowing what im doing or taking notes. I,ve tried resets to factory which is what I really would like. I have no super important files or media
 I cant replace. I know I deleted recovery files. accidently deleted last known point. So im pretty convinced Im my PCs worst enemy.&nbsp; As far as Bios go I pushed enter six time as admin\power black screen and that gave me some number(that I did write down.)
 I do believe that's when I got locked&nbsp;of C:&nbsp;after that. Hope this helps and thanks again for helping me out. Jake

            Thank you so much for answering.There is not any error codes or error msgs.This laptop top was given to me by my&nbsp;niece,who never took care of &nbsp;it.When i got it she had a whole lot of trojans,etc.I managed to get them off with malwarebytes,spybot,and superantispyware.
 I got it 2 yrs ago and i would say the last yr &nbsp;or a little longer all scans &nbsp;have turned up clean.The windows update has never stopped running since i got it,unless i turn it &nbsp;off manually.I did use the Fixit and just downloaded the Readiness &nbsp;tool.Here's
 hoping it works,because when it comes to messing with the registry,that makes me nervous lol. Once again Thank you.

    <title>How do you turn on safe mode in Windows 8&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jammerjonn  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you turn on safe mode in Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    How do you turn on safe mode in Windows 8? I was told it isn't on by default and I would like to get into safe mode and logon as the ADMIN and delete an account&nbsp; where the user can't remeber the logon password ( as you can do in all other windows versions).
 I did get into Advanced startup and selected #4 safe mode but that did not cause the system to reboot into safe mode. Microsofost says "safe mode must be turn on in windows 8" but can't find where to do this. Thanks!

            1. Run Command prompt as Admin<br />
2. Type:<br />
<br />
bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy legacy<br />
<br />
3. Ensure operation completed successfully<br />
4. Restart system and you'll find F8 works.<br />
or <br />
F8 equivalent in windows 8.<br />
<br />
1) In MSCONFIG, under "BOOT" make sure there is a decent timeout, say 10 seconds.<br />
2) Next, launch admin command prompt and ensure you are at C:\windows\system32. Now type the following and hit enter:<br />
<br />
reagentc /enable<br />
<br />
You will get a message "Operation completed successfully". Exit command prompt. <br />
<br />
3) Restart. You should get a boot menu with your regular boot entries plus<br />
"To specify more options for this choice, press F8"<br />
Now, with Windows 8 boot entry highlighted, press F8.<br />
4) In the next screen, you'll get the option to press F1-F9 for all the safe mode stuff etc.<br />
At the bottom, there'll be an option to press F10 for more options.<br />
5) Hit F10. Now you should see a menu to launch recovery menu.<br />
6) Press the recovery menu option and you're taken to the familiar window

    <title>Should I send my XBOX 360 Pro in for repair&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pizz3454  say:</h3>
<h2>            Should I send my XBOX 360 Pro in for repair&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>We have 3 XBOX 360s at home, used by my 5 kids.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have 2 of the newer slim models, and 1 Pro.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had the Pro sent in twice already.....once for the red ring of death and once for not powering on.&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time we got it back, it never seemed 100%.&nbsp;&nbsp;It
 does turn on everytime now, but when you power it on, it really sounds like it is struggling to turn on.....it sounds like it is winding really hard and then turns on.&nbsp;&nbsp;The disc drive seems to make lots of noise when you first put the game in.....it sounds
 like an old pc when you would put in a floppy disc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, and this doesn't happen all the time, but sometimes when you put a game in the screen reads "Open Tray" or won't read my game.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes I can get it to read it by removing the hard drive and putting
 it back on.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to be sure it wasn't the game, I tried the game in the XBOX 360 slims we have and the game worked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The warranty on this unit runs out on December 13.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not sure what to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;The system does play games, but it also has some quirks that scare me into thinking the system is about to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, in your opinion, should I send it in for repair?&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, is there a way to trade my Pro Model for a 250GB model?</p>

<p>It's really up to you. Personally, I'd take advantage of the warranty to see if I could save some money and get a console back that's in better shape. However, with 5 kids, Christmas coming up, and the new dashboard coming in a couple of weeks, buying a
 brand new console might be a better option for you.</p>
<p>There's no way to trade in the Pro for a new model through Microsoft. </p>

<p>You should see about sending it back in for repair, sounds like it is not working right.</p>
<p>There is no Microsoft trade in for old consoles. You would have to do that with a retailer in your area.</p>

<h2>            ethernet unidentified network&#47; no internet access&#47; public network</h2>
                    <p>Please help!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot connect to any device through ethernet cable on my laptop (running windows 7 ultimate)</p>
<p>I am currently trying to internet share my wireless connection with my panasonic tv but am unable to do so. The funny thing is that the laptop can see the tv as a media device and can stream through home share( occasionally) but when connected via ethernet
 cable It is an unidentified network with no internet access and stuck as a public network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The annoying thing is that I have connected my xbox 360 to my laptop in the same way in the past and it was working with no problems at all (a few years back however and im not sure if it was before i upgraded to windows 7 from vista). The xbox 360 now has
 the same problem of an unidentified network etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The furthest ive come to connecting my panasonic i was given an error message that there was no default gateway but most of the time there is no activity at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also uninstalled and reinstalled drivers and have ipconfig/flush&nbsp;&nbsp; and /release&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /renew in the command prompt with nothing</p>
<p>the ipconfig/all from the cmd.exe is as follows:</p>

            Re: Fix for "Unidentified Network" / No Internet Access
<div>
<div>
<blockquote>Solved ..................................<br />
<br />
The problem was resolved by going into the wired adapter (Local Area Connection networking controller) in windows device manager selecting the device right clicking Properties, choosing advanced --&gt; property --&gt;
<span>network
</span><span>address</span> --&gt; value and entering any mac-address (OR the existing by checking ipconfig/all
 from command prompt CMD) then ok button. after that 
<span>internet
</span><span>access</span> was restored.<br />
<br />
I don't know what caused this issue. with the machine in question i did a factory restore to fix another issue which the restore resolved and while trying to update windows discovered this issue. I don't really like this fix because it may trip things up later
 if by chance another device has the same mac-address as the one i madeup.<br />
<br />
anyway, thanks for your help -techguyisme<br />
<br />
<br />
oops, i forgot to say what the problem was! the mac-address of the wired nic adapter was all zeros 00:00:00:00...(see the ipconfig /all output in the original post); so i changed it to something other than all zeros<br />

    <title>Exclude media folders from system image backup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john smith_954  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exclude media folders from system image backup</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have a system with a SSD C: drive for the OS, a HDD D: drive for media/programs/etc., and a HDD E: drive dedicated to backups for a system restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing a clean W10 install + drivers/updates, I used the Windows backup tool to create a backup + system image of both C: and D: onto E: (letting Windows determine what to backup). The process went swimmingly. I then installed programs/games/etc. that
 existed from my earlier Windows. I performed another backup/system image creation, but this time I encountered an error; I forget what it was exactly, but I do remember the D: system image specifically failed, and that the error mentioned filesize/HDD space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that in mind, I changed two things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Backup settings:</p>
<p>Under "What do you want to backup?", I selected "Let me choose" and de-selected the Downloads folder under "Additional locations", leaving the individual drive backups unchecked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Registry edits:</p>
<p>I added two registry entries to <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\BackupRestore\FilesNotToSnapshot</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(based on this discussion:&nbsp;https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/b0c7413b-2d76-49dc-9abe-1846fdff5227/exclude-folders-from-system-image?forum=w7itprogeneral )</p>
<p>
</p><p>D:\Users\&lt;my name&gt;\Steam Games\*.* /s</p>
<p>D:\Users\&lt;my name&gt;\Downloads\*.* /s</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Steam Games" folder is where all my Steam games are located, and the "Downloads" folder is where I put all my media, downloaded or otherwise. The two together total about 300 of the 310 GB used up on my D: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I create a backup + image, the backup process is much quicker. It went from dozens of minutes long (during the second backup before the error) to just a few.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the image backup simply hangs once it gets to creating an image of the D: drive. It'll start and finish the C: drive image just fine, but it was stuck on the D: drive for roughly 1.5 hours before I just now canceled the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any advice on tackling this issue besides moving the games/media to a separate drive before backing up? Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now also getting an error during the regular backup process. The log says thus:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Backup encountered a problem while backing up file C:\Users\&lt;me&gt;\Documents. Error:(The system cannot find the file specified. (0x80070002))</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I moved my user folders (Documents, Downloads, etc.) to the D: drive. When looking through the backups on E:, I noticed that D:/Users/&lt;me&gt;/Documents was not present, even on the original backup (which reported no errors).</p>

<p>Is it just me or the difficulty is just unbalance to a point that we hate the game for the insane time you will have on the "VERY EASY" setting. To make things wrost is there are very little heath and beds in the levels it seems that this was for pros rather
 then for normal gamers.</p>

<p>I never played on anything lower than Normal. &nbsp;It sounds like maybe you're venturing into areas that are too high for you level and equipment. &nbsp;If you go straight from one main story-line quest to the next this can happen, you should slow down and do the
 side quests available in each area before moving on. &nbsp;This game can be quite challenging your first time through as it is really tempting to move forward full steam ahead, but it is really designed for you to take your time and more or less complete an area
 before you move on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bethesda ruins is a great place to go early on. &nbsp;The Raiders there respawn every 72 hours, so you can keep on going back there until you have decent equipment in good shape from them.</p>

<p>A great tip to making a good Wasteland worthy character is when you level up, only put points in the sections you're actually going to be using and specializing in. There's no sense in putting tons of points in Melee or Unarmed just to balance out all your
 categories if you're going to be using guns and never bothering with melee weapons. Avoid picking &nbsp;perks that don't really build up your character at all. Don't bother with the "Bloody Mess" perk and things like that until later in the game when you're a higher
 level. At first the game seems overwhelming and it seems like you're constantly using the few Stimpaks you have and using up the little bit of ammo you've accumulated. But do side missions (the ones that score achievements) and you'll earn a bunch of XP plus
 new weapons and armor that'll help you. Trust me, it will get alot easier. it just takes time to build up some XP and round up some useful items. You'll have more Stimpaks, ammo and Caps then you'll know what to do with. I'll be honest, I had to turn the difficulty
 down a tad at a couple earlier levels to get by, but&nbsp;remember the higher the difficulty setting the more XP you'll earn from things like&nbsp;killing enemies and completeing missions.

<p>Strive for the harder levels. More rewarding XP wise and challenging too. Early on inthe &nbsp;game prior to level 10 resources will be limited. Play on very hard You can max a character in under 35 hours both SPECIAL and skills. Look for unique clothing to artficially
 boost &nbsp;SPECIAL like pre war hats, the lucky shades to boost luck. They do help. Don't lose faith it's a great game to play. AS for slepping You can find free beds close to Megaton. SPringvale and down at the Super duper mart and under the bridge to the right
 of the store. Good luck</p>

<p>It's practical and beneficial to smell the roses in a Bethesda RPG. &nbsp;Work every side quest you can. &nbsp;I haven't had to turn the level down at all. &nbsp;My share of restarts but it's doable. &nbsp;Take your time bro. Enjoy.</p>

<p>Take the perk where you find more ammo in containers (<em><strong>Scrounger</strong> I think it is</em>).&nbsp; Look for
<em>Bobbleheads</em> in general &amp; especially those that that sinc with your TAG skills if possible.&nbsp; I also tend to recommend the
<em>Toughness</em>&nbsp;&amp; <em>Sniper</em> perks for this Fallout.&nbsp; Headshots save ammo for you &amp; require less hits on the foe.&nbsp; If they're in clustered groups &amp; you've got some grenades, use them.&nbsp;

<p>Scrounger is on my personal list of useless perks, as is Fortune Finder (does the same thing but for caps instead of ammo), as it is just too easy to build up a huge stockpile of ammo without it. &nbsp;It might be useful on a first play-through, but if you make
 sure your repair skill is high and you can easily tote tons of caps worth of gear from an outing and turn that into more ammo than you'll ever be able to use up. &nbsp;I absolutely agree with everything else though.</p>

<p>Na, &nbsp;I was like the OP;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a certain point I had next to no ammo &amp; everywhere I turned I saw either a Super Mutant or Centuar &amp; frankly made me turn off the game &amp; play other things for a long time (<em>I almost didn't get FNV due to this</em>). &nbsp;I
 set it to Easy for a bit too until I got that (<em>Scrounger</em>) perk. &nbsp;I also found where the Chinese remnants were hiding &amp; got more then enough of their Assault Rifles which also helped immensely.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do wish this game had the
<em>Jury Rigging</em> perk,&nbsp; as it is I've no way to repair the Chinese Stealth Armor if it gets damaged.&nbsp;

<p>Chinese Stealth Armor can be repaired with recon armor. &nbsp;You don't see them a lot in shops, but you'll find one once in a while. &nbsp;I always buy up any I see for this very reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few pointers: &nbsp;</p>
<p>Bethesda ruins are a great place to gather weaponry early on. &nbsp;While the Raiders there won't carry the Chinese Assault Rifle, they will carry regular ones, and with a good repair you can put their stuff together and end up with decent armor. &nbsp;You'll eventually
 have to replace everything you get from them, but the stuff is useful when your level is low.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Spoilers below*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have The Pitt it can be completed at a very low level. &nbsp;With one of my characters I came out of the Vault, got my Megaton home, then went straight to do Operation Anchorage, and from there went straight to The Pitt. &nbsp;One of the rewards for completing
 The Pitt is the ammo press, which you can use to convert scrap metal and ammo that you don't use into ammo that you need (guns only, not for energy weapons). &nbsp;If you're having a lot of trouble with ammo in the lower levels then I would advise doing something
 similar. &nbsp;In both of those add-ons you don't get to use your own stuff, so no worries about how much ammo you have when you start them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keeping your weapons in good repair and having a high guns (or energy weapons) skill will both make sure you are maximizing your damage per shot, and thus minimizing the amount of ammo you need to use per enemy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have the stealth armor then work on getting your sneak up high enough that the bonus from the armor boosts your sneak to 100+. &nbsp;Once that happens you can usually sneak right up to enemies even in broad daylight. &nbsp;If you have a decent melee weapon
 and skill level then you can kill a lot of enemies with a single sneak melee attack. &nbsp;The really nice thing about this is that melee weapons are considered silent, so you can actually take out a whole series of enemies that way. &nbsp;Just be careful not to bump
 into them or you may be spotted. &nbsp;The shishkebab is excellent for this, especially if you have the pyromaniac perk, and you can get schematics for this weapon early on. &nbsp;You'll have to build up a few caps first, depending on your barter skill, but Lucky Harith
 sells one of the schematics for it and he appears outside Megaton periodically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One more note: &nbsp;If you have Operation Anchorage there is a glitch that you can exploit to gain massive amounts of ammo and some gear with extremely high HP, so they rarely require repairs. &nbsp;Also, the Winterized T-51b power armor you receive at the end has
 almost 10 million HP, so you can wear it for a very long time before you can actually see its condition fall. &nbsp;That doesn't help with ammo supply, but once you have it you will probably wear either the T-51b or Stealth Armor for the rest of the game.</p>

<h2>            icons and display are way too big.  How can I make them small again&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I did nothing to change the size of my icons and display.&nbsp; Screen went dark and reopened with all the icons on my desktop and display to a very large size.&nbsp; Resetting the icon view to small did make them go back to small as they were.</p>

            <p>I made a mistake when posting the question.&nbsp;&nbsp; We've actually been trying to do this with&nbsp;the windows 10 Calendar app not the Windows 10 mail client.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a way to subscribe to icals directly&nbsp;using the Windows 10 Calendar app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only workaround I have found is to go to outlook.com, calendar, and then subscribe to the ical calendar there.&nbsp; As long as the outlook.com account is setup in Windows 10 calendar app&nbsp;then the accompanying subscriptions populate in the windows 10 Calendar
 app.&nbsp; However the timing seems to take a long time to refresh.&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't figured that out.</p>

            Winaero tweaker is a handy tool to customize Windows components that Windows by itself does not allow to. A recent example is customising font size. However, I would take caution to modify only those settings which are very necessary

            Hi Vampire Fox.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I don't recommend Tweaking suites.  But as my colleague Summit mentioned there are those who appreciate the font resizing only available now through this one.  
<br />
<br />What I would do to cover myself is save a System Image backup externally so you can go back in 20 minutes to where you are now at any time for any reason.  Use the free app all experts recommend here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>
<br />
<br />Then before each tweak you make with the app set a System Restore point after making sure System Restore is turned on for C and as much space as you can afford (5-15%) is configured for it.  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Vampire Fox, yes that is safe to use, in fact it brings back a lot of functionality that Microsoft have removed from Windows 10, like UI font resizing, changing the color of icon text and lots more . . .
<br />
<br />Most experts here on Community recommend that utility on a regular basis to fix these issues . . .

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Community reviews says that program is OK but use this 3rd-party software at your own risk. It will be better if you create System Restore point before using such kind of applications.</p>

<p>I'm very suspicious of any program that claims to "fix Windows errors and optimize system performance" and you should be too. There's no substitute for your own knowledge and judgement if you want to fix a problem or 'optimize' your computer's performance.
 A third-party program can't make those decisions for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fixer/optimizer programs rarely do anything of lasting value and frequently cause serious harm to your computer. And when they do cause serious harm, which might happen immediately or in the future, like during the next Windows update, you won't know what
 went wrong because you won't know what the program did or how to reverse it, if that's even possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a problem that you need to fix, address that problem directly. Ask about it here or show your computer to a professional. If you want your computer to run as well as it can, you can learn how to do that. It's not hard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone came up to you on the street and said "I can fix any problem you have, just leave it to me and don't ask questions," would you let them? Why would you let the same thing happen to your PC?</p>

If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items </strong><br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</strong><br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 6: Resolve the problem<br />
</strong>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the
 problem item.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 7:<br />
</strong><br />
Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
<br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</div>

<h2>            &#34;Destination Folder Access Denied&#34; appear when modified the Desktop.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a problem while I tried to copying, moving, saving, and deleting a file to Desktop. It happened yesterday.</p>
<p>For example, when I tried to copying a *.txt file to my Desktop, the "Destination Folder Access Denied" window appear.</p>
<p><a href="http://s261.photobucket.com/albums/ii63/picture_emotion/?action=view&amp;current=Capture.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi261.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fii63%2fpicture_emotion%2fCapture.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>This message makes me confused since I am the Administrator and there are no other users on my laptop.</p>
<p>I then noticed the UAC logo when I right click the Desktop -&gt; New -&gt; Folder (and it is the only thing that I could found)</p>

<p>It's not happened when I used the Windows in the Safe Mode.</p>
<p>I've tried to used the Microsoft Fix It (Mats_Run.winfilefolder.exe) and Troubleshooting feature to fix this problem, but it doesn't work. I've scanned the whole computer with Microsoft Security Essential (up to date), but found nothing.</p>
<p>Could you please help me with this problem?</p>

<p>Hi Gokul T,</p>
<p>- The error message appear when copying, creating, and deleting ALL TYPE of files.</p>
<p>- I didn't make any changes on any software and the OS.</p>
<p>Hmm,, I've perform the system restore. But it doesn't fix the problem because there is only one restore point (a restore point that created automatically while updating the Microsoft Security Essential a day after this problem occur).</p>
<p>Oh, a brother of mine told me that the Microsoft Security Essential found a malicious software when he used my laptop. The MSE found it in a winrar (*.rar) file (I don't know what is the file name because the MSE already deleted it).</p>
<p><a href="http://s261.photobucket.com/albums/ii63/picture_emotion/?action=view&amp;current=Capture2-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi261.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fii63%2fpicture_emotion%2fCapture2-1.jpg" /></a></p>
I also try to scan my laptop in the Safe Mode with MSE, but found nothing. This problem not occur while in the Safe Mode. When I right-clicked the desktop, everything looks fine.

            <p>Hi p0pc0rnm0mma,</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If this occured after you bought straight away, it could be a hardware problem in which I would try and get it sent back and looked at, they may test it and give you a new one.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The error "0x80040900"&nbsp;means Server name cannot be found on the Network (outlook related)&nbsp;which I'm finding it hard to understand why it may be occuring, try resetting the xbox again and see if it's a game or app causing this issue, and report it as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem presists, contact support asap</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I bought black ops on sale yesterday, but it keeps downloading in french. I live in belgium, dutch speaking. All my settings are correct and i haven't had this problem in the past. I can find the game and content packs with the language [EN] in my store
 and with [FR]. Any way i can get the game to download in english?</p>

<p>thx</p>

<p>nope since the national language for belguim are dutch and french</p>
<p>with blackops you can only buy one language </p>
<p>if you could see the game in EN why didnt you buy that one</p>
<p>with blackops you must buy the EN not the FR</p>
<p>and yes it is language specific</p>
<p>it isnt user selectable</p>
<p>very few games have multiple language support</p>
<p>since belguim only supports french and dutch</p>
<p>I dont know how you can have EN</p>
<p>not all content supports EN </p>
<p>.with region specific content like cod games they stay with the nationally offical languages to avoid region violations</p>
<p>also language mismatch</p>

<p>When looking in the online store where I bought the game (not on the console) it only mentions [EN] and mentions [FR] for content packs only, the xbox console store only mentions [FR].</p>

<p>that would be why</p>
<p>when you look at xbox.com you need to change the marketplace region to your actual region</p>
<p>since your account region would be in belguim</p>
<p>when you queue from the website you are sent to your console region</p>
<p>otherwise you will get a region lock violation error you cannot queue US content while in belguim</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>many users who try to queue content that isn't allowed in their region get that</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FYI blackops content must match your actual location to download this includes languages</p>
<p>blackops is LANGUAGE and region specific and are not user changable</p>
<p>meaning your disk and dlc language must match in order to be used with each other</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as stated before</p>
<p>content is usually in the nationally supported languages in the region of your account since english isn't one of your offically supported languages</p>
<p>that would be why</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it avoids region and language mismatches and yes that does make discs and dlc unusable</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Evil Within Season Pass - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> muffinhugs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Evil Within Season Pass </h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>

<p>I just bought the evil within season pass on &nbsp;the xbox love marketplace on my Singapore account.</p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Account region: Singapore</strong><br />
<strong>Physical region: South Korea</strong><br />
<strong>Internet Service Provider (ISP): Skt broadband&nbsp;</strong><br />
<strong>Content you are trying to download: Evil Within DLC</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><br />
</strong>I successfully bought the season pass on my SG account with my debit card and downloaded it to my console. However, when I boot up the game there is no option in te main menu to download the DLC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, the Season Pass is listed on the marketplace as 108kb but when after I downloaded it and checked on my harf drive, it is listed as 56kb, half the size.</span></p>
<p><span>I've been able to download games from different country accounts &nbsp;without any issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So is this a restriction on the game developers side? Not allowing people to play their games if im not physically in the allowed countries? Even though, I bought the game back home in Singapore where it was released &nbsp;and purchased the season pass
 from the Singapore marketplace.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Or is there something wrong with the xbox live servers now? I some times get weird errors when I connect to live.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please help, i would like very much to be able to play the game I purchased.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

<p>When you download does it stop at 80% or 99% and say "Can't Download"? If so then that is a sign that it is region locked. A lot of games and content are region locked. It is usually from a developer's side, but can also be restricted by the country. If
 content is region locked, it can only be downloaded if your account region and your physical location match and you live in a region where the content is available.</p>

<p>The download completes, 100% in active downloads and says 'download successful'. If games are region locked, the xbox marketplace wouldn't even let me download it in the first place. That was the case with some of the previous games I've tried. There would
 be a message pop up saying that 'this game is not available in your region'.</p>
<p>However, that is not the case with this evil within season pass.</p>

<p>That definitely doesn't sound like a region issue then. However, if there is content that is available in your region, but your regions don't match, the system will try to download it but won't be able to complete. So you won't always get that error message.</p>
<p>When you've deleted and redownloaded it, have you tried clearing your cache after deleting it?</p>

<p>Yeah, I've spoken to a Microsoft tech support officer about this issue as well through chat. Did what he said, cleared cache 3 times, re downloaded season pass, restarted console etc.</p>
<p>Still nothing. He said it could be Bethesda that's delayed the released for the DLC in certain regions, but I dunno I doubt it. He said to wait for the in game notification that new DLC is available. When I checked the support page for Bethesda, they said
 that if you're not able to download the DLC it could be a problem with xbox live.</p>
<p>I really dunno what to think now, it really blows when you pay for nothing. </p>
<p>I guess I have no choice but to follow the dude's advice and wait for that in-game notification. Will give it 2 days before I'll ask for a refund. Sigh.. If anybody has any other ideas of why this problem is happening please let me know..</p>

<p>they will not give you a refund "it would be best to coordinate with the game developer to manually check the season pass that you've purchased. However this is not an issue with your Microsoft account, console or connection with us. Just to set your expectations
 right, once you have hit "Download" button, then the console will prompt to download the game from Tango Gameworks database/server and not from Xbox live server given they are the team who made the game as well owned the game."</p>

<p>Hey, Quincannon, yeah I feel like the tech support people don't exactly know what they are talking about and just guessing.</p>
<p>I've contacted Bethesda through email as well, hoping I can finally figure out why I can't access what I paid for. This is really ridiculous. They told me the same thing, that somehow just because I'm currently in South Korea, I will not be able I download
 it because it's been region blocked in that country.</p>
<p>THEN SHOULDN'T THEY HAVE BLOCKED THE SEASON PASS AS WELL. I'm able to give them my money for the data file but not have the content. That's a flaw they need to fix. If it is indeed an IP block because of locatoon, they should BLOCK EVERYTHING. So people
 don't waste their time and money dancing around with Microsoft and Bethesda about this issue.</p>
<p>I completely agree with you Quin, never buying anything from Microsoft and Bethesda.</p>
<p>Thank god I haven't put money down for an xbox one yet. Have to convert over to Sony for sure now.</p>
<p>Sorry for the rant I'm just so frustrated about the situation right now.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Text-to-speech</strong> is the ability of the operating system to play back text in a spoken voice. It's available in English, French, Spanish, German, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese. However, please note that using
<strong>French </strong>as the default system language is only applicable to <strong>
Windows 7 Ultimate</strong> or higher. You may refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/972813/windows-7-language-packs-are-available-for-computers-that-are-running" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>article</strong></a>. It explains about the Windows version and edition requirements, how to install the language packs, and how to change the default system language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you've mentioned that you already tried downloading its language pack, we would like to know the following so we can investigate the issue:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which edition of Windows 7 are you using? Is it <strong>
Windows 7 Home &amp; Premium</strong>, <strong>Windows 7 Professional</strong>, <strong>
Windows</strong> <strong>Ultimate</strong>, or higher? To check it, press the <strong>
Windows </strong>key + <strong>R </strong>key, type <strong>
winver </strong>and press <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</li><li>If you're using Windows 7 Ultimate or higher, have you set<strong> French
</strong>as the default system language? It is required that you set the computer's default
<strong>Region</strong> <strong>&amp;</strong> <strong>Language</strong> to <strong>
French (France)</strong> for the <strong>Text-to-Speech</strong> functionality to work properly. You may refer to the article provided above on how to set it up accordingly.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you're not running Windows 7 Ultimate or higher, we recommend that you upgrade your computer by purchasing from any local stores that still sell Windows 7 Ultimate discs (Note that upgrading to
<strong>Windows 7</strong> <strong>Ultimate</strong> through <strong>Windows</strong>
<strong>Anytime</strong> <strong>Upgrade</strong> is no longer available. You may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15045/windows-anytime-upgrade-not-available" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link
</a></strong>for more information).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you have other concerns that we can assist you with.</p>

    <title>High Definition Audio Device not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            High Definition Audio Device not working</h2>
                    I own a Asus N550jk laptop running Windows 8. The HDMI video output works fine, but when I play a video it only runs through the computer. I went to "manage audio devices" and found the high definition audio device option and it read "not plugged in" underneath.
 The video works fine and I am failing to get sound from the TV. Any help on this issue is appreciated.
