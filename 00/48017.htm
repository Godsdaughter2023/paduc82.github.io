<h2>            Xbox One X Replacement</h2>
                    <p>I bought the Xbox one X back in November when the console came out.&nbsp; There is already a faulty hdmi port with it and had to send it back.&nbsp; Now microsoft is saying that I will be without an xbox for 2-3 weeks.&nbsp; That is pretty frrustrating.&nbsp; I have had an xbox since the original, and have bought every console this generation.&nbsp; Pretty frustrating that can't replace the xbox quicker.&nbsp; Wish Microsoft cared a little more about their loyal customers.</p>

            <p>This is the second time I have had to send my XBOX ONE X off for repairs. Games not downloading, E105 error codes and other error codes. Just want something that works. I also have been with XBOX since day one I hope they fix this.</p>

    <title>Why won&#39;t Age Of Mythology Work online for me&#63; UBISOFT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j_1616  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why won&#39;t Age Of Mythology Work online for me&#63; UBISOFT EXCLUSIVE version.</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased a 'Age of Mythology: Gold edition', the UBISOFT EXCLUSIVE version, unforutunatly this version does not seem to work online for me.</p>
<p>Whenever I try to play online an error message appears saying 'There is an updated version of the game that is required to play'</p>
<p>I have gone to the homepage, selected 'more' and then 'update titans' however a box appears stating 'checking for update...' then 2-3 seconds later 'your game is up to date.', however this does not solve the problem at all, the message "There is an updated
 version of Age of Mythology that is required to play" still appears whenever i try to create an account or login with the one i 'created' earlier.</p>
<p>I have also now tried to create an account on Age of Mythology without the titans expansion pack, I get up to creating the account and it even saying that my account is logging in then a box appears saying "your CD key cannot be vaildated at thi time", I've
 read about that problem and it seems to mean I need a new CD key as the one I have is likely for offline play only, however I have also read that Microsoft have stopped making CD keys and when I have looked on the Microsoft helpsite there is no Age of Mythology
 option available, no search results even appear for it, only for age of empires.<br />
Also the apprant update problem still occurs when i try to log into / create an account on the titans expansion.</p>
<p>when i try to play with a friend via ethernet cable, an error message appears stating 'your version is not up to date with the host's version, please check both versions are up to date then try again' - his version is a classical 'Age of mythology: gold
 edition' and NOT the ubisoft exlusive version<br />
<br />
I have downloaded countless updates in order to try and patch this problem but nothing seems to work and one update I downloaded (patch version 1.03) made an error message saying 'Please insert the Age Of Mythology Disk and try again' When the disk was int
 he drive. I had to uninstall and reinstall in order to even play offline again.</p>
<p>please help, someone.</p>
<p>P.S. The last thing I am willing to do is buy a new copy of the game which is the classical version as this will be quite expensive so ONLY if you are 100% my problem cannot be solved I would appriciate any information of where to purchase said copy of the
 game, thankyou.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>As per many users there are some issues with certain editions of the game throwing this error message.
</span></p>
<p><span>Some copies of the game do not allow you to login.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Be sure to check out the
<a href="http://forums.heavengames.com/redir/http:/aom.heavengames.com/cgi-bin/forums/display.cgi?action%3Dct%26f%3D1,18666,0,10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Age of Mythology Heaven FAQ and Guide</a>.
 It contains the answer to some of the more basic questions.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest to try reinstalling the game, update the Age of mythology first and then install the Titans expansion pack and then update that and check if you can
 play online.</span></p>
<p><span>For information on uninstalling a program check the below link:</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Creator Edition Breaks Software</h2>
                    <p>The Windows 10 Creator Update was forcefully installed on my computer last night.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The first thing this update did was lock the start menu and break a video encoding project that was running for 5 hours and I need to redo it. &nbsp;<br />
Unfortunately, I cant run Handbrake to do the encode after the update.&nbsp; It simply won't launch.&nbsp; There is no error message or anything.<br />
Additionally, the update broke my AMD video drivers for my RX 580.<br />
Also, Media Player Classic can't play videos with the EVR renderer after the update with ACCESS VIOLATION reported in the crash notes.&nbsp; It was fine before.<br />
Also, the computer has been crashing with MEMORY VIOLATION blue screen errors since the update, when it did not before. &nbsp;<br />
Any ideas on a fix.&nbsp; I don't really want any cumbersome workaround when the system was fine before the update.&nbsp; Microsoft should test their updates better before forcing them on everyone, especially with such obvious problems.&nbsp; Most of the updates pushed break
 the bitlocker encryption on the separate laptop I use.<br />
<br />
The update installed this time is listed below.<br />
Updates for Windows 10 Version 1703<br />
Feature update to Windows 10, version 1703</p>

<p><span>You may check to see if the microphone is set as default. </span></p>
<p><span>a. Click <b>Start</b>, type <b>mmsys.cpl</b> in the Start Search box, and then press
<b>ENTER</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the Sound dialog box, click the <b>Recording tab</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Under this, <b>right click</b> on the empty area and make sure “<b>Show Disabled Devices</b>” has a check mark on it. If the microphone is disabled, it will now show up in the list.</span></p>
<p><span>d.&nbsp;<b>Right click</b> on the device and select “<b>Set as Default Communication Device</b>”. Click OK.</span></p>

            <p>if you actually read my post then you'd know that this issue pertains to PC not xbox. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i think may have happened is before the 7th month of this year my controller was still using a driver from 2009 and thus was showing up as "afterglow gamepad for xbox 360". i went and replaced my microphone and controller here recently to fix a slight
 audio distortion that i heard and so i found out that a recent driver was installed. one made in the 7th month of this year and so my controller which formerly displayed the old "afterglow gamepad" name now says "XBOX_360_Device_01:03".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>hopefully this makes sense.</p>

<p>Points are region locked, so no you couldn't buy points for him in a UK store.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>You could PayPal him the money which could be used to buy points or find an online store that sells points for his region.</p>

<h3> skier7667  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kinect - Cycles Itself Off</h2>
                    
<p><span>Have had the Kinect since announcement day of the Xbox One, never a problem and understands Cortana commands just fine.
</span></p>
<p><span>Recently I've noticed it turns itself off, then back on, then off, then back on, finally stays off. No Cortana commands are recognized when off. Only way to have it come back on&nbsp;is to perform a Power Off
 of the Xbox One. It comes back on, but then after a while begins to cycle on and off again - sometimes it doesn't cycle on/off, it just turns off.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>I know it's off because all the lights on the Kinect are off and the Icon on the Dashboard shows the Off-Icon. Almost appears as if it is going to "Sleep". In these rare cases, voice command - "Hey
 Cortana" wakes it up for a while.</span><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>It's behaving very strangely!<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Happened recently after latest Insider Update.</span></p>

<h2>            Sound coming from both speakers and headphones</h2>
                    Before you ask, here is my computer's information.
<div><br />
</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa4123ff-7049-4117-a1e4-2cf7594af4ce" /></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;I have been trying to set up ASIO4ALL for FL Studio 10. Turned out that "Realtek HD audio output" wasnt working. Here's what I mean:
<div><br />
</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92741f00-6c1f-4331-aa51-0f3f85628aa9" /></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So after trying so hard, I tried going into the audio manager.</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e2b13b9e-cfe8-4db5-8ece-da4d1d01fe36" /></div>
<div>And seeing what's wrong, I started hearing a little bit of feedback (I was hearing myself on my microphone.) and took off my headphones.</div>
<div>I blew into the mic and heard it through the headphones and the speakers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have called Microsoft support, the person I was asking for help with was quite rude. She (yes, she was a female) didn't get me anywhere. All she told me to do was to go to a local technician.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using a Blue Snowball to record, maybe that's the reason?</div>
<div>FL Studio wanted me to use ASIO. Could that be a problem?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm awfully confused. And I thought Chrome crashed on me. Things are getting worse.</div>
</div>

<p>Please let me know the make and model of the computer? You may also download latest audio driver from the computer manufacturer website. If the Internet connection is very slow on your computer, you may download audio driver for your model on another computer
 from manufacturer website. And install it on your computer.</p>

    <title>How do I reinstall Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rosssanders  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I reinstall Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I believe the Photo Gallery portion of my Windows 10 was corrupted during Windows 10 installation? I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 on my Dell 560S desktop. I have not found a solution to fixing my Photo Gallery problem so am considering reinstalling
 Windows 10. Windows 7 is no longer on my computer and I do not have a key code for Windows 10 as I don't think one was provided during the upgrade from Windows 7. How do I fix Photo Gallery (or trouble shoot it) or reinstall Windows 10 in the hope that that
 will fix my problem?

<p>Hi HR </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to another reply with a proposed fix to my inability to&nbsp;import photos in Photo Gallery using Windows 10, I have been able to successfully upload some test photos. It was not a flaw in the software but a convoluted compatibility issue that I was able
 to work with to get the import function to work - at least for now. Solution was in response to another input on the problem in another thread in the Microsoft community Forum.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response and support. Ross</p>

    <title>More than one console - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dead man gamer8  say:</h3>
<h2>            More than one console</h2>
                    
<p>We are thinking about upgrading to the family pack, but have one question about this. We have two consoles. Can we use two consoles in a family pack, or can there only be one console used? Right now we only have one console on this account. The other console
 has not been set up at XBox Live yet.</p>

<p>You can use as many consoles as accounts in the FGP. You will need to add the accounts to the FGP on one console first then you can move them to another console as you see fit.
</p>
<p>Just be aware that download content is licensed to the gamer tag that downloaded it and to the console it was downloaded to. Just an FYI.</p>

<p>[quote user="Dead Man Gamer8"]Can we use two consoles in a family pack, or can there only be one console used?[/quote]There is no linkage between consoles and accounts for the purposes of account usage. Any account can be used on any 360 console (assuming
 Parental Controls permit the account's access if it's an under-age account).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me repeat that: Any XBOX Live account can be used on <b>any</b> 360 console. There is nothing that binds a Live account to a specific console or set of consoles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only time the console matters is with respect to purchased DLC. DLC comes with two licenses, a console license and a gamertag license. The console license is bound to the first console that the DLC is downloaded to. That console then permits any account
 access to the content. The gamertag license works no matter what console the purchasing gamertag logs into.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I own nine consoles. I can use my account on any of the consoles at any time. I keep my gamertag and game saves on a USB memory stick just so I can move it around to whichever console I feel like using.</p>

            <p>Hi Reinielle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. I understand the inconvenience you are facing. I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate if you could answer few questions to narrow down the issue and to provide you better assistance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you able to create a new Microsoft Account?</li></ul>
<p>I suggest you to check the internet connection, as signing in to Microsoft account require active internet connection. Also try to clean boot and check if you are able to sign in into Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to restart the computer. Remove any external plugged in devices (except mouse, keyboard and internet connection), perform clean boot and then try to sign in and check if it helps. Clean boot will help you to recognize the program that is stopping
 you to sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>After you have finished the troubleshooting, refer to the section
<strong>“How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>” to boot the system in normal startup. The steps given in above link are for Windows 8.1/8/7 but it also work for Windows 10.</p>

            You have to change the ones in the DLL cache first, then when replacing the ones in the System32 folder and if prompted for the Windows CD by WFP just click on cancel and then have WFP keep the replacement files, see here:<span style="font-weight: bold"><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />

            <p>Finally I was able to replace the files, here's&nbsp;what I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replace the files in the DLL cache. </li><li>In the System32 folder, rename <em>shlwapi.dll</em> and <em>uxtheme.dll</em> to
<em>shlwapi.bak</em> and <em>uxtheme.bak</em>, respectively. </li><li>Move&nbsp;the new files&nbsp;to&nbsp;the System32 folder. </li><li>Reboot&nbsp;the computer because the <em>.bak</em> files&nbsp;were still locked. </li><li>Delete the <em>.bak</em> files.</li></ol>
<p>For some reason, Windows still&nbsp;gave me&nbsp;the old version information&nbsp;even for the new files after step 3, which mislead me into thinking that it didn't work at first. However, rebooting the computer in step 4 fixed that too.</p>

            It depends on the computer model. It's probably a key marked something like Num, NumLk or Num Lock , if it's an English keyboard. It's best to look in your computer's documentation.

<h2>            Error&#58; &#34;Windows cannot use this hardware device because it has been prepared for &#34;safe removal&#34;, but it has not been removed from the computer. &#40;Code 47&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Running Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Purchased a Hard drive USB 3.0 Docking Station.&nbsp; When connected it spins up fine and windows sees it.&nbsp; I can read and write to the HD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to Remove the Hard Drive I use the "Safely Remove Hardware and eject Media" icon of Windows.&nbsp; I get the popup, its safe to remove Device.&nbsp; When I try to insert the same or a different HD into the Docking Station...nothing takes place.&nbsp; Windows
 does not see the HD\Station.&nbsp; I opened Device Mgr and saw the dreaded Yellow Exclamations mark beside &nbsp;USB Mass Storage Device.&nbsp; When I click on its Properties it reads:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows cannot use this hardware device because it has been prepared for "safe removal", but it has not been removed from the computer. (Code 47)</p>
<p>To fix this problem, unplug this device from your computer and then plug it in again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted the Docking Stations Manufacturer; their response; Device worked fine with Windows8, will not work with Windows 8.1.&nbsp; They went on to write; I will need to wait for Microsoft to update the driver (I assume the USB Mass Storage Device driver.&nbsp;
 I did run check for an updated driver for this entry and it came back I had the newest driver installed.&nbsp; Like Microsoft is going to Update this USB Mass Storage Driver for this particular Hard Drive Station...won't happen.&nbsp; I pushed back at the&nbsp;manufacturer
 writing they are the ones that should provide a Win8.1 driver Update...not Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this happening?&nbsp; It spins up and runs when I insert a HD on the 1st insertion.....I&nbsp;believe I am utilizing the correct steps to safely remove it.....why isn't it properly disconnecting so that the next time I insert a HD into the Docking Station....it
 spins up and runs?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Den,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum. I appreciate you provided&nbsp;detailed information on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you make any significant hardware or software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error code occurs only if you used the Safe Removal application to prepare the device for removal, or pressed a physical eject button.&nbsp;Make sure that the device is connected correctly to your computer, and then restart your computer.&nbsp;If that does not
 resolve the issue, please try the following methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Run the following fixit and check if it helps</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/hardware_device_problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows</span></strong></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Remove and reinstall all USB controllers.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open Device Manager by pressing Windows key + X, and clicking <strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong> from the menu. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></li><li><span>In the list of hardware categories, find and expand </span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Universal Serial Bus controllers</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></li><li><span>Right-click every device under the Universal Serial Bus controllers node, and then click
<strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong> to remove them one at a time.</span></li><li><span>Restart the computer, and let the USB controllers get reinstalled.</span></li></ol>

            <p>Thank you for your response....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although your reply does address the issue of clearing the Yellow Exclamation Mark....my purpose for writing was when I use the Safely Remove Hardware feature of Windows for other USB devices like a thumb drive for example, I do no face this issue....I can
 insert the thumb drive again and it runs fine.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>As I wrote, when I Use the Safely to Remove Hardware Feature&nbsp;to disconnect the HD that is inserted into the&nbsp;HD Docking Station.....why won't it fully disconnect like my Thumb drives do?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Manufacturer says its a Win8.1 issue.....because the Manufacturer says this HD Docking&nbsp;Station worked fine&nbsp;with Win8.....it&nbsp;disconnected completely under Windows8.....</p>

            <p>Hello Den,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you try the methods provided in the previous response?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, in accordance to the error code, a normal reboot is sufficient to resolve the issue. However, as the issue is not resolved, the fixit provided in Method 1&nbsp;should fixit&nbsp;or else it'll&nbsp;help&nbsp;us to check if there is any other error message that can
 narrow down the troubleshooting. Apart from that, if there is an issue with any specified USB controlling drivers, Method 2 will address that issue.</p>
<p>Now, as the&nbsp;device was working fine with Windows 8, then, apart from calling it Windows 8.1 issue, it might be possible&nbsp;that the device&nbsp;is not compatible with Windows 8.1. In that case, the manufacturer should provided additional drivers or updates (if any)
 that can help you resolve the issue. Hence, I would suggest you to try the above methods once and if not resolved, please check with the manufacturer once again for any additional drivers for the device.</p>
<p>In addition to that, you may also try the following fixit to check if that is a USB port issue.</p>

<h2>            Halo Reach server unavailable</h2>
                    
<p>I have not been able to access Halo Reach all day. Xbox Live is up &amp; running just fine but on the Halo Reach Matchmaking screen, it says "The Halo: Reach server is unavailable at this time. Please try again later."</p>
<p>I have 'tried again later' many times but nothing has changed. If it's a problem on my end, i'd like to know how I can fix it. I can't find anything about it online. If it's a Halo Reach issue, does anyone know when it'll be fixed? This game is the only
 reason I pay for an Xbox live subscription.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

<p><span>Hi LuAnnP,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The issue could be caused due to video or audio filters. Video and audio filters are used to help decode and play video files, so they will ultimately
 play on your final DVD.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Restore the Windows DVD Maker settings to default and check if that helps in fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the “To turn filters on, off, or to restore the default list of filters” section in the following article on instructions:</span></p>

            I tried to restore to default and the same thing.&nbsp; No sound.&nbsp; I tried each individual setting so there is only one setting on each try and the same thing.&nbsp; I have 7 copies of the same movie and no sound.

            <p>I am having the same problem you are, I did a system system restore once,and it solve the problem once. I suggest that you use different software to burn your dvd's. like downloading burn express,
</p>
<p>that always burns my dvds properly.try it . it would work for you too. good luck.</p>
