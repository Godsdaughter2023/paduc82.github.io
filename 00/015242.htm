<h2>            ms office 2010 and quicken personal plus 2011 problems</h2>
                    <p>I have a&nbsp; problem with Quicken Personal Plus 2011 (Australian Version)that is installed on my computer. When entering data into any of the of the &nbsp;fields and if I don’t hit
 the enter key quickly enough the cursor reverts back to the date field and I lose all of the data that I have entered. Also at the time this happens, the screen flickers or jumps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have uninstalled a couple of times but the problem still remains.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also&nbsp;when using&nbsp;Excel or Word&nbsp;(2010) and i have help open the&nbsp;screen will jump and the gap between the Excel or Word Icon and the help icon increases and decreases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My operating version is Windows 7 Professional SP1 64 bit. I also had the same problem on my previous laptop Windows XP Professional SP3 but somehow managed to sort it out</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated as it is getting very frustrating</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials - Installation problem</h2>
                    Dear Sirs,<br />
<br />
I have a Windows Xp32 bit system in my laptop. I had installed MSE (Microsoft Security Essentials) in my laptop&nbsp; and was working fine. A week back when I tried to run it because it was showing orange color it did not work and went of the screen. Afterwards
 I tried to reinstall but could not then I went through the process of "I cannot install MSE" meticulously . I got error code 0x80070645. I went through the process of "Fixing error message 0x80070645". Even the I am unable to install and getting the same error
 code, I do not know what to do now. As I am 83 years ols can you kindly help me out.<br />
Thanking and Regards,<br />
NP.Bhakta<br />

    <title>Unable to open a shared Note in One Note for Desktop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to open a shared Note in One Note for Desktop</h2>
                    <p>I have a user in my office who we are attempting to share a One Note notebook with. When he opens the notebook in One Note Online everything is fine. However, when he clicks the button to open the note in the Desktop version he gets an error saying that
 he doesn't have permission to open the Notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error looks like this:</p>
<p>"We couldn't open that location. It might not exist or you might not have permission to open it. Please contact the owner of onenote: https://d.docs.live."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have changed the actual link...to protect sensitive data. </p>
<br />
<p>The owner of the onenote has sent the link multiple times and everyone on the team,&nbsp;except for this one person, can access the note in Desktop.</p>

            The notebook has been shared. Multiple times. We have deleted and recreated and re-shared the notebook, multiple times. Others, with whom the notebook has been shared, are able to open the document online and on the desktop. This single user cannot open
 the notebook on the Desktop because the notebook "might not exist or you might not have permission to open it." Which seems silly to me because he can open it online. We have asked him to upgrade to Win 10, subscribe to Office 360, create a new Microsoft account
 with an email on the same domain as the others in the group. No luck. We can open the document; he still gets the same error. I am beginning to think that he is cursed.

            <p>I was kind of hoping to get some resolution to this issue. As it stands he is still seeing the "might not exist or you might not have permission to open it," error when trying to open a shared onenote on the Desktop. As stated before, he is able to open
 the document in the ONLINE version of Onenote...so I can't see how this is a permissions issue. We have verified that the document is shared in OneDrive. We have recreated the document and shared it again. Still doesn't work.

            <p>I was finally able to solve this by doing this:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Open Credential Manager (go to the Start screen and start typing "credential", it should be among the first results).</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click "Windows Credentials".</p>
</li><li>
<p>Under "Generic Credentials", find the entry that starts with "MicrosoftOffice15_Data".</p>
</li><li>
<p>Expand that entry and click on "Remove".</p>
</li><li>
<p>Now open any Office program. Check the top right corner, it should require you to log in. Do so, and your documents and OneNote notebooks should sync again.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>However it only worked, when I signed out of Office first, then did the above process. To sign out, open any Office product, and in the top right click 'switch account' and then 'sign out'.</p>

            Please see below screen shot of the spreadsheet I am working on. &nbsp;When I used the formula, =SUMIFS($R$3:$R$29,$B$3:$B$29,”Yes”) it is shows 0, but it should show 794,080 since there are two boxes with Yes. In column B there is a drop down box to select
 Yes or No. I dont need to track the No, just the rows that have Yes in order to get the total square feet that have been completed (Yes). I am trying to determine what the formula is and have it calculate in cell B35 at the bottom of my spreadsheet.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/287e19c5-01d8-4d67-829f-1c66bd30f938?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/287e19c5-01d8-4d67-829f-1c66bd30f938?upload=true" /></a>

            Hi amalinazainudin
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

                    I have&nbsp; a lumia 640 and I have been having trouble with it for the past month.&nbsp; I would not able to download any games and if I do it says that I need Wi-Fi for the download and My phone will show that I do not have it and my husband can sit in the same
 spot and have Wi-Fi.&nbsp; I have had trouble with the phone just turning off for no reason, plus many more issues.&nbsp; I have tried a factory restart, removing the battery, soft reset, called Microsoft and that was a joke.&nbsp; The phone has no physical damage and no
 water damage.&nbsp; Purchased on 12/30/2015 and have only reload it one time. Has anyone else have this much trouble with this phone?&nbsp; If you did let me know.

<p>Hey all, wondering if anybody can help?</p>
<p>Recently upgraded to a Nokia 6700 slide and evrythings been working fine until recently, the phone was knocked off a table and fell onto the floor. It still works perfectly, (making/receiving calls, sending/receiving messages etc.), except now there's a
 small permanent black rectangle block on the screen:- started off as 2 little lines then gradually grew-: it's definitely not a scratch on the surface and its not limited to the "home screen" either, appears on every&nbsp;screen (menus, pictures, even on the camera).</p>
<p>Cheers all.&nbsp;</p>

                    Hi.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm on Windows 8 with the Office 2013 preview edition installed (both 64bit), trying to print from Outlook and Word to an HP Officejet Pro 8000 A809.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Attempting to Print &gt; Print Options &gt; Properties in order to print in draft/greyscale... but the dialog box popping up is in Chinese/Japanese/unknown symbols (not sure!) with blank dropdown boxes.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Have also checked using Adobe Acrobat (dialog box is fine) and Notepad (same problem as described above).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone who can suggest what has gone wrong/a fix?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks.</div>

            Hi Deepa.
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for taking the time to pop me a note, it's appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It was only Office-related products that were affected by the glitch and despite uninstalling any and all HP printer software and drivers I could find (via HP's own software remover utilities plus my own efforts), it still didn't solve the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Anyway, no matter now, as it gave me the chance to reset the PC (something I've been wanting to do anyway) and all is fine... except I have an issue now with the Metro icons at the bottom of the start screen not appearing on 'right-click'. I'll save that
 for my next shout out for help in the Community!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again :-)</div>
<div><br />

Not finding this in the MS database so we assume you're using a program other than MSE.&nbsp; Have you scanned using the MS Safety Scanner - this program will not interfere with your installed AV product?&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My limited research indicates this may be a boot sector virus.&nbsp; If so, you may need to repair the boot sector instead off attempting to remove it with scanners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What antimalware program are you using?&nbsp; If it identifies the malware, will it not remove the malware or tell you how to remove it?&nbsp; You should follow their recommendations if possible.</p>

            It is a Boot Sector Virus. Your computer MBR (Master Boot Records) is infected.........<br />
<br />
To fix this one you have to fix the MBR........<br />
<br />
If you are using a Windows XP then you can use this Norton tool<br />

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Definitely we can run Internet Explorer 32 bit on Windows 64 bit.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Perform the following workaround to use 32 bit Internet Explorer on Windows 7 64&nbsp;bit:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. If you have installed the Adobe Flashplayer and have Java enabled, make sure you have the Adobe Flashplayer installed for that particular Internet browser.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. If you are running the Windows 7 64 bit edition, please use the Internet explorer 32 bit because Adobe has not released the compatibilty for Windows 64 bit computers.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3. Use following path to launch the Internet explorer in 32 bit in Windows 7 64-bit edition:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
(a) The Internet Explorer shortcut in the Quick Launch toolbar and in the Start menu of Windows 7 x64 will run the 32-bit version of Internet Explorer by default.<br />
(b) There are actually two shortcuts for Internet Explorer in the "All Programs" menu.<br />
(c) Here's the title of each and the exe's they run:<br />
(d) Internet Explorer<br />
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"<br />
Internet Explorer (64-bit)<br />
"C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe"</div>
<div><br />
The first one runs IE from the "Program Files (x86)" folder, this is the 32-bit version. The second one is the 64-bit version.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

            After making changes via OWA, select to refresh or synchronize the folder in Outlook. It sounds like Outlook is not syncing to the server then uploading again from Outlook.<br />
<br />
I suggest you look at the number of messages in your folders. The Inbox in particular should only have a few hundred messages. There should be no subfolders under the Inbox.<br />
<br />
Exchange Header<br />
Inbox<br />
&nbsp; Folder A&nbsp; &lt;---this is wrong<br />
Drafts<br />
Deleted Items folder<br />
Junk<br />
Folder A&nbsp; &lt;-- this is correct<br />
<br />
It's best to move folders using your web interface (OWA) but you can drag in Outlook.<br />
<br />
In Outlook:<br />
First turn off Group folders. You'll see the header with the name of your Exchange account at the top. Drag folders to the header. Do this slowly. It will take some time for results to sync to server then back to Outlook.<br />
<br />
In Browser via OWA<br />
Because of the massive changes The process is best done in your browser. I would also put Outlook into work offline mode during this process. After all is moved on the server via the browser, I would delete the Exchange account and let it all download correctly
 from the server. If you only have Exchange, just start over in a new Identity.<br />
<br />
<b>Exchange Basics</b><br />
<br />
The Inbox syncs more frequently than any other and should be kept as clean as possible. (this is the number one cause of problems with sync). Do NOT make subfolders under the Inbox.<br />
<br />
Any folder with more than a few thousand messages is going to take some time to fully come down when you first sync your account. Due to the design of Outlook's sync engine (and how exchange works), you will see the 512 newest messages in a folder at the initial
 start of sync then the rest of the folder's contents will be back filled before you see any mail that arrives after this point. This is why it will look like you are not getting new mail when a folder is still going through initial sync. This is also further
 exacerbated by an Exchange issue where it gets unnecessary change events before the newer mail arrives. If you carefully watch the progress during the sync of a folder with greater than a couple thousand messages, you will see "Updating local..." a lot before
 the newer mail starts arriving (newer than the initial 512 that come down).<br />
<br />
Outlook checks the server for updates every minute, any folder that has updates will subsequently be synced. Since Outlook has a limit on how many folders can be synced at a time, there can be a queue of folders waiting. The Inbox does get high priority so
 it will generally sync before other folders that also need to sync.<br />

    <title>Updating MSE connection failed&#63; However... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryanmsd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updating MSE connection failed&#63; However...</h2>
                    I downloaded MSE today and once I started the program, it asked me to update (at risk) my MSE. Therefore, I obviously updated my MSE and once it finished, I got a message saying something like, "Update was not complete due to the connection failure because
 of my internet connection." Lol?<br />
<br />
My internet was still connected while I was updating because I watched my MSE update the entire time. I didn't even touch my computer. I just let the update do its job alone.
<br />
<br />
So.. I wasn't sure what the problem was, but I hit home. It says my virus and spyware definitions were not up to date. So I clicked on update again and then once it finished searching for any updates, it found no updates and says that my MSE was up to date.
 Lol?<br />
<br />
So, I'm really confused. <span style="font-weight: bold">Is it okay to assume that my MSE is up to date now?</span> Sorry if my information seems a little obscure...<br />

<p><span>What operating system and service pack? MSE requires XP (32 bit version only) with SP3 installed, Vista or Win 7…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Prior Security Software?&nbsp; What about a trial version of an antivirus program that was pre-installed when the computer was purchased? McAfee, Norton, Trend Micro?</span></p>
<p><span>Any security software still installed?</span></p>
<p><span>A
<b>possible</b> reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC. Remove all other security software from the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>You may need to use a cleanup tool to remove your prior security software:</span></p>

<h2>            Data-&#62;GetExternalData buttons grayed out</h2>
                    <p>I find it completely infuriating when it is felt that just because a GUI is being used, one can completely ignore common sense such as providing feedback to the user as to why certain functions have been disabled.&nbsp; People kowed into simply accepting this
 ridiculous behaviour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After much rummaging around, it seems that the subject symtom is obtained for rows into which data has been inserted from a text file.&nbsp; If some of the imported text has empty fields, it means that you can position the selected cell to the right of the apparent
 last field, but still have the buttons grayed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Isn't random GUI design wonderful.</p>

    <title>Resource booking with calendars overlay - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ivanbakran  say:</h3>
<h2>            Resource booking with calendars overlay</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I'm trying to create a resource booking system in our SharePoint Online site. I have followed a couple of guides on the Internet, telling me to create a calendar app for every single resource and then use the Calendar Overlays to create views of similar
 resources (cars, rooms and so on). Here is one example:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm3CA9UMNbw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm3CA9UMNbw</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/rm3CA9UMNbw?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/rm3CA9UMNbw?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>While in such a view (cars for instance) - consisting of a "master" calendar that's holding a number of "sub" calendars representing every single available car as overlays - and clicking in the calendar to add event, this event ends up in the master calendar
 when saved. Obviously, since I clicked in the master calendar - which I suppose is "on top" when in an overlaid view.</p>
<p>Do I really have to open the overlaid calendar before I can add an event to it? Not very logical to users.</p>
<p>Or have I missed something, like preventing users to add events in the master calendar?</p>

            Hi Rob,<br />
<br />
You can prevent your users form adding events to the “master” calendar by replacing their
<strong>Edit </strong>permission with <strong>View Only</strong> permission. Here are the detail steps:<br />
<br />
1. Open the “master” calendar, click <strong>CALENDAR </strong>on the ribbon, and click
<strong>List Settings</strong>.<br />
2. Click <strong>Permission for this list</strong> under <strong>Permissions and Management</strong>.<br />
3. Click <strong>Stop Inheriting Permission</strong> under the <strong>PERMISSIONS
</strong>tab. <br />
4. If the permission of your users for this calendar are granted from the <em><strong>site Member</strong></em> group, delete this group.
<br />
5. Then grant your users <strong>View Only</strong> permission by clicking <strong>
Grant Permission</strong> under the <strong>PERMISSION </strong>tab.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jiaxing

<h2>            Error code 3253 in Outlook for MAC 2011</h2>
                    <p>I tried sending an email in Outlook with a large attachment (a video).&nbsp; It seems the attachment was too large and this message didn't send because it timed out on the server.&nbsp; I received the error 'connection to the server failed or was dropped'. That's
 ok.&nbsp; I'll try to send something different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A day later now and the message keeps trying to send every few minutes and gets the same error message.&nbsp; I can't find where the message is located to delete it.&nbsp; It's not in any of my folders in Outlook that are obvious.&nbsp; Maybe I'm missing an outbox somewhere?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I delete this message permanently so I don't keep getting an error code and beep every few minutes?</p>

<p><span>Hi
</span><span>DEA66</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting the query you encounter in our forum. According to the error message and your description, your account in Outlook for Mac 2011 is not connected to the email server
 correctly. I suggest check the server settings such as incoming server and its port under account settings in your Outlook for Mac 2011. If you are not sure the exact server settings of your account, please contact the provider of your email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>S</span><span>ince the Outlook 2011 for Mac is no longer supported after October 10, 2017, it is recommended for you to upgrade the Outlook client to Outlook 2016 for
 Mac for getting better experience and more features </span><span>. </span>
<span>If you use Outlook 2016 or after upgraded to Outlook 2016, this issue still occurs, since you may have different scenarios from the thread owner, I suggest you to post a new thread in our forum, and our engineer will focus on your issue in
 the new thread.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Coldwell</p>

            <p>Custom (or clean ) dual boot install on an unallocated drive partition or a separate hdd altogether is the best way totally &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can run *some * applications and access and use all of your audio /video /music &nbsp;and photo media installed on your ( other operating system drive or primary drive partition&nbsp;) and just treat it like a storage drive for that stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some programs ,media player ,games etc may have to be installed in win 10 to run others may run fine .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can make shortcuts in Win 10 &nbsp;to librarys ,folders and programs on the other OS drive or primary drive partition they will all be visible in your Win Explorer &nbsp;directory tree on the&nbsp;<span>other drive</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would rename (edit and preface) any shortcuts from the (other) drive or partitian with that OS and drive letters as indicated on your win 10 directory tree e.g. W7: D or W8: D or whatever then ( app or folder name &nbsp;) so as not to confuse them with similar
 (or same ) shortcuts to things on Win 10 drive .</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>**You can also add new downloads ,files,Docs,media or folders from the Win 10 side to the other drive for storage&nbsp;<span>there</span>&nbsp;and use them within win 10 ** (or just save them there ) with the exception of *some installed apps and programs *</p>
<p>
</p><p>***You can run F/F and Chrome browsers from the (other drive) &nbsp;but they don't take up a lot of room so might as well install whatever you use on the 10 side also and your &nbsp;settings and bookmarks will carry over anyway . &nbsp;</p>
<p>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
**I would back up work and critical saves in other OS drive or partitian or on another hdd altogether .**&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Joe, Yes i did apply the updates and that fixed a few of the folders but to not all. I finally went in to remove the program and start from new and instead trashed the com.microsoft.outlook library file and that seemed to take care of the issue. &nbsp;I should
 have started there but figured a new install would be clean from the start.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Purchased Xbox Live games WILL NOT download&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>ok this is similar to many post's but it seems that the problem is getting worse.</p>
<p>Firstly, I am using a HTC 7 Trophy, I am connected via my home WiFi.. and I use my own xbox live gamertag details for purchases.</p>
<p>I first noticed problems when an update became available for HTC&nbsp; Hub, this update would not download.</p>
<p>After about a week or two an update was released for the xbox live game Flight Control (which I have fully purchased).. Once again this would not download. I posted the problem on here.</p>
<p>J WOODS who's profile is here&gt;&gt; http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Profile/en-US/?user=J+Woods+-+MSFT&amp;referrer=http%3a%2f%2fsocial.answers.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fen-US%2fwindowsphone7%2fthread%2f6c664248-348a-48f7-aae4-8ba4ff1b6717&amp;rh=ue9tcCu87jtvJYNskiIBdBpmExx7x5usQ1vr19dUVu8%3d&amp;sp=forums</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He posted this as an answer to the problem</p>
<p>For the symptoms you are describing, I would suggest the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete the app from the Phone by tapping and holding on the app and then tapping “delete”.</li><li>Go back to Marketplace and reinstall the app.&nbsp; &nbsp; </li></ul>
<p>If that doesn’t work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn off the phone, remove the battery for 30&nbsp; - 60 seconds, replace the battery and restart the phone. Removing the battery may not be absolutely necessary but I don't want to tell you to try it later :)</li><li>Repeat the first 2 steps above.&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p>Let us know if this works.<br />
<br />
Best regards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IT DOES NOT WORK...</strong></p>
<p>Now, after following J Woods advice, Flight Control WILL NOT download at all. I am still connected via my WiFi...and every time I try to download the game it displays "Attention required. Press here." when I press on the message it then displays another
 message. syaing "Can't get this information at the moment. Check again in a little while."</p>
<p>But this is not the only problem of its type..</p>
<p>On December 26th 2010, I purchased Bejewled LIVE from the Xbox Live marketplace on the phone. Straight after purchasing I recieved the same error messages as I did with flight control. Even though I have not been able to download the game as of yet (despite
 many attempts)... Microsoft did not delay in <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">STEALING MY MONEY</span></strong>...</p>
<p>I am getting very fed up of complaining and trying many different methods to try and get my game that I HAVE PAID FOR... But it seems that Microsoft couldn't care less.</p>
<p>They have not even acknowledged that they are aware of this problem or given any indication that they are going to fix it... But yet they are quite happy to take peoples money and refer you to the disclaimer at the bottom of every purchase which claims..
 "there are no refunds on this purchase"</p>
<p>Surely if they cannot provide me with the items I have paid for, then I am entitled to a refund. If anyone knows what I can do about this please reply. Because if this is not fixed soon I will be seeking legal action. Even Microsoft are not above the law,
 and charging me for something that they don't give me is a violation of consumer rights.</p>

            Greetings GizM0, welcome to the Windows Phone forums!<br />
<br />
I have not seen nor heard of the specific issues you are experiencing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Use of WiFi to perform downloads results in the resolution of most of the problems (large downloads over 10, 15, or 20megs usually requires WiFi), so not sure what's causing the problems.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Could you go back to the MarketPlace and let me know what size the download is?&nbsp; This can be found by scrolling towards the very bottom of the product page:<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
related <br />
(pictures of related apps shown)<br />
released mm/dd/yyyy<br />
version x.x.x.x&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> 1 MB<br />
</span></strong><br />
Supported Languages: English (etc)<br />
-----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I've seen downloads that have screwed-up specs, which prevents THAT particular download from working correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp; This can usually be determined by the fact that the size is show as&nbsp;<strong>2348127 MB</strong>&nbsp; (or some other wildly inaccurate&nbsp;number).&nbsp; And
 obviously, you can download successfully any other app (try a free app to double-check).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm certain that the resolution to the problem has to do with flushing the MarketPlace cache that is stored on the device, and I'm working on how to do that now.&nbsp; I'll update this thread as soon as I find-out how (if it's possible).<br />

            Thank you for posting your fix; my sincerest apologies for the loss of your pics and other important data.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I came away with&nbsp;a couple&nbsp;of&nbsp;things from your Hard Reset action:<br />
<br />
<strong>1.)</strong> The fact that the problem went away after the Hard Reset&nbsp;infers to me that the problem was with the software on the WP7 device, and serves to reinforce my belief that the problem is due to cache issue.<br />
<strong>2.)</strong> The fact that you can download any other program from marketplace&nbsp;confirms that marketplace itself and your data connection are not the cause, again reinforcing the belief in a caching problem in&nbsp;MarketPlace.<br />
<br />
Had you seen Xul Nhoj's suggestion above (about&nbsp;deleting the IE history on the phone) in time prior to your resetting?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Again, my apologies for the loss of your data,&nbsp;your results&nbsp;have certainly helped us, and hopefully we'll be able to&nbsp;resolve the problem once and for all, so no else has to deal with this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will continue to work on this issue internally...

<h2>            Repeatedly sent emails</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I sent an email, only once,&nbsp; in early November. I recently noticed that my sent items folder was full of instances of the same email being sent over and over. I have tried deleting all instances of the email from my sent items and have changed the password
 on my account 3 times but the mail still keeps reappearing as being re-sent<br />

            <p>If there are duplicate messages in the Sent folder, is the Samsung Mail app being used to send messages?&nbsp; There is a bug in the Samsung Mail app that duplicates messages every time the app syncs the emails.</p>
<p>Remove the account from the app.</p>
<p>Download and install the outlook.com mail app.</p>
<p>Add your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The duplicate messages will have to be removed from the Sent folder.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Technical Preview on Lumia 928 - capacitive buttons are not always responsive.</h2>
                    I installed the Windows 10 Technical Preview on my Lumia 928 and the capacitive buttons (Back, Start, Search) become unresponsive. Opened Cortana but was unable to click the back or start button to get back to the Start screen. Had to hard reset my phone
 to get it working again.
