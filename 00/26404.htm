<h2>            E71 - How to add tasks via Nokia PC Suite</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a question that may be silly, but I can't figure it out myself. I connect my E71 with USB cable and I would like to edit or add some new tasks to the calendar. When I choose the calendar icon and Nokia Communication Center views the calendar screen,
 I can edit meetings, notes or birthdays, but the "reminder" option is disabled (I can't choose it) and there is no task to choose at all. I have some tasks added on my phone for today, byt from this view I cannot see them nor edit or add some new. How to add
 tasks with my computer, not by my phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, on the main screen of PC Suite below the image of my E71 in the calendar view, when I spot today's date the tasks for today show in the small message box, but I cannot edit them. The help message on the right bottom tells me, that to edit meeting
 dates I should click on the date, but when I do this nothing happens. Is that all right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help me manage tasks via computer!! :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Mateusz</p>

<p>Hi Mateusz, no its not silly!</p>
<p>In Nokia Suite the reminder option is greyed out but I don't know why. Tasks don't appear at all it seems. However, I use Ovi Suite most of the time and you can sync the calendar and have access to it on line through your ovi account. You can set one up
 using the same username and password as your Nokia account. This does display and allow you to modify tasks and to do lists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the phone I use QuickCalandar which is much better than the standard E71 version but it does integrate with the the standard calendar, its just a better interface and provides more options expecially for recurring events and alarms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to add - you can have both PC and ovi suite installed and use them both but I wouldn't recommend having them open at the same time. I use Win XP and have not found any conflicts but some have. Also, when you open ovi suite it doesn't appear to have
 any calendar options at all but you can connect to your on line account from within it. You can sync from your phone to the ovi servers at any time too.</p>

<p>You can also not edit or view the comments in a memo, (what you can do on the phone). Both, PCSuite and OVI, are not able to do that (official answer from the online-customercare. You can only do that if you use synch with a third-party PIM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also there is no way to access notes via PCSuite or OVI. Same here..... third party PIM can do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did ask that questions online already, and got the answer that it is not possible....</p>

<h2>            Windows phone WiFi problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really struggling with my second Lumia now and it's wifi. My first we a Lumia 930 and now i have a Lumia 950. Great phones.... But the wifi is not good. I have read probably +200 posts on this problem... And yet it is not solved. Update after update...
 Even now on insider update....still will randomly not connect to a known network that it had previously connected to. So.... Seeing that ms does not want to be professional and admit there are problems with those phones ( personally i think it is the drivers
 of the wifi atheros chip), i can not get my money back for a phone that isn't working as it should. Besides that, it is extremely irritating that notification will not work, messages don't get delivered....while the phone is one and wifi too...becuase the
 phone just didn't connect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I'm stuck with a bad ms product????</p>
<p>I want to try and fix it myself then. Will ms help me? I saw that some of the issue were solved by switching the airplane mode on and off again. So, becuase i am missing power saving options in windows phone in any case, i thought i could make an app to
 switch a Lumia's airplane mode on and off at a certain time slot of every hour..... Actaully, i only want to do this for the wifi.</p>
<p>I also read this is not allowed..... So how can i help myself if ms doesn't want to do it? If ms want to solve it, then give a away for us to help ourselves on your bad product.</p>
<p>Why can ms not help me or someone to develop such a simple app that would also solve the problem maybe for them and add real value also to extend battery life on the windows phone platform at the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All help appriciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ps . No, it is not my router. 4 cheap Android phone + 2 iPads have no such issues!</p>

            <p>Hi Theo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if these troubleshooting steps will help you further: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Restart your phone, check the WiFi connection icon on the phone screen, and move closer to a WiFi access point to get a better signal.</li><li>Make sure your phone is not in the Battery saver mode (Settings &gt; System &gt; Battery saver, Lumia with Windows Phone 8: Settings &gt; battery saver).</li><li>Disable Bluetooth connectivity in your phone while being connected to a WiFi (Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Bluetooth, Lumia with Windows Phone 8: Settings &gt; Bluetooth). Bluetooth and WiFi operate on the same frequency range and may interfere with each other.</li><li>If you cannot connect to a network that you have connected to before, try deleting the network from your phone: Settings &gt; Network &amp; wireless &gt; WiFi &gt; Manage, under Known networks, tap and hold the network name, then tap Delete. (Lumia with Windows Phone
 8: Settings &gt; WiFi &gt; manage (advanced), under Known networks, tap and hold the network name, then tap Delete.) Deleting the network will delete the associated settings on your phone. After that, tap the WiFi network in the list of networks, then try to connect
 again.</li><li>If there is no SIM card in your phone, try inserting a SIM and check that you are not in the airplane mode. If there is no SIM card in the phone, some of the country-specific WiFi features may not be available when your phone does not know its location.</li><li>Check if you can connect with your phone to another WiFi network (for example using the internet sharing feature of another phone).</li><li>Using your mobile data, check if there is new software available for your phone: tap Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Phone update (Lumia with Windows Phone 8: Settings &gt; phone update).</li></ol>
<p><strong>If you are having trouble connecting to your home WiFi network.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Restart your router (some routers should be switched off for 2 minutes periodically to allow for background updates).</li><li>Check that your password in a secure network of your phone is properly configured and that your phone's security settings match with the settings of your home WiFi network. If you keep getting an Incorrect password error, log in to your wireless router,
 and change the operating mode 802.11b/g/n to 802.11g only, and then restart/reset the router, and try to create a connection again.</li><li>Check that your WiFi network is not configured to filter the access based on the device MAC address. If using MAC-based filtering, the MAC address of your phone must be added in the filter list. You can find your phone's MAC address in Settings &gt; System
 &gt; About &gt; More information (Lumia with Windows Phone 8: Settings &gt; about &gt; more information). It should be listed under Device information.</li><li>Disable other active network services such as video streaming and online games.</li><li>Check on your router's support page that it has the latest firmware installed.<br />
</li></ol>
<p><strong>If you are having trouble connecting to a public WiFi hotspot.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Check if any authentication is needed to the public WiFi hotspot. Even though the WiFi network is open, you may still need to authenticate with a username and password on your phone browser before you can access the internet. You may also need to re-authenticate
 after the authentication timeout expires. Disconnect and reconnect to the WiFi network in Settings &gt; Network &amp; wireless &gt; WiFi (Lumia with Windows Phone 8: Settings &gt; WiFi) if you do not get the authentication prompt.</li><li>Especially with public WiFi hotspots, the maximum number of users may already be connected. Wait for a while and try again, or look for another WiFi hotspot.</li></ol>
<p>Let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying..... But..... This is not an answer all work arounds. I'm not interested in rebooting my phone once every two days (it is not a windows pc with xp), or switching off blue tooth...or anything else that i do not have to do on any of the
 other 12 devices in my home that has no such problem. My wifes $130 Huawei works perfect with all routers....my daughter's cheap samsung of 9 yesrs old has never lost the wifi... But the ms phone off $400 has problems?!</p>
<p>Again, what exactly is the problem with the Lumias wifi chip for this to be happening. Why aren't ms stating the problem? Only then can we all help to think of fixing for it if ms can not!</p>
<p>Your suggestions are the same as in many threats about this... But why is this phone wifi so bad?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you missed my other question, how can i develop an app to switch the wifi off and automatically on again at set time slots? This seems like a very good app in any case and might give a convenient workaround​in any case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if ms had read all of the other fairly detailed complaints and investigations other people have done for them on this issue.... Then they would know that this started when phones got updated from mobile 7 to windows phone 8. Just ask an internal engineer​
 to go have a look what either ms or qualcomm did chance on the driver becuase that is the problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Formatting pictures in Word</h2>
                    I created several flyers and inserted pictures&nbsp;using Microsoft Word 2003 .&nbsp; Using the picture format option was very simple and easily allowed the sizing and movement of the picture.&nbsp; I am now using Windows 7 and Microsoft Word 15 and I am having trouble
 formatting the pictures.&nbsp; The new format option is very difficult to use and does not let me move pictures around, however when I open an old flyer document that was created in Word 2003 in Windows 7 and Word 15 the old formatting is shown and can be used
 for that particular flyer.&nbsp; How can I get to use the old formatting?&nbsp; Can two Word Programs be installed on the same computer?&nbsp; 2003 &amp; 2015?

            <p>If you need to easily move the pictures around the "Wrap" setting should be set to "tight" or "square." You should be able to resize the pictures easily by selecting the picture and working the sizing handles at the picture edges. I don't think there have
 been any changes in the newer version to effect this.</p>

<h3> bslatterylpz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 Paste Special &#62; Keep Source Column Widths not working</h2>
                    <p>When trying to paste columns from one sheet to another in Excel 2016, the "Keep Source Column Widths" option does not seem to work-- whenever I use this Paste Special option from the right-click mouse tooltip, the data I am copying just pastes normally without
 changing column widths.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried pasting only one column at a time, or multiple columns that are adjacent in the source sheet vs ones that have space between them, and nothing seems to fix this issue. The only way I have been able to preserve column widths when pasting is to
 use the "Insert Copied Cells" option when pasting instead, but this option doesn't always appear (such as when posting multiple columns that aren't adjacent).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some other setting or option in Excel that is preventing the "Keep Source Column Widths" option from operating correctly?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue can be due to conflicts due to existing settings and format applied on the worksheets that you are copying and pasting. We can use the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Cell width shortcut. Select cells and copy (ALT +C) &gt; press and hold <strong>
ALT+E + S + W</strong> to paste the data.</li><li>Through the Paste icon. Select cells and copy (ALT +C) &gt; click the drop-down below the Paste icon at the upper-left corner of the worksheet &gt; click
<strong>Keep Source Column Widths</strong> or <strong>Match Destination Formatting</strong>.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know which works for you.</p>

    <title>Importing contacts from Hotmail account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike30---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Importing contacts from Hotmail account</h2>
                    
<p>Previously, all my contacts were taken periodically from my Nokia E71 phone and moved to my Hotmail account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found no reason for this, although other threads here suggested I disable the contacts option in the email accounts part of my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I not only did this, I upgraded the phone software and then imported the phone contacts from the backup I had made in Nokia PC Suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I need to import the rest of my contacts from Hotmail, the ones which were removed from my phone without my wanting them to be removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I do that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I found the answer - export contacts to a spreadsheet from hotmail (via browser window), options, more options, export contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's fine, and I've cut and pasted etc into a Nokia Suite Communication Centre .csv file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I can't import the Nokia .csv file back into the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia doesn't like me doing that, Nokia wants me to buy Outlook Express, move the .csv file into that and then sync with it via the Suite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I get around this problem?</p>

<p>I don't think there is a way of doing what you want but it might depend on what email client you are using on your phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you set up the email account on the phone did it ask if you wanted to sync contacts? If so, you could sync the current contacts to the pc and delete the account off the phone. Then set it up again and sync with all the contacts in your hotmail. Once
 thats done, re-sync with the pc to put them all together.</p>

<p>I would like to be able to download a Windows Live client or Hotmail client to my phone, which would sync my contacts with&nbsp; my Windows Live/Hotmail account; but after much searching I did not find any for the E71.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia offers a download of one for S40 and S60 phones only, not the E71.&nbsp; Microsoft don't offer anything for any phone not running a Windows Mobile OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent between four and five hours last night searching for solutions, exporting data, editing, importing data...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ended up downloading a trial version of Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, the .csv file still needed editing (all the 0's at the beginning of numbers had to be replaced); but that was easy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case there are any users out there who need to know this; what I tried with the .csv file and how I added the 0's was...I inserted the 0's one by one.&nbsp; Then I tried (obviously naively) to alter the .csv file so that the Communicator would read it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do that, all I did was copy the data to a new spreadsheet, then did a formula ="*"&amp;A1&amp;"*"&amp;";"</p>
<p>Then I did a paste special (values/text only), then replaced the * with ".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then pasted back into the original file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is incorrect however, because in a .txt file in Notepad, the original .csv file had all the "", in there before editing.&nbsp; So the editing was pointless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed that when I opened the .csv file in Notepad, that it was all correctly separated with "",</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not so if I open it in a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried saving that as a .txt file and importing that via the Nokia Suite Communicator; but it froze up the program.</p>

<p>The S40/S60 distinction relates to the platform, rather than the precise phone model. The E71 is an S60 phone (built on the S60 platform, also known as a Symbian phone). Have you tried the S60-compatible products? I'm afraid I can't help with Hotmail sync.</p>

<p>Yeah...just found that out by going to the Nokia E71 software specificatons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then found this in the Windows Live download instructions;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To find Windows Live on S60 devices, visit the "Download!" folder from the main menu and click on the Windows Live Messenger icon. If you don’t see the Messenger icon in the Download! folder, select "Options", and "Refresh list". Windows Live should appear
 after the list has been updated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no "Download!" folder in my home menu.&nbsp; It shows as being an installation in the Application Manager, but is not actually visible in the menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are instructions about it in the help menus, so it must be there somewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I make the "Download!" folder visible?</p>

<p>No 'Download' Folder has ever existed on my E71, it must mean the 'Installations' folder. If WLive appears in App Manager then it should be in the Installations or maybe the Communication folders unless it was moved. Sounds odd if App Manager thinks it is
 installed but it doesn't show up anywhere !</p>

<p>There was a "Download!" folder on my E71, because it shows in Application Manager and there are instructions about it in the Help menus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I have found out though, is that Nokia have probably disabled it to make way for the Ovi Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's all well and good, but it does mean I can't have Windows Live Mail on my E71 at the moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only reason I wanted Windows Live on my E71 is because the Nokia Suite Communicator doesn't read .csv files properly, and because Nokia Suite Communicator won't take an import from any email client except Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason why Nokia PC Suite won't read any .csv file that has been edited and saved is because in order to open the .csv file in a spreadsheet application, it has to be decoded first.&nbsp; Is that going to be Unicode or Western EU 1252 Win Lat 1?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia hasn't said so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Nokia appear to want me to do instead, is to download Nokia Messenger and pay a subscription after the free trial of Nokia Messenger has ended.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nice try Nokia.</p>

<p>The Download in App Manager is not a folder, its a link to download files which now go through ovi as you say. Anything downloaded/installed goes into the installs folder as before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CSV files are simply text files with values seperated by Comma's (but can be any character really). I don't see any reason for any decoding unless you aren't using Western. Some software needs each seperated value to be surrounded by quotes which is a bit
 odd as far as I'm concerned but thats how some are, so may be thats what is required here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is extremely doubtfull that Nokia will ever charge for Nokia Messaging.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>The reason for decoding is that when you open a .csv file in a spreadsheet after having exported to that file via Nokia Communicator, it asks you to pick which option you want to use to decode with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mean, I personally don't get it, but that is what happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The message sent to my email after I installed Nokia Messenger was this;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for trying Nokia Messaging! This email message contains important information about the service.</p>
<p><strong><em>Costs of the service</em></strong></p>
<p>During the trial, there is no cost for the Nokia Messaging service itself. However, data traffic will be charged according to your current operator service plan and may not be included in your flat data rate plan. Please contact your operator to know how
 much you will be charged.</p>
<p><strong><em>Get the most up to date client</em></strong></p>
<p>If you signed up for Nokia Messaging directly from your phone, please upgrade your software. The updated version allows you to view emails in HTML, supports Windows Live Hotmail, allows you to set up multiple email addresses, and is a lot faster!</p>
<p>Using your phone browser, visit <a href="http://email.nokia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://email.nokia.com</a> and click the download button.</p>
<p>NOTE: No upgrade is necessary for E75, E72 and E55 phones.</p>
<p><strong><em>What happens after the trial?</em></strong></p>
<p>As your trial nears its end, we will send you a reminder. If you do not want to purchase a subscription, simply allow the trial period to end. We will notify you when the period ends, and we will cancel your Nokia Messaging account. You will not be billed
 for the service and you will not have to do anything.</p>
<p>Enjoy your mobile email!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yep, everyone receives that mail. However it is widely expected that the trial is now a never ending one and at some point they will remove any mention of it. You never know but if they do charge then many (most) will simply not use it - Nokia know this.</p>

                    <p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p>I would like to know if it is possible to use Quick parts (include text and include pictures) with Powerpoint 2010, as it is possible with Word 2010 ?
</p>
<p>I have to include several images which will be updated afterwards, and I have to do the same with a separate text. It would be great if it would be possible with PPt, but I do not find any "Insert/quick parts button"...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot in advance, </p>

            There is an Add-In called <a href="http://www.shapechef.com/libs/graphics-and-templates?page=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ShapeChef</a> that adds much of the functionality of QuickParts to PowerPoint. Though the web page mostly shows graphics, the program also stores photos and text boxes with formatted text. They have a downloadable demo you can try.

    <title>Low Resolution Photos on Lumia 950 &#47; Photos App bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlo a. mendoza  say:</h3>
<h2>            Low Resolution Photos on Lumia 950 &#47; Photos App bug</h2>
                    <p>I've been plagued by this problem, and I'm wondering if anyone else is experiencing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife and I have Lumia 950. Both sometimes end up with photos that are only 1920x1440 or 1440x1920 resolution. All the EXIF info wiped out of the photo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't put my finger on it but it almost seems like the "Adding the finishing touches" by the Photos app is causing the problem. I think it's corrupting/deleting the original high resolution version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens even if Rich Capture is off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Rich Capture is on, I can see that there are .nar file created with the low resolution photo but it's only 1kb. When I open it up using 7-zip, it's empty.</p>

    <title>Grayscale changes to colour in Publisher 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lesleyvg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Grayscale changes to colour in Publisher 2013</h2>
                    <p>A friend and I collaborate on publishing a community magazine. I use Publisher 2010; he has just upgraded to 2013 and since then we have had a problem with grayscale images.</p>
<p>When I change a colour image to grayscale and send the file to him and he loads it into 2013, it appears (and prints) in the original colour.</p>
<p>It isn’t practical for us to recolour each image every time we transfer files. What are we doing wrong?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can offer.<br />

            I cannot reproduce your issue. <br />
<br />
I open a file in Pub 2010 on a WinXP machine, select an embedded image &gt; format picture &gt; recolor &gt; change picture to grayscale (and another to sepia just for giggles) &gt; save file. I transfer Pub file to a Win7 machine with Pub 2013, open it and the pictures
 have retained the grayscale and the sepia.<br />
<br />
What if anything is different in your workflow to mine? <br />
<br />
Is either machine a Win8?<br />
<br />
Are your images embedded?<br />
<br />
What happens if you convert the image to grayscale using a third party image editor before you insert /embed it?<br />
<br />
Are both of you using the same default printer? Try producing/opening the the file with the XPS printer driver selected on both machines.<br />

            Thank you for trying! We both use Windows 7. Images are embedded. Images converted with a third party editor stay grayscale. We aren't using the same printer, will try your suggestion and let you know what happens.<br />
Thanks very much<br />

            <p>It took me a while to find out how to change a picture in Publisher 2013 to grayscale but I finally found it and it is surprisingly easy, but not well described.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the picture box in your document.</li><li>Select "Format Picture" from the context menu.</li><li>In the Picture tab, find the Recolor section and pull down the Color box.</li><li>In the section labeled "Scheme Colors", select the blackest box for grayscale. You can chose one of the grayer boxes for a lighter shade.</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            Thanks Mark,&nbsp; I had exactly the same problem as David, had changed pictures to grayscale in older version but when I&nbsp;used upgraded version the same publication came out in colour.&nbsp; Don't think I'd ever have realised the solution.&nbsp;Maybe Microsoft will upgrade
 the options to show grayscale as before.

<p>
</p><p>on the Home tab</p>
<p>1, Click on Pictures tab and wait a couple of seconds while it loads.</p>
<p>2, Click on Recolour tab</p>
<p>3, Click on Greyscale clouds (second from the left on the top row)</p>

            Dear bscribe,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Since you have changed your security info <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-security-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12428/...</a> you will not be able to enable automatic forwarding until 30 days are over. Please note that if you will try to cancel change, it will take another 30 days after you will do it.
<br />
<br />As a workaround I can suggest to set up rule that will forward all your emails received to your address to another one. You can set it up here <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/rules/inboxRules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/rule...</a>

<br />
<br />it seems that you are experiencing error message "We're not ready for you yet" when trying to access your account, it could be the 30-day waiting period after changing your security info.

                    <p>I have been trying to send numerous emails from my hotmail account to a relative who has a Talk Talk email address. She has not received any of my emails but she can send to me. I sent her an email from my old Yahoo account and she got it fine. I have her
 saved in my address book, i have added her to my safe list and still my emails aren't getting to her. So mit is clearly something to do with my hotmail account.</p>

<h2>            internet sharing not working on the Lumia 625. Please point me in the right direction</h2>
                    <p>At first glance, the Nokia Lumia 625 looks like a great phone. But the most important feature, 'internet sharing', doesn't work. I tried upgrading the firmware and apps to the latest version. I made sure I entered the correct APN settings and I am able to
 browse from my device but I cannot tether. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If it helps, the following screenshot shows the particular model, firmware OS, .... I have on the phone:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=262l7kh&amp;s=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=262l7kh&amp;s=8</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This screenshot shows the screen where I am trying to share internet:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2nbc7li&amp;s=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2nbc7li&amp;s=8</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And this screenshot shows the error I am getting.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I also tried contacting Nokia, it keeps taking me to a page which tells me that the problem is with the restrictions that have been placed by my operator but I find it hard to believe because I have put my SIM card in other Lumia phones that have different
 models and internet sharing works fine there. Here is a screenshot of the page they take me to (notice there is no sign that Nokia is taking responsibility and there is not way to contact them directly):</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Has anyone had any success with this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It pains me that I am finding it hard to get in touch with people at Microsoft or Nokia because I am finding it hard to find a solution to this problem.</p>

            <p>It is not a sim issue, because you have tried other phones. That also means it is not an issue with your cell provider either. It is also not an issue of wrong settings used by you., either.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>He can see the number next to the inbox folder indicating that he has an unread message, and he can see the message in his Unread Mail folder which indicates that it is in his inbox, but the message does not show in his inbox (like it is hidden).</p>
<p>
</p><p>He can see the message in his inbox in OWA.</p>

<h2>            All of our documents are opening in compatibility mode when edited and read only when double clicked</h2>
                    <p>The computer in question is running office 2013, the documents were made in office 2013 however it is apparent that they were all saved in 07 format which I believe is why we are having the issues. How do I convert all of these files into the correct format
 so that they open and are editable in word. At the moment when you double click on a file it opens in "read only" and the document changes to WD000017 etc which means it cannot be saved immediately back to its location</p>
<p>

<br />
Also whether it provide internet security or not.<br />
My personal experience with it is good as with Norton internet security 2012 and avast internet security 7. Till now&nbsp; I had used security essential&nbsp; in combination with either of both internet security softwares. Always observed security essential very prompt
 over other two in detecting a threat.<br />
<br />
Now due to financial reasons i decided to use only security essential. <br />
So i want to know in detail whether alone security essential tool is sufficient to keep pc out of viruses and other threats

            <p>Firstly, running two or more Anti-Virus software at the same time in same operating system would cause conflict,error,performance and other issues, you should only use one Anti-Virus software in your PC. You should NEVER use MSE along with other Anti-Virus
 or other Anti-Virus along with MSE.</p>
<p>You should chose instead of combine.</p>
<p>Internet Security programs usually provide you with firewall and some additional security features. Many of these features are avaliable in Windows Out of the Box, such as Windows Firewall, Internet Explorer SmartScreen Filter,etc. MSE is Anti-Malware protection
 which protect your against Virus, Worm,Spyware, Adware and other trheats and work along Windows Security features such as Windows Firewall. It is powerful enough to protect your PC and it is award winning product.
</p>
<p>In reality, when you want to make deicition to find Anti-Virus software and use it, it is your chose and you should ask yourself what you want from a Anti-Virus and how an Anti-Virus address your needs. I suggest take a look at:</p>

            It would appear that if you could retrieve the unique <i>Symbols</i>&nbsp;from column E that are associated with any particular
<i>Stock</i>, these could be used to retrieve the additional columns of information.&nbsp;With your sample table in
<i>Sheet1!A1:E26</i>, use identical column labels in <i>Sheet2!A1:E1</i>&nbsp;and type
<i>CAT</i>&nbsp;in A2. Use the following <i>array formula</i>&nbsp;in E2,<br />
<br />
=IFERROR(INDEX(Sheet1!$E$2:$E$9999,MATCH(0,IF(Sheet1!$A$2:$A$9999=A$2,COUNTIF(E$1:E1,Sheet1!$E$2:$E$9999),1),0)),"")
<div><br />
<div>That requires <i>Ctrl+Shift+Enter</i>&nbsp;rather than just <i>Enter</i>. Once entered correctly, it can be
<i>filled down</i>&nbsp;as far as necessary to collect all of the <i>Symbols</i>&nbsp;associated with the typed
<i>CAT</i>&nbsp;in A2. Next, use the following <i>standard formula</i>&nbsp;in B2,</div>
<div><br />
<div>=IFERROR(INDEX(Sheet1!B:B,MATCH($E2,Sheet1!$E:$E,0)),"")<br />
<br />
.. and <i>fill right</i>&nbsp;to D2. Select B2:D2 and <i>fill down</i>&nbsp;to match column E. You may wish to use the following in A3,<br />
<br />
=IF(LEN(E3),A2,"")<br />
<br />
... and <i>fill down</i>&nbsp;to match columns B:E.<br />
<br />
Note that the formula in E2 needs to be filled down beyond the total possible number of values to collect in order that none are missed. This is a bit of a balancing act as you do not want a long column of unnecessary
<i>array formula</i>&nbsp;returning blanks but you need enough to retrieve all values from Sheet1 no matter what
<i>Stock</i>&nbsp;is typed into A2.</div>

<h3> rajatsaxena  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue line during Skype video call&#63;</h2>
                    A very thin(1 or 2 pixels wide) blue line appears on top left side of my screen during Skype Video calls.Is it a hardware issue or an issue with Skype?Any one else noticed the same issue?

            <p>Hi RajatSaxena,&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting,&nbsp;<br />
Please contact the Skype Support below, to get more information.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/</a> </p>
<p>If the blue line doesn't appear elsewhere it doesn't sounds like a Hardware issue.&nbsp;<br />
Also you ma want to re-install the app, to see if that will fix the issue.&nbsp;<br />
Kind Regards, </p>
