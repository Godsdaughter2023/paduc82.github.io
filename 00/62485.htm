<div>We have 2 wifi networks in our home network, plus the building we live in has its own wifi that we can also connect to if needed. The computer always connects to our faster but lower signal strength connection (15' down stairs through concrete floor) rather
 than our slower but higher signal strength connection (6' through wood wall). This issue did not start until after the computer was off for 3 months and all the windows updates were done at once.</div>

    <title>Windows 7 - Windows Explorer crashes and hangs Pc forcing manual - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 - Windows Explorer crashes and hangs Pc forcing manual shutdown</h2>
                    <p>Since about mid August 2015, Windows Explorer has been prone to hanging when using "right click" to move or copy files. It does not happen all the time but maybe once a day or every other day depending on usage.</p>
<p>It will not close using task manager and also prevents a restart of PC unless PC is close forcibly using on/off button on case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Win 7 64 bit and have all latest updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also running Norton Internet Security with all updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone any clues or with similar problems</p>

            <p>Hello Cath,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur if display driver is not up to date or due to any virus or malware. This may also happen due to software conflicts or corrupt Windows files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to use steps provided in this article and check if it helps.<br />

<strong>Error: Windows Explorer has stopped working</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2694911" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2694911</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Important notes:<br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you use system restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I highly recommend backing up all of your important files and folders onto an external storage device before attempting any type of OS repair or upgrade.</p>
<p>

            <p>This issue is still not resolved. The problem only happens occasionally and seems to be linked to working too quickly. If a file or files&nbsp;are selected quickly and then a rapid right click for copy or cut, it then sometimes hangs with a blurred out Win Exp
 window. Other functions continue to work OK but not IE.&nbsp;Attempting Task Man to close WExp does not work and a full shut down hangs on blue "shutting down" screen. This then requires forced shutdown&nbsp;by holding&nbsp;PC off button. On restart, sometimes the "Windows
 did not shut down properly" screen appears but sometimes not. It then seems to work OK.</p>

<h2>            Icons will scatter around the screen after dock&#47;undock laptop.</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 3 I knew the files to save my icons to the same arrangement even when someone else moved them. It was a batch file and worked great. I have Windows XP SP3 at work (soon going to Windows 7) When docking and undocking my laptop the icons will scatter
 around the screen. How can I make a batch file for Windows XP and 7? My admin won’t allow downloads and installs from the net.

<p>In Windows 3 I knew the files to save my icons to the same arrangement even when someone else moved them. It was a batch file and worked great. I have Windows XP SP3 at work (soon going to Windows 7) When docking and undocking my laptop the icons will scatter
 around the screen. How can I make a batch file for Windows XP and 7? My admin won’t allow downloads and installs from the net.

            <p>Try this.&nbsp; It worked for me on my Dell laptop with Windows 7.&nbsp; The icons moved only when docking and redocking to an external monitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, Dock your laptop. Right click on desktop.&nbsp; Go to Screen resolution.&nbsp; You can simulate this by Opening and shuting your laptop while watching the resolution setting.&nbsp; My resolution was changing from the&nbsp;"recommended" setting of 1920x1080 to my laptop's
 setting of 1366x768.&nbsp; Match the resolution&nbsp;setting to your laptop setting, which is probably the 1366x768.&nbsp; The resoltution was changing back and forth, which was moving my icons all over the place.&nbsp;This was a&nbsp;"fix" for me. &nbsp;Hope this solves your issues.</p>

            Mine changes resolution as well, but when I change the resolution on my external monitor it doesn't stay.&nbsp; The resolution continues to change everytime I undock and re-dock I have to go in and reset the resolution.&nbsp; My icons do not move back to their original
 places, and most times I loose them all together and end up with 2 out of 10 remaining on the screen.

Resetting the Wireless Display Adapter
</p><p>If you’re having general issues with the adapter or forget your password to modify the Adapter Settings/Update firmware, from the Windows App – resetting the adapter may help. Follow these instructions to reset the Wireless Display Adapter:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Press and hold the <strong>Reset</strong> button for 10 seconds.</li><li>When the button is released, you will see the LED light blink on the adapter and a message on the TV that indicates it is resetting. Wait until it indicates "Ready to connect".</li><li>Once the reset is complete, you will need to reconnect your devices to the adapter. On Windows devices, you will see a message "Tap to fix connection", clicking on this will remove the Wireless Display Adapter and then automatically
 start searching for it again. You will need to select the Wireless Display Adapter to complete pairing.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Make sure you have installed all Windows Updates for your SP2 by manually checking several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, Charms, Devices Project, Add a wireless display.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>How did you find that, the&nbsp;graphics card is NVIDIA?</span></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Samsung NP300V5A, comes with Intel® HD Graphics 3000 video card, I would suggest you to refer the link mentioned below.<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/computer/laptops/NP300V5A-A03US-specs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.samsung.com/us/computer/laptops/NP300V5A-A03US-specs</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>If you have upgraded the video card to NVIDIA, you may download and install appropriate drivers from the manufacturer website.<br />
</strong>See: <a href="http://www.geforce.com/Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.geforce.com/Drivers</a>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you have 2 graphics cards, then you have to boot into <strong>BIOS</strong> and disable<strong> Intel HD card</strong> in order to use
<strong>NVIDIA card</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;

    <title>Windows Vista freezes in normal mode. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ss12ym  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Vista freezes in normal mode.</h2>
                    <p>Dear Support Team,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a laptop that I use for official and personal purposes. From the past 4 days I've been having trouble booting the system in normal mode. After a few seconds of showing up the desktop, the system just freezes/hangs and does not respond to any of the
 mouse clicks or any requests that I make.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below are my laptop specifications and I purchased it on 15-Apr-2009.</p>
<p>Windows edition:<br />
-----------------------<br />
Windows Vista Home Basic with Service Pack 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System:<br />
------------<br />
Manufacturer = Dell<br />
Model = Vostro V1510<br />
Processor = Intel Core 2 Duo CPU T5870 @ 2GHz 2GHz<br />
Memory (RAM) = 3 GB<br />
System type = 32-bit operating system</p>
<p>I have the e-Scan anti virus installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem started on 10-Apr. I was able to boot successfully in normal mode on 10-Apr morning and use the laptop without any issues until sometime in the noon. From 10-Apr evening or night the problem started appearing, and I was not able to boot in the
 normal mode anymore, and the problem still persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm able to boot my laptop in Safe mode. In the 'Safe mode with networking' I can also connect to internet from LAN and Wireless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In normal mode the system boots up until I view the desktop, but only a few system icons are loaded like volume, Network and Battery, the other icons are not loaded. And once these icons are loaded I see a cursor symbol (a round one) that indicates that
 the system is performing someting and that I have to wait till it completes, but I see that it never completes and thats when I call it hung/frozen and the only option left for me at this point is to forcefully shut it down by pressing the power button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was in Safe mode and I just wanted to see if all files on the disk in C drive (files used by the system) are readable, so I tried to copy a hidden folder ProgramData into an external drive, but this gave errors "An unexpected error is preventing the operation"
 and "The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error" while copying the file Cache.001 located at C:\ProgramData\MicroWorld\eScanBD\plugins. I instructed the system to try copying this file again, and the system hung. After restarting in
 Safe mode again I tried to perform the same copy and when it threw the above error I instructed the system to skip this file, but the system hung again. This could possibly mean that the system is unable to read the file cache.001. The last modified time of
 this file shows as 10-apr-2012 around 6pm thats the day when my system started hanging. So I set Startup type = Disabled and Manual for all eScan services in Services.msc and tried to boot the system in normal mode, but this hung again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that there is one CRITICAL event logged in the event logs below that could give some hints about the reason for the problem. Also note that some of the event logs were generated from safe mode, and some others were from normal mode. I was trying
 to boot in both modes alternatively to find out more information when these logs were written.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be highly commendable. This issue is blocking me from using my laptop to complete some of my critical official work assignments.<br />
Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please bear with me for any information that was not required, its just an attempt to put down maximum possible details so that it helps in analysing the issue faster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I looked up in Event logs under Event Viewer -&gt; Windows Logs -&gt; System and got the following different types of errors and warnings, latest ones are at the top. I've mentioned the dates so you know which ones appeared on 10-Apr when the problem started.
 I tried booting in normal mode today also, but it froze again. Today's event logs also I've captured and put them below with date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

These were the event logs generated on 10-Apr on which day the problem started. Latest ones are at the top.<br />

<h2>            How do I set OneDrive to Sync to a Specific Folder&#63;</h2>
                    I am currently trying to set OneDrive to Sync up with a pictures folder on my PC so that I have access to my pictures wherever. When looking it up online i went to the onedrive setting under account and chose which folder would be available. I set my onedrive
 to show my screenshots folder in my documents. It tells me that everything is sync'd but when i try to open the folder in one drive its empty. What am I doing wrong?&nbsp;

            Best way to do this is to create the folder in onedrive first.
<br />Then in file explorer right click onedrive and select Settings.
<br />Then on the account tab select Choose Folders 
<br />Then from there select the folder you created in onedrive.

    <title>Task Bar growing in size - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> microsoft_sucks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Bar growing in size</h2>
                    Just upgraded to Windows 10 and the first day the task bar was a normal size, located on roughly the bottom 10% of the screen.&nbsp; Now it is almost covering 25% of the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; I can auto-hide it but not reduce the size.&nbsp; There is only six program
 Icons so it should not have grown due to the amount of programs pinned.

            You should be able to resize the Taskbar the same way you resize windows (hovering the mouse over the edge and dragging the edge to where you want it); however, if&nbsp;the Taskbar is locked you will have to&nbsp;right-click on the Taskbar and unchecking "Lock the
 taskbar" first.

            <p>I was having this same problem. &nbsp;Each time I logged in the taskbar was growing in size to the point it was covering almost 50% of the laptop screen! &nbsp;I couldn't find a way to reduce it and there was no way to "grab" the edge of the taksbar to drag it back
 down to the normal position. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I finally tried right clicking on the task bar which brought up a menu and I noticed the "Lock all taskbars" was checked. &nbsp;I unchecked and then was able to grab the edge of the taskbar and drag it back down to the normal position at the bottom of the screen.</p>

            This continues to annoy me. I lock the taskbar, but on start it resizes and takes up 25% of screen. Windows taskbar and icons and all the mess that makes up the menu needs rethinking as far as I'm concerned. I work on my computer I do not want to spend
 time trying to resize icons, or jump to THIS PC to get to what once required one click. There is a lot to like about Windows 10 but this user interface needs to NOT GET IN THE WAY...

            <p>This problem was reported back in 2015 and it's still a problem????&nbsp; ****?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got a brand new HP Spectre laptop a week ago and this is one of the most irritating problems I've encountered.&nbsp; It is very easy to reproduce:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a local user account.&nbsp; From the start menu, I select the little gray circle with the person&nbsp;outline&nbsp;to go to the login screen. I reselect the user name I came from and type in my password.&nbsp; When I'm in, my taskbar is twice the height it was before!!&nbsp;
 If I repeat the process of going to the login screen and logging in again, I come back to a taskbar that is four times height!!&nbsp; I have to unlock the taskbar to resize it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several other Win10 desktop machines for which I manage the accounts the same way.&nbsp; None of them do this.&nbsp; Is this a laptop problem?&nbsp; An HP problem?&nbsp; This is ridiculous.</p>

<h2>            Music and videos always start playing at full volume &#39;till I hit the volume button</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let's say my speakers volume is set to 42 in Windows 10 and I play a new video on Chrome through Facebook, YouTube or any other website, it always starts at 100% volume and I have to hit the volume buttons on my multimedia keyboard so it syncs with the
 system volume. It happens in every software I use, like in WinAMP everytime I start or resume playing a file. It is very annoying. I'm not talking about the media's volume bar, which can be set normally, I'm talking about the system output volume which is
 always to MAX.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I understand there is such thing as independent volume settings for every app but it always gets back to 100% and I'm done beating my eardrums with this.<br />
<br />
What can I do?

            <p>That is an issue that MS doesn't seem to care about. For 2½ years, I have been asking people to let MS know how you feel here.</p>

<h2>            Numeric keypad not working after win 10 update</h2>
                    My Num Lock key no longer works after installing KB3199209 and KB3194496. &nbsp;All that I get is a beep when I cycle it on and off. &nbsp;The pad works when I type my login password after a reboot but there is no pad function after Windows comes up. &nbsp;This is happening
 to all of my Win10 computers, 5 in total, which are various brands.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 1)</p>
Open registry editor and find the following archive:
<p><strong>HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Control Panel\Keyboard</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 8 and above, set its value to <strong>80000002</strong>. A note for Windows 10 users: if your Windows 10 does not save the state of NumLock after the reboot, try to set the value "InitialKeyboardIndicators" to
<strong>2147483650</strong>. This will turn on NumLock on the logon screen starting from the next boot.</p>

<p>
</p><p>(Note: this website is not hosted by Microsoft and the subject material is liable to change without notice.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 2) </p>
<p>Reinstall the keyboard driver.</p>
<p>Right click Start &gt; Select Device Manager</p>
<p>Click the &gt; next to Keyboard</p>
<p>Right click driver &gt; select Uninstall</p>
<p>Reboot the computer</p>

            <p>Hi...If you would like to set number lock to stay on at logon...<br />
<br />
Right click 'Start' and open 'Run'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Regedit</strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to/select:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> HKEY_CURRENT_USERS\Control Panel\Keyboard</strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on the “InitialKeyboardIndicators”, select Modify and change Value data&nbsp; to {
<strong>2 </strong>}.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Registry.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart the computer.</p>

<p><span>I found this solution on an old thread from Sept 2015 about the same issue. &nbsp;IT WORKED! &nbsp;I get a nice beep sound when I cycle the numlock key now but at least the keypad works.......
 Turning off Mouse Keys when numlock is on did the trick. &nbsp;I left "Use numeric keypad to move mouse around the screen" on.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can you be more specific?...</p>
<p><strong><em>"Ease if Access</em></strong><em>&nbsp;for&nbsp;</em><span><em>Mouse"</em></span></p>
<p>Do you mean Ease of Access?...if so, I see no mouse setting which gives Numeric keypad options.</p>

<p>Hi Smitty...thanks ..now that was simple....thanks...</p>
<p>not needing this but I will disable&nbsp; a setting just to see if my num lock will turn off as an experiment....would that be the "Turn on mouse keys with LEFT ......"</p>
<p><strong>or</strong> "Use Mouse keys when NUM LOCK is :....." </p>

<p>@'Smittychat' brought it up here previous post.</p>
<p>You might be mixing up 'Control panel' with 'Settings'?</p>

<p>Hi...<em>'Uncheck Turn on Mouse keys' to answer your previous post...?</em>...</p>
<p>The picture I posted is the way it is with 'Num lock' working.</p>
<p>So I was thinking the opposite .</p>
<p>I got to this menu from 'Control panel'.... Kptnbly said /thought I was using Win 7...that's all.</p>
<p>Your input before was helpfull....so like I said I might just un-check just to see if the num lock will disable.</p>
