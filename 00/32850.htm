<h2>            Start Up Problems&#58; Notebook</h2>
                    I have an ACER ASPIRE ONE notebook, I believe it is 10.1". It does not have a disk drive and I am unable to start my computer. It always stops at checking the C drive. It states "Checking file system on C: &nbsp;The type of file system is FAT32." Can someone
 please help me?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If this helps I am running on Windows XP, and it allows me to go to the Setup Menu, the tabs are Security, Boot, Information, etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have had this problem for about two years now and haven't been able to use it.</div>
                </div>

            What is curious about your issue is that chkdsk says the file system is FAT32.&nbsp; FAT (File Allocation Table) would be something you would expect to see on a floppy, memory cards, USB thumbdrives or maybe Windows 95/98.&nbsp; Was the system ever running windows
 9x and then have XP installed on it later?&nbsp; It could also be that it cames that way or whoever/whenever XP was installed, the installer just chose FAT32 instead of NTFS (Ow.).<br />
<br />
The optimal file system for modern systems is NTFS (<b>N</b>ew <b>T</b>echnology <b>
F</b>ile <b>S</b>ystem).&nbsp; So that means if somebody says "...<i>the NTFS File System</i>..."&nbsp; they are being redundant.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Microsoft has a tool to convert FAT32 to NTFS that you can read about <i><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></i>.&nbsp; I have never had a need to actually use it, but I think many people have used it successfully.<br />
<br />
You need to get to the Advanced Boot Options menu and choose <strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong> so you can see why XP is not able to boot.<br />
<br />
You can then create a bootable USB thumbdrive with a Hiren's Boot CD on it and if your system is able to boot on a USB device (perhaps by pressing F12 before XP starts to load), maybe you can fix it and/or salvage off any personal files to an external USB hard
 drive.<br />
<br />
So- you have two things to do...&nbsp; See why XP won't boot and create a bootable Hiren's USB device and maybe you can fix what you have (maybe).&nbsp; Now I am being redundant.<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
If there is a problem booting, XP is configured to automatically try to boot again and you can get stuck in a loop of just being unable to get past the boot options screen or none of the boot options you choose will work.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when XP has a problem starting or crashes and tries to start again, it will give you a "short" menu of boot options and none of them will seem to be the right ones to get your system going again.&nbsp; Something like this:<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
<br />
You've tried them all!<br />
<br />
The options resemble the XP Advanced Boot Options menu, but the one option you need (Disable automatic restart on system failure) is not offered because XP has gone too far along in the boot process and offers you a limited number of boot options.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, you must manually invoke the Advanced Boot Options menu yourself until you do see the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong><br />
<br />
When you do get to the correct XP Advanced Options Boot menu you want to see, it has options on it like these:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
<br />
Enable Boot Logging<br />
Enable VGA mode<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Directory Services Restore Mode (Windows domain controllers only)<br />
Debugging Mode<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong> <br />
<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
Reboot<br />
Return to OS Choices Menu<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What you need to choose from that menu is the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure<br />
</strong><br />
Then if XP fails to boot normally, you will see an error screen with information and clues regarding the problem and then you can decide what to do next.<br />
<br />
If you do not see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option, you need to reset your system and start tapping the F8 key on the keyboard until you do see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you miss the F8 window of opportunity, you need to try again and start tapping the F8 key with more urgency (sooner and more frequently) until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure, then select it.<br />
<br />
You need to keep trying the F8 menu until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure option, and select it.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your system is experiencing a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), we need to know what the screen says:</p>
<p>Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</p>
<p><a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></p>
<p>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</p>
<p>If it looks like there is some kind of file name listed under the STOP message, send that line too.</p>
<p>Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what your BSOD looks like.</p>
<br />
<br />
I am going to recommend you use Hiren's boot CD (it will also go on a USB drive).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
This is good for you because it has many more tools on it that on the XP Recovery Console CD and you will not have to futz around in your BIOS if any afflicted system has SATA drives - Hiren's can deal with that.
<br />
<br />
You will have a whole bunch of cool tools that you don't have in the XP Recovery Console...&nbsp; a registry editor, password resetter, and a desktop that looks like Windows XP so you will feel comfortable maneuvering.<br />
<br />
From a working system, first download Hiren's Boot CD from here (it is a substantial download but worth it):<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (look near the bottom of the page).<br />
<br />
Unzip the Hiren's to some folder where you can find it.&nbsp; There is a Hiren's.BootCD.15.1.iso in there that you are going to need next.<br />
<br />
Hiren's has instructions to make a bootable USB that you can use, but it requires you to first burn the .iso to a CD and some other steps, so I<br />
suggest another way...<br />
<br />
Download RUFUS 1.20.x from here (read some stuff on the page so you can know more about it):<br />
<br />
<a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://rufus.akeo.ie/</a><br />
<br />
I will caution you to be careful that you don't accidentally format any of your hard drives - be sure your USB stick is in and know what the drive letter is!&nbsp; This part always makes me a little nervous, so be careful.<br />
<br />
Launch RUFUS and all the defaults should be okay, for the Device, choose your USB drive letter, Quick format, FAT32, label it if you want to and in the Format options box, click the little icon that looks like a CD and a window will open.&nbsp; Navigate that dialogue
 to point to the folder that contains the Hiren's.BootCD.15.1.iso that you unzipped earlier and the box should change to say ISO image (RUFUS understands the Hiren's ISO file).<br />
<br />
Double check you have the right Device selected in the top (NOT you HDD) Click Start, acknowledge the warning and let it finish (it will take a little while) as it copies the files.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hiren's ISO is also good size.<br />
<br />
When RUFUS is done, it will say 'DONE' in the bottom.<br />
<br />
Put the USB stick in the afflicted machine and reset/reboot and press whatever key you need to press to get to a boot menu where you can select the USB as the first boot device (that is F11 for me).&nbsp; If you don't see a boot menu choice, you will have to adjust
 your BIOS to boot from the USB first instead of the HDD.<br />
<br />
When the Hiren's menu comes up, choose the Mini XP Mode and it will start loading (slowly from a USB drive) and eventually you should see a Windowsy looking desktop.&nbsp; You should recognize that part and feel comfortable, but it is not your desktop - it is the
 Hiren's desktop!<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop.<br />
<br />
Double click My Computer, and right click your afflicted HDD, Properties, Tools, Error Checking, Check Now, put a check mark in the first box Automatically fix file system errors and click Start...&nbsp; then wait a while for it to finish which could take a long
 time, so be patient.<br />
<br />
You can always run it again if you think you need to.<br />
<br />
Then you can close all that stuff, click Start in the Hiren's&nbsp; Taskbar and restart your computer and see if it will now boot on the HDD.
<br />
<br />
If not, start over and you might need to check the disk again and include the Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors option (check both boxes).<br />

<p>Hi, I'm assuming you mean Xbox wireless controller. &nbsp;Is the cable you are using the play and charge cable? &nbsp;If it is, then the cable cannot be used to connect the controller for playing games. &nbsp;The cable can only be used for charging the battery. &nbsp;To connect
 a wireless Xbox 360 controller to a PC, you need to purchase an Xbox 360 controller wireless adapter.</p>

<p>When you see a message about a file that is missing from your computer - did you preform a search on your system to see if the file was really missing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That file is not included with a Windows 7 installation so the problem is not with Windows - the problem is with DpFileList Generator, it's installation or you are missing some other required components that do not come with a Windows installation...&nbsp; what
 could those be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you checked the DpFileList Generator WWW page and asked about the problem in their community did they have any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.pes-patch.com/forum/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DpFileList Online Forum</a></p>

<p>So do you have that installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it looks like you also need KB4019990 installed so do you have it installed?</p>

                    All of the sudden when I save my movies in windows movie maker..upon playback I keep seeing these black flashes. I've used these same clips previously and had no problem so I don't think it's the clip. What's the deal?

<h2>            Skype&#58; Problems, problems&#33; Why&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Note: Because of the inflexible Skype topics and sub topics, I've had to enter topics that don't exactly apply: E.g. My concerns are for Skype for a laptop, not desktop etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>My initial problem with Skype was sorted (with the kind help of people on the community), but problems remain:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Why does Skype update my version to Windows 10, and when it does so, it totally disables all the Skype services, effectively making it useless? One would have thought a later version would be better, but no, I have to use the old 'Classic' version: Why?
 Why does Skype cause all that grief?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) When I do manage to negotiate all the tripwires (and there's lots of them!) and install the Classic version, if I quit Skype, then it transfers my account to the updated version, and yes, you've guessed it; all services disabled. SO I have to reinstall
 the classic. What it means is that I can't quit Skype; it is always live. IE I have this icon on my task bar:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That never used to be the case: It used to just be the Skype icon without the green and white circle and the red bar below it. So why is that?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why has Skype gone 'mouldy' on me? Is it just me, or will it be happening to everyone? What the hell is going on?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm beginning to think I should just abandon it and go for WhatsApp instead. Couldn't balme me could you?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can answer why there are these short coming s are occurring! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steve</p>

</p><p>Allow me to assist you on this and answer some of your Skype questions or I might have a question too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I understand that using the Skype version for Windows 10 can be confusing to most users, as there are some features were removed as the classic one is still the same, unfortunately I do not have a clear answer about it on what is going on and how it looked
 like that, what answer that I can give you. That Skype is still up and running and there are some other new features needs to be added for the new version, and we will take your post as a feedback, so that we can forward it to our developers of Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What do you mean that you can't quit Skype? were you having an error on signing out and just keep one application (Skype classic) to run the Skype application?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have other questions or clarifications.</p>

<p>Dear Juan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for trying to reply</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re1) IE: You don't know do you? Incredible. This isn't just a few features removed; this is the equivalent of a picture; no links; nothing. That's not a few features removed; that is total disablement! So, it looks like the customer is a victim - like a
 guinea pig in a research lab - having his time wasted and frustration exacerbated while the 'scientists' dissect the problem. Skype gains entirely at the customer's expense.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I can sign out. If I do, I get the logo on my task bar as shown in my post. If I quit Skype it, it asks me am I sure, and says I won't be able to make calls etc. Well; that is what one wants in that if you close your browser, then you won't be able to
 browse - well, sure; that's the idea. But the difference here - using the same comparison, would be that you would just get a picture of your browser when you re-open it. So what USED to happen when quitting Skype, was that the Skype logo would just be all
 blue, and one signed in by left clicking on it as usual. BUT what happens now, is that if I quit Skype (as opposed to sign out), it disables Skype and the logo is white. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the story. It would be nice if Skype could solve this and stop wasting my time and giving me frustration. The only gainers now really are Skype, not me. I'll simply sign out instead of quit. But I don't like it; the programme is clearly still running
 in the background. </p>

<p>Hi there again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you want to quit Skype running on the background, but have you tried to go to the task bar and press right click &gt; then quit Skype?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you feel uncomfortable or do not like the new interface of Skype. You can always download and install the old Skype classic version. And if you are having an issue to install it, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Please try to uninstall Skype application from your computer.</p>
<p>2. Go to this link (actually its a direct download link): <a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Click here</a></p>
<p>3. Install the one you have downloaded from the link that I have posted above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if that will help.</p>

<p>No, non N distributions of Windows 10 use separate, unique product keys.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How did you get Windows 10 Enterprise N?</p>
<p>
</p><p>N versions are normally only available to users in Europe because of rules set by the European Union to not bundle Windows Media Player and other media features and technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Enterprise is a volume license client used by large organizations that deploy Windows 10 in bulk to hundreds or thousands of computers. Install files are normally available through the Volume License Service Center or MSDN subscriber downloads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>HI Ammar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your concern related to the performance of your device when running games can be due to its software configuration and/or hardware related issues. To better understand your concern, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last activities performed on your device prior to your concern.</li><li>The version and build of Windows 10 Enterprise N that you're using on your device. To check this, you can perform the steps posted on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>The "N" editions of Windows 10 include the same functionality as other editions of Windows 10 except for media-related technologies. The N editions don't include Windows Media Player, Skype, or certain preinstalled media apps (Music, Video, Voice Recorder).
 To know more about this, you can refer to the</span><strong> More Information</strong> section of this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3133719/media-feature-pack-for-n-editions-of-windows-10-version-1607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we'd recommend performing a clean boot in Windows to isolate software conflicts on your device. To do this, you can perform the steps posted on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. In the clean boot environment, check the specified gaming applications and see if there will be a difference in terms of frame per second (fps). The link will also provide steps to isolate the possible cause of the issue. Once you're done troubleshooting,
 check the <strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong> section to revert your device to normal boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Then it shows the driver: <strong>IDT High Definition Audio </strong><strong>CODE</strong><strong>C</strong></p>
<p>Then under that it says:<strong> A device attached to the system is not functioning.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Then when I look under 'IDT High Definition Audio CODEC' Properties&gt;Device Status&gt;it says: No drivers are installed for this device.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I have unattached all devices and tried again and again, but get same message. I am not sure what devices the computer is referring to. Any ideas on this? Internal devices; external devices, software, hardware. I don't know where to go from here.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated as I'm lost and frustrated. I'm not sure if it was an upgrade or what that caused this but I sure can't fix it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Thank you.</strong></p>

    <title>windows 10 spontaneously disconnects from wifi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mog_whitestone  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 spontaneously disconnects from wifi</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new laptop about a month ago, and upgraded from windows 8.1 to windows 10 after a few days. Windows 10 spontaneous disconnects from wifi after a few hours.</p>
<p>When I try to reconnect, all wifi stations are in the list, but windows 10 reports it can not connect. This happens on at least 3 wifi places (home, train, and tethering on mobile phone). Other machines do not seem to be affected.</p>
<p>A reboot solves the problem, at least for the moment, but the problem seems to increase in frequency.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an added note, driver is up-to-date and I do not have VPN installed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would request you to go through the steps from the link mentioned below and then check if the WiFi disconnects.

            <p>Dear Jesson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to answer my request. The steps you indicate are for GETting on line.</p>
<p>I AM on line, so the steps do not look like they will help.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I will go through them, even though they feel like a waste of time.</p>
<p>1) http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/getstarted-get-online</p>
<p>Yes, I AM on line, the wifi symbol is in my traybar. </p>
<p>
</p><p>2) http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/getstarted-why-cant-i-get-connected.</p>
<p>Again, these steps look not applicable, but here we go.</p>
<p>a) Make sure Wi‑Fi is on.: Yes, it is.</p>
<p>b) Make sure the physical Wi‑Fi switch on your laptop is turned on. (An indicator light usually shows when it's on.)</p>
<p>I dont see a physical switch like on my previous laptop, but if there is one, it must be on else it wouldnt connect after a reboot.</p>
<p>c) Select the Start&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2f6.4%2fmain%2f851aefc6-d9e7-41b6-a160-2a5e45499b33_17.png" />button, then select
<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;<span></span> &gt; <strong>Network &amp; Internet</strong> &gt;
<strong>Airplane mode</strong> and turn off airplane mode if it's on. Of course it is off.</p>
<p>d) Move closer to the router or access point. Strength is at 5 when i reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the sake of completeness, I did check out http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/how-to-fix-wifi-from-disconnecting-spontaneously/d1781fdd-c7f1-4d48-ae3d-32d4b82c3144 before posting this question.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The solution suggested did solve the problem for about a week. This week it reoccurred several times. I'll copy the statements above into a cmd file and run that as admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took a look at the windows system logs and found 1 error and 2 warnings. Here they are, oldest first:</p>
<p>Error: A fatal alert was generated and sent to the remote endpoint. This may result in termination of the connection. The TLS protocol defined fatal error code is 10. The Windows SChannel error state is 10.<br />
<br />
Warning: Name resolution for the name _ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs.WORKGROUP timed out after none of the configured DNS servers responded.<br />
<br />
Warning: Name resolution for the name pipe.skype.com timed out after none of the configured DNS servers responded.<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you very much for all the time you already invested in this problem.</p>

<h2>            Can anyone explain how to filter games on Game Pass&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I bought this new XBOX ONE S and my wife and I wanted to see what games we could play together from Game Pass. Can someone please tell me how to accomplish this? I would also like to configure this so that it does not show me all of these usless headings
 and stuff i'm not interested in seeing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the most difficult to use system I have ever purchased and if I am unable to make it simple it's going back. Not to mention XBox support is non existent. Try to get support for Xbox and it is an endless loop of web browsing. Shame on Microsoft!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is not an option to filter content on Game Pass for terms like local multiplayer (the type of game you're searching for).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reach Xbox Live Support, choose a category <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
from this site</a>. When prompted to speak to a virtual agent, decline it. After a few more questions, you will get an option to chat online with a live Microsoft employee or request a free callback. If you get stuck in a loop, back out and try a different
 topic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to how you reach support, it seems to be the new thing to have customers work online to solve the majority of their issues, which frees up Support agents to deal with less common ones.</p>

            I'm not much younger than you, and I look at Game Pass in much the same method as I do Netflix, or even the video stores of old ... just browse and see what strikes your fancy. When you look at the game description, you want to see mentions of "local multi-player",
 "couch co-op" or similar terms. Look at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/knight-squad/bq9c40mt0wwk?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this example</a>, which is available on Game Pass.

            Sorry no real filter on the console for that. Try the app which is really really great, might work alot better for you.

<h3> hgandhi1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battery not charging,  Driver appears missing</h2>
                    <p>Hi:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a new Lenovo 9 cell battery for my X201 Lenovo laptop&nbsp; (i was using a 6 cell battery earlier).&nbsp;</p>
<p>My OS is Windows 7 Ultimate.&nbsp; &nbsp;My new battery is not charging.&nbsp; It said 0% plugged in, charging&nbsp; - but the charge on the battery continued to show 0%.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While reading the trouble shooting tricks online I ended up dong the following</p>
<p>(1) removing the battery and AC adaptor and holing the power button for 30 seconds</p>
<p>(2) Updating the drives throught device manager</p>
<p>(3) Uninstalling the drivers throught device manager and running a "scan for new hardware"</p>
<p>(4) someone suggested I reboot in safe mode and uninstall the Microsoft Composite Battery driver.&nbsp; Which I did but was then unable to re-install it.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So now my battery charge indicator has disappeared.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But I know for the orange battery indicator
 that the battery is not charging even after 2-3 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know what I should be doing</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Harish</p>

<p>Sounds like either the charger or the battery are either failed or the wrong models.</p>

            <p>I suggest that you back up (if at all possible) your pictures, documents, and other non-replaceable files and data to an external storage device. (just to be safe in the event you format the surface's disk or something similar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then download the Windows media creation tool for your edition of Windows.</p>
<p><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=510815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 8.1 Media Creation Tool</a></p>
<p><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10 &nbsp;Media Creation Tool</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Use those to create a Windows installation USB. If that was what you have already tried, or it continues to fail, do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(Assuming you use Windows 10, if you use Windows 8.1 do not proceed.)</p>
<p>Download the Windows 10 ISO file from Microsoft, from here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/techbench" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Techbench (Microsoft.com)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;-Scroll down and select "Windows 10" as the edition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Download the very large ISO file somewhere.</p>
<p>Once download has finished, grab that USB drive you'll be using to recover with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Format the drive as FAT32 - Default allocation size</p>
<p>Mount the ISO file you download by right clicking it and selecting "Mount"</p>
<p>Open (right click, then "Explore") the virtual CDROM drive that will have appeared after mounting it.</p>
<p>Select everything in the drive (ctrl + a) then then copy (ctrl + c).</p>
<p>Open the flash drive which was formatted FAT32, and paste (ctrl + v) everything onto it.</p>
<p>Wait for the transfer to finish.</p>
<p>Safely remove the flash drive by doing so via the safely remove devices task bar icon (next to the clock in the lower right corner).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drive should now be prepared just as the media creation tool should have done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not recover the Surface Pro, there might be a larger problem, at which point you should consult your warranty status, get your proof of purchase, and all the accessories, and other things that were included with the tablet when you bought it,
 and head to a Microsoft store or where you bought it to get further help.</p>

<p><br />
What happens when you try to connect to media center?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would suggest you to download the software and install in Windows 7 and check if it works with media center.</p>

    <title>A user account named &#34;updatususer&#34; was created after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keypounder  say:</h3>
<h2>            A user account named &#34;updatususer&#34; was created after installing Nvidia driver update.</h2>
                    Ran Windows Update, Check for updates, and was told an "optional update was available".<br />
<br />
The update was: "nVidia - Graphics Adapter WDDM1.1, Graphics Adapter WDDM1.2, Other hardware - NVIDIA GeForce GT 430"<br />
Additional Info: "nVidia Graphics Adapter WDDM1.1, Graphics Adapter WDDM1.2, Other hardware software update released in October, 2012"<br />
<br />
I installed the update and it installed successfully.&nbsp; No re-boot was required at the time.<br />
<br />
Soon after that I noticed that a new User Account and Service had been added to my system under the user name of updatususer.&nbsp; Feeling this to be a security risk I deleted the user account, stopped the service, and then set the service "nvUpdatusService" to
 Startup type: Manual.&nbsp; That appears to have worked, the service has not attempted to reinstate.<br />
<br />
On the surface, this seems to be simply a well intentioned "feature" of the nVidia video driver package that will provide notification when a new driver becomes available.<br />
<br />
My problem is that<b> I was not asked by Windows Update if I wanted this "feature" installed and I was not presented a EULA from nVidia stating their intended purpose for adding a User Account</b>.&nbsp; It was quitely installed by default like any other fix from
 Windows Update.<br />
<br />
I see the potential that if this User Account remained active on the computer and a hacker was able to crack nVidia's password, they would be able to log on and gain administrative control over the system.<br />
<br />
Your comments?&nbsp; Did I take the correct action?<br />
<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This
</span><span><strong>behavior</strong></span><span> is

            <p>Hi there, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a few concerns about this update as well. Least of those concerns is it causes my monitors to turn on and off so badly that I had to do a hard shut down and reload from safe mode to roll back the drivers.
</p>
<p>Not as bad, but bad as far as concerns go, is when I went to apply updates last night, I indicated that I did
<strong>not</strong> want that update installed, yet, when the updates finished running, the monitors were flashing on and off again...it was installed (I understand that could be a glitch in pre-release version of Windows, but that seems pretty big at this
 late stage).</p>
<p>When I looked at information about the update, the links provided by Windows Update are to a "Coming Soon" page and the main Microsoft Support page, which I would kind of expect, but...this is the only update that has been applied to my system that has different
 links. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, and this is what caused me to seek help from MS...the driver, when it's been installed has been loading dynamic link libraries shortly after system startup, which throws event ID 11 in the Event Viewer. After reading&nbsp;the text/article in the event
 log...</p>
<span>
<p><em>"Custom dynamic link libraries are being loaded for every application. The system administrator should review the list of libraries to ensure they are related to trusted applications. Please visit http://support.microsoft.com/kb/197571 for more information."</em></p>
</span>
<p>...I have to ask: Is this update legit? Sorry if I'm sounding paranoid, but I just rebuilt my system after losing a fight against a rootkit virus with Prorat that spoofed my antivirus, parts of Windows Help, etc. etc.&nbsp; (My family is never ever allowed to
 check their email on my network again lol)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help in advance...and if you can help me find a way to make sure this update remains uninstalled on my system, I'd appreciate it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Whatever it is, it is showing there are some holes in security at the moment. I did what you did, disabled the userid, removed the entries from the registry, stopped the service and set it to disabled. 2 days later, everything was back the way it was before.

<h2>            Slow connection</h2>
                    I'm getting about 1/7 of my connection speed on Xbox live. Check with my isp and ran test, everything is working properly. My isp said it is a known problem among isp, and it's due to Microsoft policy with limiting the speed(specs) on the original Xbox
 and early models of 360's nic cards. Compounded by the fact Microsoft gaming severs are located outside the United States. Any help with fixing my current problem will be greatly appreciated.(except a suggestion about buying a newer 360) Modem: **** TG852G

<p>Xbox 360 IE does not have Java or flash so I can't use speedtest. So I'll use testmy.net for now, my current internet package from TWC is 30/5, average score on test my net 27/4.9</p>

<h2>            Windows Update gets stuck on &#34;Checking for Updates&#34;</h2>
                    I've been having an issue with Windows Update. I cannot update Windows Defender's threat definitions or Windows itself, because whenever I attempt to check for updates in both Settings and Windows Defender, the update process gets stuck at "Checking for
 Updates" and doesn't progress. I've tried using the Windows Update Troubleshooter, which said that it fixed three issues but didn't seem to do anything. I've even tried going into Windows Safe Mode and deleting the contents of C:/Windows/SoftwareDistribution,
 and even that didn't fix the problem. I don't know of anything else I can do without using third-party tools. Please help me!

            OK, so Windows Update was (finally!) able to find two updates to install. Windows Defender, however, is still stuck. I'm going to try applying the Windows updates and see if they fix the problem.

<h2>            Windows 10 Onenote requires signin after update</h2>
                    <p>I have been using one note locally for over the last four years without having to sign in. &nbsp;Now all of a sudden, after the latest update, it wants me to sign into a MS account. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;These are notes that are not needed anywhere else except on that machine
 and on that project. &nbsp;This means I now cannot access the notes I have built up whenever there is no internet access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does MS assume that everyone has internet access everywhere? &nbsp;I work in a lot of dead spots where there is either very bad internet access and no phone signal. &nbsp;I just use apps that do not require internet access. &nbsp;OneNote was one of them, now it is
 not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which change should I undo or what should I reconfigure to allow access to OneNote without internet access again.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 version 1803 problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samaritanplays  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 version 1803 problem</h2>
                    Hello,

I recently updated my laptop's Windows 10 OS to the Windows 10 April 2018 Update (also known as Windows 10 version 1803). Everything completed successfully, but when I went to look in the File Explorer, I found that all .dat files showed up in the file type
 as "Ȁ`Y夀ﶎ (.dat)".

After some minor updates from Windows Update, it was still unfixed. Another laptop I use has also updated to Windows 10 version 1803, but nothing is wrong. Was the update I installed corrupted or something similar?

Thanks,
Samaritan

            Hi Sackboy10,
<br />
<br />version 1803 introduced errors into Explorer. It can sometimes not calculate the correct size of folders which contain sub-folders. It have problems calculating free space on a hard drive. 
<br />
<br />And as you have seen it has problems reading metadata like file type, size, width . . . etc. from files
<br />
<br />Microsoft are aware of the issue and will hopefully soon release a patch . . .

<h2>            Windows 8 Brightness Problem</h2>
                    I just upgraded to windows 8 3 days ago on my HP notebook and I have installed the drivers and stuff from the HP site(Specifically for windows 8), I am facing a problem. When my notebook is not plugged in, sometimes it brightness automatically becomes
 the minimum possible and I can't do anything to change it. Neither from the control panel nor the brightness keys. I've tried disabling adaptive brightness but to no avail.&nbsp;
<div>But I found out that if I plug it in, then I can change the brightness again. And plugging it out again, brightness can still be changed.</div>
<div>I would like to know if&nbsp;there's&nbsp;a solution for this problem?</div>

            I have to say that I don't believe the computer specs are necessary here as I am having the
<b>exact same</b>&nbsp;issue as Rishab. &nbsp;EXACTLY as described, and I seriously doubt that we have the same HP computer. &nbsp;There are tons of people having the same problem all with varying models and brands of computers. &nbsp;It is a Windows 8 software bug and we need
 a fix.

<h2>            Xboxone and AVR</h2>
                    
<p>Lots said to go from your Sat box to the one then TV, But what if you run all your stuff thru your AVR then to the TV,&nbsp; For me, the SAT, PS3,360, BD all run to my AVR then to the TV... This has me wondering, to fully utilize the one's capabilities im not
 sure how to hook all up on the 22nd with the AVR involved..</p>
<p>Im a Harmony remote user for all my components so trying to visualize the ones setup with an AVR setup has me wondering. Anyone with the same type of scenerio and ideas on hookup. 22nd is right around the corner, I cant wait for that day to arrive.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

            I don't have answer, but do have the same set up... and you got me wondering now. There is very little about how we are going to hook our cable/Sat boxes to the Xbox one. I keep seeing HDMI pass through. Which now that I think of it is not going to work
 well in our situation. My cable box, bluray, HD-DVD, Xbox 360 and a homeserver all plug into my Pioneer AV receiver via separate HDMI In. I control everything with a Harmony One. I have the Pioneer hooked to the big screen via one hdmi out. I'm struggling
 with how this is going to work for us. Xbox One going to have an HDMI in? So it would be cable box to xbone HDMI In...xbone HDMI out to AVR...and is the pass through true where we can have cable box on and xbone off (my pvr has to be on for pass through to
 work). We just haven't been given enough info to be able to set these things up in a home theatre environment when we get them on the 22nd. I'll be back here in a few... going to make sure my stuff is HDMI 1.4 (does the bi-directional stuff).

<p>Ok, so my Pioneer is HDMI 1.4 but my Cisco STB is HDMI 1.3...But it does have CEC (which is another way to control devices). Still not seeing how this is going to work... betting a lot of us won't be set the way we want on day one. &nbsp;Now with Time Warner
 I do control my STB from my MS surface via the web (this is a TW service), I wonder if the xbone might leverage some of those service... still doesn't answer the pass through for STB - AVR - Xbone -AVR - HDTV &nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes its quite confusing. All my stuff is 1.4, with a Yamaha AVR. &nbsp;I have lots of ideas, one is to go from the SAT to the X1, X1 to the AVR, then we would have to use the harmony to do as we did before. problem with that, its probably going to break the "instant
 on factor, etc" unless that input is already set. &nbsp;Damn there are a few situation that could work, its finding the best way to get on the X1's features that makes it tough.
</p>
<p>I wish they would come out with some kind of guide, as most have entertainments systems today..A typical SAT to X1 to TV just isn't typical. &nbsp;Its going to be a mess a great day with a mess to figure out.</p>

<p>The Xbox One does support Audio Receivers so don't worry, you would just plug your HDMI Out from your Receiver into the HDMI In for the Xbox One and then input the information on what receiver you're using. &nbsp;While I don't know the specifics of your model/setup
 in general users of major brands should be fine.</p>

<p>The Xbox One is designed to sit at the top of the stack connected to the TV so you get all your Xbox One features and the signal comes through your Receiver into the Xbox One. You just have to tell it which Receiver you have in the configuration menu.</p>

<p>Makes sense.... The only draw back is it would have to be on that input to do things like"instant on etc.." would be nice, no matter what the scenario you could just say Xbox on, and it would fire up... but with us with entertainment systems running thru
 an AVR, that will have to be on along side the proper input etc. &nbsp;No biggie, but yet again another HUGE reason to own a Harmony remote... That device is just a must have in my opinion.

<p>Ok i ran it per above, AVR output to X1, X1 to TV. TV will work thru the X1, yet X1 sound wont return back to the AVR. I don't want to use the TV for sound as that sucks. Want my AVR to control the sound as i did on the 360. &nbsp;I have arc enabled for the TV
 and the AVR, didn't help. </p>
<p>i did tell the setup my direct tv box and AVR, as said tv will play thru the x1, yet i cant get sound back to the avr from the x1 while going thru menus, or looking at a game.
</p>
<p>I must be missing something here. Any ideas how to set this up so i can use all X21 features. &nbsp;Thanks for any help.</p>

    <title>Forza Horizon 2 - Unable To Race - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Forza Horizon 2 - Unable To Race</h2>
                    Xbox came with Forza Horizon 2 installed. Grandson had no problem racing. We purchased and installed Storm Island add-on and it's been downhill ever since. Storm Island shows at the top of the game but is not selectable. I've been told told many things
 by many people on how to get to it. Even had an Xbox Support person try different things. All the while racing wasn't a problem. Took the Xbox to the local Microsoft store, they hooked it up to one of their tvs, went into the game and they determined that
 there were a number of races that to be WON before Storm Island would activated. They also seemed to think that Microsoft has made updates to Storm Island that will activate it upon purchase/installation. Brought the box back home, hooked it up and now grandson
 says he can't enter into any races. Has some setting been corrupted? Should game be reinstalled? HELP.

            First thing would be to try the hard reset EXACTLY like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.&nbsp; Unplug
 the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Plug the power cord back in and restart the console.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>

            If you're trying to play Multiplayer I'm pretty sure that its not an option anymore since they put all the focus onto the newer Forza's. I think you can only play single player modes now. You may want to try uninstalling the game, Clearing local saved
 games ( you won't lose a thing) and then install again. Also I would check to make sure that the new Map or DLC is linked to the same profile trying to play it

            To Choppy's response - Forza Horizon 2's end of life happened back in September. They're focused on FH4 now.&nbsp;
