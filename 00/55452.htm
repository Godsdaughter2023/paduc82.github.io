            <p>Hi renegade,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here's my little blurb on improving space and speed (you can ignore the speed ones if you want, but often they are closely related and it won’t hurt to address both anyway) in Vista or Windows 7 systems (and it also suggests other things of value that
 you can consider or ignore - the choice is entirely yours). All of this is your choice, actually - I'm just presenting some options that may help and that have helped many others (and that I pretty much use myself though sometimes I do procrastinate I'm sad
 to admit and there are some things I won't do no matter how beneficial - for example, I refuse to delete my cookies (but that's a personal choice as I prefer the benefits of having them when going to previously-visited web sites over the limited amount of
 space recovered and speed gained given their small size)).&nbsp; Much of this should be part of normal maintenance, but that includes some other things (like creating periodic system restore points&nbsp;- probably&nbsp;at least weekly as they don't necessarily improve speed,
 space or performance and may in fact even do the opposite in some cases)&nbsp;not addressed here.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A great many things influence the speed and performance and available space of your system - mostly the existence of various files and what's loaded on the system.&nbsp; There are ways to handle this
<span>&nbsp;</span>(and you should follow all the suggestions) - and of course the amount and type of RAM and the speed of your processor and motherboard (but I'm just going to discuss software solutions here - you can go to your computer vendor/manufacturer for
 hardware solutions if any are available (I, for example, am maxed out at 2GB RAM by my motherboard and there is no better motherboard available for my model of laptop but if your system can handle it, Vista 32-bit can use up to 4GB of RAM (well, almost 4GB,
 more like 3.5 actually) and the 64-bit version can use even more).&nbsp; If space is the issue, replace your hard drive with a larger one, add a second hard drive (if it is a desktop system), or add an external hard drive.&nbsp; Those are hardware answers (which cost
 money).&nbsp; We'll now discuss software solutions (which are mostly if not entirely free - at least the options presented here - there are 3rd party programs that provide additional options but they really aren't necessary)..</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>One very important thing to begin – do NOT use any Registry Cleaner or Registry Booster or Enhancer, or Repairer or Fixer&nbsp;software (or whatever it calls itself) no matter what it says (scans will tell you have thousands of errors just to get you to
 download and install the program or worse, buy it) or where you got it (even safe sites sell these products but they are not worth the headaches they can cause).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Most do nothing of value and some can do great harm (to the point where you need to do a clean install to fix the problem – and that’s not even counting the fact that many such programs are actually malware in disguise).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Vista keeps the registry clean on its own quite well and doesn’t need any help.</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
<br />
To improve your speed and&nbsp;space, do Disk Cleanup using: <a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76073-disk-cleanup.html</a>&nbsp;in Vista or <span><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/818-disk-cleanup-open-use.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Disk Cleanup - Open and Use - Windows 7 Forums</span></a>&nbsp;in Windows 7</span>.
 Delete as much as you feel comfortable doing – nothing deleted there will harm your system in any way. This includes deleting the Temporary Internet Files.&nbsp; If you want to keep this from building, go to Tools / Internet Options / Advanced and check the box
 Empty Temporary Internet Files Folder whenever browser is closed and then that folder will always stay empty (except when you're using the program).</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Also do an Optimization: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance</a>&nbsp;in Vista or
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Optimize-Windows-7-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Optimize Windows 7 for better performance</span></a>&nbsp;in Windows 7</span>. Do all of the options (or at the very least, consider them
 - many can help a great deal).</p></span>
<p><span>At least once every month or so, run CCleaner <a href="http://www.piriform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.piriform.com/</span></a>&nbsp;with as many options as you choose to delete (but be
<strong><span>careful</span></strong> because this program if not used properly and with caution and with you paying attention to what you are doing can delete important and even critical files that could cause a great deal of trouble).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Clearing out your temporary files can also save you much space and improve performance and while some of the above will clear a lot of the temp files, they won't cover them all.&nbsp; This will.&nbsp; I recommend running it every month or two.&nbsp; It is TFC by
 Old Timer </span><span><a href="http://www.geekstogo.com/forum/TFC-Temp-File-Cleaner-OldTimer-file187.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>TFC - Temp File Cleaner by OldTimer - Geeks to Go Forums</span></a></span><span> and you should download and save it to your desktop.&nbsp;
 When run, it will close everything else, so be sure to save anything you're working on and basically close all your programs.&nbsp; If it asks (and when done even if it doesn't&nbsp;ask), reboot to complete the process.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>System Restore can take up to 15% of your partition's space but that can be reduced.&nbsp; It's a trade-off.&nbsp; The less space you allocate, the fewer restore points you will be able to retain - but many people reduce this to save some space while leaving
 enough to save 3-4 restore points at least (which is usually enough - until you need them).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76227-system-restore-disk-space.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76227-system-restore-disk-space.html</a>&nbsp;in Vista or
<span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/5482/make-system-restore-use-less-space-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/5482/make-system-restore-use-less-space-in-windows-7/</span></a>&nbsp;in Windows 7.</span></span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
<br />
Go to Start / Search options and type in msconfig and enter and then double click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Go to the startup tab and uncheck any program that you don't need starting at startup.&nbsp; That will probably be the majority of items there -
 if not most of them (some are needed like the AV program and Windows Defender but most are there to make opening the source programs faster and make you think they're more efficient).&nbsp; This will free up a lot of RAM and help a lot in making your system faster
 (though perhaps not so much that you'll be able to notice the difference - but maybe depending on how much unnecessary stuff is loading at startup).<span>&nbsp;
</span>When I did this on my system I removed over 90% of the entries and suffered no ill effects – to the contrary, I noticed startup was quicker, response times when working were better and I could open more programs at the same time and still have no problems,
 and shutdown was also faster.<span>&nbsp; </span>Better still, download Autoruns<span>&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a> which is much superior to msconfig and click on the Everything tab and do what was suggested above
 (though here you <strong><span>can’t</span></strong> delete everything as with the start menu in msconfig because there are some very important files and services included which
<strong><span>MUST</span></strong> not be deleted or it can cause serious harm to the system). If unsure, leave it alone.<br />
<br />
<br />
You also want to have good AV and AS programs on your system (so no malware is operating in the background draining resources).&nbsp; Windows Defender is a good AS program.&nbsp; The free Microsoft Security Essentials
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</a>&nbsp;is an excellent AV/AM program that has one of the least impacts on system performance and resources according to reliable sources and it does the job very well.&nbsp; If you're using MSE, you don't really
 need Defender and MSE will deactivate it when installed (but you would with&nbsp;many other&nbsp;AV programs - though some of them also deactivate Defender).&nbsp; I would also suggest downloading
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</a>&nbsp;and running it monthly to catch anything that MSE might miss.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
If you follow this advice and do it periodically (at least monthly) then I believe you will have as fast and clean a machine as it is capable of going given the hardware.</p></span>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

            <p>What version of Windows? If Windows XP the following may help.</p>
<p><span>What is the CPU and how much RAM does your computer have? Right click on the My Computer icon on your Desktop and select Properties to get this
 information.</span></p>
<p><span>Try Ctrl+Alt+Delete to select Task Manager and click the Performance Tab. Under Commit Charge what is the Total, the Limit and the Peak?</span></p>
<p><span><span>You can create more free space
 in C by carrying any of the measures suggested below.</span></span></p>
<p><span>The default allocation to System Restore is 12% on your C partition which is over generous. I
 would reduce it to 700 mb. Right click your My Computer icon on the Desktop and select System Restore. Place the cursor on your C drive select Settings but this time find the slider and drag it to the left until it reads 700 mb and exit. When you get to the
 Settings screen click on Apply and OK and exit.</span></p>
<p><span>A default setting which could be wasteful is that for temporary internet files, especially if
 you do not store offline copies on disk. The default allocation is 3% of drive. Depending on your attitude to offline copies you could reduce this to 1% or 2%. In Internet Explorer select Tools, Internet Options, General, Temporary Internet Files, Settings
 to make the change. At the same time look at the number of days history is held.</span></p>
<p><span>The default allocation for the Recycle Bin is 10 % of drive. Change to 5%, which should be sufficient.
 In Windows Explorer place the cursor on your Recycle Bin, right click and select Properties, Global and move the slider from 10% to 5%. However, try to avoid letting it get too full as if it is full and you delete a file by mistake it will bypass the Recycle
 Bin and be gone for ever.</span></p>
<p><span>If your drive is formatted as NTFS another potential gain arises with your operating system on
 your C drive. In the Windows Directory of your C partition you will have some Uninstall folders in your Windows folder typically: $NtServicePackUninstall$ and $NtUninstallKB282010$ etc. These files may be compressed or not compressed. If compressed the text
 of the folder name appears in blue characters. If these files are not compressed you can compress them. Right click on each folder and select Properties, General, Advanced and check the box before Compress contents to save Disk Space. On the General Tab you
 can see the amount gained by deducting the size on disk from the size. Folder compression is only an option on a NTFS formatted drive / partition.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 7 installation problem with partition - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 installation problem with partition</h2>
                    I am trying to install the public release <span>Windows 7 Professional (x86) - DVD (English). I booted to the DVD, deleted all partitions (2), created one large partition (40GB EIDE drive), the 100MB partition was created, and I chose the other partition
 (remaining disk space) to install. Each time, whether we first format or not, we get an error message that states something about not being able to install to the partition and error code: 0x80070057. I tried this using a 120GB EIDE drive as well, with the
 same results.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a clue what is happening here? I was able to install the Release Candidate with no issues last Fall. We are MSDNAA which is why we already have the public release.<br />
<br />
TIA for your help.</span>

<h2>            Personal Security, Windows Vista Home Premium</h2>
                    My old laptop [son's computer] has a program on it called "Personal Security"&nbsp; Says it was installed 12-9-09.&nbsp; It is tying up the computer.&nbsp; It displays the my System is in Danger and wants me to pay for activation of the program.<br />
<br />
When I go to try and delete, it takes me to the program and tells me to pay for activation.<br />
<br />
The details tab&nbsp;of the unistall/change application shows:&nbsp; Microsoft Windows {FCC74B77-EC3E-4DD8-A80B-008A702075A9}<br />
<br />
There is no way [that I've found] to get to a phone number or other means of contacting this program's origination.<br />
<br />
If I could figure out the path and where the program is, maybe I could delete it manually.&nbsp; However, the program is only in the tray at the bottom of my screen and give the options of:&nbsp; *Computer scan *Update *Settings &amp; *Help.&nbsp; The Help won't link to an internet
 page.&nbsp; The Settings takes me to a screen with many options all of which lead to pay for activation.<br />
<br />
I can provide more details.&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone has any ideas, I'd appreciate hearing them.&nbsp; Thanks!

            Hi Blue_Rocket,<br />
<br />
Thanks for using the Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
There are a variety of modes, starting at Windows 95.<br />
You should be able to run most 16-bit applications.<br />
<br />
You can also download the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor here:<br />

<h3> doctorfield  say:</h3>
<h2>            Plug and play devices have stopped being recognised in Windows 7 since installing the updates, and also WMP12 has stopped working</h2>
                    &nbsp;I am getting this for ALL my plug &amp; Play USB devices -A recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software from an unknown source. (Code 52)<br />
<br />
WMP won't work at all and when I go to the URL suggested by WMP it won't recognize that I even HAVE WMP-
<br />
Windows Explorer seems to stop working on a regular basis now as weell<br />
<br />
Is this a recent bug that occurs with all these updates for Windows 7 (64 Bit) or is my computer fornicated?<br />

            Hi-<br />
1)&nbsp; The recent updates were:<br />
&nbsp;(KB2898785)<br />
&nbsp;(KB2847077)<br />
&nbsp;(KB2817641)<br />
&nbsp;(KB2850085)<br />
&nbsp;(KB2858725)<br />
&nbsp;(KB2891804)<br />
<br />
2) EVERY SINGLE plug &amp; play device ( I have four different (Samsung, Philips and Toshiba) external HDD and a LG BluRay Disk player) using ALL USB ports has the same little yellow triangle on the device manager - I find it hard to believe it's just one device.
 I have a HDD using the HDMI socket and the computer has no problem recognising that.&nbsp; Similarly ALL the card reader slot drives have similarly malfunctioned- all this since installing the latest updates and I fear there is a connection<br />
<br />
3) WMP has been checked by the Microsoft Fixit app.&nbsp; It says it's fine.&nbsp; However when I use WMP it simply says this- The file WMPLOC.DLL has a version number of 12.0.7601.18150 where 12.0.7601.17514 was expected.&nbsp; Windows Media Player is not installed properly
 and must be reinstalled. Do you want to install the player from the website?<br />
<br />
I tried this and spent half an hour trying to get WMP12 installed, and the website politely informed me that I don't have WMP installed anyway.
<br />
<br />
I have done system restore and the PC recognises everything I plug into it, but the next time I boot up, it seems to have a relapse.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p><strong><u>WMP problem</u></strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Dec Windows Updates included KB2847077 and that was a WMP update.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>Update for Windows 7 (KB2847077)</em> or <em>Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2847077)</em>&nbsp;- the

</font></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><font color="#000000">This KB is supposed to be&nbsp;a specific fix&nbsp;for WMP freezing but some other recent posts indicate that it fixed other issues whilst at least one post said that it created problems
</font><font color="#000000">and had to be uninstalled.&nbsp; In this problem case, <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-pictures/wmp-problem/8a17ee8f-2bd0-47c6-8429-b5fd9cd36273">
<font color="#0072c6">WMP problem</font></a>, the user described a similar error message to yours about the version number expected.&nbsp; That user also fixed the problem by removing that specific update.</font></p>
<font color="#000000">
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Personally, I would uninstall the update as well as&nbsp;unload then reload WMP.&nbsp; To unload-reload, do
<font color="#000000">both these steps [<i>they are the closest thing possible to uninstalling then reinstalling WMP &amp; will effectively provide a new installation of WMP</i>]</font></p>

            The first thing to try is a two button reset:
<br />
<br />Step 1:	Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.
<br />	
<br />Step 2:	Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both. 
<br />	
<br />	The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.
<br />	
<br />Step 3:	After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.
<br />	
<br />Step 4:	Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.
<br />

    <title>Computer is extremely slow and freezes after not shutting down Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jleester  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer is extremely slow and freezes after not shutting down Windows 7 properly.</h2>
                    Yesterday, my computer froze to the point of me pulling the plug on my laptop. After turning it on again, I noticed that my computer became extremely slow. I tried to browse the web with Google Chrome and it takes ages just to get one page loaded. The
 Shockwave Flash plug in crashes frequently and whenever I try to browse a web page that uses Java, it freezes for a couple minutes and continues loading slowly.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Chrome is not the only program that is running slowly. Every other program seems to freeze/be slow. I have the MSI CX640 with: 4GB of ram, Nvidia Geforce 520M 1GB, Intel Core i3-2310M @ 2.1GHz, Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I took a look at the event logs and found some warnings and errors:<br />
<br />
The driver \Driver\WUDFRd failed to load for the device ACPI\ACPI0008\2&amp;daba3ff&amp;2.

            <p>Hello Jleester, <br />
<br />
The error warning states the I/O errors may be from faulty hardware: <br />
<br />
<em>Windows (5352) Windows: A request to write to the file "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Search\Data\Applications\Windows\Windows.edb" at offset 70025216 (0x00000000042c8000) for 32768 (0x00008000) bytes succeeded, but took an abnormally long time (91 seconds)
 to be serviced by the OS. In addition, 18 other I/O requests to this file have also taken an abnormally long time to be serviced since the last message regarding this problem was posted 30 seconds ago.
<strong>This problem is likely due to faulty hardware</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would check with your computer software manufacturer to see if there are any diagnostic tests that can be run on your hardware.
<br />
<br />
I also see that Steam.exe is not releasing handles to your user profile, so I would suggest you uninstall Steam and then reinstall. The event id 1530 is just stating they unloaded the application, steam.exe. This type of errors can cause your user profile to
 become corrupt. <br />
<br />
<br />
Let us know if this helps. <br />
<br />
<br />
Marilyn <br />

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am always advised to install a 3th-party antivirus program to be in-place&nbsp; Windows defender.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In this screen shot below, the Defender is turned off since the&nbsp;Microsoft Security&nbsp;Essential is installed.</p>

</p>
<p>However, when I have&nbsp;let the Windows defender monitor my PC alone by uninstall the MSE, I found it is OK to be a standalone&nbsp;reliable program.</p>

<p>Due to the very high prices of 3th-party antivirus programs, I would &nbsp;only rather using the Windows defender alone. Would it be OK?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Finally: </strong>other third-party antivirus&nbsp;programs such as Norton Internet&nbsp;Security can&nbsp;be&nbsp;instead of Windows defender and can be managing the&nbsp;Windows Firewall as well. However, MSE cannot be managing&nbsp; the&nbsp;Windows Firewall&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Defender on W7 is basically antispyware only not anti virus - <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/using-windows-defender" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Defender</a></p>
<p>For W7 you need AntiVirus as well ( free examples - MSE, Avast, etc for more see here -&nbsp;<a href="http://freebies.about.com/od/computerfreebies/tp/best-free-antivirus.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://freebies.about.com/od/computerfreebies/tp/best-free-antivirus.htm</a>&nbsp;
 others are probably available as well. ) some of which will turn defender off and replace it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've not used any of them except MSE and AVG myself. <em>Only download any program from known trusted sites.</em></p>

            <p>Thanks a lot,</p>
<p>I really would ask you if I have Registred version of MalwarBytes Anti Malware as well. It would be OK.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Do you think it is a worth buying a Norton Internet&nbsp;security for 3PCs and a year with a price of about US 40$ and ESET Smart Security with about US 52$.</p>
<p>I really have been using NIS for about two years, but I didn't see any significant difference between it and MSE, except online supported chatting .</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How can I be entirely sure that a 3th-party antivirus program is suitable for me and the money is&nbsp;spent&nbsp;well.

            <p>Thanks a lot,</p>
<p>No problem to jump into this thread,</p>
<p>With respect to your Question, because I didn't notice any significant difference for NIS for which I paid about 40$ one year ago. When I have used the MSE, I would think no need to spend money on paid Antonius programs at all. Thus, I would be informed
 to&nbsp;only&nbsp; know if there any differences needed to buy anti virus programs. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'v been almost always asking myself why there is no&nbsp; good antivirus software program built-in with all Win 7 systems and it will be updated with Windows' updates. I don't have any answer, apart-from if Microsot integrated such&nbsp; good antivirus software with
 Win 7, then all the other companies which invest their money to design the antivirus programs(NIS, Smart Security-ESET-)&nbsp; will complain Microsoft to release a Windows 7 with a very good antivirus software&nbsp; integrated with systems</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, I really saw that even MSE is not as deeply designed as NIS or ESET are because I think there would be a complaint if it would be&nbsp; as deeply designed as they are.</p>
<p>Simple question, who will be paying for antivirus software if they will find&nbsp; free good antivirus software? This demonstrate that MSE, Avast, or other free programs are not reliable to be used as stand-alone programs</p>

            <p>I think you will get as many different answers to the "which Anti-Virus/malware protection should I be running" question, as the people you ask. People have their favorites and most have their "hated choice".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Personally, I run AVG(free) on an old XP machine, and MSE on my W7 machines. These are running as the real time protection. I also have free Malwarebytes Antimalware with which I scan the PCs every so often and always before I make a back-up.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Some people prefer the paid for programs like Norton, others say they are "process heavy" and wouldn't use them.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The choice basically is yours. But remember no one AV program is every likely to always catch everything all the time, no matter if its paid for or free. Just make sure they are running and kept up to date, and a second program ( Like Malwarebytes(free)
 or SuperAntiSpyware(free) etc ) is on hand to run on-demand scans as/when required.</p>

<h2>            After Avast installation, restarted the computer, a blue coloured screen started flashing.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: avast not letting windows 8 start </p>
<p>I recently upgraded my windows 7 to windows 8 pro (on a dual boot with vista) and installed avast free antivirus.<br />
when I restarted my computer instead of lock screen a blue coloured screen started flashing.
</p>
<div>So I restarted my computer again and chose system restore from the dual boot menu and restored my pc to the time when avast wasn't installed and everything worked fine.<br />
So how can I use avast again?<br />
If that's not possible please give me some free antivirus alternatives for windows 8.</div>

            <p><span>Hi AnmolSingh, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the information, you are receiving blue screen errors when installing Avast free antivirus.</p>
<p>It would be helpful if you could reply to these questions to assist you further.</p>
<p>1. Which version of Avast did you try to install?</p>
<p>2. Did you receive any error message or error code when the blue screen flashes?</p>
<p>3. Are you using Windows 8 pro 64bit?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems installing Avast in Windows 8 pro 64bit get BSOD errors.</p>
<p>Windows 8 has its own inbuilt Security software, Windows Defender.</p>
<p>Here is an article which provides you more information on the same.</p>

 there's no number on it. i don't know if it's faded or my mum rubbed it off with her incessant cleaning but I can't reinstall windows. As i've already formatted it I can't use one of those programs like jellybean(?) Is there a way I can find the product key

<p>Your info is a bit confusing, one has to assume system restore didn't work and you have reformatted your hard drive and want to reinstall XP for which you will require the XP installation disc which should have the Key on it. If you have had a successful
 system restore and simply want to know your key because you have no number on either the computer or disc or disc is missing then&nbsp;download from below and run the program to obtain keys for any Mocrosoft product on your computer,</p>

<h2>            windows 8.1 will not boot on Toshiba Satelite C855D-S5303</h2>
                    <p>My laptop is not quite a year old (will be on the 7th), never had any issues with it. Updated to the 8.1 update and now it won't boot up. I can not reset or restore, because it says that the disc is locked. Or it says that there is no recovery partition.
 How can I get this working again? Not happy. Why would&nbsp;Microsoft release an update where you are unable (purposely) to restore your computer? And, if they are giving people the runaround (a lot of that going on lately with other companies),&nbsp;Microsoft is&nbsp;setting
 itself up for a major lawsuit. I don't appreciate my "new" laptop being rendered unusable, because&nbsp;Microsoft made it so it couldn't be self repaired. &nbsp;I should not have to buy any recovery discs (made my own and they don't work either, says the discs are missing
 files), if it's something I can do on my end, I have no problem being walked through the steps.
</p>
<p>Microsoft really dropped the ball on this one. Major F*** up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone have a solution to this issue? I am on a Toshiba Satelite C855D-S5303.</p>

<p>The situation is&nbsp;bad. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know why drives are locked by OEM's.&nbsp; Here the best option-Laptop is less than a year, warranty period might apply, contact Toshiba immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per my knowledge, since drive is locked and&nbsp;there is no recovery partition&nbsp;contacting Toshiba for assistance&nbsp;is the best&nbsp;option. I don't think even Microsoft can help you here.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            My Xbox 360 slim is going bananas&#33; Corrupted pixels, freezing, etc.</h2>
                    Okay, so my Xbox 360 slim has been working for some time now, i'd say about two years. And recently, out of nowhere the console started freezing while i played sonic generations, no biggie, it happens. So i turned off the console, and back on again, and
 i noticed something strange... there are corrupted pixels on the sign in menu!! This started to worry me, but i signed in and carried out my game. But it freezed on the dashboard! I kept trying and trying but the same thing kept happening, so at this point,
 i knew something was up. I did some searching on the internet and found that clearing the storage cache could help, so i tried. No dice. I then tried cooling the system down, and it still didn't do anything to help. For the final thing to do, i tried deleting
 or storing corrupted data on the hard drive (250 gigs). And, yay!! It worked! No more problems! So what was the point of telling that story? well, about 2 weeks of it working like a charm, it, for some reason, decided to do ALL O

<h2>            remote desktop login problem - &#34;account restriction&#34; error</h2>
                    I'm having a problem accessing my WinXP Pro system from my Win7 Pro system via Remote Desktop over a user group network. From the XP machine I can connect to the Win 7 machine, but if I try the reverse, I get an "account restriction" error on login to
 the XP machine. My user account is password protected on the Win 7 computer but not on the XP if that makes a difference. Both have allow other computers to connect in Remote Desktop. All service packs &amp; updates are current on both.

<p><br />
Yes that does make a difference. By design you must use a password protected account to access a computer via Remote Desktop.</p>
<p>But you can try this to get around that issue if you wish using TweakUI and the information in this KB article. Note these pertain to the XP machine only.</p>

<h2>            Task Manager Startup Dropables Issue&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently updated to 1803 update of Windows 10. I noticed a sort of "bug" with the startup menu on the task manager. The arrows does not expand nor contract the programs who have multiple instances of itself. Has anyone gotten this, or is it just me? Thanks
 for the help!</p>

<p>Well, not sure what to say as it only happened when I updated to 1803. Can I get a more precise link to download this tool because that
<span>"</span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/947821/fix-windows-update-errors-by-using-the-dism-or-system-update-readiness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix Windows Update errors by using the DISM

 also seem to suggest to reinstall windows, but I've done that like 4 times already and still getting the same issue. In any case, I will just ignore it and the "Devs" will resolve it in a later date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, did some scans from what I can understand from that "</span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/947821/fix-windows-update-errors-by-using-the-dism-or-system-update-readiness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix

 again because I have software's that have limited amount of serial keys and I've have to contact the other software companies to reset them each time I installed Windows. I am just reporting this issue here, so that the "Devs" are aware of this, but it seems
 I am the only one here.</span></p>

 I tried using the .srt file with Divx Player and it only shows boxes. I tried using DirectVobSub using .srt and it only showed some weird words and letters mix of numbers and letters. Anyways I don't know what else to do.</span>

            <p><span>Hi Redvolt,<br />
<br />
From your issue description, I understand that subtitles are not getting displayed in Windows Media Player 12. Please let me know if you are not facing this issue.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Windows Media Player does not support .SRT file format. However, you may download third party codecs from trusted websites to play the .SRT Files in Windows Media Player.</span></p>

<p><span>Hello pegasus00,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This question is there because if you were installing from Vista SP1 then the upgrade installation is an option.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It’s only from the Windows 7 Beta that a clean install is required.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

    <title>Can&#39;t boot PC after Windows 8.1 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> akifm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t boot PC after Windows 8.1 upgrade</h2>
                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This Monday I updated to Windows 8.1 from the Windows Store and the download went smoothly. After restarting the computer for the update to finish, it took some time to configure some files, but then I ran into a blue screen with this error:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>"Recovery</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>Your PC needs to be repaired</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>The operating system couldn't be loaded because the system registry file is missing or contains errors.</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>File: \Windows\system32\config\system</i></div>
<div><i>Error code: 0xc000014c</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div><i>You'll need to use the recovery tools on your installation media. If you don't have any installation media (like a disk or USB device), contact your system administrator or PC manufacturer."</i></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>From this screen I can access the UEFI Firmware Settings and not much else.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The PC didn't come with any recovery disks, so I don't know what to do now. I have also tried starting it in safe mode, by pressing the F8 key or shift + F8, but that didn't do anything.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The laptop is an Acer Aspire V5-573G, and the disk is a Samsung 840 EVO 250 GB SSD.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can access the files on the SSD by removing it from the laptop, and then connect it to an old laptop with a SATA to USB cable, if that's any help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi - It's worth mentioning that there are several different repair options available under Troubleshoot (step g above). In my case, after operating several weeks under 8.1, I&nbsp;started&nbsp;getting a boot error (0Xc000014c). I created the Windows 8.1 installation
 DVD media per your link above (Product key required) and booted with the DVD. The option tree&nbsp;I was presented with is</p>
<p>
</p><p>Choose an Option</p>
<ul>
<li>TroubleShoot
<ul>
<li>Refresh your PC</li><li>Reset your PC</li><li>Advanced Options
<ul>
<li>System Restore</li><li>System Image Recovery</li><li>Startup Repair</li><li>Command Prompt</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>I&nbsp;navigated to and selected&nbsp;TroubleShoot--&gt;Advanced Options--&gt;Startup Repair. The repair failed. At that point I was given the option to automatically try&nbsp;to set the system to a&nbsp;backup restore point (the same option as "System Restore", above). That succeeded.
 The system was set to the last system restore point and I lost very little in terms of system setup.</p>

<h2>            Call of Duty Black Ops 4 XBox One- Can&#39;t be purchased on Microsoft Store&#63;</h2>
                    I keep checking the Microsoft Store both from console and on my PC to buy COD Black Ops 4 for Xbox One, and it states "Call Of Duty: Black Ops 4 is currently not available" over the tab where I should be able to buy the game, and the tab only gives the
 option to "Redeem a code." If I change region (currently I am in Argentina), i am shown the price of the game in the currency of that region/country and the option to buy it, but of course I cant buy it because I dont have a billing address in those other
 countries. So I was wondering if this is a glitch or is there a problem to sell the game in Argentina?

    <title>The Darkness 2 DLC Cancelled by 2K Games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fieldteacher1  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Darkness 2 DLC Cancelled by 2K Games</h2>
                    
<p><span>The Darkness 2 was among the top shooters of the 2012, with the special quad-wielding feature which had never seen before in any other game. The game was mainly single player but it also did offer a 4 Player co-op Multiplayer with a separate story
 of its own. After asking around apparently there was a possibility that the planned-but-cancelled DLCs for Darkness 2 were going to continue where the story left off, there was also plans for additional bonus content such as new weapons and darkness relics.
 However none of those were ever confirmed to the planning phase, they were thrown out when 2K didn’t saw necessary for it to continue since the total sales for the game were below 1 Million copies for all three platforms (PC, PS3 and X360).</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">The game was fantastic, along with the first one.<br />
It just fell below the radar among all the other games dropping soon at the time.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty bummed, I really want to see what happens since Darkness 2 pretty much left off as a cliffhanger.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I think a lot of people are fantasizing the past when it comes to the darkness, but I never liked the game so who knows, all I know is I could make snake things eat people, fun for a bit but got bored.</p>

No, it was good. It was just way too short. I liked the first one more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Darkness 2 was incredible. I don't know if it was quite as good as the first, but it was pretty damn close. Sad to see the DLC was cancelled, but I am not surprised....didn't even expect any DLC really.</p>

<p>I'm loving the Darkness 2 so far, awesome game! Sad to hear the DLC was cancelled... I never could get into the first Darkness so the sequel really surprised me.</p>
