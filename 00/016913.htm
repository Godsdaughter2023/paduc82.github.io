<h2>            Office 365 Personal 1 account on my laptop and PC&#39;s</h2>
                    I have a laptop and 2 desktops, total of 3 Windows 10 computers. I use a single Microsoft account on each of them. Would a Personal account allow this, or would that require a Home account?

<h2>            Change Payment Information</h2>
                    <strong>How do I "convince" Skype that I live in a different country now so I need to change my payment details?</strong> I set up my Skype account more than a decade ago and have since moved to a different country. Yet Skype won't let me change my payment
 information - it keeps redirecting me to "Skype partner" in my "old" country. But I no longer have a bank account in my "old" country so I can't add credit to my Skype account via the "partner" website! What should I do?<strong> I cannot find any Skype Help/Customer
 Support details!</strong> I really don't want to lose my Skype ID and set up a new one but it seems like the only option at the moment...

<p>Hi Deanne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer is yes. You can delete a message in your class team:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/236900db-643e-4e7e-bf24-b29a7f0d32b6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/236900db-643e-4e7e-bf24-b29a7f0d32b6" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And then even delete a conversation. For more details, refer to this article:&nbsp;</p>

                    I clicked the arrow in the upper right hand of the toolbox, which flips it over. &nbsp;You are given a series of check boxes to remove sub-formatting palettes that you do not want to display, like "slide background." &nbsp;Well, all but three of the subpallets were
 removed. &nbsp;Now I can not reset the toolbox to its default settings.

<h2>            Windows 7 Thin PC&#58; running Windows 10 preview bricks Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>For kicks I installed Windows 7 Thin PC edition in a VM but did not activate it.
</p>
<p>I installed all updates and then ran the Windows 10 preview setup.</p>
<p>This bricked Windows Update - trying to check for updates says "Windows Update cannot currently check for updates, because the service is not running. You may need to restart your computer."</p>
<p>I tried restart, it looks like the service is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows update screen also now says "Find out about more software from (null)."</p>
<p>This could perhaps be a hint that the Insider setup bricked the WU config.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that either Windows 7 Thin PC SKU is not supported, or a system that has not been activated is not supported.
</p>
<p>No complaints there, really.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, expected behavior is a message saying this system is not supported.
</p>
<p>Bricking Windows Update is not expected, and should be considered a bug.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Possible Pause on Insider Builds Coming Soon &#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I would not be surprised at all if in the next several days Microsoft puts a temporary suspension to all Insider Builds after final Insider Build is released to insiders. The reason I am saying this Microsoft put a temporary suspension last year when Windows
 10 was released last July. Maybe the same thing will happen soon. Microsoft has announced the Insider Program will continue after August 2nd for the next phase scheduled for next year. If Microsoft does this I wonder how long the delay would be.

            Last year there was a pause in August and part of September. Insider program was temporarily suspended for almost two months. That is the reason I am speculating Microsoft might temporarily halt until new insiders until new test Redstone 2 builds are ready
 for insiders. I don't think it will be too long. A lot of older builds will stop working this weekend any how. A couple of the later builds will stop working on October 6 unless insiders upgrade to 14383 or 14385 or any newer builds this week.

            Actually, the pause will come when the Anniversary Update releases to manufacturing. &nbsp;Once it "ships" MS will not issue new builds because of a commitment to OEMs that they have the final build and can begin shipping product with the AU in time for the
 general public release on Aug 2nd. &nbsp;Further changes will be through Windows Update as ordinary updates. &nbsp;Preview builds will resume a few weeks after Aug 2nd when work begins on Redstone 2. &nbsp; The build range for rs_2 is unknown, but could be anything.

</p><p>Hi Ray</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has never been an intentional 'pause' between builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
The longest time between builds was 72 days which occurred between builds 9879 and 9926.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
The time between 10240 (RTM) and build 10525 was 34 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a table showing this history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The time between builds is variable and depends on many, many different teams and procedures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a pic of a table showing this history.</p>

<h3> paradoxes-111  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mailbox being moved</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello, for the past 5 days, I've been receiving error that my email is being moved and I should try again later. Although this is intermittent but for any given day within the past 5 days, I haven't
 been able to access my inbox for more than 15 mins at a time then it goes inaccessible for hours.</span></p>
<p>

</p><div>
<p>I understand that MS is migrating but this type of outage is unacceptable as it is impacting my work. For a day or 2 is fine, but going beyond 5 days and with no indication of when this migration will be completed is a very careless move toward the consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div>Is there any workaround or timelines as to when will this be fixed? My company's support opened a ticket with MS support but there hasn't been any response yet.</div>

<p />

            Hi WayneHenry3,<br /><br /> I'm a fellow Microsoft customer and expert user here to help. <br /><br /> Can you check if Skype has permission to use your camera on your computer?<br /><br />Click on Windows Start, then Settings. Under Privacy, select Camera on the left and then check if Skype has permission to use the camera.

<br />Go to Privacy - Camera
<br />
<br />Make sure 'Allow apps to access your canera' is turned on and make sure Skype is also set to On

            Hi WayneHenry3
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.

<br />Also down below Choose apps that can use your camera is ON for Skype 
<br />
<br />2. To isolate the issue, can you make call using Web Skype to see if issue is with Skype client
<br />
<br />Web Skype - <a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/</a> 
<br />
<br />3. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store

            <p>Hello Ravi Krishnan s:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the forum regarding error code 8007050A.&nbsp; From what I have found about this error, it is most often associated with an issue with the Windows update component.&nbsp; You will find multiple posts about this error in the Windows forum,
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/Search/Search?SearchTerm=8007050A&amp;CurrentScope.ForumName=Windows&amp;CurrentScope.Filter=&amp;askingquestion=False">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/Search/Search?SearchTerm=8007050A&amp;CurrentScope.ForumName=Windows&amp;CurrentScope.Filter=&amp;askingquestion=False</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that being said we will need to get more information from you regarding when you receive this error.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are you trying to do when you receive the error code?</li><li>What is the message that accompanies the error code?</li><li>Where exactly are you getting this error code, on the computer, in the Zune software, on the phone?</li><li>What is the make and model of phone you are using?</li><li>What operating system are you running on the computer you are using?</li></ul>
<p>In regards to the phone crashing when you attempt to take a photo.&nbsp; This may be an indication of a hardware issue but there are a couple things we would like you to try on the phone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perform a soft reset of the phone.&nbsp; This will simply clear out temporary files that could be causing some issues with phone performance.&nbsp; The best way to do this is to remove the battery from the phone for about a minute.&nbsp; Replace the battery and power
 the phone back on.</li><li>Look at the camera button for any small debris and remove any casing you may have on the phone. If there is no visible debris and the issue continues, clean the camera button area.</li><li>If you have a removable SD or SIM card in the phone try removing them and taking a picture, do you have the same experience?</li></ul>
<p>Please let us know if you have any additional questions or concerns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark W.</p>

<h2>            The new WINDOWS PHONE OS AND WINDOWS 8 is it control&#63;</h2>
                    <p>hi all</p>
<p>The way i see it, is that the previous older verions like 6.1 and 6.5 still gave the user full control over what they wanted in the way of apps and dare i say it "hacks" and by hacks i mean by doing so much more on your device like you would on a pc. Take
 the new windows phone 7.&nbsp;I had one when it first came out. HTC. Looked great bit buggy but after while i noticed i could not do some off the things id like too. ie -&nbsp;PS1 Emulator. In fact i couldnt do anything to explore the real potential of what my phone
 could do! I m ean u pay alot for&nbsp;a device thats got alot of spec to it and so you really want to see the potential of what it can do, but instead u cant! &nbsp;and thats my question. Is microsoft now designing this os based on people doing too much to the previous&nbsp;os,
 an in so by designing windows phone 7 along with windows 8. restricting the user from full usage. in other words u get what u get? dosen't seem fair if you ask me.

            <blockquote>Android is open source and is what im on now. Of course you would choose android as have i, for the simplicity of putting on what you want with ease.&nbsp;If i want a game or app that isnt on marketplace&nbsp;i go to a 3rd party website
 download apk file and enjoy. bang job done. Even you must agree on that one.&nbsp;But can you do that on windows phone. No you get what your given through buying apps. So no good if you go online to download a free app because it will not work.&nbsp;You can only purchase
 through marketplace. Id say windows has downgraded itself. why a new os when u can update with the new ui and files. think bout it. lol, not a hacker or nothing just dont like the idea of a control over my device. Sounds to me there trying to join&nbsp;into a market
 of users like the iphone or android. So still dosen't answer the question, is it control from microsoft?
</blockquote>
<p><br />
I think one of the main reasons Microsoft went with 'control' of apps through the Marketplace was the same reason Apple 'controls' apps through the iTunes store -- ensuring that the user experience is consistent and reliable.</p>
<p>Microsoft isn't quite as controlling (IMHO) as Apple as to what is permissible and what is not as an application for their platform, but the main goal is to:</p>
<p>a) prevent malware from using the phone in appropriate or damaging ways; and</p>
<p>b) ensure that users see the same and equivalent interface/experience from all the apps they purchase (or acquire).</p>
<p>I really appreciate the fact that if I see an app on the Marketplace, I can be assured that because of the way the O/S is designed, the application can't do 'weird' things to other parts of the phone or other apps.&nbsp; I also know that SOMEONE has run and tested
 the app to ensure it works, and does what it says it does.&nbsp; And, that it will work in the way I expect it to -- like all the other apps and the O/S interface itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've played in the WM6.x world and Android for many years. I guess I"m getting old, but I really want MY phone to be like an appliance -- always there, always working.</p>

            Are these disks that came with a computer that had Office installed at the factory?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Normally the Office install disks only install Office.&nbsp; The program to look for is SETUP.EXE.&nbsp; You can start it and see what it says will be installed, select the "customize" button to be able to control exactly what will be installed.&nbsp; If you see any indication
 Windows is also going to be installed, then you can cancel the installation BEFORE anything has actually started to install.<br />

            Thanks Rohn007 I'll try that.&nbsp; I have already used the discs on my PC and it worked fine, but I did want the Windows installed as well so I didn't need to fiddle with it.&nbsp; The discs were from a laptop which already had Office installed at the factory so
 they didn't come with a product key or anything.&nbsp; With Office 2003 I had a specific disc just for this, rather than it being incorporated into the Windows discs so I did wonder if I had lost the Office one at first, but i'm sure it's just incorporated. Thanks.

You have to have some form of Windows installed before you can install Office.<br />
<br />
If you have a combined "Windows + Office" installation disk it has to be the "recovery disk" provided by the computer builder.&nbsp; The included Office would be a trial for which you would have to buy a separate license. The builder would have provided you with
 some sort of proof of purchase for Office that includes the Office Product Key. Here are a couple of examples:<br />
<div>
<span>HP “MS Product Identifier Card” / Certificate of Authenticity:</span>
<p><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/kcs/document?docid=415387" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/kcs/document?docid=415387</span></a><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<br />
The Office license type must allow install on more than one computer (ie an OEM, factory installed and activated license CANNOT be transferred to a different computer). OEM is the only type that can be identified by looking at the generated Product ID.
<br />
<br />
In theory you could use that disk to install Windows and Office on a different computer, but you can expect problems. These are not generic installation disks, so they only have the drivers specific for the builder and general computer model. Those drivers
 may or may not work adequeately on different computers.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having the same issue. I have setup several domains on my domain, and whenever I try and verify them I get mixed behaviour. The three most common are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Activiation SMS arrives, I type it in, the website acknowledges it but no change to 'active'</p>
<p>2. I try and 're-send' the activation code, error message saying it's unavailable</p>
<p>3. I try and 're-send' the activation code, it never arrives</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is wrong with this service??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>So these are files in the windows file system? You can move them to a network file.
</p>
<p>If they are folders in a mailbox, you need to drag the message to a folder in the file system then copy it to the network.

<h3> shelby_j  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t bullet just one section ... Word inserts one bullet in front of the whole doc &#40;and indents the whole doc&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Word 2013 - Windows 8</p>
<p>Formatting a section with bullets affects the entire document - inserts one single bullet at top of doc and indents the entire doc, but does not create a bulleted list in the section that I highlighted.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>I paste copied&nbsp;text into a doc (selecting to use destination styles). </li><li>Then try to fix a bulleted section (due to formatting changes caused when pasting).
</li><li>I remove the dots and spaces that represent the old bullets, highlight/select the area, and click the bullet formatting icon. This inserts a bullet at the top of the doc before the first line of the first paragraph. It indents the entire document.
</li></ol>
<p>What Word options do I have to change to unattach the area that I want to bullet? Why does Word apply this action to the entire document when I am highlighting a single section?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have found this solution: </p>
<div>Go back to Format&gt;Style&gt;Normal and uncheck "Automatically update" and check "Add to template" so you store the change for future documents.</div>
<div>But, Word 2013 does not have this option to uncheck.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Thanks for any help!</div>

            The text you pasted in used <i>line feeds</i>&nbsp;instead of <i>carriage returns</i>&nbsp;for separating paragraphs. This should be evident if you tap
<i>Ctrl+Shift+8</i>&nbsp;to turn on the display of formatting marks. A line feed is noted as&nbsp;↵ and full carriage returns as ¶.
<div><br />
<div>A carriage return is two characters, ASCII 0×13 followed by 0×10. A line feed is a solitary 0×10.<br />
<div><br />
<div>You should be able to quickly change all line feeds to carriage returns with a
<i>Find &amp; Replace</i>&nbsp;looking for <i>^l</i>&nbsp;and replacing with <i>^p.</i></div>

            <p>In part, your problem is caused by the fact you're trying to override the format of the paragraph's underlying Style. At a guess, I'd say the paragraph has the 'Normal' Style applied, which would explain why you can't see the "Automatically update" attribute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should define and use an appropriate Bullet Style for all your bulleted paragraphs. That way, if you change your mind later on regarding how these paragraphs should look, it's a simple matter of changing the Style definition.</p>

<h3> karenindc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Web doesn&#39;t support updating CC exp date or CVV, &#38; finding Customer Service ph &#35; is like pulling teeth</h2>
                    <p><span>I find it incredulous that an alleged *software* company can't support the simple online task of&nbsp;updating basic&nbsp;subscription payment info. The credit card I use
 for my Office subscription is expiring. Got my new one from my bank. Went online and tried&nbsp;to update the expiration date and CVV (security code on back) for my MS Account/Office subscription. It's the same credit card acct, same number, same billing address.
 The only things different are a new expiration date (10/2019, not 10/2015)&nbsp;and new CVV.&nbsp;Your MS acct software wouldn't let me. I tried (1) updating just those two pieces of info. MS acct software wouldn't let me. I tried (2)&nbsp;adding a new form of payment with
 all info as if it were all&nbsp;new. The MS acct software wouldn't let me. I tried (3) to delete the previous payment info and add all info again. The MS acct software wouldn't let me. So I tried to contact Customer Service, getting stuck in a seemingly endless,
 vicious circle of searches (and I'm a professional researcher. Btw, Bing sucks!), *finally* locating an MS phone number for the US, calling it, waiting on hold, then talking with the person (who I'm sure is very nice in real life) who makes their living reading
 from a script. The canned "I'm sorries" irritate me to no end. He had to delete the payment info and start again adding my updated credit card info as if it were all new. The whole thing took 15 minutes on the phone and irritated me--probably more so because&nbsp;I'd
 just completed the same task&nbsp;online, updating the same billing info, for Netflix. So Netflix has better online and software functionality than Microsoft? What? Do they use Apple? I know I can't be the only person in the world who has experienced and been frustrated
 by this ridiculous, stupid,&nbsp;sucked-up-way-more-time-than-necessary&nbsp;problem with the MS website and account software. C'mon, Microsoft. Take one-millionth of the energy, staff, and money you spend marketing Windows 10 and direct it toward trying to keep and
 satisfy your existing customers by--now here's a novel idea--actually functioning the way you're supposed to.</span></p>

            <p>You can't do it there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since posting about that problem/frustration, I encountered a new, related one:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to change my Office 365 Home subscription from monthly to yearly and switch payment to a different CC. You can't do those things online either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deduced I could cancel/terminate my subscription, then repurchase, but with three licenses heavily used by my spouse running the business that is our livelihood, my kid away at college, and me, I didn't want to risk a glitch in service. I also didn't want
 to inadvertently be hit with hidden (surprise!) fees, penalties or problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While searching and searching online, a "Chat" window popped up. Yay! But guess what. It's not real. It's a fake Chat function. All it did (infuriatingly!) was send me back to the topic lists and pages I'd already searched, none of which provided info or
 functions for what I was trying to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I finally found a "Contact Support" phone number for *precisely* the change I wanted to make. I captured the info and set it aside; MS had eaten up enough of my time, energy, and tolerance for one day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previous calls had been frustrating, exasperating, annoying, and irritating, so I avoided going back to it like some people put off going to the dentist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, finally, I called. Guess what again. It wasn't the correct number at all. Of course, I didn't know that until 20 minutes of my life were eaten up waiting on hold; giving every tidbit of my info to a rep; he finally told me he couldn't help me; and
 he transfered me to "Billing." The rep did perform exactly the account change I was trying to make *but* only for commercial accounts. That wasn't specified in the info. Once again, I was confused and frustrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I languished on hold, the annoying MS promotional recording stoking my irritation for the next 10 minutes. Then a nice lady came on. She gracefully handled my request with aplomb, cancelling/terminating the subscription, repurchasing with the different CC,
 and even arranging credit back for the most recent charge on the previous CC. It took her a total of eight minutes to complete my transaction, and that was with time eaten up by me re-explaining my need; regurgitating what I'd been through (because she asked);
 re-giving her all my info; complaining about past experiences, frustration, and the lack of functionality of MS so-called "account management" functions; her puzzling over why the first rep hadn't given me a Case Number; her having to text me a verification
 code *twice;* and me fumbling for a phone number I should have had at the ready.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this and the ludicrousness that *is* Windows 10 has convinced me to spend the extra money and go Apple next time. MS doesn't seem to have a clue about how not to make me hate them.</p>

            Is there any chance you discovered any easy way to update an expired CC since this debacle?&nbsp; I'd really like to know, seeing as I'm facing the exact same problem right now....<br />

    <title>550 Administrative prohibition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> katestewart- &#91;o365&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            550 Administrative prohibition</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, we run a busy small law firm and every now and then we send out bulk emails with legal or policy updates. We sent these today and since then get an error message "550 Administrative prohibition" each time we send and email. We can't send emails, obviously
 this is crippling for our business and we have been attempting to fix the problem all day. We have uninstalled office 365 and reinstalled and now can't even set up outlook 2016 as we get the same error message in the Test Account Settings. Any help on how
 to solve this problem greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi KATESTEWART,</p>
<p>I need some information below to better understand your scenario:</p>
<p>1. Which Office 365 plan do you use, Office 365 Business, Office 365 Enterprise E3 or any other plan?</p>

    <title>Access query gives wrong result - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joestepansky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access query gives wrong result</h2>
                    <p>I'm running a simple query against a DB2 table using ODBC.&nbsp; But there's a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was retrieving all sorts of extraneous data, so I simplified the query so that I only&nbsp;pull records with an account&nbsp;code of say, "1234".&nbsp; That's it, there are no other criteria.&nbsp;
 The query does indeed return records with account code "1234".&nbsp; But it also pulls some records with account codes of "2345", "3456", etc. (these account numbers are fictitious).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why, when I&nbsp;clearly indicate the query should return records with an account code of "1234" does it return some of the others?&nbsp; I verified that the field is CHAR 4, so selecting "1234" should select only "1234" and nothing else.&nbsp;

            <p>Thank you Gina, and yes, it would have been nice.&nbsp; Rookie mistake.&nbsp; Actually, I've solved the problem (it always seems to be that way after posting for help).&nbsp; The problem was in the way I set up the table.&nbsp; When doing the ODBC link, Access asked me which
 field I wanted to use as a key field, so I selected the first one.&nbsp; After this issue it occurred to a couple of us...what if we don't select a key field at all?&nbsp; So I didn't.&nbsp; And that solved the problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's something, who knows what, in the field I selected as key that caused these issues.&nbsp; So the query was fine (it only selected one value for one field), but the link to the table was not fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply and next time I'll remember to be more specific.</p>
