<h2>            Is Spotify safe&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Recently, i encountered a tough malware. And it won't stop. </p>
<p>I reinstalled windows for like 5 times already.</p>
<p>But now its gone because I updated my windows to the anniversary update.</p>
<p>And before, even malwarebytes can't detect that ransomware.</p>
<p>It will just restart randomly and after the restart, the ransomware will fill the entire screen and i can't access task manager.</p>
<p>It also survives safe mode.</p>
<p>and i ran my Bitdefender rescue disk and its not detected<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now,</p>
<p>I'm really careful in what I am installing. So is spotify safe?</p>
<p>I read articles about spotify installing malware on their pc's.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW. I'm using WIndows 10 Pro 64 BIT</p>

</p><p>If you suspect malicious activity or malware (in any version of windows) use these tools from&nbsp;<strong>bleepingcomputer</strong>&nbsp;(they are relatively quick): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/</a>&nbsp;(the
 other two (2) suggested tools are on the bottom of that page), like rkill (1), jrt [junkware removal tool] (2), and adwcleaner (3) (run all of them, in that sequence)(i put them on the desktop, and run them from there)(as administrator (right click))(if they
 get hung (10 min) for any reason, close the running tool, go to the next tool, after trying them all, if any are unsuccessful, re-run them again (in sequence) in safe mode; &nbsp;also run Malwarebytes, while in safe mode during this process (if its definitions
 are updated), before adwcleaner. &nbsp;Uninstall adwcleaner, after running it and the system has rebooted, by opening the program, and choosing the uninstall button, or its quarantined files may set off your antivirus. The other tools from bleepingcomputer can
 be safely deleted, after running them; they are updated often, so the old versions are not necessary. After running the tools, if they found anything,&nbsp;<em>you need to reset&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;your browsers to default</em>, then check for any unfamiliar plugin/addins
 within the browser. then run malwarebytes &nbsp;again.<br />
</p>
<p>in a lot of instances, &nbsp;you have to remove the malicious activity one layer at a time, so you may not want to delete the tools after the first run.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/</a></p>
<p>uncheck the box at the end of the install for trial, or convert to free at the end of the trial.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Malwarebyes is a good addition to your antivirus software.&nbsp;<strong>Make sure in Malwarebytes the 'Scan for rootkits' box is checked-&gt; Settings-Detection and Protection</strong>. &nbsp;Free means manual, so, you have to open it, and run it occasionally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>geek uninstaller can help to uninstall programs that are unusual, it works on 32-bit and x64 programs (and it stays free)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geekuninstaller.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.geekuninstaller.com/download</a></p>
<p>only get the free version.</p>
<p>right click on the program in geek, will let you force uninstall, without running the apps native uninstaller (only use the force method, if the installed program is malicious, or will not uninstall normally).&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and frustration you have been through. I will be glad to assist you.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the troubleshooting steps you have performed to try to resolve the issue.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;When exactly do you get this error?<br />
2.&nbsp;Have you installed all pending Driver and Windows updates?<br />
3.&nbsp;Did you make any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>4. What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if there are issue with Graphic driver. If you have updated the Graphic driver, then you may try rolling back drivers to the previous one and uninstall the driver through Device Manager and let system install the compatible driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>•&nbsp;Open run command by pressing<strong> Windows key + R</strong> and type “<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong>” (without quotes) and hit<strong> Enter.</strong><br />
•&nbsp;Spot and expand the<strong> “Display Adapters”.</strong><br />
•&nbsp;Spot the driver and select <strong>“Uninstall”</strong> then restart the system and let the system install the driver automatically on Start. Check and see if it resolve the issue.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 library folders that won&#39;t die</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Windows 7 pro x64 to windows 10 pro x64 and I can not remove the Camera Roll and Saved Pictures folders permanently from the library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the camera app. I also completely disabled OneDrive and made it disappear.</p>

<p>All of MY applications pictures are saved in C:\Users\Public\Pictures so they can be easily shared on my local network. That is the way I set it up under windows 7 and that is the way it is under windows 10. I don't use the windows 10 camera "app" and in
 fact, I uninstalled it completely. I also disabled OneDrive and have no intention of using it either. I would very much like to remove these two folders or at least relocate them so they do not show up in my libraries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there ANY way to do this in windows 10, or is it so inflexible that we are forced to change all of our windows 7 disk structure after this "upgrade"?</p>

 a new hard drive.&nbsp; The fact that these folders keep showing up is maddening.<br />

<p>Go to&nbsp;<strong>Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps</strong> and turn off

            The photos app is not the culprit.&nbsp; I turned off all of my background apps in the privacy settings when I installed Windows 10 about 6-7 weeks ago.&nbsp; The CameraRoll and SavedPictures libraries continually resurrect themselves; sometimes daily, sometimes
 every few days.&nbsp; Someone turn this off please!&nbsp; It is a major nuisance.

            <p>Hey usjohns,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your frustration.</p>
<p>These two empty folders (not files) will continue to pop up in your <strong>Pictures</strong> folder until you delete them.</p>
<p>You will also find them in your <strong>Libraries</strong>.</p>
<p>You have two options - either disable the <strong>Camera</strong> and <strong>
Photos</strong> app or uninstall them completely.</p>
<p>Check out Sqrly's and Sharief K's useful replies above to get a better understanding.</p>
<p>If you continue to open pic files in <strong>Photos</strong> then the&nbsp;<strong>Saved Pictures</strong> folder will continue to be created. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I prefer to use good old <strong>Windows Picture Viewer</strong> to open pic files, right click on a JPEG and/or other type of pic file and<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Open With&gt;</strong> an option other than
<strong>Photos&nbsp;</strong>to open the file.</p>
<p>As Sqrly states, <strong>Windows</strong> updates will periodically reinstall/restart these apps so you will need to repeat the delete/disable process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had to do this once since last September, otherwise all good, no more hassles.</p>
<p>I guess that you, like me, use your PC to process photography or other graphics work and it is annoying to find these useless empty folders cluttering up your work space.</p>
<p>Many other photographers I know use a Mac so have their own problems but I need to use a
<strong>Windows</strong> box because I also deal with a lot of <strong>Word</strong> and
<strong>Excel</strong> files.</p>
<p>Don't get peed off, it is an easy fix.</p>
<p>All the best!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Devices provides five predefined locations for users and apps to store media files. Built-in apps store both user-created media and downloaded media in these locations.</p>

<p>I wonder when Microsoft will learn that some of it's users know what they are doing.&nbsp; Yes, it is good that Microsoft provide a program in Windows that guides beginners through various steps but some of us have been using PCs for many years, in my case from
 DOS 2.0.&nbsp; I know how to set up a PC and which folders I want and use.&nbsp; As someone who takes about 1,000 photographs a week using a DSLR camera I have set up my own work-flow folders and therefore do not need&nbsp;Camera Roll (my PC does not have a camera) nor Saved
 Pictures.</p>
<p>Is it beyond Microsoft's capabilities to prove us with a way of permanently deleting folders from the Library that we do not need, use or even want.</p>
<p>Come on Microsoft and show us that you listen to your users.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 not safe - netadaptercx.sys infected virus from microsoft direct , gathernetworkinfo.vbs  infected direct from microsoft</h2>
                    <p>i have had to install my system over 15 times now and fed up with it.</p>
<p>found out from last advisor that there was a virus. which is very strange as it was a clean install done by microsoft mediacreation tool.</p>
<p>a complete removal of all data and files. formatted everything</p>
<p>soon as it was downloaded it was checked using same software support used and it was a virus they said.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>this starts of with windows packages being infected and not working and gets worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i lost everything and had to redo work so many times now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>it is a joke.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>tried troubleshooter. tried dism trid sfc. tried rest tried refresh tried clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>each microsoft person tried to sell me azure. told me its a virus.</strong></p>
<p>now i just done a clean install and nothing else on system</p>
<p>run the autobat that they said showed virus.</p>
<p>had a very long conversation with each support person that only wanted to charge me money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>here is the bad news folks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>windows 10 is not stable as&nbsp;gathernetworkinfo.vbs is corrupt on download using mediacreationtool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>sorry but this is not good enough microsoft. stop having what should be technical support but what actually is sales to promote&nbsp;<strong>selling service agree or azzure.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>if windows 10 comes with this error it should be corrected by microsoft.</strong></p>
<p><strong>now i been looking at lots of technical&nbsp;forums&nbsp;and there must be thousands of people with same issue here.</strong></p>
<p><strong>and its simple why because the release of windows is corrupt.</strong></p>
<p>microsoft support chat......</p>
<p>Thanks for contacting Microsoft support, my name is Mariel N.<br />
13:08<br />
So glad to have you back!<br />
13:09<br />
Can you double check if the issue with still occur?<br />
13:09<br />
yes will try. we did try this with another advisor and only had video drivers loaded on main boot<br />
13:10<br />
It seems that the issue still occured so here's what we are going to do you can either Subscribe to our Subscription which is Assure Plan, &nbsp;It covers not only this issue but any future issues you may have with Windows, Office, Viruses and Malware … and also
 includes PC Tune-up services to ensure your system runs as efficiently and protected as possible; for one FULL YEAR you can contact Answer Desk to resolve any of these issues with the peace of mind that experts like myself that know your Microsoft products
 better than anyone will offer complete end-to-end support. Or we can do Inplace Upgrade this will refresh your Windows 10 and fix its corrupted files.&nbsp;<br />
13:11<br />
same error as expected. error is either unstable windows 10<br />
13:11<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">So which one you will choose?</span><br />
13:11<br />
already done a reset and a refresh and restore and a image restore and this is a clean boot. done it twelve times in two weeks. issue is there as soon as system is built.<br />
13:12<br />
Okay, thank you for letting me know.<strong>&nbsp;So let's go ahead to the Assure Plan?</strong><br />
13:12<br />
its unstable windows and thousands of users have same issue#<br />
13:12<br />
May I show you something?&nbsp;<br />
13:13<br />
<strong>i dont see why i would want to pay extra money just to get windows store working as it should as a standard part of windows.</strong><br />
13:13<br />
yes show me something if you like. remember this reinstall is write down to basics.<br />
13:14<br />
Okay, thank you!&nbsp;<br />
13:14<br />
remember its not as if i am cause of problem or if i don't have it knowledge its the product. ok what are you trying to show me???<br />
13:18<br />
You will be seeing a Yellow line here,&nbsp;<strong>meaning its a Virus that is causing you some Applications not working</strong>&nbsp;while the&nbsp;<strong>pink one was the infected one.</strong><br />
13:19<br />
i have the best anti virus and that is onedrive. i have not loaded anything onto onedrive new. has same files for a long time. symantec nortons virus is good and shown no erros. only time it was switched off was when microsoft advisor did it last time.<br />
13:21<br />
Then I highly suggest for you to do a full scan.<br />
13:21<br />
i do then regular and there was no virus. now last engineer switched virus and spam malware all off.<br />
13:22<br />
i only reinstalled this from your sight today. so i am now concerned that a member of microsoft has put a visrus on my system when they switched it off<br />
13:23<br />
which i will be writting to microsoft about.<br />
13:23<br />
Can you just check the yellow line please?<br />
13:24<br />
Let me just delete them for you.&nbsp;<br />
13:25<br />
ok but let me see what they are as i will still be writting to head office about last advisor that switched virus software off and access onedrive<br />
13:26<br />
Sure, no problem.<br />
13:26<br />
Its now deleted.&nbsp;<br />
13:27<br />
it was a microsoft file get package component<br />
13:27<br />
Yes, I believe so.<br />
13:28<br />
So let's do the In place Upgrade for you, it can fix corrupted files.<br />
13:28<br />
We will be re-installing Windows again.<br />
13:28<br />
so ned to check which advisors i been online with recently. so use other number that was not users out of two case numbers i gave<br />
13:29<br />
reinstall number 14 or 15 lost count<br />
13:29<br />
so if i got this and there are several other****** thousand users just from tech forums i looked at. it means they may of all got this from microsoft as all sat started in last two weeks<br />
13:31<br />
Okay, no problem. So here's what we are going to do for a resolution for this matter.&nbsp;<br />
13:32<br />
if it was not advisor but one of your updates then i may go back to win 8.1<br />
13:32<br />
ok continue<br />
13:33<br />
I will be downloading a Tool that can fix your system. This will fix your issue with your Windows Store.<br />
13:33<br />
ok<br />
13:33<br />
You will be just needing to wait until this one gets done. This might take awhile.<br />
13:33<br />
is it windows toubleshoot that is on microsoft site<br />
13:33<br />
No its not, I will take over and show you.<br />
13:34<br />
ok<br />
13:34<br />
i used that and created a iso and also used that to do fresh install a day two days maybe ago<br />
13:35<br />
This one is another tool.&nbsp;<br />
13:35<br />
There's a two option on here, we can do the In place (This one) or purchase the Assure Plan, that I am talking about.<br />
13:36<br />
<strong>but i will just get virus again as its coming from microsoft. so microsoft gives us a virus and then sells us a virus removal services. not really legal that</strong><br />
13:38<br />
No, I can assure you that once you have our Assure Plan it can covered anything.<br />
13:38<br />
why doesnt microsoft just remove the virus from there own systems. as microsoft is one spreading the virus. i will need to imform symantic about this and a formal report will go in<br />
13:39<br />
<strong>deliberaly giving users a virus is a capital crimje cyberhacking</strong><br />
13:40<br />
<strong>Mariel N is typing...</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Yes, that Is correct.</strong>&nbsp;You don't have to worry, I will be sending you an Email regarding on what we have done here, and incase you might have encountered big problem than this you can always contact me and my colleagues, we are so willing to
 help you out.<br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>i have&nbsp;<strong>norton symantec</strong>&nbsp;and of course files that have&nbsp;<strong>correct hash tag and system files from microsoft are expected to be ok.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>gathernetworkinfo.vbs</strong></span> which is stalled by mediacreation tool done by microsoft staff. is the virus and affected file which goes on and affects rest of system over time.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>so microsoft is in fact put out a build that has a virus in it.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>so no recall of software</strong>&nbsp;or removal but&nbsp;<strong>just sell us anti virus software</strong>&nbsp;after&nbsp;<strong>giving us infected files</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>yes if i pay i get windows that would have viruses removed otherwise i pay for windows and then need to pay again to have viruses removed but each time a update happens i stand the chance of microsoft giving us another virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>----------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>the big issue is all our data , bio info , everything is no longer secure. so banks card anything online using windows 10 is not secure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>medical info not secure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it affects everyone that has used mediacreation tool from microsoft to reinstall windows 10. which will be everyone due to all win 10 bugs we had since it first came out and then anniversary issue and then more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also infected&nbsp;netadaptercx.sys ,<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>gathernetworkinfo.vbs</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Sorry you and the Microsoft Staff seem to have a language issue though it appears to be mostly on their end.<br />
<br />
The only way the Windows Media Creation Tool created iso could have a virus is if you had one already on the system that you ran it on. And a clean install does, even removal of partitions and formatting, does not remove all possible malware that may already
 be on the computer. i.e. Rootkits and other malware can survive a format.<br />
<br />
Added that all antivirus products can alert false positives if that is where your virus ideas came from.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
If the Media Creation Tool did have a virus in it then hundreds of millions would have the same problem you are having.<br />
<br />
Possibly your system just can not reliably run Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

<p>as microsoft support staff. all three of them wanted me to pay to get this resolved.
<strong>they were pushing for me to take out their plan and that was only way i was going to get this issue resolved according to them.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>however i would just end up paying money for nothing as this is a issue microsoft need to address as it appears that certain apps that say [get] and not [install] will not download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>however if you create a new user and then try it. it will work maybe just once , maybe two or three times</p>
<p>
</p><p>but always in the end you go back to the same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can test the theory by creating more local users and trying the same apps. sometimes they download and other times they will not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it seems to be once you do download a [get] app it corrupts the user profile so that you can no longer download apps that say [get] and not [install]</p>
<p>install works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>this issue can be found in many tech forums as stated. just google the error message and see.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>what i am angry at is the fact that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>microsoft keep pushing for sales of their maintenance &nbsp;and care plans</strong></span> instead of
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>i have a relatively new rig and its most definitely compatible and will run windows 10 fine - that is windows 10 components that work normally.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Yes i am aware of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">However it is rather concerning</span> that one of the biggest companies known can not actually get fully
online <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">technical</span> support.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It was not as if i contacted general support and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
9 out of 10 times get a basic office worker -</span></p>
<p>who has a question and answer sheet and a flow chart to follow on what to do.</p>
<p>They get basic training only of dos commands., Some windows system commands - just the standard commands used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There question and answer sheet can be rather difficult <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
for some of the microsoft support staff</span> i spoken too over the last couple years.
<strong>&nbsp;I have noticed that some of them just follow the standard chart but don't actually know what they are actually doing with these commands. I had&nbsp;spoken&nbsp;with a few and wh asked some questions about&nbsp;the&nbsp;command&nbsp;they were running thy&nbsp;were&nbsp;not&nbsp;able to&nbsp;actually
 tell me anything about it and did not even know that&nbsp;there&nbsp;were other options the command had available.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I even was unfortunate enough to allow remote&nbsp;access&nbsp;to my PC when i had a issue. The support person disabled all my anti virus software and then went straight on the internet.&nbsp;did not&nbsp;go direct to a safe microsoft site but had clicked on some other sites
 which were not sites that were of any technical value at all.</p>
<p>my pc was basically used for a short time to browse&nbsp;certain&nbsp;websites&nbsp;with no anti virus software active.<br />
</p>
<p>Then they&nbsp;proceeded&nbsp;to look at root&nbsp;drive of&nbsp;SSD C:\</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>they just deleted files i had stored in root</strong></span> that were
<strong>profiles</strong> and <strong>bios backups</strong> and <strong>saved bios setting</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus Avatar Pictures and other images that were use for BOOT login - just like a company can alter the UEFI or BIos so that it boots up and instead of displaying just motherboard name it displays dealers namne - such as overclockers.uk .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen them stumble around running the exact same SFC , DISM routines BUT sometimes forgetting the full command and typing it wrong and neing to look up help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My point is some of their online support staff really should not be working there in just my personal opinion based on personal observations only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yes you are correct <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">they may make a statement and yes it may be false</span>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>its just i had three different advisors over two days all do the same routine to me.</strong></p>
<p>All made same claim and all stated i needed to take out there support paid for package.</p>
<p>Basic sales only, not trained in support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I really hope microsoft stop using basic call center routines for support</p>
<p>and actually use well trained and experienced staff.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BUT as it stand we only actually get well trained staff if we pay for support.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>otherwise free support is pot luck and you can end up worse off before you contacted them.</p>
<p>worse case scenario - my pc was in hands of microsoft support. who were working away. i came back from making a coffee to find microsoft support person telling me pc needs to reboot and then they would continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PC rebooted and it would not restart.</p>
<p>checked bios/uefi settings. booted using repair disc but could not do startup repair , could not do previous build restore , could not do a refresh and could not even do a reset.</p>
<p>Could not even access system restore options or system images. which were stored on 3 drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>i had to reinstall my windows 8.1 pro 64 bit from original dvd. start from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not first time PC's Plural as have 3 in house that i am working on as a ex- hardware/software engineer - retired many years. 8086,,iAPX 86<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;286 386485 pentium 5. &nbsp;(mainframe , Lans ETC. ( software first program made at age 12 published in
 a pc magazine) my claim to fame lol. would of hoped for more in life than that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So i hope , i really do hope microsoft staff stop doing the basic must sell support packages two types of support.</p>
<p>and that microsoft have better trained staff on hand. we purchased there product we expect support when it is a fault in microsoft and not something we did wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>basic normal support when a product is sold and has bugs/faults hidden in its depths. lets face it microsoft has had a few whoppers of bugs over the years - BUT it is a lot of code to go through and it is not possible to give a early release and check all
 thinkable possibilities where issues could occur</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence why they used millions of users when they gave the free release of windows 10 - as there were issues all the way through from day 1 to end of fre sale.
<p>
</p><p>But there are still many faults in the system. So we should still get free support. system bug is not of our making but the manufacturers issue to resolve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>So i plead to you microsoft</strong> look at all the other technical forums look at all the similar issues. Please get trained staff on support and not keep trying to sell us support every time we find a bug and need help.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Also some support staff seem to think it's ok to reset everything and make as loose a lot of data. just&nbsp;too&nbsp;quick to jump on reset or reinstall &nbsp;,</strong><strong>if we don't accept pay for support.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I am not really happy with the support paid for that i was offered by one plus others &nbsp;of your staff.

</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>A virtual replica of my pc. Under the care of trained technical support staff (?maybe)</strong></p>

<h2>            Freezing during a movie always</h2>
                    So I recently updated to windows 10 and have all the same files I had during my time on windows 7, I've watched movies I have on my hard drive always and had no problems. But now since I updated I've only been able to watch 5 minutes of anything as my
 computer locks up, I am using the tv&amp;movie app only and it's the only thing that causes this lock up&nbsp;

            Not quite but very similar. For me the Movie and TV App freezes intermittently. It's never consistent as to time but it happens several times in a two hour movie. The only thing I've found to correct it is to back the movie up several seconds and start
 again.&nbsp;

            Yes, as I stated earlier it is not consistent but occurs five or six times during the play of a two hour movie. The audio continues unabated but the video freezes.&nbsp;

            I am having similar issue except the problem is not limited to Movies and TV app. It happens with all my apps including Netflix and Edge browser. It's also happening on my 2 computers, a Toshiba Encore Write 2 (atom z3735)&nbsp;and an HP EnxyX2 with CoreM.&nbsp;The
 videos freeze but audio continues. The only way to get decent results on the HP is to maximize performance in power settings, but that's not good for battery. The Toshiba has no power settings to maximize (don't know why atom processor cannot be altered).
 Am I missing something?

<h2>            Activation of Windows 10 fails  Error code &#58; 0x8007007B.</h2>
                    <div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p>I have bought an used and wiped laptop from my work. I had a small PC shop help me install Windows it. He installed Windows 10 but shortly after I was prompted that my license was running out. So I revisited the shop where the owner did something at it was
 running fine for a while until the same message reappeared. I realized that I had been given a trial edition of Windows 10 so I purchased a genuine version from an Internet shop and installed it. 10. But after some months I suddenly get the message that I
 need to activate Windows. When I go to settings and try to trouble shoot I get following message: We can't activate Windows on this device as we can't connect to your organization's activation server. Make sure you're connected to your organization's network
 and try again. If you continue having problems with activation, contact your organizations support person. Error code : 0x8007007B.</p>
<p>I have tried to re-enter the key but with no result.</p>
<p>Does anybody know what to do about it?</p>

            Hi Anja,
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to System - About 
<br />
<br />Whet version of Windows 10 is reported there, is it Pro or Enterprise? 
<br />
<br />Then in the Settings App, go to Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />Does Activation report that 'Windows is activated using your Organisation's Activation server'?       
        </p>

            Hello, 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />&gt;I realized that I had been given a trial edition of Windows 10 so I purchased a genuine version from an Internet shop and installed it. 
<br />Which website and which edition?
<br />
<br />
<br />To better diagnose the issue,
<br />Right click Start&gt;Command Prompt-Admin and type in the following command:
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />If you have Powershell instead of Command Prompt Run these in order:
<br />cmd.exe
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />You will get a window, take a screenshot using snipping tool and paste it it next reply.
<br />How to get a screenshot and post back:

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says: Windows 10 Home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;And at activation I get this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Windows has been working for a couple of months and suddenly I get above message. Nothing else has changed - no new programs or apps......</p>
<p>
</p><p>My husbonds laptop has exactly the same problem. His laptop has also been bought from my work and I bought the two Product keys at the same time from www.pcmac.dk</p>

            Hi Anja,
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small utility which will find your Windows 10 Product Key 
<br />
<br /><a href="http://neosmart.net/OemKey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/OemKey/</a> 
<br />
<br />Go to Settings - Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />Try entering that product key there to activate Windows 
<br />
<br />Otherwise, contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Choose a local Phone Number: 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If the above fails, it may be a problem with he website you purchased the product keys from, www.pcmac.dk are selling Windows 10 Home for 365,00 DKK which equates to 58.61 US Dollars, which seems extremely cheap and those product keys might not be legitimate . . .

<h2>            ALERT&#33; NEVER give your phone number to Microsoft</h2>
                    <p>I set up/repair computers, and ive NEVER seen anything like the recent tide of SCAMMERS calling my clients, I CANT BELIEVE IT</p>
<p>the<strong> only common denominator,</strong> they all bought computers with windows 8.1 and they all gave Microsoft their phone number during setup, during the two step authentication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well <strong>it looks like Microsoft is not keeping peoples phone numbers secure</strong> because, SCAMMERS are calling people and tricking them into buying things they dont need or giving their credit card number, and somehow they usually know what brand
 of computer people have, they will say they are calling from dell for example if the person has a dell computer, others just say they are calling from Windows or calling from Microsoft</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never trust anyone that says they are calling from microsoft, dell, hp, toshiba etc , they are probably SCAMMERS</p>
<p><strong>and never give your number to Microsoft!</strong></p>
<p><strong>i guess Microsoft NEEDS TO STOP requiring peoples phone numbers for setup if this is going to be such a security problem</strong>!!</p>

            <p>You can't blame Microsoft for this one.&nbsp; But you are right, the information is getting out somehow.&nbsp; I don't do large scale outside work on computers, running an IT dept and working on friends and family systems are annoying enough, but I've heard a lot
 about this too.&nbsp; One of them was from my grandma who had someone identifying themself as a MS employee telling her that he needed remote access to her computer (even knew the type and OS) to fix a "problem."&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went over my grandparents network settings and security, computer, their phones, and even the internet tv box with a fine tooth comb looking for viruses, mis-set security (my cousin set it up so I was digging deep to find some sort of problem with it to
 rag him about,)&nbsp; and even illegal hook-in's on their cable and telephone lines (someone may of been stealing their cable, for all I knew.)&nbsp; I came up with squat.&nbsp; And I hear about it a lot from my people at work, people who work in other departments, and even
 from the IT people in another companies plant (we borrow network cables, connectors, and other items from each other regularly) across the street that know people that have gotten these phone calls.&nbsp; So something is going on and this needs to be addressed.&nbsp;
 So far, all the stories have been using names commonly known by the public, and so far, none have used company names that only people who commonly work with computers, networks, and other insiders jobs know about.</p>

            <p>It really is strange, the day i started this post, it had happened to yet another person, an older Vietnam vet, he called me and told me he had made a terrible mistake, talking to someone he originally believed was from Dell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He was freaked out and wanted me to come make sure his computer was ok. All the other times ive looked at a machine after the "imposter phone calls" i've found NOTHING. After a through and exhaustive search, this was the first time i found anything at all</p>
<p>
</p><p>i found something called Dell Wyse Pocketcloud had been installed, a browser window was still open with a download page for dell wyse pocketcloud
<a href="https://appservices.wyse.com/pages/serviceandsupport/support/dlOraFW.asp?which=106&amp;model=Dell%20Wyse%20PocketCloud%28Software%20Downloads%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
(here)</a> its some kind of remote desktop software, i also found something called teamviewer had been downloaded, but not installed, its remote desktop software as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that was all, nothing else, no browser hijackers, no rootkits, no strange services or startup entries, no spyware or malware, no adware no host file hijack, no firewall hijack, nothing else, none of my scans found anything malicious whatsoever including
 pocketcloud and teamviewer</p>
<p>
</p><p>my best guess is the Scammer was trying to remote control the computer, to what end i don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree something strange is definitely going on, and People need to be aware that this is happening so they don't fall victim, in the mean time, we should all do our best to figure out how these scammers are getting peoples phone numbers and such detailed
 information about peoples computers to begin with, i know you don't think its Microsoft, and maybe its not, but i really think this all started around windows 8.1<br />

 &nbsp;2 security firms that made a run on my companies network did just that last year and tore our system up in tests. &nbsp;They bribed one of my techs for a "low" level access account and used it to breach multiple layers of security. &nbsp;( I admit that I wanted to
 kill the guy instead of firing him) &nbsp;And the HP one used to not require a user to give permission to run it. &nbsp;I may be getting paranoid on this, but it is a possibility. &nbsp;Get a list of consumers and their information of the specific product, get a list of
 locations where they are, do a little data mining, and the result would be a informed "tech" that wants to help you. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>No, don't blame Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that anywhere you buy anything computer related, they ask for your phone if there are issue with the order.&nbsp; And once it's out, the scammers come out of the woodwork.&nbsp; I have gotten several, selling everything from "add on services" to "protection
 from malware" and even some claiming to be from Microsoft tech support.&nbsp; So I have a bit of fun.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I either do my best "gay Indian" voice (they seem to all be foreign accents) and then get the caller really P.O.'d at me.&nbsp; Or if I want them off for good, tell them they just called a tracked number and that the FBI has their location.&nbsp; Before I get to "location"
 they hang up.&nbsp; Hell, might as well dork with them!</p>

<p>
</p><p>And you are right, 8.1 isn't fully involved as the scam has been around for awhile. &nbsp;I remember hearing about it during the Win Vista days, but I never knew anyone who's gotten hit with it. &nbsp;And judging by talks in other places, it's exploding in numbers.
 &nbsp;But what else is new? &nbsp;A lot of scams also have been exploding as well. &nbsp;I'm getting to the point where I want to demand common sense classes to be mandatory in school due to the levels of absurdity some scams take on. &nbsp;When people become easy targets, there
 are always scammers ready to take aim at them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to electronic spam gatherers, I go to extremes to spoof them because I'm not someone who likes to have their time wasted dealing with them. &nbsp;My phone number I give to friends is one that goes to a blanked (no info) out VIOP number that then redirects
 it to my cell or home number (did the same with my wife. &nbsp;Except for specific info, my public email accounts have changes (security on them extremely sucks) &nbsp;enough to deter or invalidate most miners. &nbsp;And I set up the company email server and directory to
 have minimum information on the users. &nbsp;A little extreme, but it's works (for the most part.)</p>

            it's called ADAD / ADA <br />
Automatic Dialing Anouncing Device / Automatic Dialing Application<br />
<br />
the scammers obtain a physical device or computer program / application,&nbsp; <br />
<br />
and they&nbsp; punch in the range to dial, <br />
thus you get people who own macs only and have never owned a windows device getting calls,
<br />
<br />
look up scam caller on youtube to watch a range of people who have recorded the interactions with scammers.
<br />
<br />
once they do have a valid number it gets passed around to the whole scammer community and they try all sorts of tactics,
<br />
eg.<br />
they will say they are from the IRS (US) CRA (Canada), Dell, HP, Acer, MS, etc. <br />
<br />
what the scammers want depends on which scammer is calling, <br />
they may want to just cost you a bunch of money to pay for non existant repairs,<br />
or install malware, etc.<br />
<br />
eg.<br />
they will have you open the event viewer and have you freak out about the long list of errors that appear and blame the errors on virus etc. and try to sell you some sort of support / maintenance package. (Thanks bill for pushing to have "a PC in every home"
 without the necessary training on how to operate it safely)<br />
<br />
That's how NT-Windows operates, <br />
the long list of errors is just that,<br />
items that are logged as errors,<br />
it's normal to see errors and warnings in the event logs, <br />
the fewer the better, <br />
but there is no system in operation that doesn't ever have errors / warnings in the event log.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f67fa8a7-45e6-4fbc-8d97-464f5beb38ce" /><br />

            <p>That is basically what I've been hearing, both from my grandma and from stories that others in my department and around me. &nbsp;The are asked to open the even viewer, then they are told on the phone that the errors and warnings are extremely critical and need
 to be fixed. &nbsp;In my grandmother's care, it was the Bonjour.exe(?) that got her to freak out. &nbsp;Now I regret giving her the ipod and installing itunes on her system. &nbsp;But that was me being lazy because I didn't think she would need to have the call-answer/warning
 explained to her for her Apple products. &nbsp;So I ended up playing catch-up to go further into depth then a normal computer user would have to know to try to keep the scams at bay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But thanks for the information. &nbsp;I never really paid attention to outside security as I usually focus on internal matters in my IT department. &nbsp;Outside security is usually handled by our corporate level IT department with contractors. &nbsp;So I guess I should
 get ready to expand my knowledge again.</p>

    <title>New Skype&#58; Cannot make fine adjustments to webcam settings&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ian g3nrw  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Skype&#58; Cannot make fine adjustments to webcam settings&#58; dim picture and bad flicker</h2>
                    <p>My wife acquired a new PC this Christmas, complete with&nbsp;New Skype. Problem is, as far as I can tell, New Skype doesn't let you
<br />
make fine adjustments to the webcam settings as old Skype used to.<br />
<br />
In particular, I need to adjust the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">anti-flicker setting</span>, since the default New Skype setting seems to be set to 60 Hz, whereas I am located in a 50 Hz country.<br />
<br />
The only solution I have found so far is to install the old version 7.41.0.101 of Skype over New Skype. Then I can make all the fine adjustments necessary to the webcam,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">including removing the flicker</span>.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Bottom line</strong></span>: By default, the New Skype setting for the webcam produces a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>dim </strong></span>picture that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>flickers badly</strong></span>. This is totally unacceptable (and unusable). I will continue to use Skype 7.41.0.101 until New Skype lets me make the same the same webcam adjustments.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>I do not want to be forced to "upgrade" to New Skype until this is fixed.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Ian.</p>

<p><strong>@ Ruwim.B</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. My next steps ( with questions) were:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I re-installed New Skype. It said it would be the latest version, so I assumed (hoped) it would include your "Webcam Settings" button feature. But no it didn't, so it obviously<em>
<p>
</p><p>***** <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>QUESTION 1: When running New Skype, how do I find out which version it is? I don't see an "About" button.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I then installed and ran your private version 8.36.0.52. This time the "Webcam Settings" button did appear as in your picture. I could make the settings adjustments as required, including removing the 10 Hz image flutter (by switching from 60 Hz power
 to 50 Hz).&nbsp; Perfect ... or so I thought. Problem then arose when I closed and subsequently re-started Skype: the modified webcam image appeared exactly as expected, but the "Webcam Settings" button had disappeared! (The only way I could recover the button
 was to run&nbsp;8.36.0.52 again).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>***** QUESTION 2: Is it intended for the "Webcam Settings" button to be permanently included in a later version of New Skype?</strong></p>

            Hi Nicholas, 
<br />
<br />I'm Evett an Independent Adviser, willing to assist you with your issue.
<br />
<br />It might be caused by your Xbox account. Check if you can play the full version of Minecraft.
<br />1. Start the Xbox app <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox/9wzdncrfjbd8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox/9wzdncrf...</a>
<br />Use your Microsoft Account (the same you used to purchase Minecraft) to sign-in to the Xbox application
<br />2. Find Minecraft and press the Play button to play Minecraft and check if it is still the trial version.
<br />If the problem is not solved check How to uninstall and reinstall a game on Windows 10 and reinstall Minecraft <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/how-to-uninstall-reinstall-game-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup...</a>

<p>Why everytime someone joins my game they have no interest and sticking with me and my friend and run off and get killed over and over again. &nbsp;Also no one is ever down to explore they just want to rush from one thing to the next its crazy frustrating.</p>

<p>@Chicken. Absolutely it's better playing with friends than with randoms. If fistful used his real GT, he could meet new friends. I would have gamed with him if everything had checked out.</p>

<p>I'd really appreciate help with this game. &nbsp;I missed I when it came out and only bought it a few weeks ago. Played for the first time last night through realistic difficulty. Game was so good I beat it in one sitting, can't remember the last game I did that
 with. &nbsp;So some bel with all the co-op stuff would be greatly appreciated. I can play, for the most part, 10am-11pm Monday - Friday EST. Just shoot me a message with what works best for you.

<p>Hi Hellhog... I am currently playing Double Agent and I was wondering if you could help me (some hints would already do, your help online and playing with me would be fantastic - but I don't push it *lol*).</p>
<p>So, my problem is I am stuck at 95% overall and I can't find what I am missing to raise stealth and gadgets for the spy and direct action for the upsilon. I have seen you have completed the game and if you still remember what you did to achieve commander,
 I am all ears.</p>
<p>I still didn't start with the coop mission for the gold medals (I am playing the game with a friend and both we are trying to get commander first), but if you will ever want to join us and help it would also be great.</p>
<p>I really hope to hear from you because we are pretty frustrated...</p>

<p>Ok, problem with the Commander achievements solved. Now, I am still looking for a 3rd player who would like to join me and my friend to hit the coop missions and get the gold medals.</p>
<p>Send me a message/add me if you are interested. We are online everyday.</p>

<p>Yes.&nbsp; Disable swipe from the edge.&nbsp; Or otherwise find out how to disable your Touchpad from trying to emulate Touch screen functionality.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even better get a real mouse and disable your Touchpad completely until you want it to just experiment using its Touch
 screen emulation.</p>

            Took a while to find the touch pad settings as there is no desktop as I am use too.&nbsp; Still think Microsoft should have stopped at XP Pro.&nbsp; While I could not disable the edge swipes, I was able to shrink them down considerably so they weren't being activated
 all the time.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.&nbsp;

<h2>            pc 1993 cdROM game</h2>
                    <p>trying to run an old CD ROM game from 1994 - "EMPIRE DELUXE" by NEW WORLD COMPUTING, INC, on my Windows 8 PC. i've already tried some of the advice from old postings here, but no success - mostly had to do with right-click on game tab, then click Properties,
 then click Compatability tab &amp; then follow instructions from there. unfortunately nothing has worked so far. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All i get on every try is - &nbsp;"this app cannot run on your PC," " to find a version for your PC check with the Software Publisher".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas are appreciated!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what you are setting the compatibility of, but you might try the actual .EXE file or SETUP, depending on whether the game installs on the machine, or just runs...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also try checking the "Run As Administrator" box...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is entirely possible that the game can not be made to run...</p>
<p>I believe that Windows 8 no longer supports 16bit applications...</p>
<p>If the game is 16bit, you may be out of luck...</p>

    <title>I never got my Predator avatar. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thatmovieguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            I never got my Predator avatar.</h2>
                    Hello, I was wondering if someone here can help me out. I was just talking to another customer service agent and they directed me here. I got the new Predator movie added to my library via Movies Anywhere before January 3 when the promo ended. I never
 received anything and I guess it should've been sent by January 10th apparently. I tried checking my messages from Xbox live and all that comes up is "This is a system account When you get another message, you'll see it here."

            Normally you get them via system messages. If there is no message you should check your mail. Sometimes you get the reward on that way. Check the spam folder aswell. If you dont See it there either you could try the support team if they could help you.&nbsp;

<h2>            Surface pro 3 replacement screen</h2>
                    I am thinking of buying a used surface pro 3 with a cracked digitizer screen. sense I have not purchased it yet I don't have a serial number and cannot get ahold of Microsoft. I was wondering if anyone knew how much it would cost to get this screen replaced?
 this way I can decide weather or not I should send it in to Microsoft or replace the screen myself. thank you for all the support and please ignore my bad spelling.

            <p>Don't get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp; These machines are classed as "non-repairable" and no replacement parts are available for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find brand new, after market Surface Pro 3's for less than $600 US (I bought one myself last week through walmart.com).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That machine with the broken screen could also have other issues wrong with it and not just the screen itself.</p>

<h2>            Nie mogę połączyć sie z internetem , i xbox live.</h2>
                    
<p>Witam , wczoraj mogłem sie logować na xbox live i grać w gry online i gdy dziś rano chciałem sie zalogować wyskoczył mi komunikat że nie można połączyć sie z internetem i przeszedłem do menu gdzie mogłem przetestować połączenie. Więc xbox wykrywa połączenie
 z routerem , ale za to nie chce połączyć sie z internetem jak i z xbox live , wyskoczyła mi podpowiedź : ''Błąd MTU , Odłącz zasilanie routera lub modemu na 30 sekund i podłącz ponownie zasilanie i poczekaj następne 30 sekund'' .Więc zrobiłem jak mi podpowiadał
 xbox i nic to nie pomogło , odłączałem router i modem na te 30 s , oglądałem tutoriale jak naprawić ten problem na youtube , i zmieniałem także ustawienia tego mtu na stronie&nbsp; konfiguracji mojego routera Tp-Link TL-WR740N . Oczywiście nic to nie pomogło i
 chce sie zapytać czy znacie rozwiązanie czy to tylko np problem z serwerem micro$oftu i czy wy też macie ten problem.</p>

<p>Jeśli wcześniej wszystko było ok i nic nie zmieniałeś w ustawieniach a poradniki nie pomogły, to prawdopodobnie serwery ms miały jakąś awarię. Natomiast co do gry online to potrzebny jest Gold.</p>

<p>Dostawca internetu może sztucznie obniżyć MTU po swojej stronie, aby sprawniej obsługiwać dużą ilość klientów. Normalnie taka zmiana jest praktycznie niezauważalna, no ale Microsoft wymaga swoje.</p>
