<p>Hello, LostProdigy422</p>
<p>Since you are using the Wifi at a public place, there may be firewall blocking incoming and outgoing connections to Xbox Live. You will have to ask the network administrator at the hotel to open some ports to your internet connection.</p>
<p>Ask the network administrator to open -</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>On Xbox 360:</strong></span></p>
<p>Port 3074 and set the protocol to Both</p>
<p>Port 53 and set the protocol to Both.</p>
<p>Port 80 and set the protocol to TCP</p>
<p>Port 88 and set the protocol to UDP</p>

<p>Most hotels require you to sign in on a special welcome webpage before they unlock you for full web access. Maybe they ask for your room number or something else to prevent non-guests from using the WLAN.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the previous post is of no use to you, as you won't be able to edit the hotel's settings to forward the proper ports.
<br />
<br />
Depending on how the hotel WLAN operates, one possible solution would be this: Find out the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MAC hardware address</a> of your computer's network card.
<br />
You do this on a Windows PC by pressing Windowskey + R, then typing "ncpa.cpl", and clicking on OK.<br />
<br />
This will open up a window with your PCs network interfaces. Right click on your WLAN adapter and choose "Status". Click on the "Details" button and you should see a list with information about your WLAN hardware.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Find the Line labeled as "Physical Address", which should have six pairs of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
hexadecimal</a> numbers. They usually look like this: 01-2A-C3-EF-6B-54 <br />
<br />
Make a note of this MAC address. <br />
<br />
Now on your PC properly connect to the hotel WLAN, and make sure you can access the internet properly.
<br />
<br />
After your internet connection works, turn off the PC and turn on the Xbox. <br />
<br />
On the console go all the way to the right to the settings hub, and there to the system tile in the upper left. Go to the network settings and try to connect to the WLAN. Then go to the network configuration, and go right to the additional network settings.
<br />
<br />
There you get the options to set PPPoE usernames and the likes. <br />
<br />
What you need to set is to clone your PC's MAC address to the Xbox. There is an option to customize the WLAN Mac address of the console.<br />
<br />
Input the MAC address you copied from your PC into the console, and test the network connection.<br />
<br />
However: Some hotels block any network traffic that is not HTTP (website) or Email related. If that is the case, you won't be able to use the Xbox console online in that hotel.</p>

<p>Same here. I can Web browse, watch Netflix but no gaming. I called the help desk for my hotel and they told me they could not help in opening the ports. Is there anyway to pass the firewall that is blocking the ports or am I just *** for the next month?</p>

<p>As I said above, some Hotels block all other Ports besides those necessary for Web surfing and email. So, if Multiplayer won't work at all, you're (as you would say with the word filter) *****. :(</p>

<p>Well I have found a solution for those who cant get the hotels to unblock the ports. VPN. Pick your favorite VPN software(I used openvpn which is $12 for 50GB). Connect your Xbox One via ethernet to your laptop/PC. Then go to the adapter settings on your
 computer and the VPN software should have created its own virtual interface. Right click the interface and go to properties then the sharing tab. Check the first box where is says "Allow other network users to connect through this computer internet connections".
 And change the drop down box to the ethernet interface where the Xbox is connect through. Make sure your computer is connected to the Hotel Wi-fi and the VPN is connected to a server close to you in location. You might have to restart your Xbox but you should
 be good to go after that. Happy Gaming!!!</p>

<p>I could connect in a courtyard by marriott following ArminatorX's direction. &nbsp;Awesome instructions. &nbsp;Follow the direction exactly and write down all the laptop information.</p>
<p>I connected to the hotel wifi using my laptop. &nbsp;Then used all the information from the laptop and cloned it to the xbox 360. &nbsp;Clone from the laptop: &nbsp;MAC address, IPv4 address as xbox IP address, &nbsp;IPv4 subnet, and default gateway. &nbsp;Now I can get on xbox
 live and play multiplayer.</p>

<h2>            Public access protection in Windows 10</h2>
                    I have a classroom with 10 computers all updated to Windows 10. I have always depended on Horizon Data Systems (Rollback, Drive Vaccine, etc.) to return the system to a standard configuration upon restarting the system. This is the same protection public
 access systems, such as libraries use. There apparently sufficient changes to Win 10 to render these programs incompatible. Is there any alternative besides reverting back to Windows 7?

2. I have **** PC (no OS), which version of windows 8 should i buy?fpp or oem? 



3. If I have build a custom PC which is build the PC from scratch and then I nedd an OS, which version of Windows 8 should I buy? oem or fpp?

<p>Hi. I'm new here. I'm quite confuse about fpp and oem, so I'm asking directly here to get clearer picture. Okay I give some situations:- 1. Let say I have windows 7 laptop and I'm buying it with Windows 7 installed in it. So is that oem version of Windows
 7? </p>
<p><strong>Yes, that is an OEM installation. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I upgrade it to Windows 8? </p>
<p><strong>Yes, you can upgrade it to Windows 8.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If can, so how? <strong>You will have to purchase a retail copy of Windows 8.</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;2. I have **** PC (no OS), which version of windows 8 should i buy?</p>
<p><strong>You should purchase the Windows 8.1 OEM System Builder license, which includes transfer rights. Its not like the Windows 8 OEM license that comes preinstalled on a new PC.</strong></p>

<h2>            &#38;quot&#59;Incomplete Xbox 360 game download&#38;quot&#59; of a free COD&#58; Black Ops 2 game</h2>
                    
<p>i just got a new 500 gb xbox360 w/ a coupon for the above game. When I attempted &nbsp;to download it, I eventually got the above error. I tried to download it again (without deleting the file) &amp; was told that the coupon had already been redeemed. What to do?
 Delete it &amp; try again? What if it maintains that "the coupon has already been redeemed?</p>

<h2>            Ease of Access Center-problem starting Magnifier, On-Screen Keyboard, etc.</h2>
                    
<p>Using Windows 7, 64 bit.&nbsp; I can open Ease of Access Center, but individual tools, such as Magnifier, will not open, except as noted below.&nbsp; Error message "C:\Windows\system 32\magnify.exe.&nbsp; A referral was returned from the server".&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can get everything working by uninstalling my mouse in Device Manager, unplugging it from USB port, plugging it back in, and letting Windows install generic driver.&nbsp; However, when I reboot, the same problem reappears-nothing will work in Ease of Access
 Center.</p>
<p>I have updated the graphics card driver, uninstalled Logitech SetPoint software, tried using a PS2 connected mouse, performed an SFC scan,&nbsp;and tried a New User Account, all to no avail.&nbsp; If I boot in Safe Mode, everything works.&nbsp; With Diagnostic Startup,
 none of the Ease of Access tools will open.&nbsp; Windows Experience Index is 5.9.</p>
<p>This is first time I have tried to use Ease of Access features on this PC, so I don't know if they worked properly at some previous time.&nbsp; Any suggestions appreciated.......</p>

<p><span>Hi wbutler600,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Seems like there is a conflict with either some third party application or some driver.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Perform Clean Boot to check for the same.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:<span>&nbsp;</span>Clean Boot</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind
 of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you
 may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in
 Windows 7:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, make sure
 to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in </span><strong><span>Step 7</span></strong><span>
 in the above KB article.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Hardware Clean Boot</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Here’s the procedure to do it:<br />
1. Go to start and type device manager in the start search field.<br />
2. Type device manager and select device manager from the programs list.<br />
3. Right Click on Sound Card, Video Adapter, and Network Adapter one by one and click disable.<br />
4. Reboot the computer.<br />
<br />
If this fixes your problem, enable to hardware devices one at time to find the exact device causing this problem.</span></p>
<p><span>After you found the device that causing the problem you can resolve by installing last driver or replacing the device.</span></p>

            <p>Divya,</p>
<p>Thanks very much for your response.&nbsp; However, I'm still stuck at "square one".&nbsp; After trying without success to isolate the item causing the problem by using the Clean Boot process, I performed a Clean Boot with all Services and Startup items disabled, including
 Microsoft services.&nbsp; After rebooting, the only way any of the Ease of Access features would work was if I performed the steps outlined in my original post.....&nbsp;uninstall the mouse in Device Manager, unplug it from the USB port,&nbsp; plug it back in to the USB
 port and let Windows install the generic mouse driver.&nbsp; After doing this, all the Ease of Access features work, even under the Clean Boot.&nbsp; As I outlined in my original post, when I reboot none of the features will work.........until I again do the mouse uninstall/reinstall
 procedure.</p>
<p>I also followed your steps for the Hardware Clean Boot, but that did not fix the problem.</p>
<p>If I boot in Safe Mode, all the Ease of Access features work.&nbsp; While in Safe Mode, I opened all possible programs and was able to use the Ease of Access features in each one with no problem.</p>
<p>Any further suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>x24hrs2livx is right. It's been known for months that the Xbox One wasn't going to be able to support the Xbox Live arcade games - next time you decide to purchase something, a little research might help 1st. Those arcade games are the reason I decided to
 keep my Xbox 360 - I'm not about to give up 300+ of them just because I got a new console. Tough luck though, I'm sure it's a hard lesson to learn.</p>

<p>I am sure that it looks great having two complete consoles hooked up to one tv. &nbsp;Mine looks awful, wires everywhere and controllers. &nbsp;All in One and there is no Arcade Games. &nbsp;A customer should not have had to do hours of research on this before buying.
 &nbsp; All in One was the main advertising campaign. &nbsp;Now we have to keep our cable box, keep our 3d bluray, keep the x360. &nbsp;That right there is All in 4. &nbsp;Xbox 4 &nbsp;should have been the name, or Xbox NONE. &nbsp;</p>

<p>the clutter would be the same if I went to PS4. &nbsp;I understand that. &nbsp;Staying with one company should let me clean things up around here. &nbsp;Now I need separate steering wheels for the X1. &nbsp;Those things are awesome but darn hard to hide and make a room not
 look cluttered. &nbsp;And if put away they never get used. &nbsp;I have not got a wheel as it is over 300 but when Microsoft comes out with one I will have to get one. &nbsp;I love that stuff.

<p>SAFELYDAD, do what I do - keep each console in separate rooms. Doing that helps reduce the clutter. Also, it took me less than 5 minutes to find out about the Xbox Live Arcade games from console to console, not hours upon hours of research.

<p>I am sure that it looks great having two complete consoles hooked up to one tv. &nbsp;Mine looks awful, wires everywhere and controllers. &nbsp;All in One and there is no Arcade Games. &nbsp;A customer should not have had to do hours of research on this before buying.
 &nbsp; All in One was the main advertising campaign. &nbsp;Now we have to keep our cable box, keep our 3d bluray, keep the x360. &nbsp;That right there is All in 4. &nbsp;Xbox 4 &nbsp;should have been the name, or Xbox NONE. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Why would you not invest the time into learning about something you're about to spend half a grand or more, with games, on?&nbsp; Seems rather dumb.&nbsp; And that doesn't take hours of reading to figure out unless you're in first grade or on that level of reading
 speed. </p>

<p>The more I keep reading about the Xbone, the more I keep getting further and further away from buying one.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>I suggest you get away from the useless rants of people that either don't understand how things work, or didn't bother learning about it before they dropped 500 bucks on it and are surprised after the fact.&nbsp;&nbsp; Read the actual information out there from Microsoft
 and some non biased sources.&nbsp; I personally think the system is great, it does everything I was expecting it to do, and a bit more, as I didn't expect to have the TV interface work with my provider since it's a smaller cable company.&nbsp; But it did, without issue.&nbsp;
 I read these cause they make me laugh, but it's very much not a sign of how things really are.</p>

<p>Galactic. &nbsp;I have 360 in every room, LOL. &nbsp;I get the business reason that xbox has done but I have a hard time being told that the X1 is incapable of playing 360 arcade or any backwards games. &nbsp;My point is it was said many times that X1 was ready for what
 ever the gamers want. &nbsp;I just think the business tactic will fail real soon as in about January with no new games people will find other hobbies. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have yet to hear exactly though why anybody would not want the arcade games they have purchased to play on X1 or even GTA V they have just purchased to not play on X1. &nbsp;All I hear is a few naïve people think it is not powerful enough which I find almost
 scary. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel so sorry for the few who have kids and have one game console hooked to their biggest widescreen. &nbsp;That would drive me nuts, the main TV is mine, yes we share it on occasion, but darn it, that remote is mine, mine, mine. &nbsp;LOL.</p>
<p>I have a set up for each of our kids and 2 set up for their friends and relatives when they come over. &nbsp;I live in a cold area for months on end so it really works great to spend a day. &nbsp;With gas prices I justify my home entertainment stuff for sure anyways.
 &nbsp;Yes my kids are well rounded for those that will attack me. &nbsp;They do every sport and school activity, we are not basement gamers LOL.</p>
<p>I never said that x1 could not charge a transfer fee to swap games to the x1 to gather losses either. &nbsp;For this Winter the X1 looks pretty boring for sure.

<p>AGOD: &nbsp;half a grand, wow my wife would love that laugh. &nbsp;I have spent well over 50000 in gaming since the beginning of xbox. &nbsp;Heck counting the upgrading to all Plasma TV that amount is low. &nbsp;The biggest reason I love new TV is for gaming, &nbsp; &nbsp;Also my surround
 sound set up and headphones are all because of gaming. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Error 80151901</h2>
                    
<p>I've had error&nbsp;80151901 since last night and can't connect at all.</p>
<p>I've tried using a wired connection and wifi, the same error occurs on both.</p>
<p>I've tried restoring the factory default network settings. That didn't help.</p>
<p>I've also tried changing the IP address to manual and setting it back to automatic. It keeps giving the error.</p>
<p>I can see the IP address is automatically assigned.</p>
<p>When I run the xbox live connection test, it says there is an IP address error.</p>
<p>I've logged into xbox.com on the laptop with the same account and it works fine.</p>
<p>Any other ideas what I could try?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Thank you all for your replies.</p>
<p>Yes the IP address begins with 169.</p>
<p>I tried all the ports on the router, it always got assigned the same IP.</p>
<p>What Country/State/Province do you live in? </p>
<p>Ireland, Dublin</p>
<p>Modem brand &amp; model number: </p>
<p>no modem</p>
<p>Router brand &amp; model number: </p>
<p>telsey cpa-znte7</p>
<p>If Wireless, are you using a white or black external adapter, or an internal (Xbox 360S) adapter?</p>
<p>Not using wifi</p>
<p>Things you have tried: </p>
<p>Is UPnP Enabled? Unknown, I have no access to the router, it's password protected and only the ISP has access to it. It has worked before and I haven't changed anything, so I can't see how this would be the problem.</p>
<p>Do you have a NAT error? If so, what is your NAT type?</p>
<p>No NAT error as far as I know.</p>
<p>Any Error Codes you encounter: </p>
<p>80151901</p>
<p>Who is your ISP(Internet Service Provider)? </p>
<p><a href="http://www.magnet.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.magnet.ie/</a></p>
<p>After you run "Test Xbox LIVE connection" press “Y” for "More Info”. In the pop-up that appears, what are the following values, if shown? (If a value below does not appear for you, just leave it blank.)</p>
<p>IP address error.</p>

<p>Yeah it's a combined modem/router. Just off the phone with my ISP and they said there's no UPnP setting on that device and they haven't made any changes to their settings so it must be on micro$oft's side.</p>

<p>Also they said there were no changes made on their side so I think it wouldn't help :(</p>

            <p>Before you tried to connect your console to your wireless network, (as a step to troubleshoot your connection) have you been able to connect wireless without any issues, to the same wireless gateway?<br /><br />If you have a spare Ethernet cable, try connect this cable to your console and also, try use a different LAN port on your router.<br /><br />I fully understand your situation and the relationship between your networking device and your ISP.<br /><br />The DHCP is a fundamental part, to be able to send data across network(s) and especially the Internet and Xbox LIVE, as it resolves IP addresses, information about the default gateway, subnet mask and DNS server, for any device that request such information. Without the ability to "speak" and request such information from the DHCP server, a device is forced to create its own network and is thereby unable to communicate outside of this network.<br /><br />If its possible, try connect your console to a different network, (friend or neighbor)

<h2>            Security Warning on opening programs.</h2>
                    Hi forum,<br />
<br />
Whenever I open a WinRAR file on Windows 7 I get&nbsp;a security warning about Unknown Publisher making changes to my computer.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to set this to "Ok for future asks" so it doesn't ask for this program anymore?<br />
<br />
NB: I have tried the 'Change when these notifications appear' option, but that's not program specific. . . I only want to turn off this pop up for this one program (for now). . . happy to receive it for others.

<p><span>Hi JestaCat,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 7 UAC Settings has a Slider to change your 'comfort-level' with the notifications. You can choose one from the following
 four options:</span></p>
<p>
<span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>Always notify me and wait for my response.</strong> The UAC prompt is displayed on the secure desktop when a program is trying to install software or when you or a program attempt to change Windows settings. If you do not click
<strong>Yes</strong>, after 30 seconds the UAC prompt automatically denies the request.</span></p>
<p>
<span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>Always notify me.</strong> The UAC prompt is displayed on the desktop when a program is trying to install software or when you or a program changes Windows settings. If you do not click
<strong>Yes</strong>, after 30 seconds the UAC prompt automatically denies the request.</span></p>
<p>
<span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>Only notify me when programs try to make changes to my computer.</strong> You are notified only when a program tries to make changes to your computer, including changes to Windows settings.</span></p>

            Very nice. <br />
<br />
Customer - I want to turn off UAC for this one program...<br />
<br />
MS Support - I am too busy to read your question carfefully. Here is a canned answer on how to turn it off completely. It probably isn't the right answer...

            @ Skramblr - thanx, well summarised!<br />
<br />
@ Andre.Ziegler - thanx, but I was hoping for some 'official' answer, not a work around that means I have to do more work to get this Operating System that I purchased to behave like I actually own something, instead of offering an opinion everytime I give
 it an instruction (user:open commonly used program; windows:are you sure? = redundant conversation!)

            Hi check the compatibility settings of WinRAR.exe. Is the option set, that request admin privileges on every use? If yes, uncheck it.

Unfortunatley, I already had the "Run As Administrator" for all users checked - there's no tickbox (that I see) for "request every time" or simliar.<br />

            JestaCat, I was having this problem as well until I disabled the "Run as administrator" feature. I thought for some reason I needed this on, but from what I can tell its not necessary. I can open Winrar, create files using the right-click context menus
 and even delete .rar files after I extract them automatically without Administrator.

            Simply tick the box that says 'Disable Visual Themes' in the compatibility tab and thats all you need to fix this (annoying) problem..

    <title>Skype Video not working Logitech C920 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype Video not working Logitech C920</h2>
                    <p>I have a logitech C920 webcam that was working for skype but I recently tried to skype my father on his birthday and for the life of me can't get it to work on my computer (it's an HTPC connected to my TV so my entire family can be in the front room while
 skyping).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I test it with the Windows Picture app or On-line the video works just great. It's as if it's something to do with skype it self that's having an issue. I also uninstalled skype and reinstalled (using the windows 10 skype app).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried different USB ports and that doesn't fix it either. When I skyped my family they could hear me through the webcam, but they just couldn't see me. I tried to call others and it had the same affect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally - one more thing I've tried. When I plug the webcam into my desktop PC everything works great! Same skype version and everything, and the webcam works as it should.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on what I can try?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Backup and Restore</h2>
                    Prior experience with Windows 7 Backup and restore: Weekly backups were in the following pattern: 4 incremental backups and then a full backup. This pattern has maintained itself for the past 10 months until 6-8 weeks ago. Now all backups are full backups
 with the attendant longer backup time. Solution??? Thx

            <p>1) Start by creating a ‘System Restore’ point before you make any registry changes.</p>
<p><br />
2) Updating the registry:<br />
The following registry changes need to be made to the action center status DWORD values.</p>
<p><br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsBackup\Status\ActionCenterState&nbsp; DWORD=0</p>

<h2>            KB2976978 update  &#40;size&#58; 25 KB&#41; keeps repeatedly updating &#47; installing in Windows 8.1 &#40;July 8th 2015&#41;</h2>
                    Hello,
<p>
</p><p>today I´ve turned on my PC and I´ve seen a message saying that there was an update
<strong>(KB2976978)</strong> available in Windows Update. The size of this update is only 25 KB and its release date is supposed to be June 9th 2015.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It´s quite strange because I had my OS totally updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is that I have correctly installed the update (the green shield has appeared after the installation) and I have restarted the computer. Once in the desktop after restarting the machine, I´ve opened the Windows Update window and I have pressed
 the "look for updates" option (this is something I always do in order to check that the updates have been correctly installed and nothing appears the second time). But this update (KB2976978) has appeared again like pending (pic at the end of this post). I
 have realised that no matter how many times I install this update. It appears repeatedly again and again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Does anybody know what is happening?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Are you experiencing this issue?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Any solution?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>This looks like the NeverE</em></strong><strong><em>nding Story...</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for the info.</p>

<p>Well, not exactly. We posted and a lot of people came up with some interim solutions (one which I employed). Had we not posted, MS may not have become aware of the problem as quickly and it might have taken longer for a solution. Plus, we helped a lot of
 others by letting them know they were not the only ones with this issue. So, MS solved the problem, but in a lot of ways, we both helped in expediting that solution. Give yourself some credit. And, thanks for posting from all of us.</p>

<h2>            Windows won&#39;t boot. Getting rdisk partition&#92;windows message.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Can't Boot Windows XP</p>
<p>Hi there everyone, </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The other day I un-installed some items that were clogging up my old Dell Inspiron 6000 (Norton, Nero etc).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I restarted the computer it brings me to a screen that provides some options</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-Safe Mode</div>
<div>-Safe Mode w/ Command Prompt</div>
<div>-Safe Mode w/ Networking</div>
<div>-Last Known Good Config</div>
<div>-Start Windows Normally</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>No matter which one I pick, the computer hangs.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I pick any of the Safe Mode options some text appears at the bottom in relation to multi disk rdisk partition\windows... and then some .dll, .nls and .sys files.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried booting from a backup disc but to no avail (I changed the BIOS settings to boot from the disc) but it still brings me to command prompt and nothing runs from there. I'm wondering if the Boot disc is funked up? I have XP on a home desktop so
 perhaps I should make another boot disk and try again?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried working my way through some of KB articles on the site (sys restore through command prompt didn't work).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hope I've provided enough information and I'd be very appreciative of any help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
<div><br />

            That sounds good so far.<br />
<br />
Now do this:<br />
<br />
Once you are booted on the CD of your choice, navigate to the following folder (assuming XP is installed on your C volume):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32\drivers<br />
<br />
From the Recovery Console you would enter this command:<br />
<br />
cd system32\drivers<br />
<br />
<br />
Look for a file that ends with a .sys extension and is zero bytes in length.&nbsp; The file may also have a curious name since it may have been generated at random.<br />
<br />
If you are in the XP Recovery Console, issue the following command while in the c:\windows\system32\drivers folder:<br />
<br />
dir&nbsp; *.sys<br />
<br />
The files will scroll by one screen at a time.&nbsp; Look at the list of files with the .sys extensions and their lengths.&nbsp; You don't need to worry about the Directories...&nbsp; If you see a file(s) with a .sys extension that is zero bytes, that is the one to suspect.<br />
<br />
If you are using the Mini XP Mode of a Hiren's boot CD (which operates just like the XP desktop), just navigate to the folder from the My Computer desktop icon and locates the suspicious file(s).<br />
<br />
You will want to actually delete the suspicious file once you get running and have run some scans for malicious software, but if you are not sure what the suspicious file is or if it might be needed, just rename the suspicious file for the time being in case
 you are not sure.<br />
<br />
For example, if you found that the zigxrtml.sys file had a length of zero bytes, rename it:<br />
<br />
rename zigxrtml.sys&nbsp;&nbsp; zigxrtml.bad<br />
<br />
Renaming or deleting the suspicious file to get the system running is not fixing the problem.&nbsp; It is fixing the symptom of the problem.
<br />
<br />
The problem is your system is infected with malicious software and you must still follow up with some scans to remove the infection.<br />
<br />
Once your system is running, follow up with MBAM and SAS to be sure the affliction has really been removed.<br />
<br />
Reduce the chances of malicious software by running some scans. <br />
<br />
Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs then resolve any remaining issues:<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes (MBAM):&nbsp; <a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a><br />
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.superantispyware.com/</a><br />
<br />
These can be uninstalled later if desired.<br />

            <p>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure.</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come with a store bought system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>

<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recovery_console_cmds.mspx?mfr=true</a></p>
<p>A good idea before starting things is to first verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear
 to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>

<h2>            Problem with 360 and Prime &#40;error mp1032&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>We are having a sudden problem with Amazon Prime on our 360. After over a year of perfect operation, we suddenly started getting errors on certain downloads saying that prime was unavailable. eventually, we lost access to Amazon Prime altogether. Thinking
 that the app was damaged, I deleted it and downloaded the app again. It installed properly and opens to its homepage. But I still can't view anything. The error message says that Amazon prime is unavailable and gives code mp1032.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also tried logging out and logging back into Amazon through the console, with no effect. On line search says that mp1032 errors can arise if video capture equip is located between the 360 and TV. We have no such configuration. It's direct HDMI from the
 360 to the TV. Has anyone encountered this error? It's Amazon only. Netflix works fine.</p>

<p>Thx</p>

<p>Peter</p>

<p>The problem kept cropping up every time that we used the Prime app. We could watch a show, but once the Xbox was shut down and restarted, the error would crop up. Each time, we had to delete the Prime app and reinstall. It's fixed now. I'm not certain what
 fixed it, but last reinstall of the Amazon Prime app, I did two things different. First, I deleted the app through the system controls. Navigate to system settings and then to memory. When you parse through the programs, you'll have the option to delete. You'll
 notice three files. Delete all of them. One possibility is that one of these files was not being deleted and the bug resurfaced because of it.</p>
<p>The other more probable reason that things are better is that I noticed that free storage was limited on the console. I freed up storage space by deleting another unused program and the problem has not resurfaced at all. Perhaps freeing up some space if
 your console is cluttered will help?</p>
<p>I wish I could be more helpful. Fortunately, uninstall/reinstall did eventually work out. It failed three times, but everything's been just fine SINCE I decided to also free up some extra storage space. Good luck! I hope you get a definitive answer from
 Microsoft at some point. Searching the web hasn't helped at all, and it's not from failing to look. I wore the net out looking for an answer. There isn't one out there.
</p>
<p>One problem is that you're stuck in a support hole. Amazon has poor support in the first place and no online help for the Xbox. And from Microsoft's side, they aren't about to prioritize troubleshooting Amazon's app...</p>

<p>I have been hit by this same bug in the last week and have read the replies here. I need this to work as I have a projector that is connected by Component Cables and the XBOX 360 is one of my last devices that isn't purely just connected via HDMI. So this
 isn't a HDMI problem. The cabling also has always gone through an A/V amp and still is.</p>
<p>Anyway in my case I have now pinned down the file in error, so I no longer have to delete the whole app and reinstall and hope it is the same for you guys.</p>
<p>I have the App installed to a USB device but also have a Memory Unit inserted. It is when I run Amazon Video for the second time that the problem occurs after reinstalling. I have found a Amazon Video App file being stored on the MU, It is the "PlayReady
 License Store" under the Amazon Video folder. Once deleted I find the videos start playing OK. I haven't currently let a whole video run, so I don't know if I will encounter any other problems. I had also tried to move the file to USB but it doesn't fix the
 problem as another is created on the MU.</p>

<h2>            Monthly suscription</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">Hello,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">Please see email below regarding an incident I had previously reported and I thought the information I have been given was accurately but it seems not to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">Subscriptions are for the month (~30 days). &nbsp; Subscriptions attempt to bill 3 days in advance
<strong>every</strong> month to ensure payment is valid before the next cycle starts. &nbsp;If you are billed on the 25th every month (<strong>I am)</strong> that means your initial sign up day was 3 days earlier. &nbsp;This means your monthly cycle does not end until
<strong>3 days after you pay</strong> for the next month (if payment goes through the first time successfully). &nbsp;Terminating the cycle early would only give you ~27 days of coverage instead of 30. &nbsp;Since minutes do not roll over, this would hurt you if you
 had not finished your consumption of all the minutes for the month. &nbsp;Terminating it early would also defeat the purpose of a monthly subscription.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">&nbsp;Minutes are not released until your old cycle has completed. &nbsp;There is no way to bypass this limitation on your account short of purchasing a different minute subscription that would have the same limitation on its own cycle.
 &nbsp;So based off the information you provided your monthly cycle is probably from the
<strong>28th</strong> to the <strong>28th</strong>. &nbsp;The minutes usually renew no later than the end of day GMT on the renewal day. &nbsp;Usually the actual renewal time on the renewal day is a bit sooner coinciding with the actual time you purchased the initial
 subscription.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">According to this email you sent me last time. I should be able to make call today 29th BUT I still have the same problem. I can't make calls right now. Even though the three cycle days have
 passed already... can you please released the minutes as my old cycle has been completed.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">I look forward to hearing from you in due course.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/a32be8a2-8edf-42f8-9d54-96cb9fc9097d">
Oxford30</a>, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to&nbsp;clarify some pointers&nbsp;on your post. </p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">Subscriptions are for the month (~30 days).&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>- Not all Skype subscription are on a monthly basis. Skype also have quarter and annual subscriptions.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">Subscriptions attempt to bill 3 days in advance <strong>
every</strong> month to ensure payment is valid before the next cycle starts. &nbsp;If you are billed on the 25th every month (<strong>I am)</strong> that means your initial sign up day was 3 days earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>- Correct. Skype charges your account three days in advance before the renewal date of your subscription to ensure the prompt delivery of the service. Based on your statement, if you are billed on the 25th of every month, then you initially signed up for
 your monthly subscription three days later, not earlier. </p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">Terminating the cycle early would only give you ~27 days of coverage instead of 30.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>- No, even if you cancel the subscription during its validity on your account, it will still be active up until it expire.&nbsp;The&nbsp;duration of the validity will not be shortened just because you cancelled it.&nbsp;Cancelling the subscription will not affect your
 current use of the subscription itself for the month, what you will be cancelling<strong> is the renewal for the next billing period.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">Since minutes do not roll over, this would hurt you if you had not finished your consumption of all the minutes for the month.&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;Yes, remaining minutes will not carry over&nbsp;for&nbsp;your next month's use.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1)">The minutes usually renew no later than the end of day GMT on the renewal day. &nbsp;Usually the actual renewal time on the renewal day is a bit sooner coinciding with the actual time you purchased the initial subscription.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;- Your subscription minutes will renew the<strong> exact time and date you initially purchased
</strong>it. So even if you were charged three days in advance, your subscription minutes will be activated on the date and time you initially purchased the subscription.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a number of reasons why&nbsp;your calls might not go through. Can you clarify some things for me?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the exact&nbsp;name of the subscription you have?</p>
<p>2. When&nbsp;were you last charged for the subscription? </p>
<p>3. What number are you calling? Is it a&nbsp;mobile or landline number?</p>
<p>4. Where&nbsp;are you currently situated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I will&nbsp;keep looking into this and will&nbsp;keep you posted. </p>

<p>Hi <span>Danida_U</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your email. see details below for my account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>All I am saying is after the 3 days that Skype take to validate the payment I should be able to make calls right, but that is the problem I can't. my monthly payments is the 25th&nbsp;every month. Therefore adding the 3 days to ensure the payment would be 28th
 by 29th the minutes then should be released for the usage but this is not happening and is not fair because that is not what Skype says in the website and this should be clarify. This happens every month, instead of having 27 days to spend the pack of 200
 minutes that I have signed for I have 26 or sometimes&nbsp;25. Again is not fair and this should be check out, you can even track my calls and see when I start making calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I live in the United Kingdom-Oxford the signal is very good and the calls I make is to&nbsp;<em>|redacted&nbsp;number for privacy and security reasons|</em>&nbsp;to a landline in Ecuador South America.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much and I appreciated if you could check it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Skype video and audio is choppy</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; since September of last year we have been experiencing choppy audio and video when we connect to someone outside of our work, it seems to work just fine inside the office. I'm trying to retrieve the diagnostic logs but cannot find them.</p>
<p>Can someone please help?</p>

            Have you tried downloading classic Skype and use it to see if that corrects your problem?<br /><br />1 ) Go to <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a><br /><br />2) Click the drop-down arrow in the blue download button<br /><br />3) Select Get classic Skype<br /><br />4) Run the downloaded program

            <div>if you can't keep it running, consider doing a complete wipe and reimage. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>different Windows computer if yours is not working properly)&nbsp; and download a</div>
<div>recovery image for your Surface. You will need a 16GB USB stick formatted FAT32.</div>
<div>Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:</div>
<div>Step 1:&nbsp; &nbsp; Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in (hold down the power</div>

<div>Step 2:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 3:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the</div>
<div>power button on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 4:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.</div>
<div>Step 5:&nbsp; &nbsp; When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.</div>
<div>Step 6:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of</div>
<div>the screen.</div>
<div>Step 7:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This</div>

<div>Step 8:&nbsp; &nbsp; Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.</div>
<div>Step 9:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Choose Just remove my files.</div>
<div>Step 10:&nbsp; &nbsp; Select Reset.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process</div>
<div>continues (this can take a while).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&gt;It keeps restarting by itself.</div>
