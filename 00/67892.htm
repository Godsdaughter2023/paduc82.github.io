    <title>Several Windows 10 apps missing&#63; and Windows store stuck - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Several Windows 10 apps missing&#63; and Windows store stuck</h2>
                    I have several Windows 10 apps that suddenly disappeared, leaving corrupted tiles on the Start menu:&nbsp; Groove Music (zunemusic), Movies &amp; TV (ZuneVideo), WindowsCamera, and WindowsReadingList.&nbsp; In addition, Windows Store is stuck downloading an update to
 Movies &amp; TV at "Started download."&nbsp; This started yesterday when I noticed that several other items were stuck downloading in Windows Store.&nbsp; I tried dism and sfc and then had to rename the SoftwareDistribution folder, which finally seemed to get the downloads
 working again, but those didn't work today.&nbsp; When I'm in Store and try to open the music app or the movies &amp; TV app from my library, I get something saying I'll need a new app to open this.&nbsp; I also tried using Powershell to remove and reinstall Groove Music,
 but just got an error removing and several errors when trying to reinstall.&nbsp; Any ideas?

<span>Hi Defose,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>a) What's your Operating System?</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>b) Were you able find stereo mix earlier?</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>I would like to suggest you<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>update</span>
</a>the sound card driver software from manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Update drivers: recommended links</span></strong><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links</span></strong></a></span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>If the option is still not there, please refer to the following step:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click the Start Button, type "MMSYS.CPL" (without quotation marks) in the Start Search box and press Enter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2. On Recording tab, right-click on the blank area</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3. Check “Show Disabled Devices” and “Show Disconnected Devices” and the Stereo Mix should show up.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it is disabled, right click on it and choose Enable.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If the "Stereo Mix" type device did Not show up in the "Sound" window when right-clicking and selecting Show Disabled Devices, it may indicate that you have Integrated Sound, and recording
 streaming, etc. is Not supported. In that case (on a Desktop PC), installing a sound card into an available slot should solve the problem.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Sometimes downloading and installing your sound card manufacturer's latest drivers can add additional sources like What-U-Hear, Stereo Mix, etc. Also, some users have reported that
 "downgrading" drivers to older versions have helped them instead of "upgrading.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Stereo Mix is available if the other devices (Microphone, Rear input) are enabled and set as default devices.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Also try running these troubleshooters and check if it helps:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that after upgrading the Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 all desktop apps and Internet Explorer 11&nbsp;(desktop mode) cannot connect to internet. I will certainly help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There could be several reasons for causing this issue. Like pending updates, driver corruption, third party application conflict. Let’s try to identify the actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>

<p><span>3. Are you able to access the apps from the Windows Store?</span></p>

            <p>Hi Sharon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. Thanks for providing the detailed information regarding the issue.</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay in reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have mentioned you are able to access Windows Store apps but the Internet explorer in the desktop mode is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue can be caused due to enhanced protected mode, due to add-ons or third party software or antivirus conflicting with Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all I suggest you to disable antivirus temporarily and check the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try placing the computer in safe mode with networking and check the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe mode starts the computer in a minimal set of drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer the link to start the computer in a safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue persists refer the link below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>“Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage" error</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>Try the steps disabling enhanced protected mode, deleting the browsing history, resetting Internet Explorer, system restore from the link and check the issue.</p>

    <title>Some Microsoft Casual Games interface text and icons too small on high - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Some Microsoft Casual Games interface text and icons too small on high dpi screen</h2>
                    <p>Only three Microsoft Casual Games scale well on my high dpi 15.6 inch laptop screen of 1920x1080 screen resolution, that is, Microsoft Solitaire Collection, Microsoft Mahjong and Microsoft Ultimate Word Games o far.
</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot of Microsoft Ultimate word games, a game that scales well on high dpi screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c5779d5-dd25-4cd4-a927-6c6060651882?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c5779d5-dd25-4cd4-a927-6c6060651882?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Other Microsoft Casual Games like Microsoft Sudoku, Microsoft Minesweeper, Microsoft Taptiles and other Microsoft Casual Games in the Microsoft Store do not scale well on my high dpi laptop screen. The interface text and icons is almost too small and uncomfortable
 to use. The gameplay is a bit fuzzy. Below is a screenshot of Microsoft Minesweeper, a game that does&nbsp; not scale well on high dpi screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/012e99d6-30b0-49e6-b355-dea93a18de9e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/012e99d6-30b0-49e6-b355-dea93a18de9e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these games mentioned above, I have tested their dpi awareness using Sysinternals Process Explorer and found out that they are all Per-Moniter aware. Their scaling doesn't change after changing the scale percentage.</p>

<p>Hi Tony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try to isolate this issue so that we could identify first as to why the other Microsoft Casual Games are not displaying well on your computer. Kindly provide us the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can you tell us if you tried reinstalling the games on your computer?</li><li>Have you recently installed the latest Windows Update?</li><li>Can you tell us the troubleshooting steps that you have tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I recommend that you run the Windows app troubleshooter to scan and repair the apps on your computer. You may refer to this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em> to run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your reply.</p>

            I have tried reinstalling the games that were not scaling well but nothing has changed, the scaling is the same. I have installed the latest Windows 10 1709 update but it is still the same. I cannot upgrade to Windows 10 April 2018 update due to bugs and
 performance problems reported, until they are fixed I will upgrade. I used Sysinternals to check their dpi awareness, the games that do not scale well on high dpi screens are all Per-Monitor-Aware

<p>Hello Tony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is already aware of the scaling issues for high-DPI devices. As of the moment, Microsoft released a couple of workarounds for Windows program by disabling display scaling on high-DPI settings. You can check this

            Hi Jack,
<br />
<br />It seems on line 1785 the code calls InternetExplorer.Application without that object having been created before that call, you will probably need to ass a line of code like the following before that call
<br />
<br />Set objIE = CreateObject("InternetExplorer.Application")

<p>I am far from well versed in script writing, but i tried adding the line of code in line right above the line in question:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/45107f68-db15-4863-b4f8-dbb978ebe90d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/45107f68-db15-4863-b4f8-dbb978ebe90d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>now, i'm getting a different error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2f69e5a-c388-45b3-adca-18cd17017550?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2f69e5a-c388-45b3-adca-18cd17017550?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>perhaps i simply added the line of code in the wrong space? or is there something entirely different going on?
</p>
<p>

 not play without the fear of losing my progress, I want my money back. I bought this game online and downloaded it a month ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was apparently a patch released on December 20th, 2013 to fix that particular issue. &nbsp; &nbsp;Frankly Microsoft is not responsible for the game running perfectly. &nbsp;If you have a problem with the game you'll have to take it up with Square-Enix</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Professional OEM Installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lmfzzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Professional OEM Installation</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just built a PC for the first time this July, and bought a Windows 7 Professional OEM along with it (couldn't find a retail version, and it's the only Windows 7 available from the stores). This is just a home computer and I'm not planning on running a
 business with it, mainly for gaming. I installed the OS without any tools that the cardboard package told me I needed to use, and I've been told that I don't really need to, if it's just for personal use. Earlier this week (5 months later) I just noticed that
 there's an "ask for Genuine" logo on the system info. I've not been restricted to do anything so far, and it's not giving me that "not a genuine" issue. So..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Does that mean I got scammed, or did I just do something wrong on the installation? Like I said, I'm not really going to build PCs with preinstalled Win7, I just want the peace of mind of having a genuine product, because I shelled out a good amount of
 money for this. </p>
<p>
</p><p>2) If I messed up the installation, can someone tell me the simplest way to resolve this? I heard I needed to pay for Microsoft phone assistance so I'd rather not call them...</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) If I go the phone assistance route, I have a receipt with the OS and all the build components, you guys think that can help in proving that I haven't changed my hardware and I'm installing it into the same machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Let's say I give up on it, and just ignore it. What will happen and when?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) In the event that there is no other solution other than to throw (more) money at the problem and buy me another Windows 7, can I just purchase a genuine RETAIL product key, and use this DVD? If yes, know anywhere I can buy it legally (and cheaply)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all in advance!</p>

            <p>Hey, Look right beside that symbol does it say that windows is activated? If so that logo means nothing its just some link. So here incase im unclear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) No you didnt get scammed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.) Unless it tells you windows is not activated you havent appered to have done anything wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.)You just call the toll free number if unactivated and give them the hardware id number. Make sure you talk to a person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.) If ungeniune wich u doubt since u been running fine for 5 months no problems. You can call to resolve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.) If you it comes to you having to find a retail copy of windows 7 Pro it would depend on where you live.</p>

            <p>Hello Jeff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah I activated it right after I installed it. As for #3, I'm not clear about hardware ID. Do you mean that I need to get this ID for every part I bought (mobo, cpu, graphics, drives)? How do I get the hardware IDs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I live in the Philippines, and I can't seem to find a retail version of Windows 7, even the established stores are only selling OEMs. I was considering buying online, but I don't know of legit store that ships here, which is why I was considering just buying
 a key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

            <p>Hello Imf, </p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as windows is activated you dont have to do anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look what this picture says on a brand new install of windows in a message.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe7cdf75-b885-4150-8d1c-0352ae09f6cc" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Its more of a windows ad telling you that when you buy ask for genuine Microsoft software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;This is an example of the window showing you Installation ID number.Just for refrence it looks like this
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c321f38a-559a-4efc-81fe-7ed83a596974" /></p>
<p>You can get to this step by hitting the windows button. Type run. Open run. Type Slui 4 in the box where it says open.Click ok.Select your Country in this case the Pilippines. It will show the above image with your toll free number(in your case you would
 have to check as the toll free number about is just an example number) and Installation ID. The Phone operater&nbsp; Will ask You for your Numbers. Its straightforward from there.&nbsp; I hope this clears it up.

<h2>            Windows 7 Professional x86 - Missing Operating System Error</h2>
                    
<p>I'm in a pretty sticky situation - I downloaded a copy of Windows 7 Professional from the MSDN Academic Alliance and installed great, activated without any problems, and worked for a couple of days. I previously had Windows Vista Home Premium and I had to
 reinstall Windows completely because it was not possible to upgrade. Two days ago, the computer randomly froze, and when I restarted it there was the "Missing operating system..." error on startup, just after the first BIOS screen. After reading some other
 questions, I messed around with the boot order, but nothing works - it seems like the computer isn't recognizing Windows 7 on the actual hard drive, for whatever reason. Is it a hardware problem, or will I have to reinstall Windows 7?</p>
<p>I've already called MSDNAA support and they recommended I talk to my Program Administrator, which I will tomorrow. I just wanted to see if there was any way I could fix the problem myself. Thanks.</p>

            The error message you describe&nbsp; "Missing operating system..." is indictactive of a hardware problem with the hard drive itself...meaning you need to replace the hard drive with a new one.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 to 10 upgrade error 0xC1900101 - 0x2000A SAFE_OS PREPARE_FIRST_BOOT</h2>
                    <p>I am encountering trouble upgrading to Windows 10. &nbsp;Despite multiple attempts, I always get the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8d661a4-2719-4202-b0b7-916cb68cbe19" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The installer gets to roughly 20% (66% copying files) then stops there for a long time, reboots and rolls back to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the suggestions mentioned in this article relating to this error&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-troubleshoot-common-setup-and-stop-errors/324d5a5f-d658-456c-bb82-b1201f735683">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-troubleshoot-common-setup-and-stop-errors/324d5a5f-d658-456c-bb82-b1201f735683</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And none have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got all Windows updates</p>
<p>Unplugged all USB devices except keyboard and mouse</p>
<p>Uninstalled antivirus</p>
<p>Disconnected from the internet</p>
<p>Used wired connection</p>
<p>Clean boot (disable all startup items and non Microsoft services)</p>
<p>Installed from the ISO</p>
<p>
</p><p>All to no avail. &nbsp;I am running an Asus PZ77-V Pro Deluxe and know this board works because I have a friend with the same one running Windows 10. &nbsp;I am running the newest BIOS available for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I definitely do not want to have to do a clean install and was wondering if there are any further options for me to explore?</p>
<p>

            <p>Okay finally got it fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read on another forum about people getting this same error in upgrading to 8 to 8.1 and it was caused by a windows.old folder in C:\</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last Windows upgrade (probably 8 to 8.1) left a windows.old folder in root C:\.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've emptied it before but could never delete it totally because of a permissions error. &nbsp;This must have been blocking the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I renamed this folder to old.windows.old, retried the update and it worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you are getting this problem and have a folder called C:\windows.old either delete that folder or if you can't delete it, rename it.</p>

<p>I'm having the same issues. &nbsp;Accepted the latest NXOE last night and when I got back online I was having the "save data" sync issues. &nbsp;I deleted my profile and did a hard reset. &nbsp;When I got back online it said that I have no friends and zero gamerscore.
 &nbsp;My background was reset and my xbox console colors as well. &nbsp;Every game I try to play just says it cannot retrieve my data. &nbsp;If I select "use offline" it works but one of my games lost all save content. &nbsp;I believe the game was Kickbeat. &nbsp;I select "use offline"
 but my entire game save is reset. &nbsp;I tried a few other games like GTA and Warframe and selected "use offline". &nbsp;The save content is still there for those games. &nbsp;When I go to manage storage not one of my games shows a game save on the console. &nbsp;It shows "reserved
 space", but no actual game save. &nbsp;The game saves were there before the latest NXOE update I took last night. &nbsp;I did not try factory resetting my console just yet. &nbsp;I have a few friends with the same issues that I am having right now. &nbsp;Every app and game just
 does not want to sync the data.</p>

    <title>Is it possible to bind wireless adapters together in Win7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> airfirehorse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to bind wireless adapters together in Win7&#63;</h2>
                    I have discovered that my N wireless adapter is still not fast enough for file transfer on my home network. Both the HTPCs I use are Win7 Pro 64-bit and I also transfer with a laptop that is wired. One of the HTPCs is wireless due to location. Video files
 take an enormous amount of time for me to copy to my other HTPC and sometimes Netflix is not fast enough on the wireless HTPC as well.<br />
<br />
An IT friend mentioned that you can "bind" ethernet adapters together to get increased speed so I was wondering if that same thing is possible with two USB wireless adapters. I have an N and a G adapter that both play well under Win 7 Pro on the machine and
 I have plenty of USB ports. I realize there are "other ways" to do things, but I really want an answer to this particular question.<br />
<br />
And I have searched for this info on-line, but have not had any luck in finding a definitive answer on this. Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />

            After an exhaustive search, I found this on a Wikipedia site:<br />
<br />
<p>[Note that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Windows</a> does not natively support link aggregation (at least up to Windows Server 2008). However, some manufacturers
 provide software for aggregation on their multiport NICs at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
device-driver</a> layer. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Intel</a>, for example, has released a package for Windows called Advanced Networking Services (ANS) to bind Intel Fast Ethernet and Gigabit cards.
 Nvidia also supports "teaming" with their Nvidia Network Access Manager/Firewall Tool.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Linux</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeBSD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
FreeBSD</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBSD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NetBSD</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBSD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OpenBSD</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Mac OS X</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSolaris" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
OpenSolaris</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Citrix_XenServer&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Citrix XenServer</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware_ESX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
VMware ESX</a>, and commercial Unix distributions such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
AIX</a> implement Ethernet bonding (trunking) at a higher level, and can hence deal with NICs from different manufacturers or drivers, as long as the NIC is supported by the kernel.]<br />
<br />
<br />
So unless the wireless adapter manufacturer makes a tool to allow this aggregation, I guess it's just not possible... yet. In case anyone besides me wanted to know.<br />

            You can buy the game if you live in a region where the game is offered for sale. If you believe you do, confirm that your Microsoft account, console region and billing address are all correct and set to where you actually live.

            Then, as Smwutches has reminded you, it sounds like the game is not available in your region. You should reach out to the publisher to see what they can do to help. Until that time, there's not much Microsoft can do.

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention here on the forums. I understand you're having trouble completing a purchase based on your regions availability of content. Unfortunately the only option would be to continue to try the purchase and hopefully
 it becomes available in your region. You can also get in touch with the developers so they may provide you with more information about their game.</p>

            Most of that stuff on the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) is just boilerplate and the stuff the matters is the STOP error code and any file name that might show up underneath it.<br />
<br />
I doubt you are going to be booting into any kind of Safe Mode with that error since it indicates a problem with your NT File System(NTFS).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If you will not be booting into Safe Mode, you will also be unable to perform a System Restore.<br />
<br />
I don't see how installing software will result in a cabling mismatch or cable foul up either.<br />
<br />
That all sounds like a big waste of time and more Support Engineer "expert"&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild-goose_chase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
wild goose chases</a>.<br />
<br />
You <i>do </i>need to perform a chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; from the XP Recovery Console but you do not absolutely need a Windows XP disk to do that (unless you are a Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert").&nbsp; A chkdsk with error correction run from the XP Recovery Console
 will usually straighten it out.<br />
<br />
Here's what to do:<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum implementation does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and
 agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
<div>
<p>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure what you have (no XP media required).<br />
</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come with a store bought system.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD (do not install UniBlue or the Ask Toolbar - ever!):<br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recovery_console_cmds.mspx?mfr=true</a></p>
<p>A good idea before starting things is to first verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear
 to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>
<p>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</p>
<p>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will not be present.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 program has stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently purchased a laptop which has a pre installed windows10 OS. I'm trying to open and use a
<strong>point of sale software by name Retailman.&nbsp;</strong>I get a error message "<strong>point of sale system has stopped working</strong>" whenever i open the application. I contacted Microsoft regarding the issue. They said Microsoft doesn't support 3rd
 party softaware. I contacted software developer. He says 1000's of people are using the application in windows10 and nobody has any issue. He asked me to contact Microsoft again. This application runs perfectly in windows7. &nbsp;I don't have an option to downgrade
 to windows7. I'm confused about what to do and whom to contact. I got a feeling that i made a mistake by buying pre installed windows laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm angry, clueless and helpless. Hope u ppl will help me to fix the issue.</p>
<p>I have Lenovo ideapad 310-15ISK.</p>
<p>Model name : 80SM</p>
<p>THanks</p>

            <p>the&nbsp;problem with preinstalled OS is the junk and bloatware that the pc manufacturer stuffs on prior to purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am surprised at the response&nbsp;from Retailman, does not look like they offer much support for their product.</p>
<p>microsft cannot possibly offer support for every bit of third party software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>in my opinion the best solution would be to wipe the disk and clean install windows 10, thus removing all the&nbsp;preinstalled bloatware, clean installs suffer far fewer problems than preinstalled or upgrades.</p>
<p>you can&nbsp;create bootable media using the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>if you don't want to wipe and clean install, try getting rid of Norton and/or Mcafee that was preinstalled, to do so use the&nbsp;removal tool from the relevant supplier (Norton or mcafee), and see if the problem persists.</p>
<p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I think the issue in not Retailman or bloatware, this is happening with too many people running too many other programs and after Windows upgrade with many
 other software packages, either way, Windows should not crash an exe program based on other running programs, its really an issue with MS Windows regardless, they don't want to own up to it, Windows 7 and 8 don't do these crashes. Anyhow thanks for your suggestion.
 I will try to reinstall clean windows. Hope the issue will be sorted out by reinstalling windows.</span></p>
