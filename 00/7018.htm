<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Skype Community Forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based from your post description, you wish to know how to add contacts using Skype for Web. If so, you may follow these instructions:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><a href="https://web.skype.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sign in</a> to your account. Click&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2faz705183.vo.msecnd.net%2fonlinesupportmedia%2fonlinesupport%2fmedia%2fskype%2fscreenshots%2ffa3281%2ffa3281_8.png" />&nbsp;Search Skype.</li><li>Select your friend from the search results and click <strong>Add to Contacts</strong>.
</li><li>Type a quick note to introduce yourself and then click <strong>Send</strong>.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The person is added to your contact list, but will appear offline until they accept your request. After they’ve accepted your request, you can see when they’re online and make free voice and video calls with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there’s more than one matching result and you’re not sure which one is your friend, right click on one and select
<strong>View Profile</strong>. It's like their Skype business card which contains all the details they've added – like a photo, city, country or phone number.&nbsp;If profile information can’t help you find your friend, ask them for their Skype Name or the email
 address they registered with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rhiza_E</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>When I'm trying to search for contacts the searching keeps "looking for" contacts and no answer is retrieved.</p>
<p>How do I know if this is a Java (or internet explorer) problem?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Using Outlook 365 business account on home computer - can i disable rules at home without affecting work Outlook instance</h2>
                    <p>My company uses Office 365. I just got a new personal laptop (not from work) and it had an office 365 trial. I was in a hurry setting it up and wasn't thinking and signed in using my work creds. It accepted them and I figured it wouldn't be bad to use this
 as a secondary source to check email. I didn't enter any rules into the&nbsp;home&nbsp;instance of Outlook, but&nbsp;after the emails started loading, I started getting errors from Outlook that were due to rules that were brought in from work because I didn't have the same
 directories created on my home laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is can I suspend the rules on my home laptop instance of Outlook 365 without affecting the work rules?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Signing in using your Outlook work account at home will carry over all the rules and settings established in that account. Thus, we would highly suggest not to suspend the rules and instead, sign in using a different account so as not to affect the rules
 set in your work account.</p>
<p>

    <title>LTR-RTL suddenly enabled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> weymama  say:</h3>
<h2>            LTR-RTL suddenly enabled</h2>
                    <p>I edit for a firm that does a lot of ESL documents, so I am *guessing* this problem may have something to do with the multiple languages Word (2016/365) now tries to spellcheck for. I do not think I have any of the packages installed (I installed a Puerto
 Rican Spanish package once, and it messed a whole lot of other documents up, so I have actively avoided that since). However, a couple of times now, I've encountered documents that automatically want to RTL the comments I insert in a document. I can manually
 change it back with a ribbon button every single time, but I've been unable to find a way to set LTR back to my default, even using the instructions the firm gave me (which appear to be for Word 2010 or older).<br />
<br />
On top of that, in working on my *own* manuscripts, I keep accidentally activating RTL in trying to insert a non-breaking space before an ellipsis (Ctrl+Shift+Space). Now and then, I hit Ctrl+Shift and then have to release the keys to adjust what's highlighted,
 and my entire paragraph flips RTL. It has taken me days to figure out what was going on here, and when I attempted to remap the keyboard shortcuts, it turns out this is NOT a mapped key sequence, it's just some feature I cannot seem to deactivate.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
An extremely frustrating feature, and one that cost me a lot of extra time on a document I edited this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mapped a key sequence to LTR so I can easily undo it and save myself a lot of extra mousing to click a ribbon button for *every*single*comment in another 5,000 word document, but I would really, really love to know if there is a way to completely shut
 it off AND how to set defaults in Word 2016 for the Comment Text style so that each new comment is appropriately LTR and not RTL.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Can anyone please help?&nbsp;<br />
</p>

            <p>By default, the Comment Text style that is used for comments is based on the Normal Style and will inherit the RTL\LTR attribute that is set in that Style - in fact, it cannot be set\altered in the Comment Style, so check the paragraph formatting of the
 Normal Style,</p>

            It is only affecting the close friend notifications. Any changes on my computer? Not that I know of, but my room mate could have done something. I have done just about everything, such as making sure that I can receive notifications on facebook, making
 sure I have no spam in my outlook account and adding facebook to my safe list. Not sure what an email client is? My email says POP options and it is set to no, IMAP setting imap-mail-outlook, there is no choice for the IMAP setting , only the POP

            Since the issue only affects the close friend notifications in Facebook, it may be because of how you configured your Facebook notification settings. You may have accidentaly turned off the close friend notifications.<br />

You can refer to the Facebook help center for the steps on how you can turn on your close friend notifications.<br />

<p>Hi Ryansharper,</p>
<p>If “outbound email” means the emails sent to outside organization, you can follow the steps below to meet your requirements:<br />
1. Login to Exchange admin center (https://outlook.office365.com/ecp/)<br />
2. Click mail flow-&gt;rules<br />
3. Click Add (+), select Apply disclaimers…<br />
4. Select The sender is located… under Apply this rule if…, then select Outside the organization<br />
5. Click Enter text… after Append the disclaimer… to add your disclaimers, then click Save</p>
<p>If the solution doesn’t meet your requirements, please let us know your root concern.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Larry</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an employee in my organisation,</p>
<p>She has Office 365 <em>
Version 1807 (Build 10325.20082)</em></p>
<p><em>On Lenovo pc, windows 10.0.16299</em></p>
<p>The problem is that she deletes emails from inbox folder in outlook,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and then deletes from "deleted items". After a while those emails return to inbox folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a new profile a month ago, the issue returned. </p>
<p>Tried to run scanpst.exe.</p>
<p>I've switched to online, then to cached mode again. This helped for some time.</p>
<p>I tried to check with the analyzer tool for 365, it couldn't sign in with her email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to check the issue?</p>

            A. Have you restarted your computer? Sometimes, this does wonders.
<br />
<br />B. See if Fn key is pressed or not.
<br />
<br />C.  Try following -
<br />
<br />1. Try repairing your office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Please look into C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel (replace user name with your user name, you can directly reach here by copy and pasting following without quotes in Explorer address bar - "%appdata%\Microsoft\Excel") and see if is contains few files / folders. Move those files to some other location (i.e create a backup of those files / folders and delete all files / folders from here). Hence, make Excel folder blank.
<br />
<br />Now open Excel and see if the problem disappears or not. 
<br />
<br />Note - If the above path is not applicable for your installation, you need to find XLSTART path. Excel folder contains XLSTART folder in itself (In case, your XLSTART path is not in Appdata)
<br />Open Excel &gt; ALT+F11 &gt; If Immediate Window is not visible, type CTRL+G. Same can be also be accessed through View &gt; Immediate Window &gt; Type "? application.StartupPath" without quotes and press enter &gt; You will have your path below.
<br />
<br />3. Sometimes, add-ins can cause problems. To determine, if add-in is a problem start your application in safe mode and see if problem has gone away. 
<br />
<br />To start in Safe Mode -
<br />
<br />Hold CTRL key and click on application icon and don't release the CTRL key till it asks you for Safe mode confirmation.
<br />
<br />If yes, then start application normally and disable add-ins one by one and start application again every time you disable an add-in to determine the culprit add-in.
<br />To disable add-in &gt; File &gt; Options &gt; Add-ins &gt; Down below you have Manage: Com Add-in : Press Go &gt; Untick the Add-ins to disable and tick to enable them

<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also,</p>
<p>I will not consider copying and moving my files due to syncing errors since last time I wasted a huge amount of valuable study time messing around with it and it never resolved itself.</p>
<p><br />

<p>And I saw previous discussions about the password for OneNote 2010 but it was no help to me.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am running Outlook 2013 (Swedish) and wonder why it's just possible to translate email text between English and German? Have I missed a setting somewhere?</p>

<p>The problem is that I have only English&nbsp;and German to choose from. No other languages are available. And there are no options in 'Choose item translation languages'. See&nbsp;attached image from the&nbsp;Translation Language&nbsp;Options window.&nbsp;(In Swedish though, I hope
 you can figure out&nbsp;the&nbsp;corresponding English named fields). </p>

<h2>            Outlook Calendar Embedded in Website - Mobile Version Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope there is a solution for this.</p>
<p>I have an Outlook calendar embedded in a web page.</p>
<p>The calendar functions with no problems in a pc base web browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when viewed on an android phone, the drop down "hamburger" (to select the month) does not function.</p>
<p>I can scroll forward and backward on the section that displays the days of the week.</p>
<p>And clicking on a calendar event scrambles the "days of the week" in the scroll bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Randy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting in our forum. To better understand your issue, may I confirm how you embedded the calendar to website? Via login Outlook Web App and publish the calendar to get HTML
 or ICS link then using HTML coding to embed it to a web site, or use any API to displaying it in webpage?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, since this issue symptom only occurs on Android phone device, to better help you, I suggest that you may contact our dedicated team for further assistance:

    <title>Protect Word - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mellow89  say:</h3>
<h2>            Protect Word</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Word template that employs a userform and different types of content control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I secured the the document, in a way that "unprotects" the actions of the userform and then "reprotects" the document after filling it out (see below). This code works like a charm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I have content controls in the document (that need to be populated), I selected "Filling in forms" when protecting it. But the thing is that I have one part in my header that needs to be filled out and even though I put a content control there too,
 there's no way the document lets me go there to type something, but just jumps to the next "open" content control. (I can't put it in the UserForm, because there will be two different people editing it after each other and the first one doesn't know what to
 put there).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I can't add exceptions to "filling in forms", I was just wondering if there's a way I can still access the header to edit it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the code is used to unprotect:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ActiveDocument.Unprotect Password:=""</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<br />
</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)">CODE (for the userform)</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<br />
<span>ActiveDocument.Protect Type:=wdAllowOnlyFormFields, NoReset:=True, Password:="" '</span></span></p>
<span>ActiveDocument.Protect Type:=wdAllowOnlyFormFields, NoReset:=True, Password:="" '</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Also, if there would be a way to allow users to remove&nbsp;unnecessary&nbsp;spaces within the protected document, that would be really great!!!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong><em>Follow-up:</em></strong> I just realized that even if I don't select "filling in forms", I can still edit them because of :=wdAllowOnlyFormFields. But even though I selected the content control in the header as an
 exception, it still won't let me edit it! Is there a code that I can still edit the header / a bookmark or content control in the header?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you!!!!!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I can only edit it, if I close the Userform before filling it out. But I need it to be the other way around, so that I can enter data in the header after the userform populated the document.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Alternatively it would be great if the protection would go away if it is saved.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Or I just need the template to be password protected so it can't be changed. The resulting "normal" document can be freely edited.</strong></p>

            <p>Hey Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. I'm using the UserForm to delete bookmarks out of the document (sharing buildingblocks is unfortunately not an option). The CC is to make it apparent and easier for the users to figure out where to enter data and to limit what to choose
 from (in some cases).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I protect my document and use it like above, I can use VBA for the Userform and people can enter their data, so it really works well. The problem is just the one thing in header that needs to be changed at a later stage in the process and I can't access
 that once protected (like I said, I can't put it in the UserForm, because the first person using this document (so the one selecting data from the UserForm) does not know what needs to in the header at a later stage, because the number going in the header
 is only created later by other people).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The people that will be using it know how to access it. But I just need to make sure, that no one intentionally updates the template with wrong info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!!!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you want to make it so that the only place that they can enter information is in the Content Controls, then you should select the body of the document and go to the Developer tab and click on the Group drop down and apply grouping to the selected text

    <title>Unable to use recovery tool with HTC One M8 &#40;T-Mobile&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> itchy.tasty.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to use recovery tool with HTC One M8 &#40;T-Mobile&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I installed the Win10 preview on my HTC One M8 to check it out. Pretty cool, but also buggy. But that's beside the point. I'd like to go back to Win8.1, but the recovery tool doesn't appear to work. The recovery tool asks me to hold both volume buttons and
 boot the phone to get to the boot-loader screen, at which point the recovery tool recognizes the phone and starts to reprogram it. It does this for hours and hours. I think I let it go for about 4 hours last night and it appears to do nothing. Even when I
 unplug or turn off the phone the recovery tool just continues to go and the phone remains as it was. I've tried on a Win10 preview desktop and a Win8.1 desktop. Am I doing something incorrectly or does the tool just not work?</p>

            Only power button and Vol Down button are supposed to be held, for 10 seconds.&nbsp; Not sure what holding both volume buttons do, but I had to do the reset and that's only a "soft" reset.&nbsp; You need a recovery tool provided by Microsoft (Nokia's recovery tool
 I believe).&nbsp; The problem is, I just installed it to do the same thing and it crashes - completely inoperable.

            <p>Update: You need to put your phone into bootloader mode.&nbsp; Use the Nokia software recovery tool 2.0.3 found here (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/support/faq/?action=singleTopic&amp;topic=FA142987)</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Power down your phone with it plugged in to your PC.&nbsp; When it vibrates, hold Vol Up + Volume Down and&nbsp; you'll get the white bootloader screen.&nbsp; The tool walks you through this and should get you squared away.&nbsp; I'm in the process of doing it now.</p>

            For anyone else having this problem, apparently the solution is to remove your SIM and SD cards. Worked like a charm after I did that. To reiterate, this is an HTC One M8 on T-Mobile using the Microsoft Windows Phone Recovery Tool.

            Unfortunately, this does not work for me on Verizon. I get to the point where it recognizes that I put the phone in boot-loader mode, then says there's no software package on the server for my device and nothing else happens.

            <p>so i got this to work finally. As soon as i turned the phone off, I held the volume buttons down (didn't wait for vibration). The bootloader screen appeared and I am now downloading the package. WPRT instructions a bit inaccurate.</p>

            I don't remember ever getting a gear with a lightning bolt... So these are the steps I followed: Unplug phone from computer, power off phone, remove SD and SIM, boot phone normally into Windows, plug phone into computer, start recovery tool (it should
 recognize your phone), go through the steps until it tells you to reboot your phone. Power down normally and make sure you hold the volume up and down buttons right when it vibrates and don't release them until you see the white screen and the text starts
 to populate. At that point, the recovery tool should start to install and (if I remember correctly) it will reboot and then come up with a black screen that tells you what it's doing. Then, just let it roll and replace your SIM when it's done.

            The only thing I can think of is that you are on Verizon (in which case the recovery tool will not work), you're not connecting to the server properly for some reason, or you're using a non-supported phone. The only phone that isn't a Lumia that's supported
 is the HTC One M8. &nbsp;Make sure you're in the list of supported phones.

            <p>I just got an email from Microsoft Community <strong><em>"Checking in on your recent question:outlook 2003 not receiving after comcast modem upgrade". &nbsp;</em></strong>No my qiuestion has not been answered. &nbsp;No Microsoft Community Replies were received. &nbsp;Comcast
 says their new modem upgrade should not impact Outlook 2003 - they say it is an existing Microsoft problem that was probably there before the modem installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My own research showed something about IPv6 being a possible problem and "to turn it off". &nbsp;BUT it may cause problems elsewhere. &nbsp;I am not skilled enough to turn it off (nor find it). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line I am still frustrated with Comcast for causing this problem.</p>

<p>&nbsp;- Two PCs - one desktop and one laptop - both running Windows&nbsp;8 and Office 365 Home premium. Prior to acquiring Office 365, I had all my contacts and appointments kept in a POP account, something that made it difficult to sync between the two pcs and my
 iphone / ipad. One of the major reasons for getting Office was just that - to be able to sync between all machines. What I have done:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- I copied all my 483 contacts from my POP contact list to my Outlook account Contact folder, some containing pictures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- I copied all my appointments from my POP calendar to my Outlook account Calendar</p>
<p>My expectation was (after the application of the latest office update), that these (contacts and calendar) will sync to Outlook.com (web) and subsequently to my laptop Outlook account.</p>
<p>Result:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Out of the 483 contacts I am missing 1 (don't know which one - yet), in Outlook.com (web). BUT they all "came" without pictures for the corresponding contacts and with some unexplained garbage in the notes section of the most contacts</p>
<p>&nbsp;- NONE of the calendar appointments synced - not a single one</p>
<p>&nbsp;- in my laptop only 26 contacts appeared out of the 482 that were in Outlook.com! In desperation, I deleted all contacts from my Outlook account in desktop pc and repeated the copying. This time laptop managed to sync 463&nbsp; - still missing some</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Of course NO appointments were synced to the laptop</p>
<p>Regarding appointments, if I attempt an edit in a given appointment in desktop Outlook account, it does sync both to Outlook.com as well as the laptop!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After this, and especially the fact that following the "promise" that the latest version would solve the sync issue, I am ready to give up with Microsoft office. Could anyone - please - suggest a solution?</p>

            <p>I wish I could help but I cannot other than to echo your complaints. I have three devices running Windows 8 (Dell desktop, Surface RT and WP8) and office 2013/365. My problem started with not all the contacts syncing to the desk top. I spent nearly two hours
 yesterday with the top level Microsoft help line and they made maters worse. I now have my contacts in triplicate across most devices (except the Windows Phone - HTC 8X - that will not sync at all) and the two new contacts are written in some form of code
 so make things more confusing.&nbsp; Emails sync fine. Calendars appear to be working - but the people/contacts are a complete mess. It has rendered my phone useless and I have to do a hard reboot just to look at my mail once before it no longer is viewable. I
 went to Verizon this morning to try and sort out the phone - they said it was a Microsoft issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought dedication to a platform was supposed to be rewarded with easy access across devices.&nbsp; I am about a day away dumping everything and moving to the Evil Empire Apple.</p>

            <p>I remember Microsoft having some sync issues from the old Activecync times (at that time, it was to sync outlook to windows mobile phone). Several years have gone by since then, BUT the syncing issues are still here! For me the biggest selling point of the
 Windows platform is the transferability of data across machines etc - if this has serious issues as several users complaint, then why bother?</p>
<p>This issue by the way was signaled by users since last October - it is very sad that they cannot solve it yet - pitty because I was thinking of giving up on my iphone and move to Windows&nbsp; -Not yet!</p>

            I gave up on Palm back in 1997 because they could not figure out how to sync with Outlook. Blackberry did it flawlessly for me for years but since I loved&nbsp;working in outlook I switched everything to Microsoft about four months ago. I find it disappointing
 that they cannot sync within outlook but I find it inexcusable that they cannot find a fix! It's one thing if something goes wrong - it's quite another to NOT HAVE ANY SOLUTION! I have spend hours with someone controlling my computer remotely, emailed my tech
 support contact, I have posted on the forums, heck I even tried emailing 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** in hopes of trying to get someone who can fix it. Nothing. What does it take?

            <p>Microsoft just disabled the Outlook post calendar to office.com function in order to push people to calendar.com so that pushed me to try Office 365. Until I prove that I can share a calendar, my primary calendar remains my pst file. I connected via exchange
 setting to office.com and deleted all old calendar appointments that existed due to unsuccessful attempts (that created duplicates)&nbsp;to upload the calendar to the "live calendar" aka Outlook.com calendar. I know of no way to clear out a calendar&nbsp;through the
 website except by&nbsp;creating a new calendar, switching the default and deleting the old one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I copied all calendar events from the pst folder to the exchange folder and that seemed to have carried all of the events, but it does not seem to be syncing up to the outlook.com website, who's default calendar remains blank.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My current suspicion is that these copied entries have an old modification date and consequently Outlook 2013 deems that they are not "new news" and does not synch them.</p>

            <p>Within my efforts to find a solution, I found a work around&nbsp; for Calendar. What I did was to copy the calendar items from my pst folder to the outlook folder. This by itself did not cause any synchronization - not a single appointment was passed over to
 Hotmail (outlook) web calendar and of course to my laptop.</p>
<p>The "trick" is fairly simple and 98% effective: </p>
<ol>
<li>I put the view in the desktop outlook calendar into list.</li><li>I selected all my appointments / events</li><li>I clicked on "categorize" and chose a random category for all.</li></ol>
<p>This simple action caused a sync to occur to web outlook calendar as well as the laptop. All BUT 1 appointment did not sync. This one just refused to sync even if I manually edited the description, time etc. - I don't know why, and gave up!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following this success I though that the same trick will apply to my contacts, but unfortunately it did not. What is worst, it made my trust in outlook even less. I thought of "categorizing" a contact in my laptop, expecting to see it being transferred over
 to the desktop (the categorization I mean, the contact itself existed already in both PCs. Well nothing happened!!! I even tried the "follow up" feature for a given contact - that did not transfer either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that Microsoft need to rethink the synchronization very seriously!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>So we're all 'gaining on it' but it's fair to say that this should work without our having to re-build contacts or calendars.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found some success on my HTC 8x windows phone by doing a complete wipe. The contacts (which are in triplicate on Office 2013/365 Home Premium) were rebuilt on the phone successfully except no photos were attached to the contact - not a big deal for
 me but others may be upset by that. The calendar and email and texts were all updated correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my issue used to be that the Office contacts would not sync with outlook.com contacts. Now I have three times the number of contacts and most of them are gibberish. I would imagine there is a way to wipe Outlook 2013 contacts and allow it to be rebuilt
 (like on the phone) by outlook.com. But I don't feel comfortable doing that solo. Can anyone help with that?</p>

            <p>Solution at last!!! In everyone's case the contacts appear to be safely stored on the outlook.com website but they often don't come down to the desktop (from the cloud if you will). This is clearly a problem and there is reason to believe the folks at Microsoft
 are very aware of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the fix - I exported the contacts from Outlook.com to a file. I then wiped my phone clean (full restart), I deleted all the contacts on the outlook.com site (since I had them safely saved to a file). Deleting the contacts on line took some time since
 there is no way to 'select all' - but I got it done by clicking them all individually. Then when the Surface RT and the desktop sync back up again the contacts disappear from each device. Once there were no contacts anywhere I added back the file to my Office
 2013/365 Home Premium. All the devices and outlook.com re-populated with the contacts. As an added benefit while the contacts were in Excel format it was easy to edit out duplicates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Caution - there is a HUGE risk in doing this. I have over 600 contacts and losing them would be catastrophic so use extreme care. Also - on&nbsp;some outlook.com contacts there is some gibberish in the notes field. The person at Microsoft whom I was working with
 said it was a sync log and it would be corrected when the fix is finally put in place. Also, for some reason the photos for the contacts that I had did not survive. I suspect this is because of when I wiped the phone I lost the associations with the photos
 but I am not sure and I really didn't have many photos for contacts so it is not a big deal for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For whatever reason starting fresh seems to allow the contacts to update as one would expect. For now it's working flawlessly.</p>

This worked for me for 95% of my appointments, thank you. It did not work on those which were tagged as meetings, which is the way some calendar import events from web services are formatted, for example airline confirmations. It sucks when you almost miss
 a flight because that was one of the few things that did not sync.</p>

Hi - when you say "...I added back the file to my Office 2013/365 Home Premium..." how did you do it? I tried importing both a CSV file as well as a PST and my office 365 at the very end of the step produced an error saying "Cannot complete operation because
 this is not supported by Service provider" - I don't have a clue what this means

<p>Do you have any control at all of the PC?&nbsp;&nbsp; Can you get to Recovery which will re-install W10?&nbsp; Not long ago, I had a W10 that would not install Office 2016 and even MS could not fix it.&nbsp; I just ran Recovery which removed the apps but kept the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently fried my 14942 by re-installing Norton.&nbsp; I just used the Media Creation Tool to get a bootable USB with a BIOS load which got&nbsp; me 14393 then fast lane back to 14946.&nbsp; If you have no control, you have limited options.</p>

            <p>Try installing the public build to a small partition to see if it auto-activates. &nbsp;You can shrink C: by 32-64GB and then boot with a Windows 10 install USB for build 14393. Custom install to the unpartitioned space. It will create a partition and install
 the public build. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Do not enter any Product Key at any time during install</span>.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Another thing you could try first is to run the Activation Troubleshooter. Run&nbsp;<strong>changepk.exe /Troubleshoot</strong> to launch it. It may find the&nbsp;<em>Digital license</em> for that PC&nbsp;that is linked to your Microsoft account. &nbsp;If it doesn't find it
 right away, indicate that you changed hardware and see what it finds.</p>

<p>@jim - You did exactly what I did - you re-installed Norton and fried your W10.&nbsp; Forget all the free advice and follow some free advice -</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; On another PC , download the Media Creation Tool and request&nbsp; a bootable USB for use on another PC</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to BIOS and change to load from USB</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp; This will give you 14393</p>
<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the choice, stay on Anniversary build or go again to Fast Lane to 14946</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your choices are somewhat limited - you have an useless W10.&nbsp; This process is fairly fast, 1 re-install to W10 and another upgrade to Insiders, if desired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will be a clean install which has built in advantages in that it gets rid of junk.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will lose your apps but should get your files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know what I am talking about.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just did it a few days ago on this very laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BIOS install works.&nbsp; You need to change&nbsp; BIOS and then re-boot with the USB in.&nbsp;&nbsp; The install should start and basically just go default.&nbsp; The data&nbsp; should load from the USB to the hard drive.&nbsp; You will then be asked to remove the USB for the install.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Keep in mind that you will once again have to change the BOPS back to C at some point in the install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been there, done that very recently.</p>

    <title>Cannot switch to form view in access 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamterrell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot switch to form view in access 2010</h2>
                    <p>I recently created&nbsp;a new form in access 2010 but cannot seem to switch to form view.&nbsp; This same problem now affects all previously created forms.&nbsp; Here is brief description of the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I open any form while on the 'Home' tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The View automatically defaults to 'Layout' view.&nbsp; When I click on the dropdown menu at far right (View icon)&nbsp;three choices appear: Form, Layout and Design.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can switch to 'Design' view with no problem.&nbsp; But when I click on the 'Form' view selection&nbsp;the 'Layout' icon remains, although the form
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">appears</span> to be in 'Form' view.&nbsp; If I then type anything in any field (I am in a&nbsp;split screen form) whatever I type appears in every record in that field.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's going on?&nbsp; How do I get the 'Form' view back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp; I am still somewhat of a novice with Access and appreciate any help I can get.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your advice I did the compact and repair, but that did not solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue first appeared as I was creating a new form.&nbsp; Upon further investigation I determined that this problem only existed with that particular form.&nbsp; So I deleted the form and started a new one and did not encounter the problem again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will keep the c and c option in mind for the future (that was new to me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the help.</p>
