<p><span><span>Hi be with nell,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try performing a clean boot and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may refer the following KB article to put the computer in clean boot:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot, then follow the steps mentioned in the above KB article to narrow down
 the exact source.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also, after resolving the issue, see the section on the clean boot link to how to return your computer to a Normal startup
 mode by following the steps under “Reset the computer to start as usual.</span></span></p>

    <title>Windows 7 Slowdown &#47; hang on file copy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ambos22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Slowdown &#47; hang on file copy</h2>
                    Hi- I have a home-built PC (Core 2 Duo, nvidia chipset) recently upgraded from Vista 32 to Win7 64. &nbsp;Installation was smooth and most software works properly. &nbsp;However, the system has started to hang or become extremely slow on file copy. &nbsp;Once this happens
 it takes several minutes for ctrl-alt-del to bring up the task manager and it is not possible to recover except via hard reboot (reset switch).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I first noticed this when importing files into Lightroom2. &nbsp;However, it now happens on any large job copying files (total more than 500 mb). &nbsp;It might be worse with my two SATA drives.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>BIOS, motherboard and graphic card drivers are all up to date and changing them did not alter the problem at all. &nbsp;This exact hardware configuration worked well under Vista32 for a year or so. &nbsp;No other application (photoshop, games, IE, Media Player,
 etc) shows any instability.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The logs show nothing unusual except that a service called "VSS" fails to load properly on bootup. &nbsp;I'm not using RAID or any MS backup service (though I do use Carbonite).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>

                </div>

</span></span></span><span>On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</span></p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for Linux - Webcam</h2>
                    <p>Just "updated" Skype for Linux. Now my camera no longer works. My camera still works fine with Cheese and Guvcview. Yet the camera is grayed out in Skype, and I can only call someone using sound, no image. When I try to turn on my camera via the "Audio and
 Video Settings", all it says is "No Device Found", and there is nothing that I can do.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To avoid this asinine almost automatic reply about my system being good enough or the other party also having a recent enough version of Skype, I want to state the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* My computer has an i7 octa-core processor.</p>
<p>* I have 16G Ram and a 1T hard drive (70% empty)</p>
<p>* The webcam that I use is a Logitech C615, one of the recommended ones by Skype!</p>
<p>* When I call my contacts, I can see them, but I cannot turn on my camera.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have pulled out the camera out of a USB port and put it back in,</p>
<p>but this didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not install any software when getting the Logitech C615, it just</p>
<p>worked. I did not need to download a driver. Logitech does indeed</p>
<p>offer software, but not for Linux. In any case, that software is a program</p>
<p>like Cheese or Guvcview, so I didn't need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked and posted around and on the ask.ubuntu forum someone suggested</p>
<p>"downgrading" the version of Skype. I'm now running Skype version 8.11.0.4,</p>
<p>and things appear to be working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, all's well that ends well,</p>

                    <p>I loaded into a game of fortnite on “save the world.” One of the other players kept trying to start the mission without allowing us to build any defenses to allow us to pass. I posted in game chat to quit,as I couldn’t even attempt to build as I had to continuously cancel the mission start. So to solve this issue I simply quit and went to loading a new one,a player messages me stating I was being reported,I asked why and he implied I was then the one causing issues in game,I explained my case as I was NOT the one doing it and he kept antagonizing me trying to get me to do something that he COULD legit report me. Well he succeeded and got under my skin causing a&nbsp;response that consisted of “report the player who was actually causing the problems,the f*** outta here with that.” I do realize i messed up by sending the&nbsp;“f” word and I apologize, he just REALLY got&nbsp;under my skin By trying to falsely report me.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>100MB System Reserved partition.. Need help please - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> calebm79  say:</h3>
<h2>            100MB System Reserved partition.. Need help please</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys funny story I've had this computer for going on 2 years now. When I bought it I was told it had 2 x 250GB HDD's and 1 x 500GB HDD. When I go to my computer it shows 2 HDD's both 500GB each. I just assumed the 2 x 250GB were showing as one. Thats
 what they told me at the store I bought it from. Well after some issues with my computer I had to take it apart for some maintenance.. I discovered that I had 3 x 500GB HDD's! lol &nbsp;Been deleting stuff for quite a while now to make space for different stuff
 so the extra 500GB will be really nice. I went to disk manager and the other drive shows it has that 100MB System Reserved at the beginning of the unused disk. And nearly 500GB Unallocated... I know the System Reserved is Boot files and it cannot be deleted.
 But how do I make windows recognize the extra HDD and be able to use it for mass storage as I can with the other 2?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please dumb it down a bit for me and give me very detailed instructions on how to do it.. I know a bit more than the average person about general functions. But when it comes to more technical stuff like using the boot up screen or command prompt or anything
 else that someone should really know what they are doing before they touch it.. yeah.. not real great in those areas lol. So step by step instructions would be helpful. Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And btw this is a fairly high end gaming laptop. Which is why I've never opened it up to see whats in it not as easy as a desktop. And just took what the store said when I bought it as truth.. And honestly didnt even know about the Disk Management tool til
 today lol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>Format the unallocated space to make a new partition. You can do this in Disk Management.</p>
<p>You should be able to create either a Primary Partition or Logical Drive.</p>
<p>As long as you don't delete the Reserved Partition (or partitions on your other HDD's) you can play around with the formatting options on the unallocated space without any harm.</p>
<p>A 'quick format' should be fine on a drive with no data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on the Help tab at the top of Disk management&nbsp; for more information on how to create partitions
</p>
<p>and do other things in Disk Management. It also explains the differences between&nbsp; Primary Partitions, Logical Drive... and more.</p>
<p>There would also be tutorials in the ether.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use a laptop, but would think that must be a monster laptop to have three HDD's.</p>

            <p>You only need one System Reserved partition and is normally on the same physical drive as the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is more than one it would indicate that the extra drive has been used to install Windows at some time. Disk Manager will protect the active System Reserved so if it can be deleted then it is not the active one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>New Simple Volume is a new partition.</p>

            The System Reserved partition is the only one I see.. So I'm guessing that is the one it needs. Still needing detailed instructions on how to make the hard drive usable as mass storage...&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>d. Type the size of the volume you want to create in megabytes (MB) or accept the maximum default size, and then click Next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>e. Accept the default drive letter or choose a different drive letter to identify the partition, and then click Next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>f. In the Format Partition dialog box, do one of the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want to format the volume right now, click Do not format this volume, and then click Next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To format the volume with the default settings, click Next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>g. Review your choices, and then click Finish.</p>

            Hello Eldon. I suggest following the guide here on getting rid of the write-protected error on that disk.

            If the instructions by Zackary do not help, probably the drive has gone bad and you would need to replace it.
<br />Write protected error message is a common indication of drive going bad.

            Hi Eldon,
<br />
<br />The Official Windows 10 Installation media on USB FLash Drive cannot be reused, Microsoft have somehow protected that drive which makes it impossible to re-use - Sorry !

                    <p>there is a broken url on the Microsoft server that is currently affecting most windows operating systems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you boot up your system you will see it is flooded with event id 131&nbsp; metadata staging failed</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tracked this down to the following url:&nbsp;&nbsp; microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=252669+clcid=0x409</p>
<p>
</p><p>which is the device meta data url:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>this link is in the following registry key:&nbsp; I cannot post the link as I am not permitted:&nbsp; it contains Link ID 252669&amp;clcid = 0x409 and can be easily viewed via the registry key as shown</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY LOCAL MACHINE - SOFTWARE-MICROSOFT-WINDOWS-CURRENT VERSION-DEVICE METADATA</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the link in the registry is unable to function is generating the event 131 -&nbsp; I have tried calling Microsoft several times to report the malfunctioning url and told the community site is the best place to get this url repaired because it will be
 viewed by engineers and moderators.</p>
<p>I hope someone reads this and points me in the right direction.&nbsp; I have put a lot of research into the culprit generating the errors and many people on the community site are also raising this issue since 9.00 am uk time 6th May</p>

            <p>no there is nothing blocking redirection, the systems, all nine of them are up to date, they are all doing the same thing.&nbsp; I have also been seen other members on the forum with the same issue who confirm the issue started yesterday at the same I recorded
 it 9 to 9.30 6th may.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error also occurs at my husbands place of employment on more than 80 stand alone laptops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this is not the first time this has happened, it happened last September and is well documented on the windows eight forum:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I went to the library and checked their windows 8 system low and behold, the same event 131 error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate what you say about the forwarding of the url working when you test it, but is working when the system tries to use it &nbsp;automatically.&nbsp; What operating system are you using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try going to hardware and devices in control panel, devices and printers and refresh the devices page.</p>
<p>You may find event id 131 pops up in your event log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assure you it is not isolated, I spoke with Microsoft this morning and they actually described the link as 'dead'&nbsp;.&nbsp; They did not give a timescale for it to be 'reborn'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind&nbsp;Regards&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you so much for your offer to escalate this issue.&nbsp; If it was my PC alone I would not trouble you, but I have 9 laptops and my husband has around 80 at work and then there are the other forum members with this issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I appreciate some users do not check there event log that often and it may not be apparent to them yet and we are not seeing the big picture just now.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I check my log daily!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft UK support checked the URL for me today and said it was dead but did not state what action if any they would take, a little bit of a lack of interest, but they are always so busy.</p>
<p>

    <title>Auto-playlist contents will not appear on Sony Bluray Player DLNA - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Auto-playlist contents will not appear on Sony Bluray Player DLNA</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Sony Bluray player BDS3500 will play all files from my WMP DLNA server, it will also show and play manual video playlists created in WMP. However, it will not show the contents of auto-playlists created in WMP. It does show the playlists listed, but when
 I try to view their contents on the bluray player it will say "no files" message or something of this sort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a reason why auto-playlist contents are not shown on the bluray player? I tried deleting the autoplaylists and re-adding them, but their content will never be shown on the bluray player. Manual playlists work fine. Btw, all playlists contain video
 files only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
                </div>

<div>It looks like you are describing using your Sony BD player to PULL content from</div>
<div>the computer as opposed to PUSH (Play To) by browsing using menus on the Sony</div>
<div>device. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Autoplaylists are created "on the fly" and in a sense, are proprietary to WMP.</div>
<div>If you open an auto playlist with a text editor, you would see something like</div>
<div>the sample below (which is from an audio playlist, but the principle is the</div>
<div>same). There is no actual meta data included for the other device to "read". </div>

<h2>            Queda de frames no Forza Motorsport 7 &#91;Fall of frames in Forza Motorsport 7&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Comprei recentemente um notebook Acer Predator G3-572-75L9 Helios 300 principalmente para jogar o Forza Motorsport 7 e não estou conseguindo. Já tentei algumas coisas e não consegui sucesso. O interessante é que baixei o Forza Horizon 4 para saber se o problema
 esta no hardware e ele funcionou perfeitamente. Gostaria de ajuda de vocês!!!!</p>

<p>Hi Alexandre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated on the situation. I'm sorry to hear the issue is still persisting, I'd be happy to try and help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may seem like an obvious step, but if you haven't already done so, I recommend completely restarting your PC. Then check if your device needs a software or driver update.

<h3> skilmar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Didn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t receive access code for free game &#40;deal ended March 31&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased an Xbox One + Kinect bundle in March online from the Microsoft store. At the time, the website said that if you purchased by March 31, you'd get a code for one of three games: one of the Assassin's Creed games, and two other options. I initially
 didn't receive a code or anything, and I contacted support. They told me I should receive notification within 10 days of purchase -- and that time has passed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did anyone else buy when this free game deal was on? How did you get notified about your download?</p>

<p>Hi there Skilmar,</p>
<p>I am sorry that you're experiencing this issue. I would suggest either checking your spam folder in your email, checking your Microsoft Digital Content (<a href="https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/DisplayDownloadHistoryPage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoftstore.com/.../DisplayDownloadHistoryPage</a>)
 or either try seeing the package you purchased and see how you should receive the code.
</p>
<p>It might have already been sent but you could've used another email or checked out as a guest. Try looking through some of your email(s) folder and see if you might have sent it to another email.
</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>GUNZxNxROSEZ</p>

<p>Actually, I've searched my email -- spam, trash, and everything else -- for "microsoft". While I have all of the notifications of shipments and purchase of the bundle, nothing on the extras.</p>
<p>There were three games that came with the bundle and I received access codes in the box. The game that I did not received was only listed on the purchasing page on the website.</p>
<p>Nothing on Microsoft Digital Content.</p>
<p>Did anyone else purchase an Xbox One in the last couple of months with the same deal? How did you receive notification or access code?</p>

                    <p>So I&nbsp;recently got a new controller, the wired afterglow one for xbox one. Only reason I&nbsp;got it was bc my original xbox wireless controller didnt have a mic amp and I&nbsp;couldnt find an adapter anywhere. So I've been having trouble hearing through my new headset (astro A10's) and my boyfriend suggested I&nbsp;update my controller bc right now it's only at firmware version 1.1.43.0 and he says his is 3 something. My first question is why is my brand new controller not already updated to the lastest version???? anyways, when I&nbsp;go to the settings to try and update my controller the firmware box is greyed out and I&nbsp;can't even scroll over it. so how am I&nbsp;supposed to update it?? anyone have this same problem or now how to fix it?</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>edit: just decided to plug in my wireless controller and see if it would update. it does with ease. so is there something wrong my afterglow controller? cant be my xbox or anything bc my wireless controller ju

<h2>            uptime.exe utility not on Microsoft website</h2>
                    <p>I'm in need of the&nbsp;<em>official</em> uptime.exe utility from Microsoft, however there is yet another 404 error when trying to get to it (sick of Microsoft deleting important webpages. what, are they out of space or something?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link should be https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/232243</p>
<p>
</p><p>but it provides a 404 error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the link from this working page:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/555737/how-to-find-windows-uptime</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I found a version of it that&nbsp;<em>seems</em> legitimate. But I would rest much better knowing I'm using an official Microsoft copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I spent 30 minutes trying to tell the staff of their problem but when accessing chat support I was told they cant help (after telling me to clear my cache and stuff, which of course I already tried), and given a phone number that doesn't let me talk to anyone
 unless I pay $100.</p>

                    Everything on my HDDs were deleted so I had to install gears again except this time the file size is way larger than I remember it being. It's been downloading for a little over a day now and it just broke 181.3GB out of 181.3GB. The end mark just keeps
 increasing everytime it gets close to finishing. As i finished that senetence the end mark is now 181.3 GB. What's the reason for this? Is this normal? Is there anything I can do so i can download it again?

                    <p>I have had this laptop since Christmas and it was fine then, but now 28.3 GB out of 29 GB are taken up! I just got an external drive the other day and it's helping some. I'm really confused, I already did the disk clean up, I fragmented my drive the other
 day and I used CCleaner to see if anything else was lurking on my drive. About half of the internal drive space is taken up by system files (which is ridiculous) and I have 3 games downloaded to my computers internal drive that don't take up much space themselves
 along with maybe a gig or two of downloads for one of the games that I saved to my EXTERNAL drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is always a problem when it comes to me and computers for some reason... If you'd like to know more, we can talk in the replies! Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(Also, I need to somehow free up 8 GB for the Windows update. I was wondering if I could put the update onto my external drive and somehow transfer it over?)</p>

            Hi S.B.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I think I answered you earlier but just in case it's a different person I'm repeating it here:
<br />
<br />There are tips here for managing smaller drives including 32gb drives: 
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br />Then for version Upgrades what works best is to install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files. 
<br />
<br />If that's not enough then clean out the Upgrade Assistant and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.

Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

    <title>Windows 10 Settings is Frozen&#47;Unresponsive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulaubin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Settings is Frozen&#47;Unresponsive</h2>
                    <p><span>I am running Win 10 and I recently noticed that none of the Settings apps is working.&nbsp; When I click on the settings icon from the Start button the Settings window opens but clicking on any of the icons in that window does nothing.&nbsp; If I right
 click on the task bar and select Taskbar Settings that window opens in a frozen state so that none of the buttons responds to the mouse.&nbsp; This seems to be a fairly common problem but I have yet to find a simple solution.&nbsp; Any help would be much appreciated.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I posted this question several weeks ago and was advised to r</span><span>un SFC and DISM which I did without resolution. &nbsp; When I told the agent that this did no resolve my problem there was no response.&nbsp; My thread was dropped.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have seen this problem posted numerous times on this site so I know it is fairly widespread but so far I have yet to read about an actual solution.&nbsp; I don't know whether the problem has been too complex to solve or if Microsoft simply has
 bigger fish to fry.&nbsp; But without access to any of the items in Settings the functionality of Windows is extremely limited.&nbsp; This needs to be fixed.</span></p>

            Try following and check after each step
<br />
<br />1. Try invoking Settings App from other Places and let me know whether Settings is working or not
<br />a. Windows Key+I invokes Settings App
<br />b. Click on the action center icon (in system tray) and then click All Settings
<br />
<br />2. Reinstall Setting app
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below and paste into Powershell &gt; Enter &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -Name Windows.Immersivecontrolpanel | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />3. Re-register All apps (You will get many reds, ignore them)
<br />Type Powershell in Windows Start Search box &gt; Right click on Powershell &gt; Run As Administrator &gt; Paste the following command in the PowerShell window and press Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />4. For Testing only - Create a New User Account and login with this new User Account to rule out corruption in user profile
<br />Windows key+R &gt; Type lusrmgr.msc and Enter &gt; In the lusrmgr window, right click Users and select New user &gt;  Fill the new user required information and click Create &gt; One the new user account is created, sign-out from your account and sign-in to new user account. 
<br />
<br />5. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />

<br />
<br />6. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<p>I have actually tried several of the solutions you recommended including reinstalling and reregistering the Settings App based on my reading of other threads relating to this problem, all to no avail.&nbsp; But I was very surprised to see that opening Settings
 from Windows Key + I allowed me to access all settings without any problems!&nbsp; So thank you very much for that!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does seem like some type of problem still exists and at some point in the future I may go ahead and run the repair upgrade as you suggested, but for now I am happy to be able to make changes to Windows settings.</p>
<p>

<p>Unfortunately the above appears to have been a fluke.&nbsp; I just tried to access Settings through Windows Key + I again and the resulting window was frozen just like before.&nbsp; I've tried a number of times now and I get varying levels of functionality but none
 has been fully functional like the first time I tried, so this was not a fix after all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try the repair upgrade as you suggested and let you know what happens.</p>

<p>I did the repair upgrade overnight and I wanted to wait until my system was done updating before reporting back in.&nbsp; After installing all updates and restarting a number of times I am happy to report that I seem to have a fully functioning Settings app once
 again!&nbsp; So for me, the repair upgrade was the solution to this problem.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Validation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anluis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Validation</h2>
                    I did a clean installation of Windows 10&nbsp;using the Media Creation Tool, here it is:
<span>
<span>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/en-US/software-download/windows10?OCID=reserve_r_PostReserve_MediaCreationTool</p>
<p>
</p><p>When installing I placed my Windows 8 license that I bought online on Windows Store back in 11/11/2012, it did not accept the license, so I skipped the process and continue installing. After I finished installing, I tried to validate Windows 10 with this
 license, and again I got an error. Windows 10 won't validate with&nbsp;my windows 8 genuine key. What can I do? Please help. I will not give up my freedom to do a clean install of Windows 10. I don't trust upgrades, there's always software issues with upgrades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            You probably just installed PRO edition, while having your product key of HOME edition. If so, you need to reinstall.

            <p>Hi rePhat:</p>
<p>
</p><p>No I didn't, I know the difference. I repair computers, I can't count the many times that I installed Windows, all versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Windows 10 Pro, and my license is Windows 8 Pro. I'm 100% sure about that. I did the 8.1 upgrade and had Windows Media Center, but remember those upgrades were free. So, my license is Windows 8 Pro, that I bought online on Windows Store back
 on 11/11/2012. Windows 8 Pro&nbsp;had came out on October, 2012, and Microsoft had an&nbsp;offer from October, 2012 to January, 2013&nbsp;for 39.99 online. They were also offering free Windows Media Center licenses online, I remember I got one of those too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, but your wrong.</p>

            <p>Hi Bryan: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, I'm already back on Windows 8.1, I was lucky to have a backup image of Windows 8.1 on one of my HDD's. It wasn't easy to make the image work on Windows 10, but I finally got it. The image was from January, 2015, so right now I'm installing
 144 regular updates, and 9 optional. I'll be doing that for a while. Since I already downloaded the Windows 10 .iso from&nbsp;Microsoft,&nbsp;I was thinking of doing the Windows 10 upgrade without all those updates to save some time.&nbsp; Then I figured that it's better
 to do the Windows 10 reserve first, so I will not have any other issues with the activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>
