<h2>            Plugged in&#47;Not Charging after Windows 10 upgrade.</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a Dell Precision M4700 laptop. It was a Certified refurbished pc and worked just fine when I first got it. Then I started doing updates and once it installed Win 10, I got the "plugged in, not charging" message. I contacted the vendor
 and they overnighted a new battery out. I plugged that in and NOTHING! I looked online for solutions and upgraded everything I possibly could, uninstalled and reinstalled drivers (yes, did the Device Manger/Battery uninstall trick to no avail) and still can't
 get this thing to charge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is this: Is there a patch or an update that I haven't come across that fixes this issue, since it's obviously a software issue. Like i said, it worked fine up until I started the updates. I have 2 batteries, one actually brand new, and the problem
 still won't go away. Any help will be appreciated. Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>I got it from Newegg as a refurb. The computer came with Windows 7 but was advertised as coming with the upgrade. While updating all the software, it started automatically downloading Win 10. The laptop is still under warranty but I originally purchased
 this laptop to have a pc to go on the road (my band is getting ready to go on tour in 2 weeks) and if I send this back I probably won't get it back in time to go on the road. So, I'm kinda stuck. If I didn't have this tour coming up, I'd definitely send it
 back. As far as the version of Win 10, it's 1607, OS build 14393.1358.</p>

ham-fisted moderator</a> has moved your thread from the Win10/Update, Backup&nbsp;&amp; Recovery forum to the Win10/Hardware forum</em>.]</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You never know who refurbished a used computer (it's seldom the seller) or how it was refurbished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If a Dell disk was used to "refurbish" the computer (doubtful), chances are the disk installed a McAfee free-trial. McAfee (and Norton) application are notorious for not uninstalling "cleanly." If any free-trialware was not FULLY removed prior to the
 upgraded to Win10, your options now are limited to doing a clean install of Win10 Version 1703. [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. You cannot trust the security of any used computer unless &amp; until YOU have formatted the HDD and then done a clean install of Windows - or paid someone to do it for you. [Again, I can guarantee you that Newegg did NOT do this!]</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. There's a very good chance that the replacement battery Newegg sent you was a "remanufactured" (by who?) battery. Ideally, you'd purchase a brand-new battery from Dell (who also sell reliable "remanufactured" batteries).</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. There a good chance the computer hardware is not fully-compatible with Windows 10 Version 1703.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Now for the biggy: The free "upgrade to Win10" offer expired on 29 July 2016 - so I have no idea (a) how it&nbsp;"started automatically downloading/installing Win 10" or (b) if your install of Win10 is legit (activated).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dunno (and don't wanna know) how much you paid for the Dell but unless you can use it on-the-road on AC power 24/7, you might be better off returning it then using the refund (or credit, more likely) to purchase a brand-new,&nbsp;low-end (i.e., cheap)&nbsp;"Netbook"
 with Win10 preinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event - and assuming the upgrade <em>was</em> legit &amp; the hardware <em>
is </em>fully-compatible, it's apparently a hardware problem (e.g., "bad" battery; "bad" power system; "bad" power cord/charger). Only an on-site repairman could fix it - and that'd cost you at least $150.00 USD just to have him look at it. Why throw away any
 more moola?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck, and have a great your anyway. Trust me: You can <em>live</em> without a computer, the internet, and even a mobile device!</p>

<p>The Windows upgrade was legit. It said it came with it, although there is a sticker on the laptop that says Win 7. It automatically upgraded when I did the updating. I also read that several other laptops had this same issue when they upgraded to 10. It's
 been said that it's a software issue and that the manufacturers and Microsoft have been playing the blame game, all the while the customer still hasn't had a fix for their issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I could do without an electronic device. However, I plan on vlogging this tour and updating our tour as we go, so in order to do that I need a computer and WiFi, which 99% of hotels have. I need to do editing which can only be done on a computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the refurb goes, it was a Microsoft Certified refurbished computer. There were others but I decided to go with a certified one, hoping that if I had issues, Microsoft would help me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop has a Core i7 processor so I'm guessing that it would be compatible with Windows 10, especially since they said it was supposed to come with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This laptop had no McAfee or Norton software with it. I also did a reset of the computer when I got it, hoping that would fix my issue. I do have Avast on it now since I also have Avast on my desktop pc, but I put that on it after I updated everything and
 reset it.&nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Was the refurbishment <em>certified by Microsoft</em> or was it done by a <em>
Microsoft Certified</em> tech or repair shop? I suspect the latter and the fact that&nbsp;a tech/shop&nbsp;was "Microsoft Certified" doesn't mean much -&nbsp;and it
<em>certainly </em>doesn't mean that Microsoft (or Dell) stands behind the work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that's really moot now. The computer you bought is what it is. Moving on...</p>

<p>1. REPOSTING =&gt; When (exact date, preferably) did you purchase the refurbished Dell computer from newegg.com?</p>

<p>
</p><p>5. What, if any, third-party anti-virus application was installed when you were still running Windows 7 (i.e., before you upgraded to Win10)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6a. Assuming you installed Avast after you upgraded to Win10 and/or after you did the reset, was

<h2>            How to create an ad-hoc network in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Please don't confuse between ad-hoc and hotspot, I have asked for ad-hoc and not for hotspot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the commands for creating a hotspot using CMD but as now the experimenting microsoft has removed the option of creating an ad-hoc network from
<em><strong>Network and Sharing Centre &gt; set up a new connection or network</strong></em> section as was present in Windows 7, it is a mystery for me to create that type of ad-hoc network now with Windows 8, 8.1 and 10.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 doesn&#39;t recognize a new external drive.</h2>
                    <p>I installed a new Western Digital 3t drive on my Dell Windows 10 desktop computer. &nbsp;Windows File Explorer doesn't show the new drive, so I can't send backups to it or do anything else with it. &nbsp;Windows Device Manager shows the new drive and reports that
 it is working properly. &nbsp;I tried restarting the computer, removing and reinserting the drive power cord and I moved the new drive to a different usb port and restarted again. &nbsp;How do I get the new drive to be visible in Windows File Explorer?</p>

<p>If MSE is flagging it, then there is probably a problem!</p>
<p>There should be no need to turn off an Anti-Virus to install drivers.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do NOT post phone numbers, or <strong>Product Keys online, if you do not want your product key to be stolen</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not tell us what type of License you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Laptop came with the Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc) , that Product Key that came with the Laptop is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines)&nbsp;is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above&nbsp;rule also applies to OEM System Builders Licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Retail Operating System&nbsp;License, that you buy and install yourself, are allowed to be transferred to another machine.</p>
<p>And Retail Licenses can also only be installed on one machine at any particular time.</p>

<h2>            Display 1 and Display 2 are joined on one display when trying to duplicate&#47;clone. Win 7</h2>
                    I am losing my mind over this! I have a Dell XPS laptop with a GeForce GT 555M graphics card. I am running Windows 7. &nbsp;I am trying to clone my display 1 (laptop) to display 2 (an Epson PJ projector). Every time I attempt to do this, my display 1 and display
 2 both end up on my laptop icon and what should be my display2 then becomes display 3. It is as if displays 1 and 2 are sharing my laptop screen, while nothing is making it to the projector. This is the third time I have had this happen and I have no idea
 why it happens, and I also have no idea how I corrected this the two previous time. I can extend D1 to D2 fine, and I can switch displays fine as well. I only have this problem when I try to clone to either my projector or a second monitor when I am using
 it. How do I keep display 2 from piggy-backing itself to my display 1? No matter what I have tried, I cannot get the clone/duplicate to actually go to the projector.

            I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

    <title>Why is my PC suddenly not working properly &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vickytorial  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is my PC suddenly not working properly &#63;</h2>
                    <p>My PC used to be very fast, but ever since I updated it to the latest Windows 10 version a few weeks ago it started taking ages to boot up the PC. I went to various sites to see what to do, but they say to reboot the PC, because some people never shut down
 it, just let it sleep or hibernate, and that makes it really slow. But most of the time I shut down my PC after i use it. It also told me to use task manager to see if any apps are hogging the CPU or Memory. When I just booted up my PC, the CPU was 25% and
 memory was 99%. I couldn't even open any apps, not even the windows menu bar or Cortana. After a while the CPU was still 25% but the memory had dropped to 38%. Now all I can open are browsers, because if I try to open anything else it says Class not registered,
 which is weird because yesterday it worked fine. The website also said to check for malware, but I can't afford to do it. The Windows menu bar and Cortana still doesn't work. So I can't shut down the PC properly, I can only leave it on or do a cold shut down,
 and apparently both options will affect the PC. Also, sometimes when I boot up my PC it turns up a black screen. Is there a way to fix this? This is a really expensive PC and I don't want to damage it by messing with it more. Thanks</p>

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. I am Rob, a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting.
<br /> 
<br />The next reply will be how to check for malware free, if you really think that is needed.
<br />
<br />I would do a Performance check for the entire system.
<br />
<br />If using an SSD or hybrid hard drive be sure it has the latest firmware.
<br />
<br />Try the Clean Boot method to see if a startup program is involved - if so it is a  process of elimination :
<br />

<br />If you had a 3rd party antivirus on the OS you upgraded OR if you have one now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus. Despite all the hype out there
<br />Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are true superstars.

<br />
<br />The below is additional help with some of the methods in the "Tips to improve...." link.
<br />
<br />Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)  OR  Windows PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />(Run these one line at a time.)
<br />
<br />SFC /scannow
<br />
<br />Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />When that completes run these :
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />Then restart the computer.
<br />
<br />------
<br />
<br />
<br />Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS, chipset drivers, and all the major device drivers.
<br />
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click Start Button - Right Click Start Button - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -  REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<h2>            windows 7 photo viewer for canon 5dsr</h2>
                    <p>I just got the Canon 5DS-R digital camera. It required an update to Adobe Raw 9.1 in order for Photoshop to open the RAW (CR2) files. However, my windows 7 Photo Viewer will not recognize the files to open them for viewing in windows Photo Viewer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded and installed the newest Miscrosoft Camera Codec Pack X86 and the files still will not open...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the following error message when I try to open the files </p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows Photo Viewer cant open this picture because either Photo Viewer doesnt support the file format, or you dont have the latest updates to Photo Viewer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or suggestions please... Or is there NO FIX to this at this time due to the newness of the camera..</p>

<h2>            Periodic Disconnecting &#43; A Server Runtime Error ... -.-</h2>
                    
<p>First off, I couldn't post on the original account of mine because of a server runtime error that I received whenever I tried going onto the forums, which sounds like this:</p>
Server Error in '/' Application.
<hr />
<i>Runtime Error</i>
<p><span><span><b>Description:
</b>An application error occurred on the server. The current custom error settings for this application prevent the details of the application error from being viewed remotely (for security reasons). It could, however, be viewed by browsers running on the local
 server machine. <br />
<br />
<b>Details:</b> To enable the details of this specific error message to be viewable on remote machines, please create a &lt;customErrors&gt; tag within a "web.config" configuration file located in the root directory of the current web application. This &lt;customErrors&gt;
 tag should then have its "mode" attribute set to "Off".<br />
<br />

    &lt;/system.web&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;</pre>
</td>

</tbody>

<p><span><span><br />
<b>Notes:</b> The current error page you are seeing can be replaced by a custom error page by modifying the "defaultRedirect" attribute of the application's &lt;customErrors&gt; configuration tag to point to a custom error page URL.<br />
<br />

<p>What does this mean? It sounds like I was banned, but I can sign into my profile (I can't connect to xbox live, hence my second problem, but I can sign in.)</p>

<p>Second problem:</p>
<p>My Xbox LIVE account keeps disconnecting after 20-30 minutes of gameplay. I was not in a party in a while, fearing the impending disconnect, and all of the problems started when a got a new game (The Sims 3), and got a title update that froze in between,
 causing me to turn off my xbox. When I turned it back on, I deleted the corrupt update file and tried again.</p>
<p>The update would get closer and closer to being done every time, after repeating the rote tasks of:</p>
<p>waiting to see how far it would go, canceling the update because it stopped, power cycling my router to get it back up and running, and finally getting the update done.</p>
<p>Finally I got the update done, but the Xbox LIVE service would disconnect every 20-30 minutes while my Wifi was still up and running. There's no reason for the xbox to be disconnecting like this, I've reset my wireless settings on multiple occasions via
 xbox settings, to no avail. I'm not that good with computers, so I have no idea where to look for all of these router settings. Can somebody at least tell me what I did wrong, and what the problem is in general?</p>

<p>Greetings, Dr IVIatt. Thanks for posting your information. To start, can you please try a direct connection between your console and your modem via an ethernet cable and let us know the results? In addition, the error code you mentioned is a known code which
 you can read about in the support article titled "<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/download-xbox-live-content#9eded815cd53455e96bc797c962e30b6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot Xbox LIVE download problems</a>." Give it a shot
 and let us know the results. Thanks!</p>

<p>I've just tried a direct connection via ethernet cable into my modem, and the connection runs beautifully, which can eliminate any possibility of an error on the ISP's side, right?</p>
<p>Also, I don't know if this has to do with anything, but I burrowed my friend's Wireless Adapter, and I have not disconnected since. Could my issue have been a wireless adapter fault the entire time?
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hey Dr IVIatt! If that's the case it could easily be that your adapter has hit its breaking point. Is the borrowed adapter the same brand and model? If so, it sounds like it may be time for a new one. To be sure you've tried some steps before purchasing
 a new adapter can you run through this guide on "<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/9/t/191860.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DNS server can't resolve Xbox LIVE server names</a>" and take the steps suggested? Let me know if this helps!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for replying, you all have been extremely helpful :)</p>
<p>Actually, the adapter I burrowed is the white, older version of the black adapter that has been having problems. They are both the microsoft issued ones.
</p>
<p>What's strange is the black adapter looks to be working fine, the lights are working fine, it's just the actual adapter having problems! I've been playing with the white adapter for about 30 mins now (15 mins longer than when it should've disconnected with
 the black adapter) and I've had no problems so far.</p>
<p>Thank you for the link, Miss Kleo, I've tried most, if not all, of the solutions used for some type of DNS error, but it seems to have been the adapter having all of the malfunctions. Right now I'm playing online in order to see if this new adapter will
 disconnect or not.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hey there IVIatt!<br />It may well be due to that your network adapter has become defective but&nbsp;there is still some useful&nbsp;tips you can try that may help you.<br /><br />Try use <a href="http://www.unofficialguidetolive.co.uk/faqs/111-troubleshooting-and-improving-wireless" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this guide</a>&nbsp;on how to troubleshoot your Official wireless N adapter.<br /><br />Make sure your routers firmware is up-to-date (visit manufactures website and see if there is a later version available then your current one).<br /><br />Some Linksys routers have a feature called Filter- or Block -Anonymous Internet Requests that is known to cause NAT issues. If this feature is present, turn it off.<br /><br />Post back and let us know how it goes.</p>

<br />I would not be running MacAfee which is the worst thing you can install to Windows and frequently ruins it beyond repair.  Uninstall it and use built-in Defender for best performance and least issues with Windows.  
<br />
<br />Other suggestions for what works best are in this checklist which will go over the instal to make sure it is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<h2>            No sound - tried everything</h2>
                    
<p>After updating the sound card driver in an attempt to get the mic working, which it wasn't, I've now lost all sound. I know the speakers and mic work by going through the diagnostics at start up. I have tried unistalling the driver, reinstalling it, updating
 the driver using an old one, etc. What I see is in the sys tray there is a red x on the speaker icon, hovering shows "Volume: 0 / Speakers / High Definition Audio Device". So it thinks there is something installed in this case, however, when I open the Volume&nbsp;Mixer,
 it says "No Audio Device Installed".</p>
<p>Checked the sound option in the Ctrl Panel, in Playback - Speakers are checked green, but can't see anything on Levels tab (blank) and there is no little bar column next to the Speakers which I think there used to be. The Recording tab shows the mic checked
 green but has the same problem, no level adjustments. It says they are both working.</p>
<p>There are no yellow exlamations in the device manager. I've run services.msc and made sure Windows Audio is in Automatic. I just can't find a solution.</p>
<p>Please help! Thank you!</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>1. What is the make and model of your sound card?<br />
2. Which version of driver have you installed?<br />
3. Did you install a service pack recently?</span></p>
<p><span>As you have already tried uninstalling and reinstalling the sound card driver, I would suggest you to perform
 a system restore to restore the computer to an earlier point <br />
in time before the problem started.</span></p>

<p>I'm not a computer whiz, but I believe my soundcard is integrated. According to the Dell site and driver CD I have it is a SigmaTel. I tried installing the SigmaTel HD C-Major STAC 92XX A03 driver R171786.</p>
<p>I have not updated to a new service pack recently.</p>
<p>That is when everything went bad. Since then no sound no mic, etc.</p>
<p>I have tried the links provided to no avail.</p>
<p>When I uninstall the SigmaTel device in Device Manager and look for new hardward it gives me "High Definition Audio Device". No more information beyond that. It says it is working. There are no yellow ! anywhere in the Device Manager.</p>
<p>I can't understand why when I hover on the sound icon in sys tray it says Volume: 0 and then when I open the Volume Mixer it thinks I have no audio device install. If I open the playback devices or recording devices, it thinks they work, but again no options
 in the Levels tab when I go to properties. Another thing I have found is that on the Playback device window when I highlight "Speakers" the buttons for Configure and Properties become active, however clicking the configure does nothing - brings up no window
 or options at all.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t project from&#47;to Surface Pro 3 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t project from&#47;to Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've been having issues connecting my Surface Pro 3 (SP3) to my MS Wireless Display Adapter (WDA).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click the adapter name in the "Connect" screen, immediately a yellow "Couldn't connect" text appears. I tried every solution I could find (the official WDA troubleshooting guide, several Answers MS threads) but nothing helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can connect to the WDA just fine from my Lumia 950 so the problem must be on the SP3 side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I cannot connect from my Lumia to my SP3 (through the "Projecting to this PC" option") so the problem is apparently two-way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on what the issue could be and how to resolve it? Thanks a lot!</p>
<p>
</p><p>M.</p>

<p>Hi Mark and thanks for your reply,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know projecting to the WDA worked several months ago (with the same WDA and same SP3). I haven't been using it for a few months and now it doesn't work anymore. I can't recall any particular action that could have caused the change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried:</p>
<p>- installing latest updates (PC up to date, running W10 Release Preview)</p>
<p>- resetting the WDA (hold hardware button for 10 seconds)</p>
<p>- temporarily turning Windows Defender (incl. firewall) off</p>
<p>- manually adding an exception to Windows firewall (can't remember the exact name but the file was in the system32 folder and was called WDxx.exe or so, where the xx are two letters I can't recall now)</p>
<p>- reinstalling the Intel HD driver</p>
<p>- running a command line script (again, can't seem to remember it now, sorry) which said something along the lines of Wireless Video being enabled</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did NOT reinstall my wireless drivers as I had trouble connecting to my Xbox for game streaming in the past and it took me ages to solve the problem so I'd rather not risk it coming back (although if you feel there is a large chance that the problem is
 here, I can try that too).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have any third party firewall installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michal</p>

<p>
</p><p>I noticed that an update created a new connection which was public.&nbsp; Fixing that by making it Private solved my problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, are there any other monitors attached?&nbsp; I had an instance where detaching a second monitor physically changed how the virtual ones connected. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>They really do need to give us better diagnostics for this stuff or at least make their troubleshooters more complete.</p>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your reply! What do you mean by a 'New connection'? Do you mean in Control panel/Network connections?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree that diagnosing these problems is a real pain, more hit-or-miss than anything else :/</p>

<p>
</p><p>It's probably there too but where I noticed it was with&nbsp; PowerShell.&nbsp; Get-NetConnectionProfile &nbsp; NetworkCategory:&nbsp; Public there sticks out like a sore thumb.&nbsp; Then I used&nbsp; PowerShell&nbsp; Set-NetConnectionProfile&nbsp; -NetworkCategory "Private"&nbsp; to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wow.&nbsp; I didn't know that&nbsp; Win-k&nbsp; would shift my session!&nbsp; Is this saying W10 has a preference for Wi-Fi Virtual Displays over real HDMI ones?&nbsp; It's trying to support an audio port associated with that too but that's only so-so.&nbsp; So I might end up disabling
 that (same as I have disabled the HDMI one.)</p>

            <p>Update :&nbsp; last night<strong> I clean installed Windows 10 </strong>and now the store works and i can rent a move.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope, that Microsoft fixes the Windows Store and begins making using the store a pleasant experience. Because right now, the store is a mess.</p>
