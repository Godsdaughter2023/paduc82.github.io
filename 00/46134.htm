<h2>            Controller Wont Turn On Console</h2>
                    

<p><span><span><span>Sometimes my 360 controller won't turn on my Xbox. It doesn't happen that often, but sometimes. Just now I tried to hit the guide button on my 360 controller and the lights just flashed
 and the system didn't turn on, so I tried a different controller and the same thing. If I turn the power on the console it turns on and the controllers will connect. Is this normal or should I get it repaired? It's an original 360.</span><br />

            <p>How long do you wait for the controller to turn on the console? Occasionally it can take a bit longer if there is a slight amount of interference in the room. </p>

    <title>Hdmi Display Problems. Black screen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hdmi Display Problems. Black screen</h2>
                    
<p>Today we bought a monitor for our gaming systems. Before this we have been using the xbox 360 slim on a normal tv with av cables. Whenever I connect the hdmi cord to the monitor or even our hdtv. The display is black. We have not used a hdmi cord on our
 xbox in a few months, maybe that's a problem?</p>
<p>We have 4 different Hdmi cords. I used them all on both the monitor and flat screen.</p>
<p>Turned them around and replugged. Still black screen.</p>
<p>I tried holding Y-RT with every hdmi cord in.</p>
<p>I've tried about everything i've seen online, these past few hours but nothing has worked.</p>
<p>I think the xbox is set on a certain display that will not allow it to show up on any Hdtv. Can't change it because all the screens are black when any hdmi cord is connected.</p>

            <p>Hey there SorestFoil7276!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the display issue!</p>
<p>When you held Y and Right Trigger, was this during boot up? Try following these steps below to ensure that the display settings were reset properly.</p>
<p>[quote]</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove any discs from the disc tray.</li>
<li>Turn off the console.</li>
<li>Turn on the console.
<p><b>Note</b>&nbsp;If you are using an Xbox 360 Wireless Controller, turn on the console by using the Guide button on the controller. Make sure that you use the player 1 controller when you do this. The player 1 controller will have the upper-left light illuminated.</p>
</li>
<li>As the console starts, on the controller, press and hold Y while pulling the right trigger. The display settings are reset to the default settings, and then the console automatically restarts.</li>
</ol>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>If the issue persists after trying those steps, your console will need to be repaired. To begin that process, please visit our&nbsp;<a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/Pages/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Online Service center</a>.</p>

<h2>            Network Services Started Using Port 80</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to Windows 10 I noticed my web server stop running. After doing a port check I came to notice that the Network Services started using port 80. I rather not have to switch my web server 's from port 80 because I have a few sites setup in a
 vhost and I rather not have to reconfigure all of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to have the network services which include:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Cryptographic Services</li><li>DNS Client</li><li>Network Location Awareness</li><li>Workstation</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I already attemted to switch the port and my server loads but none of vhost domain did. Anyway to prevent them from using port 80. I am getting desperate.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Did you make any software changes to the computer recently?<br />
2. What is the make and the model number of the sound card?<br />
<div><strong>There are several causes of Code 39 errors: <br />
</strong>• A required device driver is missing. <br />
• A required binary file is corrupted. <br />
• There is a problem with the file I/O process. <br />
• A driver that is referencing an entry point in another binary file is unable to load.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.</strong></div>
<div><strong>Recommended resolution:<br />
</strong>Reinstall the drivers for this device. Uninstall the driver from Device Manager, and then scan for new hardware to install the driver again.</div>
<div>You may be prompted to provide the path of the driver. Windows may have the driver built-in, or may still have the driver files installed from the last time that you set up the device. However, sometimes, it will open the New Hardware Wizard which may
 ask for the driver. If you are asked for the driver and you do not have it, you can try to download the latest driver from the hardware vendor’s Web site.</div>
<div><br />
a. On the device Properties dialog box, click the Driver tab, and then click Uninstall. Follow the instructions.<br />
b. Restart your computer. <br />
c. Open Device Manager, click Action, and then click Scan for hardware changes. Follow the instructions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p>Já fiz tudo isso, só preciso que me enviem o código de 7 dígitos, porque por enquanto só me enviaram um de 4 dígitos que é pra saber se sou eu mesmo que estou tentando recuperar. Já afirmei que sou eu, já tentei recuperar por outro meio que é o de vários
 dados e sempre negam meu formulário, forneci os dados do cartão usado na conta, meu nome e tudo mais. Isso é falta de compromisso com os usuários. Pois gastei no mínimo 1K e não estou satisfeito com o trabalho de vocês. Acho que cabe a mim procurar outros
 meios para ter o que é meu por direito. Porque estou tentando de todos os modos e ninguém até agora me ajudou com isso.</p>

 to get what is rightfully mine. Because I'm trying in every way and nobody so far has helped me with this.]</strong></em><br />

<p>Hello Verlon,</p>

</p><p>We regret the inconvenience this has caused. We will be glad to help you fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They usually occurs when a serious problem causes Windows 10 to shut down or restart unexpectedly. There are multiple reasons why this type of errors occurs on the computer.&nbsp;It might be due to driver issues on your computer. However, it might also happen
 due to some other software/hardware reasons. </p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>Kindly, provide the below information for better understanding about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp;How did you upgrade your PC to Windows 10? <br />

<p>
</p><p>These all transferred seamlessly the first time but my old outlook did not work properly so uninstalled at the time, back to W7. No I have reinstalled and have a blank slate so to speak. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi Ron.
<br />
<br />I'm curious why you went back to WIndows 7 to do an inferior Upgrade install when you could have done the vastly superior Clean install while wiping the drive to avoid a disk junkyard:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />All of your mail, favorites, history, etc must be backed up first as outlined in the tutorial above which covers everything so nothing is forgotten.
<br />
<br />You should use WIndows 10 Mail app which will sync all of your mail accounts in one Inbox and huge ad-free reading pane:  <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2488072,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2488072,00...</a>
<br />
<br />Easiest way to back up and restore your web data and favorites is to sign into the web browser wherever you are so that it remains sync'd using that sign-in.  You can also back up your favorites for each browser to an HTML file that can be restored in the settings.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps to sort it out or do it over.  Your description isn't exactly clear as to what was done or has resulted so if you ask back more questions I'll get you back on track.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I upgraded the first time my outlook, my key piece if software (am rethinking), had issues. Tried to sort them out but was told to suck it up. it will never work right on W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So reverted without issues to W7. That was about 8 months ago. I purchased W10 office in the new year and got really busy, only now have I tried to revert to W10. It installed flawlessly albeit incredibly time consuming even with an SSD and high speed internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can use your other suggestions - eventually,&nbsp; but need to sort my losses before reverting once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key issues are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>No emails, No Contacts, no setup of incoming emails, nothing:&nbsp; -&nbsp; a blank slate,&nbsp; I was using Office 10, I would have thought that part would be seamless. Its like its installed anew version of Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chrome &amp; IE: Again no data: All history and saved links gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree about the disk junkyard, but saw no reference to your link when installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ron</p>

            Ron, was it Upgraded from 7?  If not having Outlook data saved after a Clean install is not possible so that and your newly installed browsers would need to have their data restored from backup.  
<br />
<br />Even if Upgraded from 7 or doing a Version install within 10, the risk of losing data, bookmarks, etc is always there so it's more important than ever before to keep strong, regular backups - ideally one done manually by regularly dragging User folders to externa, and another in the Cloud using OneDrive's free 5gb or Google Backup  free 15gb which can even choose your User folders to sync.
<br />
<br />Backing up Office Outlook is here:  <a href="https://www.howto-outlook.com/howto/backupandrestore.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howto-outlook.com/howto/backupandre...</a>
<br />
<br />Again the best way to back up any browser (besides Edge which is not fnished yet) is to sign into it to sync all your data, favorites and changes in real time.  Done.

<p>Thanks Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I will try to go back to W7 again and see if I can restart this process a little better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I had done this in the past with no issues other than some minor but important issues with the Outlook from Office 20013, it never dawned on me that it could not reinstall correctly and especially as I had Office 10 functioning just fine under W7.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a sad commentary that the W10 installation does not pick up the fact Office 10 is already installed and leave it alone. My guess is it could have saved some time during the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think </p>
<ol>
<li>I can go back successfully, if I go back my W7, and </li><li>That the data from the previous is still going to be valid.</li></ol>
<p>Cheers</p>

            So, I'm assuming that your did the in-place Upgrade.
<br />
<br />If so then see if there is a Go Back option at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery.

                    <p>
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I know Windows 10 1803/1804 update was delayed due to a "blocking bug" - think I know what this bug is as I've experienced it on 3 different
 computers running the Slow/Fast ring updates.</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The bug I've experienced causes Explorer.exe to crash every 3-5 seconds - the start menu does not work, the task bar keeps resetting and the
 computer is near enough un-usable.</span></p>

<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I know this bug is described as a "flashing bug" that some people have experienced in the past due to incorrect graphics drivers and incompatible
 applications but each one of the computers have different hardware, and software installed. I've also tried uninstalling any software that may cause issues and uninstalling and reinstalling graphics drivers with no luck. On my SurfaceBook I wiped the installation
 and installed the latest build ISO from fresh and the bug still occurred! The only fix I've found so far is to revert to 1709.</span></p>

<p>Hello Mark Elmes,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to verify, have you tried the driver roll back option? Some newer version of drivers becomes incompatible to your device, so try it out see if it helps. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and hit the Enter key.</li><li>Expand the Display adapters branch and right click on your graphics card. Click
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Roll Back Driver</strong>.</li><li>Restart your PC.</li><li>After rolling back, try to manually download and install the drivers on your PC. Try a different version of driver from the driver's manufacturer's website.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Another step that I can suggest is to check if your BIOS is on the latest version as well. We have come across some thread that posed the same bug issue and a few reported that updating the BIOS helped them resolve the issue. Click

<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome.</p>

</p><p>I tried both driver rollback, standard VGA drivers, no drivers, newest drivers - the problem continued to persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I filed a report with the Feedback app and recorded a video of it happening - I then lost patience and wiped the machine back to 1709.</p>

    <title>Keep The Cheaters Out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> techno fabulous  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keep The Cheaters Out </h2>
                    
<p>Hi, my name is John, aka Techno Wizard. I have been a gamer for thirty years and thoroughly enjoy Xbox Live. I have four children, all of which have a separate Xbox live account. I have an engineering degree, I am an active member of the International Brotherhood
 of Electrical Workers, and spend the rest of my time gaming! The reason I started this post was to discuss the future of gaming, and ways that game publishers can keep the cheaters&nbsp;and modders from ruining these wonderful games. For Example...When Halo Reach
 launched last September, there were around 1,500,00 players online. To date, there are an average of only 30,000 to 100,000 gamers playing Reach online.&nbsp;My rank in Halo Reach is Eclipse. I play without cheating and instruct my family to do the same. I have
 noticed that&nbsp;there are&nbsp;thousands of websites on where to download aimbot, cheat codes, and God Mode for several of the popular titles. It doesn't make good business sense to me to allow cheaters into the game to begin with. After a FPS game has been out for
 several months, usually there are stragglers left playing a game&nbsp;and running wild with these cheat codes, giving them an advantage over honest players. Even when you go to Xbox websites,&nbsp;Call of Duty, or Halo websites.....There are links&nbsp;or a list of websites
 on where to go to get the latest cheats. What kind of message does that send out for the youth of today. On one hand, Xbox has a system implemented in most these games for reporting cheaters, but then they turn around and tell you where to go to find these
 cheats.&nbsp; I love Xbox Live and my family enjoys it as well. Somebody please step up to the plate and&nbsp;do what is right. Is it better to keep around 100,000 cheaters playing a game, or lose&nbsp;hundreds of thousands of gamers because&nbsp;of the frustration of not being
 able to compete against a cheater? As&nbsp;customers, we buy the consoles, games, clothing, and toys. &nbsp;We deserve&nbsp;the right to play a game without worrying about&nbsp;who has the latest mod or aimbot.&nbsp;I would like to know why I can't download a program to render these
 cheats useless. If you allow cheaters to download codes, then I should be able to download something to counter act the cheat. My kids know what is right and wrong...and cheating is wrong. When someone is able to run a cheat in a game, they are wasting my
 time and the gaming communities time and money spent on these games.Why do people quit playing FPS games? Because of the cheating. The game publisher that creates a game that doesn't allow cheaters in to begin with, would make a fortune. People deserve to
 play on an even playing field, and to enjoy their experience on Xbox Live. I was around in the days of Atari, Coleco Vision, and Intellivision. What made the games back then so enjoyable, was the gameplay. Online gaming has come a long way and is awesome,
 but somewhere in the excitement the game publishers have forgotten their responsibility to the kids of today. My thirteen year old son came up to me just yesterday, and said that he was so frustrated from playing Halo and Call of Duty, that he might just play
 campaign games from now on. The reason of his frustration stems from people running aimbot, while playing these games. Someone cheats, then honest players get cheats to play against the cheaters. Sooner or later, everyone is cheating and then there is no longer
 a reason to play the game. Look at all the revenue that is lost from allowing these cheaters to have their way. What good is it to have a ranking system on any game, if the person sitting on top, got there by cheating. The whole point behind this post was
 to try and change the opinion of those who are cheating, and what effect it has on those who play by the rules. I am 39 years old and a gamer at heart. Let's make Xbox Live the most enjoyable gaming experience ever!</p>

<p>I agree with what you say John.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>The sad facts though are these:</p>
<p>1. Almost nobody gets to the top in anything without lying, cheating, or coniving, and being amoral, treacherous or ruthless...just observe the political and corporate worlds.</p>
<p>2. Game publishers are businesses, at the end of the day, they care for profit / product life ratio ....see sad fact #1.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>I have toyed with the idea of hostng a system link Halo/ BBQ day for upto 8, or maybe 16....</p>
<p>Bring your monitor, xbox &amp; controller, Halo discs, &amp; food - I'll supply the venue, power, ethernet switch &amp; patch cables, hotplate &amp; beer (so, it would be open to over 18's only).</p>
<p>I would be interested to see just how much better the gameplay is without lag/hacks/mods etc..(HA! bring your modded xbox and leave with it up your A... lol at the funny walk!)</p>
<p>I can't see that I'd get enough people within a reasonable travelling distance (I'm in Sydney Australia) interested though.</p>
<p>Perhaps I'll field the idea seriously in a thread at a later date, will see.</p>

<p>Great post - don't play Halo Reach anymore (not for a while) got sick of the same thing your talking about - just to add another grip about cheating is the modded Controllers you can get now as well. Man people who care about K/D W/L etc stats need to get
 a life - News Flash your boss isn't gonna care your tired at work cause you were on a roll and got 25/3 last night.</p>

<p>Do it. One of the best things you can do if you've got friends interested in it.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"so can we see some save films of these cheats in action ?"</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>This is another thing: I want to see these cheats myself, because it is possible to mistake legitimate gameplay for cheating. I was told a day or two ago that "That lag is going to end up getting you banned", because someone unaware clearly thought I was
 cheating.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Make sure you're right before you go saying things, that's all I'm saying.</p>

<p>Yes, I will be posting footage of these cheaters. I tried posting them on Halo Waypoint and I was banned for a week for backing up what I said. I am not trying to cause trouble, I am just trying to make playing games fun again. They asked me for proof on
 Halo Waypoint and I provided footage from theater mode of a guy standing up in armour lock for a second or two, and then proceeding to run across the map with armor lock on. I was quickly shut down from posting on the forum by the administrator. I was very
 upset that someone from 343i would try to dismiss the fact that people are cheating. What really didn't make sense, is that on Halo Waypoint they show you where you can go to get these cheats and cheat codes. The most common response, which is probably from
 a person being paid to address these issues on the forum, was..."Oh, that's just lag." I know the difference between lag and cheating. Lag doesn't last 6 seconds, enabling the player to run across the map in armor lock. It's almost like the companies making
 these games, are letting the cheaters play so they do not lose revenue. What they don't realize, is the number of customer's they are losing by taking such a soft position on this matter of cheating. Thank you for your feedback. Maybe I'm old fashioned in
 my ways, but cheating is never right and should not be glorified. Xbox should remove these sights containing info. on where to get cheat codes. How hard is it to sit down in a chair and push some buttons on a controller? Nobody needs aimbot....I would rather
 do it myself than to know I was assisted by a cheat program that plagues all first person shooters.</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure I posted almost an identical response on your thread on the Waypoint Forums too, actually...</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>And Microsoft does not run sites that advertise or provide downloads or instructions for cheating, so they can hardly shut them down outside of a lawsuit.</p>

<p>That's not true. If you type in Halo Waypoint in your search bar, it will bring up Halo Wapoint cheats and other websites where you can find the cheats. If you just type in aimbot for Halo Reach or Call of Duty, it will pull up a whole slew of info. and
 footage on YouTube and various other sights. If you own the rights to Halo and Halo Waypoint, please do something about this. If I owned something and had exclusive rights to it, do you think for one second that I would let a third party or anyone else, give
 out info. and downloads that would adversely affect my product. This is exactly what I'm talking about. No one is willing to admit what is going on, because no one has a handle on it. If you hack or cheat when you are an adult, you are in trouble legally,
 but it is ok to do the same thing as a gamer, as long as it is just a video game. I'm not saying that 343i condones it, or that Microsoft condones it.....I'm saying that no one is doing anything to stop it. They are computer programs for goodness sakes. Measures
 can be taken to prevent the aimbot and various other cheats from happening. Already, there are postings of aimbot for COD 3 and Battlefield 3. These cheats are out even before the games have launched. In fact, Bungie had to ban thousands of ploayers within
 the first week because of cheaters. I don't need to show tons of proof, it's already out there.

<p>Simple solution, instead of banning someone for cheating, just so they can get another gamertag and cheat again....Implement firmware and hardware that denies these types of cheat programs being used. Have regular updates that prevent the latest cheats from
 being used. And go after these web sites that advertise downloads to your USB card, which can be loaded into your profile and used for cheating. My family and I will always support Xbox and Xbox Live. And as a customer, I expect to see the money I have invested
 in memberships, consoles, and games protected. Yes, there are bigger things in life than to worry about these slimy cheaters, but it's a matter of principal. Halo Reach for example, has a function within the game to report cheating, etc. If there were no cheaters,
 then why does that function exist? Anyway, I gotta get back to gaming......and if anyone out there has any influence whatsoever in the gaming world, please protect the customer's interest. Afterall, it's people that are hard working, have families, and spend
 money, that make up the Xbox community.</p>

    <title>The xampp uninstall.dat file cannot be found - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidyoung123zg  say:</h3>
<h2>            The xampp uninstall.dat file cannot be found</h2>
                    My friend wants to uninstall xampp and reinstall with the latest version. He recently upgraded from Win7 to Win10 which we think is causing many of the problems.<br />
<br />
After clicking "uninstall" this message appears "The uninstall.dat file cannot be found and is required to uninstall the application, aborting".<br />
<br />
There is an Adobe uninstall.dat file in the xampp folder above the application.<br />
<br />
This does appear to be a Windows 10 problem on installation, because uninstall did work for an installation under Windows 7 and an uninstall under Windows 10.<br />
<br />
He has asked in ApacheFriends forum but received no replies.<br />
<br />
If the uninstall can not be fixed, the only solution we can think of is to move the xampp folder to the recycle bin.<br />
<br />
In that event, how could we see if any of the programs are still running, and if they are, how to delete them?<br />

&nbsp;<br />
Welcome to the Microsoft Community.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
We understand how you feel about the situation. We're sorry for the trouble this has caused.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Before we proceed, I need more information to help you better.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Have you installed all the pending updates and driver updates on your system?&nbsp;<br />
2. Are you facing this issue on the Microsoft account or a local account?&nbsp;<br />
3. Have you made any changes to your system, prior to this issue?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This issue occurs due to the conflict between any third party application on your system.
<div><br />
I suggest you to sign out from the current user account, restart the system and login to the either administrator account or the Microsoft account to check, if that helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let's try to perform a clean boot and check. Setting the system in a clean boot state will help to identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</div>

            <p>Hi AntonyJose,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response, although I am confused with the contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, it is&nbsp;XAMPP Version 7.0.2 that I'm wanting to uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I understand all updates in Windows 10 are carried out automatically.</p>
<p>2. I do not understand what you mean by "Microsoft account or a local account".</p>
<p>3. I installed an early version a few years ago, and kept it for the purpose of holding the files, and I also installed Version 7.0.2 back around July 2015, and both those installations were done under Windows 7, and I had no problem uninstalling those under
 Windows 10. I had another issue and I was advised to uninstall and reinstall but I found after I did that I lost all of my files, therefore I restored my system to gain back those files. I have since moved those files into a separate folder so that will no
 longer be a problem. I had installed Version 7.0.2 under Window 10 and found the original issue arose again, therefore decided to uninstall but found the
<p>
</p><p>I do not know what you mean by "sign out from the current user account, restart the system and login to the either administrator account or the Microsoft account". Every 4 days I close down my laptop and restart by pressing the start button, enter the password,
 and then the computer is available to use. There is only one user. There is an account of the previous owner but it is confusing if he is the administrator, or if we are. That has never been a problem so we have never investigated the administrator issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've opened http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135 but there is no reference to Windows 10 there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've opened&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/repair-or-remove-programs#v1h=tab01 and gone through that process but there is no reference to xampp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind xampp is not a program in itself, it is a package containing a variety of programs and applications, the 3 primary are (1) PHP (2) MySQL (3) Apache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to install xampp Version 7.0.2 yourself to solve this problem&nbsp;https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>Version 7.0.2 is the number I retrieved from the readme file but I note in the above download webpage there is reference to 7.0.3 so I don't know if there is any significance to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also need to restore your system to solve this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I haven't tried, but I don't think the task manager will involve xampp as it's not a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help so far.<br />

            I need to answer my own question, in case another person has the same problem. I deleted the xampp folder to the recycle bin, downloaded Version 7.0.4, installed and uninstalled, then installed once more. Everything appears to be working now. This may
 have been a fault with Version 7.0.2 which is what I had these problems with.

<h2>            Windows 10 Minecraft - Error - Can&#39;t download.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to install the free windows 10 edition of Minecraft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been to my Mojang account and it says that I have claimed my code and I can see the code.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click the 'Redeem' button and I am taken to a Microsoft page which appears to be linked to Billing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The loading graphic (Dots going around) appears briefly and then the following message comes up:</p>
<p>
</p><div>Try that again
<div>Something happened on our end. Waiting a bit might help.</div>

<div>2016/07/26 - 07:07:51 UTC</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>
</p><p>I have waited.&nbsp; I started trying yesterday and it is still doing the same today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried doing the Store Reset as given as a resolution and it doesn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am doing all this through my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone advise what is going on?&nbsp; Or what I can do?&nbsp; Have I just not waited long enough, and if so how long should I wait? :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**EDIT:&nbsp; Should have said.&nbsp; If I click the Cancel button that appears under the message nothing happens, I get the spinning loading dots but it never gets anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there is nothing under my Recent Purchases if I go there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what else I can say that wasn't in my original post, but i'll try..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to download the game from the Microsoft Store.&nbsp; Mojang offered those who already had Minecraft a free copy of the Windows 10 Version.&nbsp; To get it I had to log into my Mojang account and claim the code, which I did, so I have a copy of the required
 code.&nbsp; To redeem the code there was a link on my Mojang account which takes me to the Microsoft store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I am taken to the Microsoft store, where I should presumably be able to redeem my code. &nbsp; However, all I&nbsp; have is the navigation bars at the top of the screen and below them is the error message (that I posted above)...</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Try that again </strong>
</p><div><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something happened on our end. Waiting a bit might help.</strong></div>
<div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SVC-AuthenticationTokenInvalid</strong></div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rYKaIQIhLEmdxjQq.19.7.1</strong></div>
<div>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2016/07/26 - 07:07:51 UTC</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>...with a CANCEL button below it.&nbsp; Which, as I added, I have clicked but nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took your advice of following the instructions on how to redeem a code, via the link you provided.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Microsoft App store, I selected Redeem Code and was taken to a webpage with exactly the same problem I have described above.&nbsp; I get the navigation bar and the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't even get as far as trying to download the game, basically it appears that when I try and access the 'Redeem a Code' section of the Microsoft Store I am getting an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this is clearer.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p />
