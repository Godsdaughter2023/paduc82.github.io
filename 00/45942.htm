<h2>            Purchase of wrong game.</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased an indie game "Castle Miner Z"&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I was buying "Castle Miner"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Same people made both games,&nbsp; but the only difference in the title is the "Z" of course..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had both trial games downloaded on my xbox,&nbsp; and bought one instead of
 the other through a *** moment of mine..&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there absolutely no way of "unpurchasing" it,&nbsp; or swapping purchases with the other game?&nbsp; Or have I was wasted several dollars?</p>

<p>I just did the same thing. &nbsp;Purchased Battlefield Hardline on line. &nbsp;I was stupid and thought it was for the xbox 360. &nbsp;Turns out it was for the xbox one. &nbsp;Completely my mistake. &nbsp;This was following my purchase of Hardline Premium at first from my 360. &nbsp;Only
 to find out that premium is an extension pack and must run on the actual game. &nbsp;I am now out over $100 dollars if xbox can't refund or switch versions. &nbsp;I'm getting to old for this.</p>

<h2>            Windows Vista Business OEM Act</h2>
                    So I had a Dell E6500 Latitude Laptop with a Windows Vista Business OEM Act. Somehow I got the free upgrade to windows 10 and therefore pursue on to get Windows 10 Pro. A few days from installing windows 10, one day I restarted my PC and there I saw the
 blue screen of death. Now The laptop and hard drive is working well after formatting everything. I later on installed windows 10 home trial and it was so slow cause it wasn't activated. I don't have a windows 10 product key but I have the windows vista business
 OEM Act product please help me find a way to at least reinstall windows on my laptop so that I can continue with my classes and works.

<p>You may have chosen to do a clean install of Win10 but an upgrade to Win10 would not have been offered to a Vista computer. That being said...</p>

<br />You can open the folder by typing the path in Run or showing hidden files and viewing through explorer.

    <title>Freeze after recovering from Hibernation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobnspkn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Freeze after recovering from Hibernation</h2>
                    I have an Acer Aspire 5515 laptop that came with Windows Home Basic installed. I downloaded and installed Window 7 RC1 as an upgrade to the Vista install. (I tried the clean install prior to this install, but had essentially the same issue/s)<br />
<br />
When I close the lid, the PC should go to sleep as I have set in the power options. The PC is still going into Hibernation instead and displays "Resuming Wndows" when I open the lid and press the power button, which is the only way to wake it up.<br />
<br />
The PC resumes the session OK, but after a few minutes (does not matter what activity I try) the computer freezes solid, i.e. the mouse cursor doesn't move, the clock gadget stops, the internet monitoring gadget quits.<br />
<br />
The only way to clear the freeze is to press the power button for more than 2 seconds to reboot the PC. It happens even if I boot to "Safe mode."

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Did you try to download via Internet Explorer?</span></p>
<p><span>In case, if you receive the error message when trying to download from Internet Explorer, try the steps below:
<br />
** Launch Internet Explorer in No Add-on Mode and check if that helps.<br />
</span><span>**
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/936213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to optimize Internet Explorer</span></a>.
</span><span><br />
</span><span><br />
As the issue persists with Chrome Browser as well, then the issue might be with corrupted Domain Name Server.
<br />
</span><span>1. Click
<strong><span>Start </span></strong>and select
<strong><span>Run</span></strong>.<br />
2. Type <strong><span>cmd </span></strong>and hit ENTER.<br />
3. Type <strong><span>ipconfig /flushdns</span></strong> and hit Enter.<br />
You should get a message that says: Successfully flushed the DNS Resolver Cache.<br />
The <strong><span>ipconfig /flushdns </span>
</strong>command provides you with a means to flush and reset the contents of the DNS client resolver cache.</span></p>
<p><span>Also check a related issue posted in Chrome Forums:

    <title>Windows 10 failure to boot due to a corrupt BCD - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 failure to boot due to a corrupt BCD</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I couldn't boot my PC yesterday after clearing the CMOS, and had multiple errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First was the unrecognized boot drive then after booting from my USB Drive and tinkering with the Bootrec tool with commands like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>`Bootrec /fixBOOT`</li><li>`Bootrec /fixMBR`</li><li><strong>`Bootrec /rebuildBCD`</strong></li></ul>
<p>But in executing the last command it Identified 1 installation of path <strong>
"\\?"</strong></p>
<p>and when I answered yes "<strong>Y</strong>" to <strong>"Add installation to boot list?"
</strong>I got <strong>"The requested system device cannot be found."</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Then I tried to remove my BCD manually and rebuilding to no avail, but now I restarted my pc and got a
<em>blue screen</em>&nbsp;progress hooray;However my joy was short lived after I read that the
<strong>\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\BCD </strong>was corrupt.<br />
<br />
I tired a lot of solutions online, but here is the status now:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Main disk has 2 Volumes:
<ul>
<li>Volume 0: <strong>System &nbsp;258 GB &nbsp;Hidden</strong></li><li>Volume 1:<strong>&nbsp;Recovery 400MB Hidden</strong></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>So my main drive got hidden for some reason and every time I try to unhide it I get an error which I don't remember now,<br />
also when I assign a letter to it then reboot it gets unassigned and remain <strong>
Hidden and with no letter.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>PS:</strong>&nbsp;My drive is of GPT format and it's supposed to have windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Mohamed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Based on my assessment with your query, since you have already done all the possible troubleshooting that we can apply to this issue, we suggest that you clear the partition on your hard drive with the help of the manufacturer of your PC. After clearing
 the partition, reinstall, refresh, or repair the installation of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if there is anything else we can do to help.</p>

    <title>Can 2 headsets be used on same console&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bcwarrior08  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can 2 headsets be used on same console&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>Issue: both of my sons want to play Call of Duty Ghosts with their cousin who lives in another city. We have 1 console. My sons both have Turtle Beach XL1 headsets. What do we need to do for them to be able to plug both headsets in and talk to their cousin
 during the game? Do we need 2 Xbox live gold memberships for both boys? Or is it a connection issue?&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have an Xbox Live Gold that is not a trial subscription, one should be able to play as a guest on the other's account, it should be whatever one's gamertag is plus a: (1) on the end of it. I think you can just plug in a headset for both controllers
 and they should both be able to talk. </p>

<p>
</p><p>I am on a Acer Predator Helios 300 gaming laptop. When this device is plugged in the performance is amazing! But when not plugged in, the performance isn't the best and the keyboard doesn't glow. I want the best performance all the time! Plugged in or not!
 Does anyone know how to do that?</p>

    <title>Battery draining in Sleep mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ari_232  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battery draining in Sleep mode</h2>
                    <p>My computer seems to be having issues with Sleep mode post recent Windows update.</p>
<p>I usually will put my computer to sleep while plugged into docking station as it connect to my desktop screen.</p>
<p>When I wake the computer now from sleep mode - even if it's been a number of hours - the screen comes on straight away and my battery has drained.</p>
<p>Most times when I wake my computer in the morning bow from overnight sleep it wakes saying battery is at critical low levels so has been draining through the night which usually wouldn't happen in proper sleep mode.</p>
<p>Also, whenever I used to wake my computer from sleep mode it would take 10-15 seconds for the computer to load up, but as I said now the screen comes on straight away which tells me the computer is not going to sleep properly.</p>
<p>I've also rechecked all my battery, power and sleep settings and nothing has changed there.</p>
<p>Please can someone assist me with this issue I now have?</p>

            What is the make and model of your computer? 
<br />What have you done so far to troubleshoot the problem? 
<br />How long has this been happening? 
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed: 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703? 
<br />Which version of Windows did you upgrade from? 
<br />Sometimes your computers firmware, which deals with things like power management, which is related to sleep needs to be updated. Remember, the issue you are experiencing here is outside of Windows, where its not resuming from sleep. Windows is in a saved state on the hard disk and can't manage the hardware resources, thats left up to Firmware (your BIOS) to handle. So, its obvious this more a hardware issue than software, but updated driver software can fix it. 
<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network 
<br />If that does not work, I recommend you try two things 
<br />First: Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />When complete, restart then check if you can sleep and wake. 
<br />
<br />Second option 
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work, well, we need to try something else. Try resetting the BIOS:

            Please answer ALL of the following [admittedly tedious] diagnostic questions by number, preferably without quoting my post:
<br />
<br />1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />1b. Have you ever replaced the battery?
<br />
<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?
<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />
<br />•  Press &amp; hold the Windows Key and press the R  key. In the RUN dialog, type WINVER and press the Enter key.
<br />

            Hi Ari.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year WIndows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />As previously stated here most Sleep problems are caused by the Display driver, so try updating yours or try another one previously installed at Device Manager&gt;Display adapter&gt;Driver&gt;Update&gt;Browse&gt;Let me pick.  
<br />
<br />In addition there are steps here to specifically troubleshoot Sleep mode problems:  <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sleep-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sle...</a>
<br />
<br />You mentioned having a docking station.  Does the problem happen both in and out of the dock?  
<br />
<br />Also did it previously work?  Do you have a System Restore point from when it did?<a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks to each of you for trying to assist with my problem.</p>
<p>Unfortunately everything I have tried so far hasn't worked.</p>
<p>I have no anti-virus programs running so don't believe that's the issue.</p>
<p>I updated all of my drivers yesterday including BIOS but so far doesn't seem to have helped.</p>
<p>My laptop in on about 5 months old and a brand new, top-of-the-range Dell XPS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Latest example of my issue:</p>
<p>- Laptop was plugged into my docking station at home</p>
<p>- Put laptop to sleep and power button light turned off</p>
<p>- In the morning returned to laptop to see power button light on</p>
<p>- Woke computer up and battery had drained and I was required to plug power in</p>

            Ari,  I would contact Dell under your 1 year included support warranty for possible repair or replacement. This may also be a known issue with that model. They are required to repair it or replace it within the first year.<br /><br />Please let us know how it goes.

            Ari, you can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

<h2>            How do I fix botched signin password&#63;</h2>
                    I have a valid Microsoft Account and good password that I use on several computers. I built a new video editing computer and upgraded it from Windows 7 to Windows 10. I have used my new video editing computer several days with my normal Microsoft Account
 Sign in without any problem. Today I read that Microsoft suggests you normally sign in with a Standard account and use an Administrator account only when needed. I was also told that Windows 10 normally has new subscribers signed in as a Standard account by
 default. However I found all my computers have me signed in as an Administrator. I decided to use a Standard account for every day sign in on the new computer. I followed the instructions to create a second local account for myself. R click Start button&gt;Ctrl
 Panel&gt;User Accounts&gt;Manage accounts&gt;Manage another account&gt;User name&gt;Password. Then it suggested I sign out and sign back in with my new Standard account. I wrote down my User Name and new Password and signed ba

            No, I am NOT able to&nbsp;log in at all!&nbsp;You&nbsp;can read that&nbsp;in my original&nbsp;question. I explained why, and how it came about that I am not able to log in. I followed the procedure to make a Standard account but when&nbsp;the "Standard" account&nbsp;showed up the button
 to make it an Administrator account was already checked and Windows 10 would&nbsp;NOT let me uncheck that button&nbsp;and would not let me check the button to make the new account a new Standard account. I wrote down my user name and new password in my computer log
 book,&nbsp;and signed in one time and tried to change the&nbsp;new user account back&nbsp;to the Standard account I wanted it to be, but Windows 10 would not accomodate that. I then signed out and tried to sign in again with my new user name and new user password but Windows
 10 tells me each and every time that the new password is "incorrect".&nbsp;I also tried to find a way to sign in with my normal Microsoft Account but I can't find a way to do that

            For anyone who&nbsp;is still following this post here is an update! After several "chats" with Microsoft Support and different suggestions from different Microsoft techs, and even a letter to Microsoft Corporation in Redmond, WA (No&nbsp;reply from Redmond) finally
 the only solution offered to me was to reinstall my Windows 7 from my installation disk and then do a second upgrade to Windows 10. That has worked but it was no fun and&nbsp;it meant losing everything on the C:\ drive like &nbsp;contacts, favorites, software, etc.
 but the upgrade to Windows 10 worked using the Key from the Windows 7 installation disk. I think this is something that needs to be corrected in Windows 10 procedures. Hope you don't have to find out yourself.

<p>================================<br />
The freeware IrfanView can create a contact sheet <br />
that will display long file names. there's sort of a<br />
learning curve but it's not that hard.</p>
<p>(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)</p>

<p>After downloading and installing IrfanView...go to...<br />
File / Thumbnails...navigate to your photos.</p>
<p>Select (highlight) the photos&nbsp;you want&nbsp;on the Contact<br />
Sheet and go to...File / Create contact sheet from <br />
selected files...</p>
<p>For displaying long file names you will need to increase <br />
the pixel number at: Thumbnail Spacing / Vertical...<br />
100 might be a good choice.</p>
<p>Left click the Create button and when the contact sheet <br />
appears...go to...File /Save As...</p>
<p>That should get you started...</p>

            <p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Samsung: Tap the F4 Key at the Samsung logo when you first power on.</p>

            <p>Hello Craig,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regrets the inconvenience you have experienced. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What error message you can see on Blue Screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. I suspect that the issue might be caused by a malfunctioning driver or an application. You can track the reason for the blue screen through
 event viewer logs.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open Event Viewer by clicking the <span><strong>Start</strong></span> button, type
<span><strong>Control Panel </strong>and select same from the list<strong>.</strong></span></span></li><li><span>Navigate to, clicking <span><strong>System and Security</strong></span>, clicking
<span><strong>Administrative Tools</strong></span>, and then double-clicking <span>
<strong>Event Viewer</strong></span>. </span><span>&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></li><li>
<p>Expand&nbsp;<strong>Windows logs </strong>in the left pane and select <strong>system</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p>Right side double-click an <strong>error event </strong>(I.e. created when system crashed) to view the details of the event.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Ensure that your system is running with compatible Windows 10 drivers. Cross check the same from device Manufacturers website.

<h2>            How to get access my Temporary Internet Files folder and delet the templets&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I use a levono core i7 laptop that has Win 10 in it. Lately my laptop and browser are getting bit slow, so I tried to clean up my Temp files. I was able to clean up Windows Tem files and Apps Temp files easily. But I couldn't clean up the Temporary
 Internet Files.&nbsp; First, I tried one click option, ''Settings&gt; System files&gt; Storage&gt; Temporary files&gt; Delet temporary files. The process went for hours, but no result. Cleaning through Internet Explorer didn't worked either. So I tried to do it manually, C
 drive&gt; Users&gt; User name&gt; App data &gt; Microsoft&gt; Windows&gt;(Hiden protected operating system files)&gt; Temporary Internet Files. But I was denied access to 'Temporary Internet Files' folder no matter what I did. Even with Admin mode, I couldn't access the folder.
 It doesn't show how many files are in the folder or the sapce taken by the folder. Normally I don't have any problem to access the ''Hiden protected operating system files'' folders in Admin mode

<h2>            Windows 10 Updated Now I Can&#39;t Use My Scanner</h2>
                    <p>Last night Windows 10 installed an update and now my HP 6500A Plus printer/scanner will not scan anything. I cannot scan using HP's app, the windows scan app, or third party apps. I have another computer that is running windows 10 preview builds and it can
 scan from the device just fine on the same network. I've tried troubleshooting this with WIA, Shell hardware services etc. Everything is running. I've uninstalled the driver using revo, manually installed it etc. I can print to the device but scanning doesn't
 work if I initiate it from the computer or if I try starting it from the printer. What is going on?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Short answer - none of the "help" helped and the issues were exactly as described.&nbsp; I ended up replacing the hard drive (1 yr old - sheesh) due to some other minor, but numerous,s issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a couple of days installing/deleting/reinstalling the drivers (couldn't duplicate at shop for wireless printing - worked fine with USB), it now works in all modes.&nbsp; Last bug to work out is some where (spooler ops maybe), after each print document,
 it won't clear out of the queue for several minutes.&nbsp; If I queue more than two docs, it reprints the first and won't move to other docs.&nbsp; I can't even delete the document (it will say "deleting" but doesn't delete).&nbsp; 2 docs, I can make it cancel the printed
 one that it says is still "printing" and move to the next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say, print operations are put off as long as possible!&nbsp; lol</p>

<p><span>As per the description I understand that you are unable to get “Repair your computer” option window which supposed to come just after the Windows 7,
 “Install Windows” window. Since you have already tried using different Disk and getting the same result. It seems like the issue is occurring due to the error or issue in the system recovery partition as you are not getting “Repair your computer” screen, which
 is depend on Recovery partition. I will try my best to resolve your issue however we need few more details to understand the issue better.</span></p>

            <p>The original system partition is working fine.&nbsp; I want to copy it to an SSD.&nbsp;The original system has a reserve partition.&nbsp; I am leaving it alone so as not to run the risk of not being able to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I copied the bootmgr and Boot folder to the system partition
 on the original, and copied the system partition to the SSD.&nbsp; Then attempted to fix the startup on the copy using the install disk, but no link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no error message. The problem is simply that there is no link on page 2 of the booted to DVD&nbsp;Windows 7 Ultimate SP 1 install disk, when all drives are disconnected except the SSD with the copied system partition on it, so I cannot run Repair Startup.&nbsp;
 As I said before I have never seen that link simply disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, there are two options in the BIOS to use to boot to the optical drive.&nbsp; One is UEFI and the other is not.&nbsp; I am using the one that is not like I always do.&nbsp; The EUFI option won't boot the install disk at all. I think.&nbsp; There was a lot of trying this
 and that, so I may be mistaken, but is there a way to tell if the original system was installed using the EUFI option?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I confirmed it is a BIOS install, not UEFI. C:\Windows\Panther\setupact.log</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my routine:</p>
<p>To copy the system partition there are two issues.&nbsp; However, I should point out for desktop systems&nbsp;I use multiple partitioning across at least two drives, hopefully three.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If there is a reserve partition, </p>
<p>&nbsp; a) I assign a drive letter to it and then copy bootmgr and the Boot folder to the System partition (C:),&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; b) Using bootable Partition Wizard I delete the Reserve Partition, move the System partition to the front of the drive, and resize it to take up the space behind it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; c) Using the Windows Install disk I go to Repair Computer and the Repair Startup to fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; d) I then boot to it to make sure it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On new installs, I partition and format the entire&nbsp;HHD or SSD before I install Win 7 and no reserve partition is created.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Once a system is fully set up, I use Partition Wizard to copy the system partition to the front of another HDD or SSD and assign it a drive letter (X:), including the following steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp; a) After the copy in regedit&nbsp;I Load the system hive from the copied system&nbsp;into registry Local_Machine&nbsp;on the original.</p>
<p>&nbsp; b) In the original SYSTEM\Mounted Devices, I copy the contents of DOS\Devices\X:</p>
<p>&nbsp; c) In the copied SYSTEM\Mounted Devices, I paste to replace the contents of DOS\Devices\C:</p>
<p>&nbsp; d) Shutdown, unplug all drives except the copied to drive, and boot to the install disk to fix the startup to the copied system partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp; e) If it boots, then shutdown, reconnect all drives, tell BIOS to boot to new copy drive, to make sure all of the pointers to the other partition's work, and then shutdown, tell BIOS to boot to original, and in it I remove the drive letter for the copied
 partition so it does not show up in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I do this is so I can have a bootable backup system partition to replace the original once the original needs replacing for whatever reason.&nbsp; This way I don't have to start from scratch to renew the OS and Software and Drivers on the system partition.&nbsp;
 All I have to do is bring the backup up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cloning software doesn't work nor does the routine in Windows 7, because I use multiple partitions on drives, and the cloning does the entire physical drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done this routine many times, so I know it works.&nbsp; That said my explanation may not.&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now you can see why having the Repair Computer link show up on the second page of the install disk is important.&nbsp; At 2. d)&nbsp;there is no access to the Recovery SW on the HDD or SDD.</p>

            <p>The Win 7 Ultimate SP1 system and software partition [it has no data in it - data partition is separate] on a HDD was copied to a SSD using a method described above that I have used successfully many times.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the copy is completed it won't boot, so I unplug all of the other drives so the BIOS only sees the SSD and the optical drives.&nbsp; I then boot to the Install DVD in the optical drive, and on the first screen you have the option to choose language etc.
 and click on Next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Next page is the Install button and in the left bottom is the link that says Repair Computer, but in this case that link is missing.&nbsp; In the Repair Computer is where it then searches for Windows installations, so as I understand&nbsp;it, the Recovery Folder
 on the SSD would not be available to the install boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Repair Computer after it searches for Windows installations, I select Repair Startup, it does, and then it restarts the computer at which point I let it bypass the optical&nbsp;and boot into the now repaired copied Win 7 on the SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't do that if the Repair Computer link doesn't show up on the second page of the Install boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Questions:</p>
<p>1. <span>Are you able to boot the windows to desktop?</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~</span>The system on the HDD boots and works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. <span>Are you getting any error message while booting the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~NO, the Repair Computer link is simply missing, so you can't go forward.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. </span><span>Why are you trying to do Windows Repair?</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~I am trying to do Startup Repair so the copied system partition will boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. </span><span>How did you copied the system partition to the SSD?</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~That is explained in the post just prior to yours.</span></p>

<p>Okay - I purchased a new SSD and I have a working system partition on my old HDD.&nbsp; I want to have the working system partition on my SSD and then use the HDD strictly for data.&nbsp; If my method is so egregious, then what method would you recommend that does
 NOT include a fresh install of Win 7, all of its software, and all of the tweaks to set the system up, which is hours and hours and hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want&nbsp;to hear any more about MS policy violation, because I have done this with MS blessing.&nbsp; I mean, where do you think I got this routine?</p>

<h2>            USB drives becoming unusable- how to recover</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Ive had an issue over the years, where somehow a flash drive will become unusable and not even visible to the system.</p>
<p>It will either show up or not show up on Disk Management console. sometimes i can run DISKPART and use CLEAN to recover it. other times diskpart will either not show the drive, not allow CLEAN, etc.</p>
<p>sometimes the issue is that ill use a utility like Fedora media writer most recently, and to recover the drive i use the same tool which says it has been recovered but its not.</p>
<p>is there any software out there, or something in powershell that can help recover any usb? im guessing i should be looking at the registry entries or some drivers/firmware, but i want some fix that i can use on any usb if possible.</p>
<p>thanks!</p>

    <title>Is it possible to install Windows XP mode on drive &#34;x&#34; or any - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richard m2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it possible to install Windows XP mode on drive &#34;x&#34; or any drive other than drive &#34;C&#34; in a Windows 7 system&#63;  If so, how is it done&#63;</h2>
                    I originally downloaded Windows XP Mode and Windows Virtual Machine to my Windows 7 Ultimate machine.&nbsp; I installed XP Mode and Virtual Machine onto my C drive (which happens to be a solid state drive [SSD]). The SSD is running out of space, but my D drive
 (a 2TB drive) is almost empty.&nbsp; Is there some way for me to move the Virtual Machine from C to D, without having to remove and reinstall. or will I be required to remove and reinstall onto the D drive?&nbsp; Furthermore, is it even&nbsp;possible to install the Windows
 Virtual Machine to Drive D at all.&nbsp; Is there any special procedure to use to install Windows Virtual Machine on Drive D or do I just change the install drive letter to D?&nbsp; Your help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you very much.

<p><span><br />

            <p>Hi Sue,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand the frustration, when things don’t work as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like to know few information, so that I can assist you accordingly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Does the issue persist with any specific email or with all outgoing emails?</li><li>Which email domain have you associated with Windows Live Mail?</li></ol>
<p>In this case the error number (0x800CCC79) and the server response (550 relay not permitted) show what the problem actually is. The reason is that you have probably forgotten to enable SMTP server authentication, and it is required in order to send emails.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps below to enable <strong><span>My outgoing server requires authentication</span></strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the account name in the folder pane. </li><li>Select <em><strong><span>Properties</span></strong></em><em>.</em> On the
<strong>outgoing <em><span>Servers</span></em></strong>tab.</li><li>Select <em><strong><span>My server requires authentication</span></strong></em>. Click the
<em><strong><span>Settings</span></strong></em>button, then select
<em><strong><span>Log on using</span></strong></em>and enter your email address and password which is associated with Windows Live Mail.</li></ol>

<h2>            How do i turn off a scrolling feature on my new Dell Inspiron w&#47;Win 7.</h2>
                    On my Dell Insprion N5050 using the touchpad i put pointer on the scroll bar on the webpage im viewing.&nbsp; i double touch to grab the bar...then drag down the page, when i pull pointer off the bar to either select a link or whatever and i move, for example,
 to the left off the scroll bar with the pointer, the page immediately goes back to the top.&nbsp; If I want to take the pointer off the scroll bar without it doing this, you have to double tap again on it to get it out of that mode.&nbsp; My win XP laptop from gateway
 (MX6453) never had this type of problem when using its touchpad to drag any scroll bar in windows explorer or internet explorer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please tell me how to turn that property off.&nbsp; I did notice that when i drag the scroll bar using the left button to grab then
