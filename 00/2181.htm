<h2>            VERY DISSAPPOINTED WITH NOKIA&#33;&#33;&#33; N86 BRICKED</h2>
                    
<p>Once again, as far as i'm concerned, nokia has s*****d me over... As with my N95 (not the 8gb), my N86 has been destroyed when trying to update its firmware. To me it seems incomprehensible, how such a company considered to be the best in the mobile phones
 business, leaves such huge "holes" that can destroy a person's phone. through its own software. My updating procedure was moving on normally when it said that the connection to the device was lost, and after 20 minutes or so i canceled the procedure, with
 a few RETRYs in between. The result, exactly the same as my N95 one year ago almost... Not turning on, hard reset not working on it, nothing...dead...</p>
<p>What you get from nokia is a silly little guide on what to do when this happens, as if they are saying "Yes, our phone software will probably crash your phone. sorry about that". Im really sorry for reacting like this, but seriously...Im really frustrated...
 Brand new phone, first attempt on an update of its firmware, and then, ends up like my last phone. Just when i was thinking about the N900 with the new maemo software. I also read that if it is under warranty they will fix it for free. What if it wasnt? They
 broke it in the first place, with their amateuristic piece of software, whether its under warranty or not!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried the N93 thread with its quick fix...but at the moment my phone will not show any charging activity (white LED stays off) and when i press the power button, it vibrates but never comes on. If i keep it pressed down, it keeps vibrating. Same goes
 when trying to hard reset. Just keeps vibrating when i press the power button</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for giving me&nbsp;nothing but trouble Nokia......&nbsp; Disconnecting people...</p>

<p>Uh, why did you cancel the procedure? It will disconnect during an update process and reconnect again. Did you not read the prompt that it will do that during an update process? If the software does not say that the update failed and to try again, DO NOT
 CANCEL and leave the phone alone. So if what I'm reading is correct that you cancelled the procedure without that prompt, it may have been a case of you pulling the plug while the software on your PC was still accessing the phone. In which case you bricked
 the phone yourself without any help from Nokia.</p>

<p>Whatever happend during the update, you will need to take it to a Nokia care point and get them to fixe it. Im sorry for your experience with the update btw. It's always frustrating when things like this goes wrong.</p>

<p>I did not disconnect it prematurely. The software prompted me for "Device Recovery" and that it lost connection and gave me the option to "retry" connecting. As i said i followed the prompted procedure. Got it to connect again, and after a few minutes it
 failed again, so i left it for over 20 minutes, hoping that something would happen. I did whatever the software instructed me to, but the NSU failed to update twice already.</p>

<p>Yes, any firmware update may be dangerous. For any mobile brand. Normally though its not, but you see sometimes things with the PC and the Phone go awry. For example, AVs often make train wrecks out of firmware updates if not configured properly.</p>

<p>Any Firmware update of any product that goes wrong can Brick the item concerned .</p>
<p>Be it CD DVD drives &gt;&nbsp; Mobile Phones&nbsp; MP3 Players &gt; Set Top boxes etc .</p>
<p>Never come across one yet where a brick has not been the fault of the users PC .</p>

<p>Although the ones in the Nokia Care center are safe since they have a CD copy of the update file (at least here in care centers in my country), and they have what is called a Nokia Care Suite, not Pc or Ovi Suite.</p>

<p>Take out battery for 5min, then reinsert. Hold the green, 3 and * buttons as you power up (meaning you have 4 fingers pressing different buttons on the phone at the same time. Do not let go of the three buttons until you see the country selection screen.</p>

<h3> kenny bones  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint 2007 - The macro cannot be found or has been disabled because of your security settings</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, this is bugging me a lot!<br />
I opened a .potm template with the custom UI editor and added these lines:</p>
<p>&lt;customUI xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/2006/01/customui"<br />
onLoad="onLoadCode" &gt;<br />
&lt;/customUI&gt;</p>
<p>This creates an event handler that basically runs the macro "onLoadCode" when it's loaded.</p>
<p>Now, this is working when I open the template just like normal. The macro is fired and everything is good.<br />
But if I start a new document from this template I get this error message stated in the title of this thread.</p>
<p>The security settings are set to Low, allow everything. And it still gives me this error. I've worked all day on this macro and though it was working all along and now it doesn't because of some stupid sh*t like this.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Is the onLoadCode also in documents based on your .potm?&nbsp;&nbsp; Probably not, and that's the problem.</p>
<p>PPT is looking for your onLoadCode, but it's not there (in any open file or loaded add-in) where it can be found.&nbsp; In other words, the first part of the error message is correct and you can ignore the part about "or has been disabled ...etc."</p>
<p>Depending on what you're after, you'll probably want to put the code in an add-in rather than in a template, or distribute it as a PPTM and have people (or code) open the PPTM and save it to a new name.</p>
<p>And yes.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; Word and Excel don't work that way.&nbsp; Welcome to the wonderful and slightly weird world of PowerPoint.&nbsp; ;-)</p>

<p>Nono, the onLoadCode macro are in the documents based on the template. I can open the macros and run them and everything is fine.<br />
I mean, when a template has a macro in it, all documents based on the macro also get these macros. It's like this in Word templates as well.</p>
<p>I just doublechecked this and I go to the Developer tab, click Visual Basic and there it is. No other PowerPoint documents or templates are open right now. I would also see that in the Visual Basic editor if they were. All I see right now is VBAProject (Presentation28)
 and under there, Microsoft PowerPoint Objects -&gt; SlideLayout12 and SlideMaster which both have the Sub onLoadCode() in them. I also have a Sub onLoadCode in Module1 which is in the same presentation.</p>
<p>But now when I think about it, it should probably be an add-in shouldn't it? I mean, when users go to save the presentation, they are presented with the message that this presentation can't be saved with macros if the file extension isn't potm or pptm. Does
 this apply to Word documents as well?</p>

<p>When I send an e-mail from outlook 2007 to a lotus notes user and they reply, the reply is blank.&nbsp; If i leave the e-mail on my ISPs server and check the reply there, the response is visible.&nbsp; Additonally i can receive original notes from a lotus notes user
 without any problems.</p>

<h3> tractor_girl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connecting Nokia 6820 to my PC&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    HELP!!! Ok, where to begin??? I have a new Nokia 6230i that in due course I want to connect to my pc, but while I was waiting for this to arrive I tried to connect my sons Nokia 6820 to our pc via a DKU-5 cable. I tried both Nokia PC Suite version 6.5
 &amp; 6.7 but with no luck of the phone getting connected with either. I uninstalled them and just kept with the older version (5.22) that came on the connectivity/driver disc, &amp; even tho thru this the pc has at LAST recognised the 6820 &amp; got connected (yippee),I
 STILL can't upload stuff from the pc to the 6820!! All it would do is upload to the actual 'Nokia' Gallery within the Nokia PC Suite, which is where my sons fone is located, but not to HIS Gallery on HIS fone.<br />
I have now received my new 6230i which thru more homework knows it requires a DKU-2 cable. No probs, I can go and get one of those but what's to say I'll have the same problem??? I have Window XP. Plus, if I was brave enough to try out my 6230i with a DKU-2
 cable, would the drivers etc on the pc clash? But one step at a time - if I get the 6820 phone sorted, I'll be happy!!! All help much appreciated!!!

            In order to have as clean setup as possible, here's some rules about Pc Suite:<br />
You cannot install PC Suite 5.xx and Pc Suite 6.xx into same PC, so uninstall 5.22.<br />
<br />
You need a separate driver sw for DKU-5 cable (but since your PC connects, you have the driver there already, so I would leave that)<br />
<br />
Now you need to install the newest PC Suite 6.70.22. The new version has drivers for your 6230i and with that 6230i you can use DKU-2 cable(old version) and a new version of that same cable, CA-53. I recommend you buy CA-53, it is better.<br />
<br />
When you get your 6230i and connect that to CA-53 and PC (remember, you have to have installed PC Suite first!), you will see that 6230i will ask a question about "allow data transfer", YES or NO.<br />
If you answer YES, you will get your memorycard visible in your PC (and BTW, that does not require any additional sw in your PC, not even PC Suite or thedrivers, that is Windows mass storage(removable disk) mode.<br />
<br />
If you answer "NO", you will get PC Suite CA-53 drivers loaded and you will get move features working: phone memory access, contacts, messages, sync backup and so on.<br />
<br />
Please let us know how it all goes once you get the phone.

            Many thnx 4 yr prompt response as I am so, so desperate to get this working - ok, thing is, at the moment itz the 6820 that I am having trouble with - even tho I do have my new 6230i, I know I have to get a seperate cable 2 use that (as u say, the CA-53),
 so shall leave that for now.<br />
Back to the 6820 - I did try and use it with the newer version of PC Suite (tried both 6.5 &amp; 6.7) but the 6820 wldn't connect with either of them, even tho on the Nokia website it DOES say that 6.7 is compatible to the 6820, so thatz the only reason I used
 5.22, because at the very LEAST it did connect, but the problem is even tho it now connects wiv the pc ok using Nokia PC Suite 5.22, it won't let me put/drag/drop/transfer stuff onto the actual 6820 fone (ie) music, sounds, pics.<br />
Until I get this sorted, I daren't go out and buy another cable (CA-53) for my 6230i, u see wot I mean?
<br />
At this point, I just wanna be able to upload stuff from my pc to the 6820, and if &amp; WHEN (!)this works, I'll sort out my own 6230i.<br />
I am here tearing my hair out and awaiting yr remarks. U have been very kind to an Ipswich Town fan!! :o)

            (OK, let's leave 6230i aside for a while)<br />
<br />
(by the way, check your system this way: right click on the Pc Suite phone icon in Windows Tary area (bottom right), select about Pc Suite and then System info. let me know what does it say.<br />
<br />
<br />
When you connect 6860 with DKU-5 cable to PC, following things should happen: your phone screen says something like "dataenhancement connected" and the PC suite should pop up a bubble in Windows Tray stating "Nokia 6820 connected".<br />
<br />
If you then go to start-&gt; Programs - Nokia Pc Suite and slect that, a launcher with icon should appear and again you should see at the bottom of that PC Suite launcher that "Nokia 6820 connected via cable"<br />
<br />
Now you should select "file manager" icon. Windows Explorer starts up and you will see at the left hand side your "file&amp;folder tree". If you don't see that, select "folders" button at the top of the Windows Explorer menu area. There you should see Nokia PHone
 Browser and under that you should see your phone icon and if you click on it, you should see under that the folder structure of your phone.<br />
<br />
Then you select the file you want to move from your PC and drag and drop that to the appropriate folder there is in the phone (I don't remember what folders there are in 6820, it is somewhat old phone already and it does not have a camera so that gallery is
 limited).<br />
<br />
If you cannot follow this, please explain exactly what goes wrong and do you get error message etc.

            Hi - right: to start with, I see u think the newer version of pc uite shld qwork, so ok, I didn't uninstall it - so as you said, I checked my system: it said:
<br />
<br />
Operating System: Windows XP<br />
Build 2600<br />
Service pack 2<br />
Bluetooth stack: Microsoft Bluetooth stack<br />
Version 5.1.2600.2180<br />
<br />
After that, I connected phone to pc - NO notificaion on the phone saying 'dataenhancement..' - pc suite DIDN'T pop up in a bubble in Windows Tray stating 'Nokia 6820 connected.'<br />
But I gamely plodded on and went to Start - Prog - Nokia PC suite - yes, launcher with icons appeared but DIDN'T say at the bottom 'Nokia 6820 connected via cable' it just said in black writing: Plse select the 'get connected' button to help you to connect
 your fone to your computer,' but i didn't do that as I've done it many times and it doesn't connect. Below that, to the left, it simply said 'No phones connected.'<br />
As for the file&amp;folder tree, no luck! All I got in the Nokia Phone Browser were two icons, one saying 'Create a new contact' and one 'Create a new text' - again with a note telling me no phone was connected.<br />
<br />
Shall I try all of the above again, using the PC suite 5.22 version instead? Or do I just give up and go lay down in a darkened room with a bottle of scotch?

            (I doupt the Scotch will do the trick, but it is always nice to have a good excuse for a scotch ;-))<br />
<br />
Fine. Bad news: you are not connected and my very suspection is that you have bought a non-Nokia DKU-5 cable and that is NOT working. At least it is not working with the Nokia Dku-5 driver. Sorry about that. I know NOkia cables are expensive, but the good news
 is that they work. non-Nokia cables seem to be the worst type: some work, some don't, but you never know when you go to ebay which ones do.<br />
<br />
But what makes me wonder it the thing that you say that you have managed to get PC Suite 5.22 (that really old) and Dku-5 to connect...I very much think that you have not made the connection.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is: if the phone is "dead" when you connect, (meaning it does not say "dataenhancement connected", you are not connected.)<br />
<br />
About 6230i: you should be just fine with it, as long as you invest and buy a real Nokia CA-53.

            Funny thing - when I read yr email this morning I felt relieved as I tought I knew what to do, and that is forget the DKU-5/Nokia 6820 and just go and buy a CA-53 for my 6230i because you reckon the DKU-5 wasn't a Nokia and therefore not compatible to
 the 6820, which makes sense - but when I had a look at my purchase details from E-Bay, it clearly stated 'Nokia' USB DKU-5 !! Now I just don't know what to do cos if I went out and bought another Nokia cable (ie) CA-53, who'se to say it also won't work? The
 Nokia DKU-5 also said it 'was compatible with Nokia PC Suite,' which hasn't worked for me either, apart from that old version which doesn't even work when connected - (hic) (burp) .... second bottle ....

            one quick way of checking is to look at the end that plugs into the phone, do you see something printed there or stamped into the rubber?

            I did look but cldn't see anything - I have been 'talking' to another very helpful person re: my problem (I must thank him/her), but wonder if u can make head or tail of this latest development...:<br />
<br />
Re: the Nokia 6820 connected via DKU-5:<br />
As I've said, I can connect it 2 my pc ok but had trouble transferring files from pc to phone.<br />
What I just did was this:<br />
<br />
'Copy' the file required <br />
Go to My Computer - Nokia Phone Browser - Nokia 6820 (or the name I gave it) - select a phone sub folder - paste the file into this - and it should appear - but I got this instead:<br />
<br />
'Operation could not be completed'<br />
<br />
Any ideas? It's weird cos u actually see the file 'trying' to be pasted - it appears then disappears and I get that above message!<br />
So, so close - is there anything on my pc that could possibly be blocking it from loading?<br />
I took my chances and have ordered a CA-53 cable to use with my Nokia 6230i, which shld arive 2mrw - now I wonder if that wont work too!!!<br />
Very grateful for any help!!! Really wanna use my pc and phone!!!

            PS: Could my problem be anything to do with the COM port? I went into Cont Panel - Hardware - Dev Manager - Ports (com+lpt) and it says COMM PORT : Com 1<br />
When I went into the Nokia PC Suite (version 5.22) and clicked on 'Connection Manager' - 'Advanced,' my pc only recognised my Nokia 6820 when I selected 'COM 4.'<br />
I feel a bit iffy changing the port setting on my pc. Do you think that the error message I quoted in my previous message has anything to do with this, and also when I get the cable (CA-53) to use with my new Nokia 6230i, would I have the same problem re: the
 COM port?? Just so much to ask!!!

            YOur new 6230i and old phone 6820 are fundamentally different. Nokia 6230i is a real USB device, so the connection is a real USB connection, not COM.<br />
<br />
Your old phone makes a serial post connection although you physically connect the cable to USB port.<br />
<br />
So there is no need to compare those 2, Nokia 6230i will be much more straight forward connection.<br />
<br />
(that is why the cables are different, the cable for your old phone has some imbedded firmware in it to make the PC think that it is a serial port connection even though it comes through USB port, but 6230i cable is simple dummy cable that connects a USB device(the
 phone) to USB port.

    <title>Re-activate Office for Mac 2016 on a new laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Re-activate Office for Mac 2016 on a new laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, </p>
<p>
</p><p>After my Macbook got stolen I had to rebuild my system on a new machine from a time machine backup. Everything worked fine, except for my Office 2016 for Mac (installed from a multi-activation volume license from my University) that I just can't activate.
</p>
<p>The dialogue from "Word-&gt;Activate Office" does not even ask me for a product key, just for a Microsoft account (which I do have for Skype, but which does not have any licenses connected with it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really want to avoid a re-installation (which would require me to download and rebuild my 80-GB-Outlook-Mailbase), so how can I re-activate this existing installation of Office? Do I need to deactivate the license for my old machine somewhere?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best, Volkmar</p>

    <title>Lumia 735 Windows Phone 8.1 dropping Calendar events - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> govolunteers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 735 Windows Phone 8.1 dropping Calendar events</h2>
                    <p>I have events posted in my phone calendar for the entire year but recently events have begun disappearing. &nbsp;Initially I lost two weeks worth of events from April 18 to May 1. &nbsp;All events before that and after that still appeared correctly. &nbsp;Then a few weeks
 later I noticed that the events from May 2 to May 15 disappeared. &nbsp;There is one peculiar exception, US Holidays still show up while the Birthday and Calendar&nbsp;events (the ones I input) are gone. &nbsp;I use outlook.com to enter events on my laptop as well as entering
 events in my Windows Phone. Until recently they have worked well together syncing events back and forth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely, if I go back and enter an event in the April 18 to May 15 time frame using outlook.com the event will not sync to my WIndows Phone but if I enter the same event in my WIndows Phone IT WILL SYNC to outlook.com ... weird huh? &nbsp;Any event entered
 outside the April 18 to May 1 period will sync properly regardless of where it's entered (outlook or phone).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a clue on what may be happening? &nbsp;So far only past events are disappearing but I'm concerned this behavior may start affecting future events which will make the phone calendar unreliable and useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>

            Can you be a little more specific (maybe a link) where I can read about this behavior? &nbsp;So far my googling "windows phone website" hasn't turned up anything that describes this behavior. &nbsp;Also, I find it highly unusual that none of the events before or
 after the April 18 to May 15 were removed ... at least not yet.

            Thanks. Yes I did check and outlook.com shows all events for the year but I did not find any way to force a sync from outlook.com. &nbsp;However, on the windows phone I was able to force a sync by going to settings-email_accounts and pressing my Microsoft account
 until the "sync" window appeared but forcing a sync made no difference; the missing events were not restored.

            <p>Thanks for the reply but my problem was not with syncing it was with events unexpectedly disappearing from my Window Phone Calendar. &nbsp;After hours of googling and reading many instances of "disappearing events" it's clear to me that this is a bug, most likely
 in the Windows Phone app, that caused these events to disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding syncing ... my tests have proven that outlook.com will allow you to input events older than two weeks but it
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I'm done trying to resolve this strange incident but I thank all of those that replied.</p>

                    Im using OneDrive and Groove Music. How do i copy the songs from a playlist into onedrive from Groove? As it stands now i have to find the single song in the playlist, click its properties, go to its file location and copy it one at a time. For a playlist
 with 300 songs this is retarded. There has to be a better way. If not ill just go back to Itunes, at least it can drag a playlist to a location and copy lal the files for me!

            <p>This method involves using iTunes as the middleman, sorry, but if you already have iTunes installed and it sees all your music, you might want to try it. It takes advantage of the fact that songs in a playlist in iTunes can be dragged to Windows' File Explorer.
 (I hate that the ultrasimple method of&nbsp;Windows 8.1's&nbsp;Share charm in Xbox Music is gone with Windows 10. What was better than&nbsp;selecting a playlist and choosing to "Share to Windows Phone"!?)</p>
<ol>
<li>Create new playlist in iTunes.</li><li>Fill it with the songs you want. Don't bother adjusting song order. Using the iTunes search box to find the songs and dragging them to the playlist will be faster than drilling into song properties in Groove.</li><li>Create a folder on your desktop with a name such as "playlist."</li><li>Select all the songs in the iTunes playlist and drag them to the folder on your desktop. The underlying MP3s or M4As will copy.
</li><li>In OneDrive, upload the contents of the folder. When done, you can delete the folder from your desktop&nbsp;because the original files&nbsp;still reside locally in the&nbsp;iTunes library.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol>

</p><p>Based on the description from the private message, we would like to suggest you make a copy of the document with red line, and then accept or reject changes there (Once accept or reject process is completed, the document will not show red line any more).
 Then, you can have 3 documents as you prefer.</p>

            <p>Hi Maurice, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting the question.&nbsp; I understand that you do not see the Groups option.&nbsp; We've released some changes this month on how you navigate around the People page. These changes were made to make it more consistent
 with how your contacts are presented. The Groups' dropdown menu have been removed and Groups have been integrated to your contacts list. Please refer to the link below for additional details.&nbsp;

<h2>            Incorrect &#34;HumanTime&#34; when exporting chat to CSV file</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed something a bit weird when choosing to export one's chat history to a CSV file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to reproduce:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Choose menu Tools -&gt; Options... -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Export Chat History.</p>
<p>2. Choose a filename and hit OK.</p>
<p>3. Load up the CSV in your favorite editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll see that column 5, named "Human Time", always has the value&nbsp;"--?T::Z" in there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like it wants to put an ISO 8601 date/time in there as GMT/Zulu (YYYY-MM-DD<strong>T</strong>HH:MM:SS<strong>Z</strong>) but isn't given the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else getting this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Desktop (on Windows 10), version 7.40.0.104.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boz.</p>

<p><span><span>This is a known bug in the CSV export file. The original timestamp in the chat database file, the main.db file, is saved as UNIX Time.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.unixtimestamp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://www.unixtimestamp.com/</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Apparently, the people who created the export file didn't know how to handle UNIX Time and to convert it to a "human time".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Open the .csv file in Excel. The original Unix Time is in column F. In column H enter this formula:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>=(((F2/60/1000)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Format the cells in this column to show your preferred Date format.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa06fc8d-ed40-45fc-ae17-045a404b58c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa06fc8d-ed40-45fc-ae17-045a404b58c9" /></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>On the other hand, there is no reason to use this clumsy CSV history export tool. Instead, you can download the free
<strong>SkypeLogView</strong></span><span> application, with which you can view and export chat history saved in any main.db file associated with the classic Skype for Windows Desktop.</span></span></span></p>

            <p>The quick-and-dirty way is to Select All (Ctrl+A) and change the font.</p>
<p>A better way is to right-click in any paragraph, and choose Font, which will open the Font dialog. Select the font and size you want and&nbsp;click Set As Default. You'll get a dialog asking whether you want to change the font for just this document or all new
 documents based on the attached template. In this case, you probably want to change it just for this document.</p>
<p>If you have a mix of fonts in the document and want to make all of them a little smaller, there are two approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ctrl+&lt; will reduce all font sizes to the next smaller size listed in the Font dropdown.
</li><li>Ctrl+[ will reduce all font sizes by one point.</li></ol>
<p>Ctrl+&gt; and Ctrl+] will increase font sizes correspondingly. Ctrl+A before using these shortcuts.</p>
<p>Still another approach is to use the ShrinkOnePage command, which is described at
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-word/how-to-find-the-shrink-to-fit-option-in-word-2010/33e0e9b6-ae7e-4305-971f-5d6de6998be6">

 Toolbar. Or you can add the classic PrintPreviewEditMode command, which displays the classic Print Preview; the Shrink to Fit button is on the Ribbon in that view.</p>

                    <p>I use OneNote 2016 on a daily basis, frequently capturing screen clipping using the keyboard shortcut (Windows + Shift + S).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading my systems to Windows 10 Build 1703 - Screen clipping continues to work, however it no longer sends the clipping to the default OneNote section.&nbsp; The options are still configured the same way, it just does not send to OneNote. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reproduced this issue without fail, on every system where I have installed and/or upgrade to Windows 10 Build 1703 (8 PCs including VMs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this does not seem to be an isolated case, but I am unable it seems to use the right search words or phrases to locate any thread of conversation on this issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi Michael,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'd like to explain that with the Windows 10 Creators Update, Win+Shift+S uses the Window Clipping Tool and sends screenshot to the clipboard. We need to press Ctrl + V to complete inserting the screenshot to your notebook.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you want to continue using the old behavior, you can right-click on the OneNote 2016 icon and select “Take screen clipping.” For power users, you can also try reassigning the behavior to a different keyboard shortcut. Please note that this is only
 recommended for advanced users.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Changing the keyboard shortcut for OneNote 2016:</span></p>
<p>1. Open RegEdit.exe</p>
<p>2. Go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\OneNote\Options\Other\</p>
<p>3. Add a new DWORD with the name “ScreenClippingShortcutKey” with the value “0x41”</p>
<p>4. Note: You can use any character code you want. In this case, “0x41” is the ‘A’ key</p>
<p>5. Restart your computer</p>
<p>6. You can now use Win+Shift+A to take a screen clipping</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<h3> jason alldridge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office 2010 Professional Plus activation code</h2>
                    Dear Microsoft I have or should I say had Microsoft Office 2010 Professional Plus which I upgraded from Microsoft publisher 2003 and I used it a lot until my pc stopped working I have now got a new PC I have uploaded all my files which I always remembered
 to backup as advised only to be told that I can not reload on to another pc I will have to pay another £150 to carry on using it, (and going on this premise I was lucky I almost had almost 2 years worth out of it, if my PC had gone down a week after buying
 it that would have been that then. Am I right or is there a way of getting a new activation code as the old one no longer works. I have email proof of purchase from 05/02/2012<br />

            How did you get Pro Plus? It is a limited distribution bundle?&nbsp; The most common source I know of is the HUP, Home Use Program.
<br />
<br />
The reason I ask is you must have a license type that allows you to transfer the installation, or that allows install on more than one computer.<br />
<br />
You could try generic MS Support as Doug suggested in the hope of getting a replacement code, or you could try doing a phone activation.&nbsp; When you phone in don't reply to the initial prompts. Instead do something to branch the phone system into error mode,
 either by simply not replying to any of the prompts or by hitting wrong buttons to all of the questions it poses.&nbsp; Eventually you should be offered the option of talking to a live 'service' rep.&nbsp; Explain the problem to them. They should be able to tell you
 exactly what the cause of the error is, in more detail than the generic messages do.<br />
<br />
Maybe you can extend the terms of the next 2 references to include 2010 (if you are a quick talker)<br />

2013 03 06- Office 2013 now transferable

<p>While the license agreement accompanying Office 2013 software will be updated in a&nbsp;future release, this change is effective immediately and applies to Office Home and Student 2013, Office Home and Business 2013, Office Professional 2013 and the standalone
 Office 2013 applications. These transferability options are equivalent to those found in the Office 2010 retail license terms. The updated text is as follows:
</p>
<p>Updated transferability provision to the Retail License Terms of the Software License Agreement for Microsoft Office 2013 Desktop Application Software:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><em>Can I transfer the software to another computer or user? You may transfer the software to another computer that belongs to you, but not more than one time every 90 days (except due to hardware failure, in
 which case you may transfer sooner). If you transfer the software to another computer, that other computer becomes the “licensed computer.” You may also transfer the software (together with the license) to a computer owned by someone else if a) you are the
 first licensed user of the software and b) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement before the transfer. Any time you transfer the software to a new computer, you must remove the software from the prior computer and you may not retain any copies.

FINALLY, I have a quote from a MS source that says there is a mechanism for getting a new Product Key if your computer dies</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;In the event that a customer buys the Office 2013 software and installs it on a PC that fails under warranty, the customer can contact support to receive an exemption to activate the Office 2013 software on the replacement PC. &lt;/snip&gt;</p>

I Bought Office Online – Replace Lost Product Key / Download Installation File
<p>If you bought Office as an online download, return to the website you bought it from and use your “Windows Live” e-mail address to log in to an account that was setup for you. The account lists all online purchases, product keys
 and installation file download links: The 2 most commonly used online stores are MS and Digital River:</p>

How to obtain a new product key for a Microsoft Office 2010 suite, Lost Product Key support – lost key
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/823570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/823570</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>You need 2 things to install Office, your unique personal 25 character “Product Key” and the generic Office installation file / disk for the matching Office bundle.</p>
<p>The above link describes the formal MS support available.</p>
<p>To summarize the article, it depends on how you bought Office:</p>
<p>If you have a 1-computer (online download), “PKC” (Product Key Card), “MLK” (Medialess Kit), “OEM” (factory installed and Activated) type license you cannot transfer the license to a new computer. It is only good on the first
 computer it is installed on and stays permanently with the computer when it is sold or scrapped.</p>
<p>If you have a 2-computer or 3-computer for Home and Student only (online download), “FPP” (online download), Boxed retail CD/DVD (which is usually the”FPP” type), these types of license may be transferred to new comptuers as
 required.</p>
<p>All licenses available to the general public that I am aware of may be re-installed on the same computer, even after limited upgrades like adding RAM, new HD, re-installing Windows, upgrading Windows version etc.</p>
<p>The link above describes where to look for Product Key numbers.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you still have a computer that Office was installed and activated on, which you have NOT re-installed or upgraded Windows let us know and we can provide links to tools that will extract the key from your HD.</p>
<p>If your purchase was through the Microsoft Store, You can contact them at 1-877-696-7786 or login using your credentials in the link below:
<a href="http://store.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(39, 108, 255, 1)">http://store.microsoft.com</span></a>&nbsp; and they may be able to provide download details.</p>
<p>If your purchase was through Digital River, refer the following link:<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

These links discuss the issue. The short answer is you have to convince MS Support to give you a new product key.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So, unless you have overwhelming proof of your original purchase and loss (police report, insurance claim) MS won’t even consider giving you any satisfaction.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Actually MS would prefer that you, or your insurance company, pay for a new copy of Office.

<p>
</p><p>To better understand the situation, please provide us with the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Regarding "I see that domain is already verified", how do you know the domain has been verified in an Office 365 tenant?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Do you have the ownership of the domain?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Is that tenant created by you or someone you know?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, we'd like to collect the custom domain to check the information. To protect the privacy, I have sent you a private message asking for the domain. You can access it via the link below:</p>

            If you have blocked them, they will not be able to message you. Even if they have found a way to message you, they will not be getting any notification back.
<br />
<br />But do let me know if they have found a way to message you.

<h2>            Mac Office 2011 - issue creating tab-delimited files</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>
Hi:</p>
<p>
I'm trying to create tab-delimited text files with several columns from an Excel spreadsheet created in the Mac version of Office. This file is, in turn, being used as input to a script that will be reading the lines sequentially and performing various processes.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the script disregards the last line, because there is no line terminator at the end of the last line. I can see line breaks (shown as ^M in my editor) in the file at the end of every line&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>except&nbsp;</strong></span>the
 last one.</p>
<p>
When I create the exact same text file in Excel 2010 on my PC, it works fine - the final terminator is present.</p>
<p>
Is this a bug, or is there a way to fix this discrepancy?</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Thank you</p>

            Use send feedback from the help menu to explain the issue to Microsoft. They indeed look at all the feedbacks, but will probably not respond to you. The mor completely you explain the problem and its impact to you, the better the chance of getting it addressed
 in a future update.<br />

    <title>Applying multiple conditional formatting rules to one cell - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Applying multiple conditional formatting rules to one cell</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to format cell H2 to highlight the text in red bold if cell I2 is blank , and format the text as regular if cell I2= "yes"</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's no problem. It's working great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I also need to format cell H2 to highlight the text bold blue if cell I2 is blank, but cell J2="yes".</p>
<p>I've tried a bunch of different solutions, and I can't get the conditional formatting I want to work at all.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>It seems so simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help me find the trick to make it work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you x infinity!</p>

            <p>Hi, to do that go to new rule, use a formula in the format value box enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>=AND(I2="",J2="yes")</p>
<p>
