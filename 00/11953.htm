<h2>            Unable to sign in to Office applications</h2>
                    <p>I recently had to reinstall Office. Ever since then, I've been unable to sign in to any of my applications, despite the fact that I have a stable internet connection and my installations are activated and valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem persists on both of my PCs - one is running Windows 7, the other, Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to input my login information, but once, I do... nothing happens. The sign-in popup disappears, but I am not signed in. No error message appears, nothing happens. It's incredibly aggravating and I'm not sure what's going on or what to do about
 it.</p>

            My question was not whether the Optimize program in Build 10041 worked or not, but was how do I get it to open when I click on it.&nbsp; At present, the program icon is dead and does nothing.

                    Hey...<br />
I just got my N80 in the mail today...<br />
I have a WiFi net at home, with WEP password...<br />
<br />
How do i set it up?<br />
And how do i juse the WiFi browser?

            Add/create a new WLAN/Wi-Fi Access point in the "Settings" app to match your home Wi-Fi router/access point (from which you get the right settings).<br />
<br />
This you do on the phone under menu &gt; Toos &gt; Settings &gt; Connection &gt; Access points<br />
<br />
I don't know what you mean with "WiFi browser"? If you mean the "Home networking" thingy, then you need to install a UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) server on your home PC(s), or enabled it on your consumer electronics stuff such as TV, video recorders, game
 consoles or whatever you have that might support UPnP.<br />
<br />
See the "Simple Center software" for your PC for UPnP here:<br />
<a href="http://europe.nokia.com/A4149138" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/A4149138</a><br />
<br />
Other than that, if you have the Wi-Fi properly set up, you can use the regular "Web" browser to connect to the Internet through your Wi-Fi (change the browser setting from the default access point to either your Wi-Fi access point, or to ask you to choose
 an access point every time you connect).

<p>Hi Betty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that you have an Excel spreadsheet with 450 peoples email addresses, and some how it was changed to an earlier version. Since it can be changed to an earlier version, I guess the spreadsheet is stored in your OneDrive for Business folder. If so,
 you may try the following steps to retrieve it:</p>
<p>1. Sign in the OneDrive.com site with your Office 365 for Business account;</p>
<p>2. Click the vertical ellipses following the spreadsheet, then select Version history;</p>
<p>3. Select a version that contains the correct information, and restore it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my above suggestion could not address your concern, please tell us your detailed process of how this happened and let us check it for you on our side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Nathan</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To uninstall an Office add-in from Word 2016, open a new or existing Word document. Under
<strong>Insert </strong>tab, click <strong>My Add-ins</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/83faccea-ae92-4aa7-9d42-c35ee9926d27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/83faccea-ae92-4aa7-9d42-c35ee9926d27" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>A new window will open showing all the add-ins installed for Office. Right-click on the add-in you wish to uninstall and select
<strong>Remove</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cf33be16-2f31-4854-95fd-67779449d9fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cf33be16-2f31-4854-95fd-67779449d9fa" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This should removed the add-in completely from the Office app it's associated with.</p>

 I'm using Windows 10 version 1809 and build 18317.1000. Yesterday by mistake I even deleted the previous version's recovery files so now I can't find a way to go back to the previous STABLE build. Can anyone help me with this? I don't want to lose my data
 or uninstall all the applications and start from scratch. So if anyone has a solution for this, please please help me :(

<p>Hi @johnthepilot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just an inquiry.&nbsp; If you downgrade to an earlier Insider Build, are you saying you will lose app and file data or just the possible&nbsp; risk of data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to me I have used prior ISOs to downgrade from a faulty current release.&nbsp; I have my data tucked away on the cloud so never a worry about data loss.&nbsp; You give great advice on having backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On one of the famous recent bad updates where I lost my LCD, I just cloned the Insider build to my public build and waited for the next Insider and then used UUPDUMP to get me the ISO for new build and I was up and running again.</p>

<p>Thanks for the great reply! Can you please just tell me how to downgrade to earlier insider build to skip 18317 build?&nbsp; I will even turn on slow pace instead of fast.<br />

<p>If you downgrade you won't get the the choice to keep apps and files. You could recover files from the Windows.old directory but it's basically a clean install.</p>
<p>Instead of downgrading, try reinstalling Build 18317 on top of the existing one by mounting the ISO via Explorer, run setup.exe and chose to keep apps and files or wait for the next build, possibly today or tomorrow. You can get the ISO using UUP dump following

<h2>            need help with new 6126</h2>
                    I just got a new unbranded 6126. I popped in my cingular sim and it connected just fine. I can send and receive calls just fine.<br />
<br />
But when I looked into updating the firmware, I don't see any selection for 6126. In fact, I don't see 6126 listed anywhere in the website. Based on what I've read here and elsewhere, I believe that the 6126 and the 6131 are very similar. I do find firmware
 updates for the 6131, but I don't know if a 6131 firmware update can be downloaded to a 6126 phone.<br />
<br />
Any one know how to get firmware updates for the 6126?

                    <p>I have recently purchased a 2nd hand laptop which I use for my business.</p>
<p>Yesterday my Outlook 2010 stopped sending and receiving emails. (I still am able to get them on my phone though)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the account information (Info) an Upgrade Now button appears saying that I must upgrade to the latest version of Outlook Hotmail Connector to continue using this e-mail account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I press the Upgrade Now button and nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Office works and they sold me 365 which I installed - NOTHING.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It asks me for a password (I wouldn't have the faintest idea what this would be and the person I purchased the comp from now lives overseas and I don't have contact details for him)</p>

<p>hi ron,</p>
<p>it’s not feasible to follow a folder. for sharepoint online, only <strong>user, document, site</strong>, or

<h2>            can not preview mov files in outlook 365&#47;2016</h2>
                    <p>I cannot preview mov video files in outlook 2016. I am told by Microsoft that Outlook 365/2016 is not designed to do so.
</p>
<p>mov video files are a common video files - video files made by an apple device. &nbsp;</p>
<p>90% of the video files I receive in emails are mov files - I need to be able to preview them.
</p>
<p>Isn't outlook 365 sold to mac users too???? This means that mac users will not be able to preview video files in outlook that were taken on their own device.
</p>
<p>Outlook 365/2016&nbsp;users - WINDOWS &amp; MAC USERS - reply to this post - let Microsoft now this isn't good enough. You pay good money for this subscription. Let them know this is a feature that is required by their users since mov files are very common video
 files</p>

</p><p>#1 - Seems you already have rec'd the answer albeit, not one that you like</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Yes Outlook is sold to Mac users and they download the Mac version of Outlook (desktop) which differs from PC based Outlook (desktop)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - Don't know why .mov isn't supported but suspect it may have to do with a few different things such as:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Apple Ends Support for QuickTime for Windows; New Vulnerabilities Announced</p>
<p><a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA16-105A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA16-105A<br />
</a>&nbsp;<br />
*** given that QuickTime is pretty much the defacto player for .mov - am curious, is anyone in an uproar and asking Apple why they've dropped "QuickTime for Windows"? Perhaps Apple should be focused on the .MP4 standard instead of .MOV (would there be a reason
 that you don't ask Apple why they don't provide MP4 files which is no different then asking MS about .mov support?)<br />
</p>
<p>b) personally have found playback of .mov files via Media Player to be PITA depending on how the .mov was created with issues related to Codecs etc - simpler to convert the .mov libraries I own to .mp4.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You dont need quick time to play mov, windows media player plays it. If you have codecs issues download them. I have never had quicktime to watch mov.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can open and play mov in outlook. I cant preview mov. I can preview mp4. Preview and opening are two different things. I wont to be able to preview mov in outlook. I want to be able to preview all common video files that arrive in my inbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel you are making this a windows vs mac thing. It is not a windows verses mac thing. This is about having an emial programs that does what i need it to do.</p>
<p>i want an all inbox as well. I want to be able to transfer emails from one account to the folder of another account.</p>
<p>All these things i could do in windows live mail a free email program. And if they could be done in windows live mail then they should be able to be done in outlook 2016. And i expect to be able to these basic things with a programs that i have to pay a
 yearly subscription for.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Well since you started this as a "discussion" and you're obviously comparing Outlook to other email clients (.......is made to do the basic functions of other email programs.......) then perhaps you can identify the Windows based email client you consider
 to be "ideal"<strong> and will be the one you are going to change to when you decide not to renew your subscription (</strong>am sure I'm not the only one who would be interested in that answer)&nbsp;Just to avoid confusion, by ideal I mean a Windows based client
 that actually "exists today" and is "publicly available" either for free or for purchase. So there's no mistake - personally have no intention in getting into any kind of debate on what may or may not be better - only asking the question for the benefit of
 others so they can evaluate your comments with some specificity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also just a FYI note - since this started with the .mov issue, I went back to review both the the number of "posts" along with the number of "views" for those posts as far back as 2012 related to .mov "previewer" - both of which were minimal "at best" so
 going to be curious as to exactly how many views this discussion gets based on the subject line outside of those created by &lt;Palcouk&gt; and myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly - for sake of accuracy, the subscription cost is for the entire Office Suite - not just Outlook.</p>

            <p>Wow! Whats up with the attitude Karl</p>
<p>You really need to relax, you are acting like you wrote the program for Outlook or something. Why are you taking my opinion so personally?</p>
<p>What - i am not allowed to have an opinion?</p>
<p>What - I am not allowed to say how disappointed i am in outlook 365/2016 ?</p>
<p>I bought my first windows pc in 1998. I have never posted any complaints about microsoft products in all those years. Until now. Until outlook 365/2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already stated windows live mail didnt have the limitations of outlook. This was a free program. But microsoft will no longer support it after the end of this month. I still use WLM for my emails now cause outlook it is not meeeting my needs. I was
 told by microsoft that outlook 365/2016 was upgrade from windows live mail. In my opionion it is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The syncing isues i experience in outlook 365/2016 make it impossible to access all my email accounts. The IMAP accounts sync some days and not other days. Since 2 days ago my gmail account, all of a sudden, will not sync at all anymore. &nbsp;it is tempermental
 and unreliable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes the subscription is for office suite. I have had many versions of office over the years which had outlook and which i didnt use then either, cause in my opinion windows live mail was better .and suited my needs. &nbsp;The version i was using prior to office
 365 - word excel etc was fine and still met my needs and didnt needed to be replaced. So i also begrudge have to subscribe for the whole office suite when all i needed - was told i needed - to upgrade to outlook 365/2016 for my emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a programmer but it seems logical to me if windos live mail was capable of functions then Outlook 365/2016 can also be capable of the same fuctions. They are both microsoft email programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The features of WLM like</p>
<p>An 'all inbox'&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability to move an email from one account to a folder of another account&nbsp;</p>
<p>No syncing issues with any of my email account types</p>
<p>No problems with mov video file attachments.</p>
<p>Being able to bounce and email back to the sender if you wanted too</p>
<p>Being able to block a domain</p>
<p>Theses are all convienent functions</p>
<p>These are functions I miss</p>
<p>
</p><p>I havent even had this program a month. Really didnt think i would have to be looking for an alternative email program. Guess i am going to have to trial a few alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you think Outlook 2016 doesnt need improvement and it meets all your needs then you are lucky. I am happy for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However you shouldnt have a go at me because it doesnt meet mine. I definitely think there is room for improvement and i guess its up to Microsoft whether they take the needs of their clients into consideration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess i have 11 months to see if they do.</p>

<p>
</p><p>No attitude - was a simple question based on your 'general" statement of "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">(.......is made to do the basic functions of other email programs.......)" leaving the impression that you had other email programs
 in mind for comparative purposes versus simply stating that there are features you don't like or find missing in Outlook. Opinions are great but when you start eluding that other programs are better, I (as a user/reader) would simply like to know what you're
 referring to so I (or any reader) can make my own comparative judgments about what you consider to be "basic email functions".&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
Anyhow - you answered the question - you don't have a specific program in mind so I'll help you with your choices that you can review and compare against at some point. I wouldn't hold my breath about seeing items like a unified &lt;Inbox&gt; or a .mov previewer
 getting included in OL'2016 any time soon. Am sure you'll find the following article of interest as a starting point for your search</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best email clients for Windows 2016<br />
<a href="http://cubiq.org/the-best-email-clients-for-windows-2016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cubiq.org/the-best-email-clients-for-windows-2016</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">May I also suggest that if you're interested in having a discussion about Outlook in general, you should start a new thread with an appropriate subject so it gets max eyeballs since if history is any
 indication, very, very few people are going to view this thread purely because of the subject line. You may consider this an extremely important feature but every past indication is that very few others do.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
Lastly, suggest that you don't conflate "issues" with "wishlist items". There's a world of difference between some kind of "sync issue/problem" versus wanting a single &lt;Inbox&gt; (which lots of people would agree with you) &nbsp;or a .mov previewer and that's ignoring
 things like "wanting to be able to move email from one folder to another within either the same account or to other accounts - unless of course you're referring to an Outlook.com account configured with Exchange ActiveSync)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short - any "problem" being encountered should have its own thread (i.e. sync issues, moving items etc)&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to change Onenote 2013 indent size</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;How can you change the indent distance (aka tab spacing) for bullet lists? I'd like to shorten the distance from the default, but I couldn't find an option to adjust it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example - From this:</p>
<p>* Level 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;o Level 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;x Level 3</p>
<p>
</p><p>To this:</p>
<p>* Level 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o Level 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;x Level 3</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help.</p>

<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> Follow
 these steps and check if that helps. </span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Internet Explorer.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span>Retry downloading the bank statement and see if the issue persists.
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>:
</span><span>I would suggest you to run Internet Explorer in No Add-on mode and try to download the bank statement and check if the issue persists. To run in Internet Explorer in no

<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, and then type Internet Explorer in the Start Search box.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Internet Explorer (No Add-On). Internet Explorer opens without add-ons, toolbars, or plug-ins.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Test Internet Explorer to verify that it works correctly.</span></p>

            Serial numbers (aka IMEI codes) usually have 16 numbers. It should also be listed on the label of the sales box.<br />
<br />
I suppose you have already contacted also your operator about this?

                    <p>The sat nav software disc asks me to install Active Sync, then computer says Active Sync is not compatible with my win 7 64-bit o/s and I must download the stupid Mobile Device Center, which is only geared up for phones - it wants me to&nbsp;specify connection
 options, with either deleting all info on device or transferring emails, photos etc from pc to device! Obviously this isn't going to work with a sat nav, so what do I do now? Sat Nav is old, granted, but surely&nbsp;I should be able to update maps?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stupid auto prompt thing from windows says Active Sync not compatible, go here to get the update that fixes it, but it doesn't, because it's all about phones.
</p>
<p>Have been round and roiund in circles with this and am getting to Kill Bill and Throw PC Out Of Window stage. Help, please!</p>

<p><span>Hello Cyberbabe153, </span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on the forums, based off what told us so far I can understand the frustration.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;I did do s</span> <span>ome</span> <span>research on this issue, and it appears that the GPS software that comes with the NavMan N40i is based off Windows Mobile CE 5.0, and also uses a prior version of Activesync that is compatible with Windows XP.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;As Prof Julie, had mentioned you may have to try updating the device using a computer with Windows XP. Especially if you are updating the device for the first time as it sounds like you are.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;I hope we have been helpful, keep in mind it could be possible one of the updates creates compatibility with Windows Device Center.</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            You are Running out of RAM that is memory the phone programs are using when Running.<br />
<br />
The user area "C-drive" has 48M memory left. There you can save user Data like pictures etc...<br />
<br />
So You may have lot of programs running and because of that memory runs out... Or certain application may run all the memory..<br />
<br />
Easiest way normally to overcome this is to reboot phone -&gt; All RAM is released then.

            Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
I have installed following programs on my E61.<br />
- Gmail Apps<br />
- Opera Mini 3<br />
- Reuters News apps<br />
- Adobe reader<br />
- Widsets<br />
- Aquacalendar<br />
<br />
But I always check for any programs running in the background by keeping the menu key pressed.<br />
<br />
I also did the reboot(switching off and on) as suggested by you. But the result is same.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Access table links in &#34;exclusive&#34; mode to table in another Access database</h2>
                    <p>I would like to have&nbsp;two Access databases (frontends)&nbsp;with tables that are links to another Access database (backend).&nbsp;The&nbsp;linking part is easy.&nbsp;However,&nbsp;for certain functions, I need to&nbsp;make sure that the link to&nbsp;the tables in the backend database is&nbsp;"exclusive".
 In other words, only one of the frontends&nbsp;has tables linked to the backend database. Once the function is finished, the&nbsp;linked tables can return to "shared".&nbsp;Is there a way to&nbsp;alter the table links programmatically (VBA)? The method "TransferDatabase" doesn't
 seem to have the option to set the link in exclusive mode. Is there some way of modifying the link to make it "exclusive"?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Maybe simpler solution would be to open a form on those table(s) and set the form's RecordLocks property to "All Records". A bit draconian, but if you really need this?</p>

                    I have a list of names, typed in upper case, first, middle and last name in separate columns. &nbsp;I want to merge these together in the 4th column and when I start to type in the second name, it automatically finishes. &nbsp; This is great but when I make a change
 to one of the names it affects the rest of the list. &nbsp;My question, how to I turn off the feature after all the names are first merged together. &nbsp;thank you&nbsp;

would you happen to have a solution for the following? My Yammer account is following people in my organisation and also following even my own account quite frequently, which is somewhat disturbing. It is doing this by itself - how can I stop this? Please help.<br />

Kind regards,<br />

    <title>Excel sometimes opens in multiple instances - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel sometimes opens in multiple instances</h2>
                    <p>I have noticed that recently (from about 6 months ago) Excel has started to occasionally open workbooks in separate instances of Excel. I cannot see any trend to when it does or doesn't, but when it does I can tell as I have another workbook that opens on
 every instance, and so that causes an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is also a problem as you can't do many cross-workbook functions, like, copying sheets, using a formula across workbooks,...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like this may have started happening when there was the update that (as well as other things) allowed you to view the same instance of Excel, but different workbooks on different screens. But this may be just coincidence or not quite the same time,
 but feel like it could be. Ignore if doesn't make sense, just maybe a steer&nbsp;in the right direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, this is not just me, the guy next to me also has this, and I think it would be everyone in my company. So maybe something relating to our computer set up, but wondering if anyone else has this as well, or knows a workaround.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures:
<br />
<br />Try working with the Word Safe mode and check if it helps.
<br />Hold the windows key + Letter ‘R’ on the keyboard to launch the Run command &gt; Copy and paste the following command line in the open box and click Ok.
<br />
<br />For Excel: Type excel /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Outlook: Type outlook /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Word: Type winword /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For PowerPoint: Type powerpnt /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Publisher: Type mspub /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />For Visio: Type visio /safe, and click OK.
<br />
<br />If, word works properly do you need to disable add-ins:
<br />Go into Word / Excel/ PW:
<br />Click on File menu.
<br />Click Options.
<br />Click Add-ins.
<br />Click on Go button besides Manage: Com-Add-in.
<br />Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox to disable them.
<br />Close the Word and restart it.
<br />
<br />In the link below explain how disable add-in:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-manage-and-install-add-ins-in-office-programs-16278816-1948-4028-91e5-76dca5380f8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-m...</a>
<br />
<br />If, the procedures above didn't work, I refer to repair Office in the following link for more information:
<br />
<br />Go to Control Panel &gt;&gt; Add and Remove Programs and highlight Microsoft Office. Click on Remove. A menu will pop up allowing you to choose repair or reinstall. Try a Repair Online and verified after repair it fix.

<br />
<br />Please let me know if this helped and works.
