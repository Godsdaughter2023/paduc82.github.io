<h2>            Unable to sync cash organizer with Intuit Quicken on Windows 7 x64</h2>
                    
<p>I have a successful partnership between my HTC TP2 and Windows 7 x64. I installed Intuit Qucken 2010 on the PC and Cash Organiser 2008 on my PDA. Each time i try to sync, i get the error 'Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {89108EE5-18DA-11DB-9617-00E08161165F}
 failed due to the following error: 80040154'. It syncs alright although i am unable to change the sync settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When i uninstall cash organiser sync from my phone, the error message goes away. I tried searching for the CLSID mentioned above in the registr but could not find it. Any help on this issue?</p>

<p>Greetings csackey!&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Phone forums!</p>
<p>This error sounds like it's being caused by the PDA application from Intuit, possibly a corruption of that original installation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since you already uninstalled the PDA applet, you may want to perform a soft-reset on both your PC and your PDA, then re-install
 the application to the PDA to see if that solves the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it doesn't, then you would be best to contact Intuit and request their assistance in resolving this problem...</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Does Windows 10 have an articulate, reasoned response to Sinofski&#39;s Start Screen argument from 2011&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We all know the user feedback and general response to the start screen, and we all know it is mostly negative (at least for traditional users).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, Steven Sinofski's arguments on Building Windows in support of the Start Screen were quite reasoned:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/10/11/reflecting-on-your-comments-on-the-start-screen.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>The argument effectively says that the start screen is better for *all* users, not just tablet users. It uses a number of facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eye-tracking for Windows 7 users should that their vision is restricted to the small area of the Start Menu when using it; they aren't looking anywhere else -- giving them more space is strictly better</li><li>Windows 7 users mostly rely on search to launch programs, in addition to search (which still works on Windows 8), Windows 8 users can rely on position, shape, co-location, and color to find apps in a very visual way</li><li>Fitt's law works better for Windows 8 given the size of the tiles and the fact that its a 2D grid</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the user feedback says otherwise. But these points show clear advantages to the start screen even for desktop users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Microsoft simply ditching these improvements based on feedback? Or will Microsoft be providing a no-compromises solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The current start menu seems like it mainly ditches these improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>The space is generally smaller (yes, you can make it bigger and taller), thus restricting the user to less space</li><li>Users relying on position, shape, co-location, and color feel rather lost (myself included) when navigating the smaller menu... because there is less room to put all that you need on there</li><li>Fitt's law doesn't work well at all since the tiles are far away from the mouse location when pressing start</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I could see forgoing the fitt's law advantage as an engineering trade-off. I am more uneasy about the first two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, Start Screen Tile Groups were very important for position and co-location. Even if a user makes their start screen bigger and adds more tiles.. it can quickly become overwhelming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Again, the question is: are there reasoned, logical, counter arguments to Sinofski? Or is Microsoft simply saying "I guess he is empirically wrong, so that's the end of the argument."?</p>

            <p>I think one of the main reasons why people don't like it, myself included, is that it feels wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mainly, it feels like the start screen interrupts my workflow by completely wiping the screen of what I was doing and showing me a huge long list of, what often looks like, ads and different sized apps in a huge mess! This makes navigating the start screen
 for a program I need kind of like looking through a messy closet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that a start menu is simply, more organized. The start menu, when you click the All Apps button, shows a list, in a single column, all the apps and programs on your pc. It's not as big as the start screen, which actually helps find things. Too much
 screen space can be bad too, as it confuses the eye and makes things harder to find sometimes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start Screen does work much better on touch devices though, because the screen space used is not too big because the tablets and phones and such, often have much, much, smaller screens. You need it to take up the whole screen just so you can see what you're
 doing, and easily hit things with your finger. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On small touch screens, you need bigger interface; on big desktop screens with mouse and keyboard, you need much smaller interfaces because of the precision of mouse.</p>

            <p>@SeanRamey, I agree that the start menu works better when looking at the All Apps area. I think the tilessection in the start menu is strictly worse that the options provided by the start screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My argument isn't "new start menu sucks, start screen is clearly superior", but rather that the current iterations of the tiles on the start menu is simply not good enough to introduce the advantages of the start screen (especially context and recall via
 co-location).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Live Tiles are cool.. but it seems like all the current iteration is doing is giving the ability to pin live tiles to a seemingly random place. What's the advantage of having them in the start menu, farther away from the mouse, than, say, the desktop, or
 special launcher, or whatever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to get more insights about what the thought process behind this is. Is the current scheme "final" as far as the basic design is concerned?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I understand this point but I think I find this reply generally dissatisfying for three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>While certain options are preferences are equivalent, the defaults are often "first class citizens". "Don't like aero? You can disable it." until one day, you can't. "You can turn that off and revert to the old implementation." Yes, except then you are
 just reverting one aspect of your experience to the previous OS version's, an experience that is probably unmaintained.</li><li>Along these lines, "fringe options" are often unmaintained. Start Screen will surely be maintained for touch devices, but still doesn't answer my concern about Start Screen being viable on desktop.</li><li>This can be used as a justification to introduce a universally inferior implementation of some feature with the argument that "users can turn it off if its worse for them".</li></ul>
<p>Why is the Start Menu the correct choice in this situation? Is the trade-offs I described above (co-location, etc.) worth it? Can some of the things given up by switching to the Start Menu really not be implemented without switching to the Start Screen completely?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this particular case, I'm not convinced that reverting to the Windows 8 experience is the right choice for a desktop user. The Windows 8 upgrader, though, is still losing some good parts about the start menu during the upgrade. Is this for good reason?
 Can we expect improvement going forward?</p>

            <p>I'm sorry, but I disagree.&nbsp; For one thing, it's a completely imagined thing that people believe they actually multitask. They don't, and I'm easily able to prove it.&nbsp; People SWITCH task.&nbsp; It's the speed with which people switch task--or perceived speed--that
 makes them thing they are multitasking.&nbsp; And the evidence that many people have lazy, cluttered minds and behaviors is shown by the desktops and task bars cluttered with everything they find cumbersome to search for via the traditional Start menu.&nbsp; I've seen
 it time and time again.&nbsp; Also, the more active windows a user insists on having on their desktop, the less efficient they become and messier their organization of information is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm convinced that the naysayers of Windows 8 were complaining more because it was a very different approach to starting programs.&nbsp; There certainly was nothing different about how things worked on the desktop once there.&nbsp; Those who insisted on everything
 being on the task bar could still plant them there.&nbsp; Windowed programs on the desktop still worked the same.&nbsp; The Start Screen allowed people to pin anything they wanted there without cluttering a desktop, and you can find anything you need much faster from
 the Start Screen than you ever could with the Start Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you perceived as a "long list of...ads and different sized apps in a huge mess" was precisely how influential techies couched it.&nbsp; That list, of course, was only as long and messy as people made the Start Screen to be.&nbsp; They could always choose to not
 use it at all.&nbsp; But that was apparently not good enough.&nbsp; I, in contrast, have been pushing for legacy programs to migrate to Metro apps, and that Microsoft would enrich the live tiles to be more interactive.&nbsp; The "different sized apps" that looked like "ads"
 would go from merely push tiles to something more interactive where it was appropriate.&nbsp; This, to me, would negate the need to actually open&nbsp; a given app.&nbsp; There was and is a lot more potential with Metro apps and live tiles than has been realized and, it's
 my opinion, we'll never see that development because people who are stuck on the desktop are destroying Windows.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I wanted to make a comment on this regarding the win7/10 start menu:</p>
<p>
</p><p>while you can't rely on position, shape, co-location, and color for searching things you CAN rely on alphabetical order, which never fails and ( to me ) it seems comfortable.
</p>
<p>And one thing i didn't like in the windows 8 start menu was that while you say "shape", to me it seemed everything was the same, everything was square and i had to scroll looking at the "little" icons in there.</p>

            <p>This is a very insightful point, especially with regards to "alphabetical order" and co-location. That said, I do think the argument fails in some cases:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The "recognition vs. recall" problem in UI is very important to internalize here. The thing about co-location being useful has to do with passively recognizing the position/neighborhood of something based on a number of queues. In the alphabetic system,
 you need to actively recall the name of the app, its position in the alphabet, etc. to find the "co-location" useful.
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, you could argue that even without recall, you simply see it enough times in the vicinity of other adjacent items that you can recognize its place by identifying them. If this is the argument (which, I think, is a weaker argument, then read
 on the next point):</li></ul>
</li><li>A more general issue with this view on co-location is that it is a fixed, global ordering. Allowing users to define co-location and group things logically enables them to find much easier cues to recognize where things are located.</li></ul>
<p>There are a few other general points:</p>
<ul>
<li>I already conceded that the Win 7/10 "All Programs" view is a perfectly viable replacement of the Windows 8 "All Programs" view. Search is also equivalent in both. The question is about the additional value provided from pinned items. Thus it is really
 a comparison between Windows 10's live tile functionality and Windows 8's.</li><li>Windows 8 provides two important "hierarchical" methods of organization that are useful in launching applications:
<ol>
<li>there's the hierarchy of "pinned" vs "all programs", and</li><li>the hierarchy of tile groups.</li></ol>
</li><li>Windows 10 on desktop arguably still supports "1". My argument is that from my experience, apps that I view as worthy of pinning in the hierarchy are numerous enough that they require more space.</li><li>Windows 10 on desktop does not currently support "2". I think this is a real serious issue.</li></ul>
<p>In general, Ramiro, I agree with you that the Windows 7 search and navigation model is comfortable when you have the specific intent of launching a specific app. Up until Windows 7, that made up ~100% of my app launching. Since Windows 8, I found myself
 also going to Start not knowing what I want to launch, but slowly discovering. This is something that was unwieldy before. Going through All Programs is a nightmare, but browsing through the start screen is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>----</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding shape. You are right that the tiles are all square, however, their icons are much larger than icons on the traditional desktop and start menu. Icons in tiles are useful and provide an important cue.</p>

<p>I'll reply to this one first: I'll start out by saying that I recommend more care with the word "facts" above. It turns out that none of the assertions above satisfy the definition of a fact. To wit:</p>
<ul>
<li>I fail to see the&nbsp;continuous logical chain of conclusions that would take us from the beginning to the end of the assertion in the first bullet point. It does not follow that "giving [Windows users] more space is strictly better", for a host of reasons,
 starting with the observation that it has not been shown that these users would make effective use, and would in fact benefit from the additional space. In addition, the space taken up by the program launcher is associated with a cost, most glaringly in the
 case of the infamous Start Screen which completely breaks the work context of a user engaged in a project.</li><li>I will point out that the statistics underlying the assertion in the second bullet point is subject to severe criticism. It completely ignores the sample bias: There's a significant group of users that have opted out of the feedback program that provides
 these statistics, and the group that has opted out is not randomly distributed with respect to the observation in question. In short, the assertion has no basis in fact. Point in case: I never use, and have never used the Search functionality to find a program
 I want to launch. I have a hierarchical Start Menu that allows me quick and intuitive access to the applications I may need at any given point.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Windows 8 provides two important "hierarchical" methods of organization that are useful in launching applications:
</p>
<ol>
<li>there's the hierarchy of "pinned" vs "all programs", and</li><li>the hierarchy of tile groups.</li></ol>
</blockquote>
<p>No, it does not, and I appreciate that you put "hierarchical" in quotation marks above. It is in fact one of the most glaring shortcomings of the Windows 8 program launcher that it does
<strong><em>not</em></strong> provide a true hierarchical structure. The consequences of this design decision (which, as an aside, I still find unfathomable in the extreme) are that the Start Screen is fundamentally inferior to the "All Programs" hierarchy
 that is available in the Start Menu. Granted, it does take some active effort by the user to fully take advantage of this hierarchy, but once you do, the Start Menu becomes immensely more powerful than the Start Screen could ever be. As an analog, there is
 a reason why all serious file systems for general-purpose computing expose a hierarchical structure to the user, and are not flat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, it should be pointed out that the relevance of the above features do depend on the use-case scenario: If you have simple use cases where a user only interacts with a very small number of applications on a regular basis, a Start Screen may be adequate
 despite its fundamental limitations. If, on the other hand, you have a user who needs to handle greater complexity, using a potentially large number of applications, then the Start Screen becomes borderline unsuable. Hence the near-universal rejection of Windows
 8.x in the professional/enterprise users' community. I'll just point out that a virgin Windows 7 install contains roughly 300 links in its Start Menu hierarchy, and once a user has installed applications, the number of links may triple. There is no rational
 nor effective way to handle this using the quasi-hierarchy that the Start Screen offers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;And the evidence that many people have lazy, cluttered minds and behaviors is shown by the desktops and task bars cluttered with everything they find cumbersome to search for via the traditional Start menu.&nbsp; I've seen it time and time again.&nbsp; Also, the
 more active windows a user insists on having on their desktop, the less efficient they become and messier their organization of information is.</p>

</p><p>I'll just note that the personal psychopathology you reveal with the above remarks is of no interest to this discussion. The fact that you seem to have an elemental fear of complexity ("clutter", and "mess") has no bearing on anything of general interest.</p>

<p>I'll just say that the fact that you are, apparently, capable of imagining to work within the narrow and clearly incomplete confines of the so-called "Metro environment" flat-out disqualifies you from any mature debate on the future direction of Windows.
 Those of us who have to handle work flow patterns that are presumably a bit more complex than yours really have no time nor patience for the kind of nonsense that ends with calls to "abandon the desktop". I'll leave it at that.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t RECEIVE email from an IMAP account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tooolnut  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t RECEIVE email from an IMAP account</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I switched a Comcast mail server account in Outlook from POP3 to IMAP, a few days ago, I cannot receive mail on that server, though I can send mail through Outlook and the Comcast server, without a problem, whether to my Comcast or any other email
 account. I was successful in setting up the same account on my Windows Phone (though it did not require port numbers info): it both receives and sends just fine.&nbsp;I followed all the advanced directions that Comcast has provided on their website, (quote)</p>
<p>
</p><div style="margin-left: 30px">To configure an email client to use Comcast email (@comcast.net), the following settings should be used for sending and receiving email:
<ul>
<li>Incoming Mail Server Name: <strong>imap.comcast.net</strong></li><li>Incoming Mail Server Port Number:
<ul>
<li>Recommended: <strong>993 with SSL ON</strong></li><li>Only if Needed: <strong>143 with SSL ON</strong></li></ul>
</li><li>Outgoing Mail Server Name: <strong>smtp.comcast.net</strong></li><li>Outgoing Mail Server Port Number:
<ul>
<li>Recommended: <strong>587 (SMTP)</strong></li><li>Only if Needed: <strong>465&nbsp;(SMTPS)</strong></li></ul>
</li><li>SSL Encryption: <strong>checked</strong></li><li>Authentication:<strong> XFINITY username and Password required</strong></li></ul>
</div>
<p>(end quote), including every possible combination of the Recommended and "Only if Needed" port numbers, to no avail. Comcast feels no obligation to serve its customers resolve such issues, saying that all they're obligated to ensure works is their&nbsp;Webmail,
 not 3rd-party email&nbsp;programs,&nbsp;and has therefore directed me to Microsoft to resolve this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm getting during Send and Receive is&nbsp;an endless "Synchronizing subscribed folders for Comcast" message, which never completes processing. When I click Cancel All, the error message reads
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Task 'Synchronizing subscribed folders for Comcast.' reported error (0x80048002) : 'This task was cancelled before it was completed.'</p>
<p>In other words, it gives us no info on what the problem was that kept it hanging without timing out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to Account Settings/Change Account to test account settings, this is the error message I get:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Send test e-mail message: Your server does not support the connection encryption type you have specified. Try changing the encryption method. Contact your mail server administrator or Internet service provider (ISP) for additional
 assistance.</p>
<p>The encryption method chosen is as recommended: SSL. The test message, however, does arrive and appears both on my Windows Phone and Comcast's Webmail, but not in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used the many versions of Outlook for well over a decade now in POP3 and Microsoft Exchange modes without a hitch: I have three other Exchange accounts that work; this is my first and only IMAP account on Outlook. What is going on with IMAP?</p>
                </div>

<p>The problem is now fixed. I don't know exactly which one of these&nbsp;fixed it, but here they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>I didn't know that I&nbsp;had inadvertently uploaded thousands of emails onto the Comcast server, in the process of haphazardly copying, cutting,&nbsp;and pasting emails from my old POP account to my new IMAP one, because I was told that these would be lost, once
 I deleted my POP account. What changes you make to one device's&nbsp;IMAP account get reflected in all others accessing the same server in the same way: I had no idea that was the case when I deleted and purged the whole bunch in Webmail, thinking it would help
 Outlook get "synchronized" quicker, something it said it was trying to do, but it didn't work that way.</li><li>Changing the encryption of SMTP to TLS.</li><li>Restarting Outlook.</li></ol>
<p>Again, not knowing better, I deleted and purged these thousands of emails in Webmail, before I realized that the copies of these in Outlook would also go away, once synchronization occurred upon restarting it: Outlook, the IMAP client, only downloads what
 is on the server, <em>temporarily </em>buffering that content on the PC. Fortunately, after calling Comcast&nbsp;for technical assistance with recovering these emails, I learned that you can do so by right-clicking the Trash folder, in Webmail, and in the pop-up
 menu, selecting "Recover deleted items." It was a long process, but these emails were all recovered. Now, I have created separate folders to store and organize these emails in, outside of the file I named "Comcast", which contains the folders of the Comcast
 server, same ones named "Inbox," "Draft," "Trash," ... in Webmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In&nbsp;this one aspect, IMAP works like Microsoft Exchange and One Drive: all the storage is in one place and accessed and modified by multiple devices from multiple locations; no explicit synchronization is necessary.</p>

<h2>            Undo Archiving for 2 Accidentally Merged Accounts</h2>
                    <p>I have two accounts in one Profile:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Work </p>
<p>2. Hotmail. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I somehow managed to archive them both into the same location: Documents - Outlook Files - Archives2.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>(I have another older profile that uses AppData - Local - Microsoft - Outlook - Archive. Not sure if this is relevant to the problem, but I figured I'd throw it out there just in case. Neither Work or Hotmail are part of this older Profile, just FYI.)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So now my old Hotmail items appear in my Work Archives folders. Is there any handy tool that can just make them retreat back to their respective origins?&nbsp;</p>

            What I'd do would be to add the "E-mail Account" field to the header row so that I could see which account received the messages.&nbsp; I'd then sort or group by that column, which would collect all of the messages received via Hotmail in the same place.&nbsp; They'll
 be easy to select all at once in that case and move back to the Hotmail Inbox.

<p>Hi William,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better understand the detailed situation and help you, could you provide the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Your OS version and Office version.(PowerPoint&gt;About PowerPoint)</span></li><li><span>Regarding "not play", do you mean the p</span><span>rogress bar</span><span> moves
 but without sound</span><span> </span><span>or there is no response after you click the play button?</span></li><li><span>Please confirm whether this behavior occurs with specific presentation/audio. You may create a new presentation and insert a new audio to test.</span></li><li><span>Please confirm the sound in your Mac is unmuted.</span></li><li><span>Considering you mentioned it works with earlier version, could you provide the workable version?</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Zixuan</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;My current iMacOS is 10.12.6 and my PowerPoint version is 16.10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The Imbedded audio in the videos contained in the presentation produces no sound. The progress bar moves through the presentation and the videos play. &nbsp;When the presentation ran on my iMac (same OS) with PowerPoint for Mac 2011 it ran fine w sound. It
 also runs fine on a windows machine (dont have specs on it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. I can record and/or insert a sound track into a new PowerPoint slide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Sound is not muted&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. I no longer have the earlier version of PowerPoint for Mac 2011. The actual PowerPoint presentation has not changed. Its on a usb thumb drive that i can use on the windows machine or my iMac. It works fine on windows and use to work fine on PPMac2011.
 Doesnt work on current PP365-16.10</p>

<p>Hi William,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your updating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my test with 16.10 in 10.12.6, the video with sound can be played normally, thus we might need more information to narrow down the issue you encountered.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to explain that as you didn't mentioned video in your question, I misunderstood you inserted an audio rather than a video with sound. Inserting an audio is different from a video. Thus,
 regarding your third reply, do you refer to an audio or an video with sound? If you refer to an audio, could you create a new presentation, insert a new video to test whether the issue only occurs with specific presentation/video type?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists with new presentation inserted with a new video, could you
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">use safe mode to isolate issues with your Mac</a> to see the outcome?</p>

<p>I downloaded an organizational presentation created in PowerPoint (don't know version) to a windows (don't know version but not Windows 10) laptop. Runs fine on the Windows laptop. I copied the file to a USB Thumb Drive and loaded it on my iMac. The presentation
 opens fine. I can click from slide to slide, but when I get to the slide that contains a video and click on "play" the video plays without sound. The iMac is not muted. I can create a video with sound on my iMac and it works fine with sound. I can imbed a
 video into a presentation on my iMac and all works well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can share the presentation if that would help.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Bill</p>

<p>Hi William</p>
<p>
</p><p>PowerPoint on Mac uses QuickTime to play videos. What you described suggests the video was encoded using a codec that is not supported by QuickTime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can test this hypothesis. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right click the presentation file and choose Duplicate (just in case we mess up)</p>
<p>2. In Finder, change the file extension from .pptx to .zip</p>
<p>3. Use Stuffit Expander to open the zip file</p>
<p>4. Navigate to the Media folder to locate the movie file</p>
<p>5. Copy the movie file to your desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open QuickTime player and see if the movie plays with sound. My expectation is that the movie will play the same as in PowerPoint - video but no sound.</p>

            Unfortunately this didn't work. I installed flip4mac and learned that my OS is not supported. "Switch" was recommended for my OS. I installed Switch and had no success. So far ... no success. Thank you for your help.

            When you say, "This didn't work" does that mean you weren't able to extract the video file, or does it mean you were able to extract the video file but when played in QuickTime the audio didn't play, or does it mean something else?

            <p>I had this problem recently and thought it was the flash player that was causing it. Cause disabling flash player seemed to solve the freezing issue. But then
<a href="http://forums.techguy.org/windows-7/1057134-solved-problem-windows-upate-ie9.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
it turned out to be</a> flash player wasn't the culprit, rather it was <strong>DFX Audio Enhancer</strong>. DFX's current version (10.137) is incompatible with the latest update of IE9 (KB2699988) and causes frequent freezing of the browser. So, if you have
 DFX installed on your system try uninstalling it and uncheck IE during installation. It might solve your problem.</p>

<h2>            Trouble syncing notes in caledar and contacts from computer to Treo 750.</h2>
                    
<p>I am hoping someone can help me troubleshoot this problem.</p>
<p>I am having trouble syncing the notes in my calendar and contacts to my Treo 750.</p>
<p>I am running Vista Basic; Office 2007; Windows Mobile Device Center 6; Treo 750-2.25-ATT; Windows Mobile 6 Professional.</p>
<p>About 3 weeks ago WMDC quit working.&nbsp; I reinstalled the driver 6.1 and that seemed to solve the problem until this week when I could not sync at all.&nbsp; It worked on Tuesday and on Thursday it wouldn't.&nbsp; After reading forums I removed 6.1 and installed WMDC
 6.&nbsp; That seemed to work.&nbsp; I could sync all my content.&nbsp; Until I notice Friday that the notes in my calendar and in my contacts would not sync.</p>
<p>I can type notes into the contacts on my phone and it will go to the computer.&nbsp; I can create new contacts in Outlook and it will sync to the phone, but the notes will not go from the computer to the phone.</p>
<p>I have tried everything I can think of and many of the solutions on the forum.&nbsp; Nothing seems to work.&nbsp; I can sync Calendar, Contacts, Tasks, Notes, Email, Files, Pictures, but not the notes attached to the Calendar and Contacts.</p>
<p>Can anyone help?</p>

typing regsvr32.exe ole32dll in the command prompt resulted in an error code: 0x80070005.<br />

    <title>How do I edit old documents&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I edit old documents&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have some documents from the late 1990s that I need to be able to edit. I think they are possibly in a version of Word from that period, possibly Word 7.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest versions of Word do not support the formats from versions that far back and I am struggling to be find a way to convert the documents to the latest version of Word for updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I confirm that these are Word format documents, they appear to be a collection of files (.STY&nbsp; .$GR&nbsp; .CHP .FRM&nbsp; .VGR etc.) and can anyone advise how best to upgrade them to a more current version of Word?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks.</p>

<p>Try FileMerlin which can identify and convert most document formats, but these files seem to be component parts of a document made up from multiple components.</p>

            <p>Back in the day a number of applications used DOC including WordPerfect and DisplayWrite. DOS wordprocessors didn't generally care what extensions were used.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a recent Word version ensure that the File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; File Block Settings allow old Word formats to be opened. By default, Word 95 and earler are likely to be blocked.</p>

                    <p>My form has a command called "Move". </p>
<p>It runs in the old formby requiring the user to enter a line number to move what and another to move to the new place.</p>
<p>I want to be able to click on a cell ie use the mouse to choose what and where to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have put in a command called "select" which will enable what is to be moved to be selected. I read the required info into refedit1.
</p>
<p>If I step through the code it will work and allow refedit2 to be selected, but if I "run" the code it does not pause to allow the selection of refedit2. This will just be assigned where the cursor is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>**! This is my problem. I do not know how to pause code to allow the user to click on (select) a cell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The method I get the first selection is clunky and not much improvement on entering the line number. This needs to be a pause to get the cell in the same manner as for refedit2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would love some nice person to solve this for me!</p>

            Yeah I have followed those steps and it does not work. &nbsp;I have set this up on other computers, however on this one after I fill out a new message and subject. &nbsp;I hit save as and the option and under file type, outlook template is not an option. &nbsp;It gives
 me several word types but no outlook option. &nbsp;Do I need an upgrade in software?

            <p>There is no technical issue in this case and Outlook works as it should. It all depends on how much vertical screen space is available. When there are more appointments than there is place to show them, you'll get the arrow to indicate that there are more
 appointments for that day. Click on it to see them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that some months show 4 and others show 6 is caused by how many weeks that month spans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can't increase your vertical screen real estate (enlarge window, minimize Ribbon, higher resolution monitor, etc...) and regularly have more than 4 appointments on a day, consider using the Week view instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that you can select multiple weeks in the week view by holding CTRL and clicking in front of the week (or on the week numbers
<a href="http://www.msoutlook.info/question/149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">if you have&nbsp;that enabled</a>). This basically takes you into a month view but you can decide how many weeks are visible.</p>

<h2>            Changing Skype Presence for Another User</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are currently using Office 365/Skype and have a need for our receptionist to occasionally update the Skype presence of other users in the company.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, sometimes meetings run very long and a person's calendar doesn't reflect this, or people are frequently called off-site and forget to update their personal message, explaining they will be out the rest of the day, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an ability or even a product that will allow us to assign some type of delegate access to the receptionist so that she can make these types of changes on their behalf?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p><span>Hi KBolger,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please be noted that the Skype for Business user's status (besides the user's manual action/change) is binded with the calendar event. Let me explain more: If the user has a meeting from 10:00 am to
 11:00 am, during that period his status should be busy (if he has entered into the meeting at that time). So, the possible solution should be the delegate manage the representative's calendar event but no a solution for accessing the Skype for Business client
 (interface) to change the status.&nbsp;</span></p>

            So, it means that your headers and footers are not lost. So, that worry is over.
<br />
<br />Are you in Print Layout view?
<br />
<br />Go to File &gt; Options &gt; Display &gt; Check Show white space...if it is already checked, uncheck it, close Word, Open Word and Check it again<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b7f1919-28d6-402f-a8b7-61a96a99d9dc?upload=true" />

                    <p>I have recently begun to use Office 365 in our offices with Office 2013 installed. &nbsp;I have successfully transferred my documents to the OneDrive folder on my desktop. &nbsp;Unfortunately, when I click on a document, spreadsheet, or anything that has to open with
 a Microsoft Office product, I get the "To activate Office, enter the address that's associated with your Office subscription" and after selecting "enter a product key instead", I get an error message. &nbsp;"We're sorry, but Word has run into an error that is preventing
 it from working correctly. Word will need to be closed as a result. Would you like us to repair now?". &nbsp;I click repair now and nothing happens but Windows closes.</p>

            <p>Hi Ray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to amend what I previously wrote because I was going on memory about what Office 2016 included or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just checked again and when this new feature was added I cannot say but now in version 15.14.0 the "Recent" files listing are all files opened during the last 30 days and there is also a "Pin" feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With these two additions, I can't imagine what more would be needed. :-)</p>

    <title>PSExec deployment of SCEP definition updates fails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doug_4160  say:</h3>
<h2>            PSExec deployment of SCEP definition updates fails</h2>
                    <p>Up until sometime last week deployment of SCEP definition updates via PSExec worked for us.&nbsp; With today's definition update(s) 1.239.701.0 and 1.239.713.0&nbsp;deployment now fails with exit code -2147023257.&nbsp; Nothing helpful in the System, Security, or Application
 logs.&nbsp; Our current deployment method has been [for months] a cmd script containing the following, and none of this has changed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>c:\tools\pstools\PsExec64.exe @c:\tools\PSTools\clients.txt -u Domain\username cmd.exe /c "\\Servername.FQ.DN\e$\definitions\mpam-fex64.exe -q"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run either of today's definitions, if fails with the exit code above. When I deploy an older definition file, it completes successfully with exit code 0.&nbsp; When I manually run today's definition file locally on a machine, it succeeds.&nbsp; "Assumption"
 leads me to believe that something has changed recently with the newer definition files, that causes&nbsp;the newer files&nbsp;to fail with our deployment&nbsp;method,&nbsp;while the older ones still succeed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any guidance to get this working again under our existing deployment method?</p>
<p>-Doug</p>

<p>If you long press on the video that you have downloaded using UC Browser you will get a pop-up menu appear and the option to export to music + videos hub. As long as the video file format is compatible with Windows Phone it should now appear in the music
 + videos hub.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will need to ask Opera why they haven't made a version of their popular mobile and mini browsers for Windows Phone. Nobody on the Nokia support site can answer that question.</p>
