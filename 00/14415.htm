            Hi, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/0a5390c8-f57c-4c12-9cfa-b38df9d2e050" title="KINGKILLERRay">
KINGKILLERRay.</a> You can download messenger app&nbsp;from the Store. If you can't download the app because of the Family Setup, you may try checking on your Microsoft account details. One main reason why you were prompted to setup My Family because your Microsoft
 account age is less that 18 years old. In some countries you need to be 18 years old to consider as an adult. Please log in with your Microsoft account&nbsp;at this link on your phone's web browser:
<a href="https://account.live.com/editprof.aspx?amru=https://account.microsoft.com/profile&amp;mkt=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.live.com/editprof.aspx?amru=https://account.microsoft.com/profile&amp;mkt=en-US</a>, change&nbsp;the birth year to at least 1997 to make it 18 years old, fill out all information needed and save. On your phone, go to Settings&gt;email+account&gt;tap and hold
 on your Microsoft account and sync. After the sync, you may now try downloading app. If you are prompted with the same message, please try downloading after 24 hours. If still get the same message, please backup all personal data to avoid data loss and reset
 the phone. Looking forward for the result, so we can further assist you.

<div>In a different worksheet I need a formula that will sum the values in column D provided a certain project and department are listed in columns A and C.</div>

<div>What formula could I put in cell B3 which will sum the values in column D in the first worksheet provided it says Proj 1 in column A and Engineering in column C? Again I cannot use a pivot table.</div>

<div>Any help would be appreciated. I'm using 2007 but would presume a formula like this should work&nbsp;across&nbsp;all versions.</div>

<p>There are several ways, here's one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT((Sheet1!A2:A20=A2)*(Sheet1!C2:C20=A3)*(Sheet1!D2:D20))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where A2 contains the project you're looking for in Col A and A3 contains engineering</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and another using SUMIFS</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=SUMIFS(Sheet1!D2:D20,Sheet1!A2:A20,A2,Sheet1!C2:C20,A3)</p>

<h2>            Cannot receive email from chicagovps.net despite having received them previously</h2>
                    <p>I have been receiving emails from chicagovps.net up until October of 2014. &nbsp;Now I am not receiving any email from them despite them sending me many messages. &nbsp;This is a hotmail.com email account that I have had for over 10 years now.</p>
<ul>
<li>The entire domain is on my safe senders list</li><li>They are nowhere on my blocked senders list</li><li>There is no filtering or forwarding rule that would touch these messages</li><li>The messages do not show up in my junk or trash folders</li></ul>
<p>Please help me figure out why these messages are not coming in. &nbsp;Could it be a space issue? &nbsp;I see no way to check allowed space usage. &nbsp;At one point I had a problem with GoDaddy email filtering just dropping "spam" messages without notifying me and prior
 to my own filters. &nbsp;Could this be the case here?</p>

            <p>I just had them send me a few more emails including a test email from an individual email account @chicagovps.net. &nbsp;They said there is no error or bounce-back email on their end. &nbsp;But they are still not making it into my inbox or even junk folder. &nbsp;I have
 no control over the chicagovps.net domain. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just changed me email address with chicagovps to my gmail address and all the emails are coming through fine. &nbsp;Looks like it may be time to officially drop my hotmail account of 10 years. &nbsp;I tried to overlook the other shortcomings, but I find this to
 be unacceptable for messages to disappear with no error or warning. &nbsp;Especially after I had been receiving them fine up through October. &nbsp;Nothing has changed on the sender's side.</p>

            <p>Follow up on this one as this is quite similar case...<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I do not receive e-mails from one of the domains (@propertymanagementteam.co.uk) despite receiving them in the past until middle of September 2014 or whereabouts. My fianc√©e who is CC'd on them receives them at all times (different e-mail server).<br />
</p>
<br />
<p>This problem has been raised to the organisation's IT department, with the following response:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">in his Live account, he's blocked your emails! He must have clicked in the wrong place, but either he's blocked your address, or otherwise marked us as spam.<br />
<br />
We can't fix this. Again, we've got green records for our message sending out, and they're being received by his servers at both addresses, but his live one has marked us as spam.<br />
<br />
He'll need to fix this one himself.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously this is not the case, moreover,I did add individual addresses as well as the whole domain to the white list - but to no avail. Also, organisation does not receive any deliver failure notification/.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea how this can be resolved?</p>

            <p>I have been through similar issues with GoDaddy and 1&amp;1. &nbsp;It wound up being that the emails were being flagged as spam by a "system level" filter which deleted them before they even hit my personal inbox. &nbsp;I don't know why something would have been updated
 in the September/October 2014 timeframe in order to cause this, much less what would be considered spam or dangerous in the emails I receive from chicagovps.net. &nbsp;My guess would be something similar is happening here and we, as free account users, just don't
 have access to the people in charge of these system wide email filters. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a software architect using the Microsoft development technologies every day. &nbsp;I am done with Microsoft and trying to rid myself of them wherever possible. &nbsp;These kinds of issues pop up all over the place with Microsoft and I am tired of it.</p>

            <p>I guess your thesis about 'system level' barrier is a valid one - we use commercial @outlook.com at work and I am having odd e-mails from reputable companies flagged as SPAM before I can read them - but the difference is I am notified about them and I am
 able to either release them or flag as no-SPAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would therefore appear that we have the same mechanism here, but with no possibility to see/highlight/flag such e-mails correctly. Hence my attempt to raise it here in the open...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is anybody from M$ going to do anything about it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I note your point about the free mail users but rest assured that old adage 'the grass is always greener' is still alive: I am paying for another e-mail service and this is even worse (I equally do not receive quite a lot e-mails, I do receive copious amount
 of SPAM instead), which has triggered my move to @outlook.com in the first place...<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having the same problem with Godaddy and Microsoft mail servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After further investigation kindly assisted by a technician at the Spamhaus Project, which both Godaddy and Microsoft use to filter spam, some light appears to have been shed into the issue and it appears that the problem is not on the end-user
 side ‚Äì as many Godaddy's support staff believe ‚Äì but on Godaddy‚Äôs server side.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As it seems, Godaddy‚Äôs Support staff are being ‚Äì erroneously ‚Äì instructed and relaying the information to users that Microsoft‚Äôs block to e-mails sent from Godaddy‚Äôs hosting servers is due to some customers on shared hosting servers
 practicing spam and affecting everyone on the same server. However, after speaking once again with Godaddy‚Äôs Support they confirmed what Spamhaus hinted at, when I contacted them directly. Whenever they run an IP search on the Spamhaus lists, Godaddy‚Äôs servers
 don‚Äôt come up. If the problem were some customers spamming, then the server should appear on the lists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This was Spamhaus's response:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>‚ÄúIf so, we'd not only hear instantly from GoDaddy (and all their customers) but GoDaddy themselves would be able to immediately remove all GoDaddy IP ranges from the PBL themselves via their PBL account.‚Äù</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What is happening instead is a completely different matter. Most e-mails sent from Godaddy‚Äôs maillservers are not being identified with Godaddy‚Äôs mailserver IP as the Source IP ‚Äì as they should ‚Äì but instead with end-users IP addresses
 as a Source IP, that usually belong to broadband internet providers. As Spamhaus also explained:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>‚ÄúIt's normal for [a broadband providers'] IP to be on the PBL (all end-user/home broadband IPs in the world are on the PBL).‚Äù</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Godaddy mailserver‚Äôs behavior is erratic. I ran several tests sending emails using Godaddy‚Äôs webmail ‚Äì therefore isolating any chance that the problem could be my e-mail program configuration (which is what Spamhaus initially presumes
 to be the cause ‚Äì to both my personal Outlook and my domain address and confirmed this myself:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong><span>The vast majority failed to arrive at @outlook.com</span></strong><span>&nbsp;but all arrived at my own domain's inbox and were either identified with a Source IP corresponding to my home IP or an unknown IP
 (127.0.0.1)</span></li><li><strong><span>The very small minority that arrived</span></strong><span><strong>&nbsp;at my Outlook.com inbox</strong>&nbsp;was correctly identified with a Source IP corresponding to Goddady's mail server, which is what
 should happen all the time</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>It would be great if other people could test the following steps themselves and replicate my experience:<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open a Microsoft blocked message that you Cc to another address of yours that is able to receive e-mails sent using from your Godaddy hosted e-mails</span></li><li><span>Click on the File tab and then Properties</span></li><li><span>Copy the e-mail headers</span></li><li><span>Go to&nbsp;</span><a href="http://whatismyipaddress.com/trace-email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://whatismyipaddress.com/trace-email</a>&nbsp;paste the headers and trace the e-mail's Source IP</li><li><span>Now just go to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://whatismyipaddress.com</a>&nbsp;and identify your home IP</li></ol>
<p>If you repeat the above steps with a few different blocked e-mails, you will likely find that 9 ou 10 times the e-mail's source IP is the same as your home IP. And, even if you find that an e-mail using Godaddy mailservers' IP gets blocked, this
 is probably due to Microsoft servers being able to identify that the original Source IP is your home IP or not associating your domain to their mailservers' IP. This is Godaddy's mess - true - but Microsoft is getting profit from it. Unsuprisingly,&nbsp;<a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2014/01/13/microsoft-and-godaddy-announce-strategic-partnership-to-help-small-businesses/#sm.001oktq47dp8eh110kq26y0eqbo4y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">they
 are strategic partners.</a></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If you wish, you can also go to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spamhaus.org/lookup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.spamhaus.org/lookup</a>&nbsp;and confirm that your home IP is on the PBL.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Since all broadband user's IPs are on Spamhaus PBL and because Microsoft and Godaddy both use this list to filter Spam, your Godaddy hosted domain e-mails are not likely to arrive at Outlook or any other Microsoft accounts.</p>
<p>I'm not an expert in IT, but this definitely looks like a straightforward mailserver configuration. E-mails sent from Godaddy hosting servers should NOT relay our home IP as a Source IP but their mailserver's IP instead, just as it happens when
 you send an email using a free service like Outlook.com or Gmail.com. Godaddy's worspace e-mail is not much better either, since it does the same. Even though it has a higher chance of arriving at Microsoft's accounts, it is still flagged - even by Gmail -
 as not able to confirm if it was sent by the from domain address or by a Spam creator. This also puts senders at a higher risk of seeing our home computers hacked, since e-mails are revealing your home IP address and also looks like a blatant breach of their
 privacy policy, since they are sending out private information without our knowledge and consent.<br />
<br />
I have relayed all this information to both Godaddy‚Äôs Support Staff (in Brazil) and to their HQ, in the hope that some solution may be found, other than asking their customers to purchase additional Microsoft‚Äôs services to work around their own server‚Äôs erratic
 behavior. HQ just ignores my e-mails and the Support Team simply gives a standard reply that they are working to solve this issue with no date to see it resolved. Really? This problem has been happening for years now.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I regret to say that I doubt both Godaddy and Microsoft are really interested in seeing this issue resolved once and for all, since the solution is simply how Outlook.com and Gmail.com mail servers behave - pretty standard - and in the meantime
 Godaddy's Support is trying to sell affected hosting customers Microsoft's 365 e-mail services as a workaround solution, while stating that CPanel e-mail accounts are unfit for professional use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be funny, if it wasn't causing damage to small businesses and regular customers alike.</p>

<p>Hi, a few years ago Microsoft Office Small Business Edition2003 was preloaded on my dell computer (60 day trial). I purchased it using the link that was provided in the dialogue box.&nbsp; i received the key as soon as my purchase was continue which i activated
 the product with and the CD came about 10 days after. My question is that the CD says upgrade(i know its been a long time) and i am trying to install the program on my Windows 7 laptop however it keeps asking me to provide the file location for the previous
 version of office since its an upgrade. Why did i receive an upgrade CD? after all there were no previous versions on the dell. And is there anything i can do to install this on windows 7 if anything is posssible?</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

<p>If it is indeed an Upgrade as opposed to a Full version, you do need the previous version.</p>
<p>It is unusual to have had a preinstalled trial of Small Business, it is normally Home and Student or whatever the name was back then. Trials do NOT qualify for upgrade versions. Works is a qualifier now but I don't know if it was back then.</p>

<br />
To use mail merge as it is "out-of-the-box", you will need a separate record for each of the email addresses to which you want to send the emails.

            My merge with attachments add-in and my many to one e-mail add-in used with the One to One option will both do this. The e-mail addresses must be separated by a semi-colon and the data source must be an Excel file, with the data on Sheet 1 (with a header
 row starting at cell A1)<br />

<p>I had the exact same problem: a database with people with multiple email addresses, I want to make sure they get the message on all of them. I found a solution that is not particularly elegant but is simple and effective: distribute the email addresses on
 multiple columns (email 1, email 2, etc.) and when you are ready to do Finish&amp;Merge/Send email messages, you basically do it twice:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- First time, select "email 1" column in the "To" field of the popup box</p>
<p>- Second time, select "email 2" column, and so on</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this is helpful</p>

                    <p>I am using Nokia Lumia 1520 since more than a year smoothly but after ; when I have been updated it with windows 10.0.143....with anniversary update my phone started rebooting continuously till more than 24 hours. I traced out the issue &amp; the issue is with
 wi-fi &amp; Bluetooth .When If i tried to switch on the wi-fi or Bluetooth it again started to reboot &amp; it starts rebooting continuously ..goes into the loop. Again I have to restored it to win 8.1 with Windows Device Recovery Tool but major software's are not
 available or working on win 8.1 platform. I love my phone &amp; Win 10 also ,so please require your strong intervention to roll out the fix for my issue for Nokia Lumia 1520.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I have spend more than Rs. 50,000 on this device because i am a die hard fan of Nokia &amp; it starts giving me issues since after 1 &amp; 1/2 year after purchase of this device because of Microsoft OS only. My sincere request to you guyz please focus on the existing
 issues &amp; development on the Nokia high end devices before starting for the new production. After a lot of updates the phone again start rebooting even with the fresh firmware update. Now my 1520 is nothing but a hot sandwidth which is on continuous reboot
 &amp; if i plug it for charging it again start rebooting. One day it will get blast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again request you to Microsoft, please find a solution for this &amp; this happens with all the device wih my friend who are having Nokia device on which Microsoft devices is there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everyone is just fed up of with your OS.</p>

<h2>            Help Nokia 5700</h2>
                    I was listening to music on my Nokia 5700 (Symbian Series 60), and all of a sudden all the songs got a question mark near them and it said it can't open them. I restarted the phone, and when I entered Music Player again all the songs we're gone.<br />
If I try to enter from Nokia PC Suite on my memory card, it gives me an error.<br />
And when I enter Memory Options on my phone, it recognizes my memory card and says Free Memory 176 mb, so it means all the data is still there but my phone doesn't recognize it??<br />
What is wrong? Please help.

<h3> crewfan  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA, Compare Two Text Boxes</h2>
                    <p>I have three textboxes: TextBox1, TextBox2, TextBox3</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to do the following: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Format&nbsp;TextBox2 as currency (The value in TextBox1 has already been formatted as currency in a prior routine)</p>
<p>2. Compare the values in TextBox1 &amp; TextBox2</p>
<p>3. Report in&nbsp;TextBox3&nbsp;if TextBox1 is over / under TextBox2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's my code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub TextBox2_AfterUpdate()<br />
Me.TextBox2.Value = Format(Me.TextBox2.Value, "Currency")</p>
<p>If TextBox1.Value &lt; TextBox2.Value Then<br />
TextBox3.Value = "over"<br />
Else<br />
TextBox3.Value = "under"<br />
End If</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem I'm running into is that my code doesn't always report the over / under properly.&nbsp; Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.&nbsp; I'm open to completely change the code.&nbsp; Is the value from TextBox1 not being "read" properly because it came from another
 routine?</p>

<p>is that the value is a text string. It will be compared to the other text string alphabetically, for example "$2.34" will be greater than "$10,000.00" because 2 comes after 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'd have to compare the unformatted values as numbers. Are the unformatted values available?</p>

<h3> jabellwilson  say:</h3>
<h2>            My live e-mail won&#39;t let me sign in</h2>
                    The other day I changed my password, because I always forget my password. But, when I tried signing back on in a few minutes, it wouldn't work, because it said "That Microsoft account doesn't exist. Enter a different email address or get a new account."
 So, I tried making a new account with the same email, but it said it's taken. I even remember the password. I was editing my account before, to take my other Hotmail off the recovery address, because every time I'd reset my password, it would make me sign
 out just to reset it. Then, when I made my GMail the recovery address, it didn't work, which is why I signed off, to see if it worked then. Now, I can't sign on, and I need this account for my Windows Phone.<br />
<br />
I also tried this on my phone, and it didn't work there either.<br />

Nope.&nbsp; I went through that with the AT&amp;T Tech.&nbsp; After a few other things we ended up doing a master reset. Want to avoid that so I don't have to redownload programs again.&nbsp; Pretty sure it's the phone.&nbsp; Cause after the reset, it sync'd up fine.&nbsp; Even did a laundry
 list of songs with&nbsp;no probs.&nbsp; But like a mentioned.&nbsp; I'd like to avoid that.

<h2>            How do I stop the style list floating &#40;MSW2007&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am using Word 2007.&nbsp; When I used it under XP I could bring up the style list onto the window and it would stay fixed.&nbsp; It did not float, and. more importantly, it did not obscure any of the text in the document. Under W7 it floats.</p>
<p>How do I get the XP effect - non-floating, non-obscuring?</p>

            Drag it to the side of the application window. It should stretch out and attach to the side.&nbsp; In theory it should save that position when you close word (but it's stopped saving that location for me in Win8 Office 2010 .... &lt;sigh&gt; )<br />

<h2>            BUG&#58; Skype running but no icons taskbar&#47;system tray</h2>
                    <p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>So whenever I run the 'normal' skype, shows up on my system tray (I hide it from my taskbar). However, when that annoying window comes up and it asks me to 'try the new skype' - when I do, there is no system tray icon! If I dont keep the Skype window open,
 I have no way to access it.</p>
<p>I literally have to wait for someone to message me so I can open it that way.</p>
<p>Alternatively, I have to restart it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going to keep running the old version until this is fixed.</p>

    <title>Inability to reinstall Microsoft Project on new laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrzejkowalski1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inability to reinstall Microsoft Project on new laptop</h2>
                    <p>In April 2014 I bought Microsoft Project 2013 and installed it on my laptop using the activation key provided.&nbsp; That laptop has died and so I tried to install MS Project on my new laptop (the MS license provides for a transfer in case of hardware failure).&nbsp;
 When I entered the activation key I was informed that it had been blocked.&nbsp; On contacting the MS support online chat, I was informed that the reason for the blocking of the key was "Abuse", that the key could not be unblocked and that the only thing that I
 could do was contact the original seller (why would it be their problem? - the activation key worked originally - MS blocked it, not they) or buy MS Project again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not a happy customer!&nbsp; How can I get this resolved so that I can install on my new laptop without paying a significant amount for a product?</p>

<p>AndrzejKowalski1,</p>
<p>Where did you purchase Project 2013? Unfortunately it sounds like you bought an illegal (cloned) copy of the software and you were lucky it actually installed the first time. I have looked on-line for various versions of Project and I find there is a unfortunately
 a plethora of unscrupulous "suppliers".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not work for nor represent Microsoft but I think the online chat advice is correct. You need to contact the person/company where you bought Project 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Real-time protection scans files as they‚Äôre accessed, so it has to move very quickly in order to keep from bottlenecking file system activity. Consequently it doesn‚Äôt take the time to unpack container (archived) files and scan the files inside the
 container. So the advantage of scanning archived files is that it will detect archived malware that real-time protection might have missed. Since any archived malware files would theoretically be detected and handled by real-time protection at the time they
 were extracted or executed, archived malware files shouldn‚Äôt pose a real threat. But on the other hand, reality doesn‚Äôt always seem to follow the prescribed theoretical path, and lots of people just don‚Äôt want any malware on their PC ‚Äì regardless of whether
 it poses a real threat or not. So it's really a question of personal preference.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On the vulnerability question, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very likely that malware would target any of your personal archived files. So if you have a collection of large archived backup files, for instance, you can probably exclude those files without introducing
 too much of a risk. But use path exclusions on the folders where the archived files are located ‚Äì don‚Äôt use file-type exclusions.

    <title>Trying to install Windows Mobile Device Center says device is - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Trying to install Windows Mobile Device Center says device is unplugged</h2>
                    Hi, I just got a USB cable for my T-mobile phone.&nbsp; When I connect the phone to my 64 bit Windows 7 PC, it only shows files to download a driver (not the files on my phone).&nbsp; The driver is ActiveSync, which I think, does not work with my computer.&nbsp; In the
 error message when I tried to install it and in some internet search, it said I should use Windows Mobile Device Center, so I downloaded 64 bit version of it (it said it was for Vista, but I read somewhere that it should work with Windows 7 as well).<br />
<br />
When I try to install it, it says that the device is unplugged and it gives a red X.&nbsp; When I look in My Computer and Device Manager, the device is showing.&nbsp; Although it is weird that in My Computer it says it is CD Drive (D:), and in Device Manager, it shows
 up in both under Disk Drives and under DVD/CD-ROM drives.&nbsp; I tried two different USB ports and it showed up like this both times.<br />
<br />
If someone can advice me on how I can get Windows Mobile Device Center to recognize my phone so I can start downloading photos from my phone to my PC that would be great.&nbsp; Thank you!<br />

            Hello. OK, with android forget about Activesync or WMDC and you can uninstall WMDC from your PC. No, Activesync 4.5 won't install on Win 7. I don't&nbsp; know why you would see that on your phone. I don't have any reference to AS on my android phone. I don't
 really think you are seeing the phone file structure yet at all as I don't think you have mounted the storage portion of the phone correctly.&nbsp;
<br />
<div>
<p>This how-to should help you&nbsp; connect via USB:</p>

<br />=INDEX(A2:A10,RANDBETWEEN(ROW(A2),ROW(A10)))

<br />=INDEX(A2:A10,RANDBETWEEN(ROW(A2)-1,ROW(A10)-1))

<p>Have you tried restarting the phone? If that does not help, remove the memory card (if there is any) and restart the phone. Otherwise, please provide feedback and I'll see what I can advise next.</p>

<h2>            Cannot saved recovered version after crash because document locked</h2>
                    <p>I am using the Insider Fast edition of office, though I have had this problem previously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After Word crashed and recovers itself, I am offered an option of files. The logical file to chose is the recovered version as it has my most recent changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I try to save this file, it says I cannot because it is locked by another user. I am saving to a folder in my OneDrive folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way of resolving this is to download the original from the server which does not have my changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens every time, and since I am using Office Insider, crashes are more frequent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Doug, but that doesn't really help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point of using OneDrive is to keep synced versions on the server and locally. If I save a different version locally (outside if the OneDrive folder) every time it crashes, it defeats the object of using OneDrive in the first place.</p>

            <p>Crashes may have different causes, of course. However, since crashes often leave temporary files behind, it isn't unusual that you have to do some maintenance afterwards.</p>

            <p>When it says it is locked by another user, it should give you a user name. In this case it should be (annoyingly) your own name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word go to File menu &gt; Options command &gt; General option &gt; Personalize your copy of MS Office section.&nbsp; In this section you should see your own USER Name.&nbsp; If you don't, do enter it here, it will make that error message a little more clear.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a crash, try using the File Open dialog. Look at the bottom of the pane, there should be a "Recover Unsaved Documents" option. Click on it to hopefully re-open the document(s) open at the time of the crash.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you open a file in Word, Word creates a number of temporary "working" files, including the lock file that is giving you problems.&nbsp; If the document is closed normally, and Word is closed normally, those temp files are automatically cleaned up by Word.&nbsp;
 But when Word crashes, those temp files are left behind. With little luck you can use those temp files to recover at least some of your unsaved work.

<p style="margin-left: 0">Microsoft Word documents can be lost in certain situations. For example, the document may be lost if an error occurs that forces Word to quit, if you experience a power interruption while editing, or if you close the document without
 saving changes. This article explains steps that you can use to try to recover the lost document.<br />
<br />
<span>Note</span> Some lost documents may not be recoverable.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">Use the following methods in the order in which they are presented, as appropriate for your situation.</p>
<p><span>Method 1 applies to Windows 10 also.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can also simply start typing the file name in the Start Screen or Start Menu to invoke the search tool.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 3 applies to Word 2016 also.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks Rohn007</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this particular instance, I normally let Word reopen automatically and it presents me with the recovered document as well as the last saved and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose the "recovered" document&nbsp;since that has my latest edits and the others do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I save this by pressing ctrl+S it reports that it is unable to "upload" because it is locked by another user. And you are right, that other user is, of course, me. Though, I suppose it is the remote me rather than the local me, if you get my drift.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the problem is not recovering the lost document, that is fine, but that when I save, there is a conflict with the remote OneDrive version, I suppose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, I can get around this by simply saving as a new file name, but that is not really a very good solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can test none of this till it crashes again, however.</p>

            In that case you are not going to like this, but your only option is to temporarily save as a new name, close word then cleanup the temp files left from the crash and rename the temp new name to your original name. Yes, it is a PITA, but you have to clean
 up the remnants of the previous crash. <br />

            <p>Oh, thanks! :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It strikes me that this is something that perhaps should be written into the recover&nbsp;procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once a particular document is chosen, especially the auto-recover version, then anything that might cause conflicts is automatically cleaned up too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't see that that is very hard to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for interest, how does Office check credentials of a document against the OneDrive server version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am interested why it doesn't understand that the ownership is the same and therefore there should be no conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or is there some safety thing going on here to prevent accidental&nbsp;overwriting that is getting in the way?</p>
<p>

            <p>You are totally correct.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Why doesn't it recognize the ID is the same? </p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason is simple. This "feature" was written some time in the late 1980's or early 1990's when networking was first introduced. It was created as a "fast and dirty" fix, so it is a brain-dead simple check: "does the matching lock file exist? If yes,
 report the name in it, do not open the file and let someone smarter than '<em>you</em>' (in other word let the user not computer figure our the solution) deal with the problem ... !" There is no actual check of the ID in the lock file.&nbsp; Actually that can be
 a good thing. In many corporate installations the same generic ID is populated in the name field, so it would NOT work as a lock in that case.
