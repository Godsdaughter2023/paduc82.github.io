    <title>Sound for email alert - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sound for email alert</h2>
                    I have recently purchased a new 64 bit computer running latest Windows. I run two email accounts in Microsoft Outlook 2003. I have managed to set them up so that they deposit emails into two separate email accounts through rules and alerts. I had hoped
 to have them make separate sounds on receipt of mail but find that the current ping sound is locked in both accounts even after I have changed the alert rule to a new&nbsp;separate .wav that I downloaded from the web and stored in my document file. The rule/alert
 shows the required sound file but it does not work on receipt of an emai. Any suggestions?

            &nbsp;The setup for sound on new email alerts is default for all email accounts in your email client. If you want to setup a separate sound alert for different email accounts, then create a rule in Outlook as follows:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>On the Tools menu, click Rules and Alerts.</span></li><li><span>Click New Rule.</span> </li><li><span>Click Start from a blank rule, and then click Next.</span></li><li><span>Under Step 1: Select condition(s), select the option 'Through the specified account' check box, click next.</span></li><li><span>Under Step 2:<span>&nbsp;</span>Select condition(s), select the option 'Play a sound' check box, click next.</span></li><li><span>Click OK, and then click Next.

<h2>            Nokia N9 POP Email problem</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;I configure the email box as POP/SMTP. &nbsp;Sending and Receiving the email works well. &nbsp;But there are two problems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;I cannot delete sent message in trash. &nbsp;When I delete a message I receive and delete it in the trash, it works fine. &nbsp;But when I delete a sent message to trash and try to delete it in trash, it doesn't work. &nbsp;The email just stays there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;I cannot make the email I sent show my name. &nbsp;It always shows my email address. &nbsp;Not a big problem but kind of annoying. &nbsp;In the account setting, I entered my name there but the email I sent does not show the name. &nbsp;It always show my email address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reset the account or reset the device or reboot the phone don't solve the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone has similar problem or know how to solve it? &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<p>Thanks for providing the information. &nbsp;I have tried this before I post. &nbsp;If I receive a email and then delete it, I can delete this received email in trash. &nbsp;But if I send a email and delete it, I cannot delete it in the trash. &nbsp;I have tried the method you
 mention or press the email and select delete. &nbsp;Neither works for me. &nbsp;I am not sure whether it is just the compatibility issue with the specific server of the university or it is a bug in the email client. &nbsp;I am pretty sure the set up is correct as I did the
 same set up in my Nokia N8 and it works well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, I haven't got the update (UAE version). &nbsp;So I am wondering if PR 1.1 update will fix the problem.</p>

You can delete any kind of mail, but you can't interact with the server, so you received an e-mail, delete from your phone, but you can't delete it from the server :(

<p>Thanks. &nbsp;Good to know the issue of deleting email is solved in the update. &nbsp;I am still waiting for it. &nbsp;Hopefully it is coming soon. &nbsp;Considering the interaction with server, I think this is not a bug. &nbsp;It is just how different email client approach POP
 setup. &nbsp;In old version of outlook, if you download email from the server, outlook will delete the copy on the server no matter you delete it on your computer or not. &nbsp;In some other email client I don't remember now, the email client did not remove the copy
 on the server. &nbsp;Once it is downloaded, all the operations are local. &nbsp;Whether you delete in your computer or not does not affect the server. &nbsp;I actually prefer this way since downloading emails to the phone does not affect whether I can still receive it on
 my laptop. &nbsp;It might be convenient if you have multiple device and just use the phone occasionally to check email.</p>

            It's not a bug, but it would be great, if you can decide how the e-mail client works with the server. I use only my N9 for e-mails, and it's a shame, that I have to go to the webmail client and delete the mails there.

            I have PR 1.1 as well but I can delete from phone and it's updates the server as well but I would preffer to have an option to delete in a phone not to trash but option to skip the trash. You might need to refresh current folder on the phone after deleting
 the mail before it syncs with server - I tried it with Google and also with Live (if I got Hotmail and opening it first on N9 and deleting it from there after checking on web account I saw new type of info POP 1 deleted)

<p>I'm really frustrated with this N9. I bought it 3 days ago and to my surprise the email cannot connect to server... When I reboot it works for 5 minutes but then it fails again...</p>

<p>If Nokia doesn't give a solution I'll change (unfortunately) to iphone or android as I can still change it in the store this week...</p>

    <title>N8 and Ovisuite - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guymit  say:</h3>
<h2>            N8 and Ovisuite</h2>
                    
<p>I am using a Nokia N8, and I am trying to get the thing to communicate with Ovisuite (which, incidentally, is so much more poorly executed than PC Suite as to make me wonder how quality assurance ever let the bugridden nonsense through the gate).&nbsp; It will
 just about synchorinise my calendar and tasks with Outlook (although the date range is ludicrously restrictive), but, after the first Contact sync, it is refusing to play.&nbsp; Whenever I try to resync my contacts, Ovisuite shuts down in the middle of the process
 and I get an error message telling me that Windows has closed down Ovisuite because of a problem and will notify me if there is a solution!&nbsp; Any advice?</p>

<p>Guymit,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear that the OVI suite is being a pain, I can fully understand your frustration, I was the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I did to get round this is to remove and then re-instal PC suite, but not the current version on the website, as it won't support the N8.</p>
<p>A quick google search for the following version 7.1.40.60 is what you need, you will be able to fully synch mail, calendar, sms etc.</p>
<p>plus if you want&nbsp;OVI it will still connect to your N8 for music and maps etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hope this helps</p>

<p>I tend to find that OVI suite can be more than a little tempremental when connection to the phone is removed then restored,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's usualy best in these circumstances to shutdown and restart OVi suite (right click on the ovi icon in the task bar and select exit), which will usualy clear the problem</p>

<h2>            How to Modify a Word 2010 Custom Table Style</h2>
                    <p>Using Word 2010, and the Oriel Report theme, how do I modify a custom table style?</p>
<p>When I create a custom table style, I'm not able to modify it. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For example, when I try to change the Header Row to red, it reverts back to automatic:</p>

<p>Here's a video (2 mins) showing the end to end process of what I'm doing and where it breaks down:</p>

            <p>I've tested this, too, and it appears that you can change the font color for the entire table but not for specific rows. You can change the shading and border colors for specific rows. If you look at all the formats in the table style gallery, you'll see
 that the text is always set to Automatic, which makes it black on light colors, white on darker ones, so I'm guessing this is by design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are definite limits to what you can do with paragraph and character formatting in table styles. The fact that you can't assign a specific paragraph style for the header row is another drawback. I usually just create Table Text and Table Heading styles
 and apply them in the tables I create, then apply direct formatting as required in specific cells. It's not an ideal solution, but it may be the best you can achieve.</p>

            It seems to work for me, in a custom table style. I modified the text color for the header row, and I had no problems doing so. Changing settings for
<strong>built-in</strong> table styles seems inconsistent, though.

            How did you create a new custom table style other than with <strong>New Table Style...</strong>, which is what both the OP and I tried? Does it matter what style the table style is based on? I noticed that what I had in the table (default insertion) was
 Table Grid, but when I went to create a new style, it was based on Table Normal (and I know Table Normal can't be customized). The borders (from Table Grid) also seemed to come and go.

 Note that Word doesn't apply the style automatically (which happens when you create a paragraph style in a similar fashion); instead I had to apply it manually.</p>

<p>Hi Hojo2018,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, I had tested at my end by creating 4 sheets (sheet 1, sheet 2, sheet 3, sheet 4) and hidden the sheet 2 and uploaded the file to my SharePoint site. After uploading the file, I had opened the Excel file from the SharePoint where
 I the sheet 2 is still hidden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps I had followed are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Hidden the sheet by referring the article: <a href="https://apac01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.office.com%2Fen-us%2Farticle%2Fhide-or-show-worksheets-or-workbooks-a8f5977c-8f1a-4ce7-a45d-58cd2c7516de%23bmhideworksheet&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C1d1e8458015a47949e8008d6409c0c09%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636767436292009014&amp;sdata=ew5C%2Bj5i4dGwGhhCL4MGsZhPBdSsOo7UXkzTagIKgm8%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Hide Worksheets</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b17e4255-33d1-4333-a2bf-4fcc9024eeb4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b17e4255-33d1-4333-a2bf-4fcc9024eeb4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. And then uploaded it to SharePoint site and by clicking on the upload in the site..</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. After uploading opened the uploaded Excel file (Online), where the sheet is hidden as the below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43d9938f-b7fd-4612-8daa-dd300291cc2e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43d9938f-b7fd-4612-8daa-dd300291cc2e?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And if you want hide the sheets in the Excel online refer the article: <a href="https://apac01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.office.com%2Fen-us%2Farticle%2Fhide-or-unhide-worksheets-4e50bf12-babe-4821-8240-2235dfdb2d50&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7C1d1e8458015a47949e8008d6409c0c09%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636767436292019010&amp;sdata=VuvcN4YszmJUoPT6ELNmfcA%2Fac9FBoePNpPjfQOnsxc%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Hide or Unhide the worksheet</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In addition, if your repro steps are not similar to the above please provide the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Provide the correct repro steps in detail.</p>
<p>2. Screenshot of your Office version. (Excel&gt; File&gt; Account&gt; Product Information) To protect your privacy, please mask if there is any personal information.</p>

            Linda,<br />
I'm not familiar with "SA". However the EULA for my license states:<br />
" Upon upgrade or conversion, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded or converted from.&nbsp; After you upgrade or convert, you may no longer use the earlier version of the software you upgraded or converted from."<br />
<br />
Upgrade or conversion is different from a new installation. If you bought an upgrade version, (i.e. software that requires you to have a previous version installed - called an upgrade version), than the above limitation is true. However if you bought a totally
 new copy (i.e. software that does not require a previous version being installed - called a full version), then the above limitation does not apply. In the latter case you have two separate licenses and you can concurrently install and use both versions.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
John<br />

    <title>Using Wingdings in footers and footer formats - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fionablueleaf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Wingdings in footers and footer formats</h2>
                    I am using the 'font' Printers Ornament (downloaded free font) to give little floral flourishes at the end of paragraphs and also in footers next to footer titles. The paragraph flourishes work fine, but I can't get the characters to appear in the footers
 without turning the rest of the text into Printers Ornaments as well. I did manage to do it on the first footer but can't do it now. I've tried inserting it as a text box, have tried leaving huge gaps, tried typing the title text first and then inserted the
 floral motif after but no joy. Can anyone suggest what else I can do?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The footer format is:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>No footer on cover page, different odd and even pages that SHOULD look like - &nbsp; "7 &nbsp; &amp; HPS Newsletter" and "&amp; HPS Newsletter &nbsp;7" where the ampersand is my floral character.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What I get is "7 &amp; *&amp;*%$££££%^^&amp;**("</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using my own fonts that I haven't set up as a custom style. Don't know whether this is a problem.</div>

            Hi&nbsp;Fionablueleaf,
<div><br />
<div>Try adding the footer's page number and text manually instead of using one of the pre-designed footers. I was able to reproduce your issue when using Word's built-in footer designs.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can manually add the page number by following the steps below:</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">View</span>&nbsp;menu, click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Print Layout</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Document Elements</span>&nbsp;tab, under&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Header and Footer</span>, click&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">Page #</span>.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fmac2.microsoft.com%2fhelp%2fGetOpenContent.aspx%3fassetid%3d4d044fcc-659a-430a-b112-d1cc22c1143a%26amp%3blocale%3den-us%26amp%3bproduct%3doffice%26amp%3bversion%3d14" /></p>
</li><li>
<p>Select the options that you want.</p>
</li></ol>
<div><br />
<div>Once you've added the page numbers, you can type the rest of your text and change the ampersand to Wingdings without changing the rest of the text.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you need more information about adding page numbers to your document, the following link should offer a few more pointers:</div>
<div><b><a href="http://mac2.microsoft.com/help/office/14/en-us/word/item/79c02dfd-881a-4efd-83e7-da38325d0ca2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add or remove page numbers</a></b></div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps!</div>

            <p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One common reason meeting invites are not populating in your Outlook calendar is incorrect auto archive settings. If meetings are not displaying on your calendar, they have been archived automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the Auto Archive settings by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>File</strong><br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Options</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Advanced</strong></li><li>Under <strong>Advanced</strong>, click <strong>AutoArchive Settings</strong>.</li><li>Ensure that <strong>Run AutoArchive</strong> <strong>every </strong>is unchecked.</li></ol>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi WestlyWarrior,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The limit is 50 Megabytes. As far as I know, it isn't feasible to change it. As a workaround, you can ask students to save file into OneDrive, then submit the link. And if you have any suggestions, you can give feedback to our related engineers via

                    I'm using the bibliography in Word for my thesis, but don't really like that all the references are in one big block, without a linebreak between each source. Is there a way to change the format and add a line break between each? I can do it manually,
 but then when I update the bibliography, it goes back to the way it was.

FWIW: Most knowledgeable Word users recommend that you <i>never</i> use line breaks/carriage returns to impose vertical spacing in any portion of a document.<br />

                    <p>Outlook 2016 Hangs on Loading Profile - Never returns even after a 1 hour wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is apparently a known issue and discussed by several users at&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/f03ed8d3-b27d-4abf-bde7-27f587bc466d/outlook-2016-is-now-hanging-at-the-loading-profile-quot-startup-page?forum=outlook&amp;prof=required</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been running Outlook 2016 - Office 365 - 64 Bit - Click-to-Run since March, and never experienced this issue.&nbsp; I got the problem yesterday after updating Outlook 2016 to latest version.&nbsp; I am now running&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365 Version 1905 (Build 11629.20246 <span>
Click-to-Run </span>)<span style="color: rgba(176, 0, 0, 1)"> - </span>All apps are v16.0.11629.20238 64 bit</p>
<p>In my case, I tried to rename the .ost file and got a message that Excel was using my file, even though Excel wasn't running.&nbsp; I went to task manager, found Excel running in the background, killed it, and Outlook came immediately to life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are for Microsoft.&nbsp; If you're aware of this problem, what is the status? and is there a permanent work-around, or do we have to keep killing whichever Office App happens to be locking our .ost file. &nbsp;&nbsp; If you're not aware of it, please
 try to replicate it and feel free to contact me for any details you require.</p>

 Support is seeing some cases with this and the workaround is what we know so far in case it applies.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:&nbsp; Some users said that they were seeing Display online status checked and grayed out.&nbsp; If you want to uncheck that option you have to run Skype or Teams or whatever your presence solution is and then uncheck that box in Outlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you rather not sign into Skype I posted a reg key to turn off presence to OneDrive,&nbsp;<a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AobSYdEz_Bdhhtk6gWyJ-7PXvaBa1w?e=zavQTq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://1drv.ms/u/s!AobSYdEz_Bdhhtk6gWyJ-7PXvaBa1w?e=zavQTq</a>.&nbsp;
 I also posted a key to re-enable it later.&nbsp; The key you need to workaround is to turn off Presence.&nbsp; Once you download the file double click on it and that will add it to the registry.&nbsp; You can then check in People settings in Outlook that it is disabled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Help. PPC system clock is stuck at the same time, wont budge.</h2>
                    This has been going on for two weeks. <br />
I tried to set it again, restart, change my regional settings and whatever else but it still doesn't seem to work.
<br />
The clock just wont move even a single second. If it's a normal watch I'd just replace it's battery. But it's obviously not a battery problem.<br />
I'm using a WM5 powered HP iPaq rx4540. You know, I used to have the same problem with my jornada.<br />
<br />
Please somebody, I tried surfing the net for more info, so you guys here are my last resort to salvage what's left of the uses of this probably useful gadget before I throw away this maybe piece of junk.<br />
<br />
I know. I'm a schmuck. But I'm a desperate schmuck. I need the clock to be working. Work reasons, yeah. Help me? Please?<br />

<p>This is strange...If you had this problem also with the jordana it must be something you have on the device now as you had on the jordana that would make this happen. probably an incompatible application that creates this error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try starting from scratch(hard reset) and install one by one you application and see when the error starts. That's the probably the evil</p>

All I'm left with now is a basic entry level ppc with no added programs and ppc. Oh dang.<br />

            Hmm.. lets see..<br />
<br />
I tried deleting all programs possible from my ppc.<br />
<br />
Didn't work.<br />
<br />
I tried soft reset.<br />
<br />
Didn't work either.<br />
<br />
Then I tried hard reset.<br />
<br />
Still nada.<br />
<br />
Sigh... What did I get myself into...<br />
<br />
Thanks for helping anyway, Johan.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should try leaving it out in the sun here in sunny little Singapore.<br />
<br />
That always seems to work, chasing out all the bugs out of my mattress. Maybe it'll work on my PPC.<br />
<br />
Cheers!<br />

<h2>            Calendar and Contacts in Outlook 2016&#47;Office 365 not syncing with iTunes</h2>
                    I had several chat sessions with Microsoft support to help import contacts and calendars into Outlook 2016, but they are not syncing (through iTunes) with my iPhone.&nbsp; This has always worked perfectly until I "upgraded" to Outlook 2016. &nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might need to connect your device to a computer and try if you can sync the contacts and calendars that you have on your Outlook email account to the application where you are trying to sync it. Before we proceed, we might need additional information
 that can isolate the issue. Kindly provide the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What are the troubleshooting steps you have done so far?</li><li>What did hat support advised to you and the workaround they tried to help resolve the issue?</li></ul>
<p>For the meantime, you can try the following steps provided below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Connect your device to your computer and then click the <strong>device button.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Info</strong>.</li><li>Select the items that you want to sync.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If the issue persists, we suggest that you contact the application's developer where you are trying to sync the contacts and calendar for advanced and additional steps that they can suggest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your reply is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</p>

<p>I finally solved the problem with a lot of help from a very determined technician from Apple. &nbsp;I think the short answer is that calendars and contacts WERE syncing, just not to the folders that the Microsoft techs expected. &nbsp;(In the course of importing my
 Outlook.pst file, I wound up with a LOT of duplicate folders. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We finally figured out which folders were "active." &nbsp;I needed to copy contacts from one Outlook folder to another, and then delete the extra contact and calendar folders. All seems to be well now.</p>

            Thanks for the reply. &nbsp;I came to the same conclusion - that the calendar I wanted to synch was not the default. &nbsp;I created a "new" calendar with a different name, and items synced immediately with Outlook for iOS. &nbsp;Contacts worked without changing anything.
 &nbsp;I can now create appt on the iPhone and it syncs with my desktop&nbsp;Outlook, and vice-versa. &nbsp;There is also a limit to the number of calendar&nbsp;entries you can sync to the iOS client. &nbsp;I kinda discovered all of this on my own - the free tech support Microsoft
 provides generally consists of one line responses like "reset the client" which never get close to root-cause. &nbsp;I guess that is free support for a free product. &nbsp;It is working now, so serving the desired purpose (I changed my outlook.com email to the exchange
 server version as pop/imap were problematic).

            The restriction code is used to unlock as SIM-locked phone.<br />
<br />
It is very unusual that your phones asks for it randomly, and then decides it doesn't need one after all, you should try a software update - either do it yourself with Software Updater (see the Nokia web site) or have it done at a Nokia service point. This
 should iron out the bug that has crept into your phone.

    <title>Messages successfully delivered to Hotmail&#47;Outlook&#47;Live SMTP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> f_j_w_c  say:</h3>
<h2>            Messages successfully delivered to Hotmail&#47;Outlook&#47;Live SMTP servers are not received by end-users</h2>
                    We are no longer able to deliver mail to any @hotmail.com, @outlook.com, or @live.ca addresses. &nbsp;Correction, we can successfully deliver the messages to your SMTP servers (they return 200 OK in the SMTP session), but the messages are never actually delivered
 to the end recipient. &nbsp;Not to their Inbox, their Trash, their Spam, the messages just disappear into the ether after your SMTP servers accept them.<br />
<br />
We are a K-12 school district, and many parents have @hotmail, @outlook, @live e-mail addresses. &nbsp;Teachers and staff are trying to use these e-mail addresses for communicating with the parents, and are getting increasingly frustrated that their messages are
 being delivered ... but not received.<br />
<br />
In the past, we have had our staff e-mail accounts compromised and used for sending spam. &nbsp;However, we shut those down pretty quickly, clean the accounts, change passwords, talk with the staff member, and change the public IPs assigned to our SMTP servers until
 they are removed from the various blacklists on the Internet. &nbsp;This has been working great for several years now ... but something has changed on your end, and we'd like to know how to fix this.<br />
<br />
I have lots of mail log entries showing messages being sent to @hotmail, @outlook, and @live addresses showing your SMTP servers accepting them ... and nobody actually receiving the messages.<br />
<br />
So, how do we go about resolving this issue?

            <p>1. &nbsp;No, there are no error messages. &nbsp;Our SMTP server shows a "status=sent (200 OK)" message from your SMTP server. &nbsp;As far as we are concerned, the message was successfully handed off to your SMTP server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;In June 2016, everything was working normally, with messages showing up in user inboxes. &nbsp;In Sept 2016, messages are being handed off to your SMTP servers, but never showing up in user inboxes (or trash, or junk, or anywhere else).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;Any @hotmail.com, @outlook.com, or @live.ca address. &nbsp;All other addresses are delivered to successfully, or show correct/normal error messages in the SMTP logs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. &nbsp;On our mail server, the messages show in the Sent folder. &nbsp;On our SMTP server, the mail logs show the messages as being sent (status=sent 200 OK). &nbsp;But the recipient never receives the message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. &nbsp;We are using Zimbra Collaboration Server for our local mail server, sending through multiple local SMTP servers, out to the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. &nbsp;Web-based mail client on desktops, local mail clients on phones and tablets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. &nbsp;We've tried multiple different @hotmail, @outlook, and @live recipient addresses. &nbsp;If sent from our mail server, the SMTP logs show the message is sent successfully, accepted by your SMTP server, but the messages are never received by the recipient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If sent from a GMail account, the message is correctly received by the recipient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If sent from a Shaw Cable mail account, the message is correctly received by the recipient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The issue, though, is that your mail server is giving a 200 return code, correctly accepting the message (meaning our part of the SMTP transaction is complete), but the message is never received by the recipient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to contact me offline, I have lots and lots of SMTP logs showing the issue. &nbsp;:) &nbsp;Including dates, times, sender and receipient addresses, return codes, and queue IDs.</p>

            <p>We would like to follow up on the issue that you are experiencing when you try to send email messages to different
<strong>@hotmail, @outlook, </strong>and<strong> @live</strong> email addresses. Kindly answer the additional questions posted below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Are the <strong>Gmail</strong> and
<strong>Shaw Cable</strong> email accounts that you are using to send messages are also configured to the
<strong>Zimbra Collaboration Server</strong> when you sent the messages?</p>
<p>2. Have you tried using a different email account on the
<strong>Zimbra Collaboration Server</strong> in sending email messages?</p>
<p>3. Have you tried removing and adding the email accounts to your mail application?</p>
<p>4. Is this happening on all the computers that you are trying to use that has the
<strong>Zimbra Collaboration Server</strong> on it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that this may be on our end and we are trying to recreate the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>I had the exact same issue as you, and I suspect thousands of others are being affected by this as well!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After getting nowhere seeking help online, I wrote to the CEO of Microsoft UK Cindy Rose. Two days later I received an email from Microsoft tech! Here's an excerpt from that message -</p>
<p>
</p><p>##############################################################################</p>
<p>We received your letter that you wrote to us indicating deliverability issue to Outlook.com/hotmail. After assessing your letter we determine that your IP address: (removed)&nbsp; was being filtered base on our Smart Screen technology's recommendation. After
 our investigation, we have determined that your IP address can be temporary mitigated from our Smart Screen technolnogy. This should help you with the current problem that you are facing when sending to hotmail.</p>
<p>##############################################################################</p>
<p>
</p><p>They admitted in a further message that there is nothing wrong with my IP address, and couldn't explain why their "Smart Screen technology" was discarding my mail!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A system that notifies the sender that their mail has been accepted and then just sends it off into a black hole is not so smart!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In its current state the "Smart Screen technolnogy" is extremely prejudicial towards genuine mail and in my opinion is not fit for purpose.</p>

<p>Regarding your issues with MSE see the following:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>What operating system and service pack? MSE requires XP (32 bit version only) with
<b>SP3</b> installed, Vista or Win 7…</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Prior Security Software?&nbsp; &nbsp;What about a trial version of an antivirus program that was pre-installed when the computer was purchased? McAfee, Norton, Trend Micro?&nbsp; If you reformatted/reinstalled the
 operating system did you also reinstall a trial version of a security program?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes remnants of prior security software will suddenly cause issues with your current antimalware program.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>A <b>possible</b> reason for this problem is that you have conflicting security software installed fully or partially on the PC.&nbsp; Be sure you have removed&nbsp; all other security software from the PC.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>

    <title>Why does Excel change my table headers&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stinige  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Excel change my table headers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a ton of data in rows and columns and I already have my own headers. I want to format this data as a table, but when I do, Excel changes my headers and WILL NOT let me overwrite it back to what I want (even if I change to format as Text). For example,
 I have Q3FY13. For some inexplicable reason, it adds a 2 at the end, making it Q3FY132 and will not let me change it, unless I change it to have a letter at the end. How can I make Excel leave my headers alone? In fact, I want it to leave all my content and
 formatting alone. I just want to reference a data range as a table so I can pivot easily.

<h2>            Windows 10 &#40;10074&#41; freezes when using Google Maps in Chrome &#40;43&#41;</h2>
                    When I go to maps.google.com in Chrome the PC freezes up. I then have to long press the power button and restart the PC.
<br />
This error is reproducible for me and happens every time I try to use Google Maps.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview is much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Windows 10 Technical Preview is still in development stage (testing environment), certain features might not work in the usual manner. Hence you may face some issue with Windows 10.We are looking forward to improve.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I would suggest you to run system file checker scan:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Command Prompt</strong> and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.</li><li>Type the following command in the command prompt and press enter: <strong>Sfc<span>&nbsp;
</span>/scannow<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></strong></li><li>Wait till the process completes, restart the computer and check.</li></ol>
<p>Also I suggest you to update to the latest Windows 10 Technical Preview build 10130 and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Bing ads again with adblocker on&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diegokusak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bing ads again with adblocker on&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Please, and I hope I can make some sense. But I am unable to block Bing ads in ie11 just recently (as of today I noticed on 2/25/19). I use edge for other ways of productivity. And doubt Edge would be better (sorry, is great but this&nbsp;topic is exactly why&nbsp;
 I avoid using it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ads is a business model that does and will more and more decreases goodwill. Say what you want. Its basic common sense that when my friends come home and see me surf the web with Firefox, Waterfox and other browsers that take with them home the idea and
 desire to do the same. See it as a small virus spreading. (in fact study how&nbsp;virus diseases spreads from the CDC to calculate the demise of that model (with Excel and Game theory).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, I thing I have the right to say this for a few reasons, one being I pay for all my MS products since 1992 and it saddens me to see the company not being smarter than google I in finding a way to use the model in a very unobtrusive and smarter way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You see, there is a trap here. If I sign in as my MS/ Hotmail account I will show as a paying customer that I can not-see-ads. But yet then all I do is traced by MS (should I end up buying IBM mini-computers now? To&nbsp;use business software I can control).
 Yes, control is the issue. Not tinfoil hat or porn distractions that marketers keep using to flood chats to derange conversations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--&gt; If a user is happy with all he/she is doing and loves to see ads or don't care, great. Go ahead, make money zll of you. But if I do not want to loose control over my PC's actions then give me a software I can do so. And yes, I study Linux, but I happen
 to be an admirer of MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which is in fact the only and main reason why I (with fear) make this post. And it made me loose an hour of my precious time (time being far more valuable than money).</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 is killing my hard drives&#33;&#33; Catastrophically&#33;</h2>
                    <p>This is a really strange one..</p>
<p>I have installed WTP on my Dell 9150 desktop several times now since the first release build</p>
<p>However, since the latest round of updates, I have had some very odd HDD failures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Configuration:</p>
<p>Dual-booting with W7 Pro:</p>
<p>&nbsp;W7 is on a Samsung 120G 840 EVO SSD</p>
<p>&nbsp;WTP is on another Samsung 840 (not EVO) SSD.</p>
<p>I have 2 Data HDD drives of 2TB each - these are (were) both HGST OEM drives (Type DS5SAD200)</p>
<p>
</p><p>W7 installed, updated and worked just fine with Office 2010 and many other apps. I configured the USER folder to be on the first of the 2 2TB drives. (I always do this to keep data seaparate from the OS, so I can use the SSDs for the OS.</p>
<p>Then I installed WTP Build 9841 and that went just fine</p>
<p>then I downloaded and installed the latest preview build 9879, and that also went fine with no issues</p>
<p>I then let WTP download updates and it started the process of installing them.</p>
<p>After a while of percentage completion indications, the machine asked for a reboot, so far so good.</p>
<p>After the reboot the 2TB HGST drive (was D:) <strong>became undetectable by the BIOS!!</strong></p>
<p>I tried the drive in another machine etc etc, but no dice - it didnt even spin up and just remained inert.</p>
<p>I though this was a huge coincidence, but s#1t happens, right, and at that point I put it down to a coincidental hardware failure during the the WTP reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, i rebuilt the machine, this time with the remaining good HGST 2TB HDD, reinstalled W7 (OK again), and went through the process of installing and updating WTP again.
</p>
<p>HOLY MOLY!! <strong>The same thing happened again</strong>! the HGST 2TB drive became unrecognisable and would not spin up after the WTP updates reboot!</p>
<p>Now, this is REALLY too much of a coincidence. Something is really wrong here... 2 identical drives failing at exactly the same point in the WTP installation process??</p>
<p>(Note that WTP does run correctly once the failed drive is removed, but, of course, my W7 profile has gone)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I phoned HGST, but they didnt really have much to say because (a) the drives are 6 months out of warranty and (b) they aren't using WTP - at least not in the support area anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - has anyone else seen this type of behaviour? Should this be a word of warning against using HGST drives with WTP?</p>
<p>I would speculate that something has been written to the drive to render them - er - unrecognisable by any normal PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I also have a dual boot setup on a Dell laptop&nbsp; - again with samsung SSD and a dual-partitioned 750G seagate and have had no such problems)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? I'd love to send the drive to a data recovery service to see if they can figure out what went on, but the cost is prohibitive.</p>
<p>

<p>This is covered much more extensively (while we all groped for an answer)&nbsp;than any of us want in</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_tp-windows_install/build-9879-hard-drive-disaster-read-this/7da0cd97-3ebc-4eb3-ae23-9873672e4e6d</p>
<p>
</p><p>My HGST drive supported PUIS, but my bios doesn't cover it. I very nearly wasted a great deal of money returning a new drive as faulty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why on earth Microsoft haven't produced a simple-to-follow set of instructions and posted them here as a sticky, I cannot understand. Hopefully the next update will solve all this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: PS, I suspect that Fast Boot (accessed via Control Panel) &nbsp;may have a role to play in the chaos, as it means that W10 really hibernates rather than closes down. If the HD(s) disappear while the machine is hibernated,&nbsp;it can't be good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>As for your non functional drives, if you have a Western Digital drive you can use to&nbsp;temporarily in Windows 7 (Keyless install) to, then download the WDDiag utility and see if you can perform a "Write Zeros" to the front and last part of the HGST drives.
 If it works your HGST drives will be returned to a RAW state and then can be initialized and reformatted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Western Digital drives download the WdDiag .iso file:</p>
<p>(As long as one WD drive is installed it will recognize and work on non WD drives.)</p>

            9879 is abusing the PUIS setting,<br />
PUIS should NEVER be&nbsp;used on non enterprise class systems.<br />
you must use a third party tool to disable the PUIS Flag before the HDD will spin again.
