<h2>            my canon printer iP1800 won&#39;t turn on... i pressed the power button a couple of times but still.</h2>
                    I got my printer with my computer 3 and a half years ago. Its a Canon Printer iP1800. It worked fine back then. Then I stopped printing junk since I ran out of ink. I stopped till about 2 years now, I have homework that I have to type within 4 days. First
 of all, my printer won't turn on. I've pressed the power button several times. And made sure the plugs were plugged in tightly. And it STILL won't turn on! I'm getting furious because I don't want to by another printer. Yes, I have the Canon program thing
 already downloaded, well I think its just a default since it came with the windows vista computer? I'm not sure. Can you help please. And if you can please explain it the most easiest way you can because I don't know much of computer technology.

<br />
If the Printer will not&nbsp;turn on after you supply Power to it,&nbsp;the Printer&nbsp;has a problem, not the Vista Operating System.<br />

<br />1809 is withdrawn now due to errors. You may wait a little for corrected version or rollback to 1803.

<p>The idea of putting the paging file on a separate drive is very old advice that really doesn't make sense for today's hard drives and Windows, which are much faster and more efficient. I haven't heard anyone mention it in years. Even in its day, the advantage
 gained was measured in milliseconds. You probably spent more time composing your post than you will save over the lifetime of your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, Windows will often create a temporary paging file - as it did back then - because some operations required it.</p>

<p>True, but it takes up space I don't have on my primary drive, I was able to somewhat fix this though..</p>

            If you're so stuck for space that you need to move the paging file, I think you need a bigger hard drive. Windows 10 eats disc space like nobody's business.

<p>My windows partition is on a a 700gb ssd It's got about 95.5 gb free atm, but windows eating up 9 GB of that with the page file when I have a 900gb virtually empty ssd is just stupid. And yes, that disk is being used, and yes, there is a reason behind the
 setup.</p>

            There are other reasons besides space to redirect the page file, VDI for instance uses this feature when dealing with a non-writable system drives like Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktop (XenDesktop) deployments using Citrix Provisioning (PVS) in standard
 image mode.&nbsp; We have seen this issue in Virtual environments running VMware and Citrix Hypervisor (XenServer).&nbsp; It appears to work fine in Hyper-V.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Surface doesn&#39;t find my USB Hard Drive &#40;Toshiba&#41;</h2>
                    I know it's been asked a million times before, but how can I get Surface to see my Hard Drive.<br />
<br />
It is a Toshiba Canvio 1TB USB externah hard drive using an NTFS file system, and it works on our family Windows 8 desktop, and my WIndows 7 laptop and Acer tablet, and worked on our previous Windows XP desktop.<br />
<br />
When I say Surface doesn't find it, I mean it doesn't register it's there AT ALL. The light on the hard drive turns on to say it's powered, but the drive inside does not start up. I can tell because it makes no sound. It isn't a misnamed drive in Drive Manager,
 it's just nowhere.<br />
<br />
It only has 1 USB cord, and no power cord, so I know it can work with nothing more than a USB port. It works on my Acer (Windows 7) tablet, even when it's not plugged in, so I doubt it can be a running on Surface's battery thing. I've tried it with Surface
 plugged in, and still no effect.<br />
<br />
I can't find any drivers for it by searching, and couldn't work out how (if at all possible) to copy them across from another PC on which it works.<br />
<br />
How can I get my Hard Drive working with Surface?<br />

<h2>            mp4 video files do not appear in Windows Media Player 12</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have Windows 7 64-bit and WMP version 12.0.7600.16667</p>
<p>I have several&nbsp;.mp4 video files in My Videos folder which do not appear in the Video Library (other files such as .avi type do). I want to stream these files to my Sony Playstation so I did a lot of googling already but can't find a fix. From what I checked
 on my system, I already have a codec and if I click on such a file in does play in WMP.</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do to fix this? Thank you.</p>

<p>I don't know if it has changed since Vista but Mp4 video wasn't a recognised video file type so a registry edit was required to make it usable like MS file formats AVI or WMV etc.. MS had (still has?) it identified by default as&nbsp;an audio file format.&nbsp;MP4
 is actually also a video container file type, like AVI. It requires having a suitable file splitter as well as the audio and video CODECs on the system.</p>
<p>The instructions for installing ffdshow&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Haali splitter&nbsp;should&nbsp;work:</p>

<p>It's essentially&nbsp;the same as what&nbsp;I've done and MP4 files do show up in my WMP video library.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit to 32 bit</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 7 home premium 64 bit version on my Lenovo y560 laptop with two drives "C"(420 GB) and "D"(30 GB).<br />
There is a recovery option that comes along with the laptop to recover windows 7 64 bit version if anything gets corrupted in the OS.<br />
I want to install Windows 7 32 bit version but I have the below questions </p>
<p>1. If I go with fresh installation of windows 7 32 bit by removing windows 7 64 bit version, will recovery of windows 7 64 bit version work as usual and can I recover to windows 7 64 bit once I am done with windows 7 32 bit.</p>
<p>2. If I go with dual boot what will happen to recovery, will recovery contain windows 7 64 bit.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>P.S. Not worried about any data.</p>

            <p>I have done this before and I notice that the recovery partition does not work after deleting the recovery partition. The best thing you can do to avoid this is to backup the entire system as a system image before doing the install:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/</a></p>
<p>If you dual boot, the recovery partition will not be changed or affected. </p>
<p>If you have the Windows 7 32 bit DVD, you will need to do a custom clean install. This requires that you either start the installation from within Windows 7 64 bit or boot from the Windows 7 32 bit DVD.</p>
<p>Please note, you should go to the manufacturers website for your computer and make sure that you have downloaded all the necessary 32 bit drivers for your system, since the drivers that are being used now are for 64 bit Windows. You will notice that some
 devices do not work. Also note that if you have 4 GBs of RAM in your computer, this will not be recognized by Windows 7 32 bit.</p>
<p>How to downgrade from Windows 7 64 bit to Windows 7 32 bit<br />
There is no in place upgrade path from from Windows 7 64 bit to 32 bit. This means you will need to backup whatever personal files you have accumulated since you started using your Windows 7 64 bit PC to an external hard disk or burn them to a blank DVD. You
 cannot use Windows Easy Transfer program when migrating from 64 to 32 bit, it is not backward compatible with the older architecture. This means, you will need to copy and paste files into a folder on an external hard disk or thumb drive. You need to gather
 all those application and driver installation disks and prepare to reinstall all of them.
</p>
<p>Obtaining 32 bit Installation media</p>
<p>If your computer came with Windows 7 64 bit preinstalled, then you will need to contact the manufacturer of the computer about obtaining a alternate recovery Windows 7 32 bit disk set to reinstall Windows 7 on your computer. The manufacturer might charge
 a small shipping and handling fee.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers will include the ability to choose either 32 or 64 bit Windows 7 at installation time. This will require that you boot into the Recovery Environment, most manufacturers require that you press the F11 Function Key when you start your computer.
 Please consult the documentation that came with your computer about how to reinstall Windows 7.</p>
<p>If you bought a retail box license (upgrade or full version) then you should have both 32 and 64 bit DVDs included in the box.</p>
<p>If purchased a digital download of Windows 7 from the Microsoft Store, then you will need to go to the Microsoft Store website (<a href="http://store.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.microsoft.com</a>), log in with your store account, select Download Options
 and select Windows 7 32 bit and proceed to download.</p>
<p>If you have an Anytime Upgrade license, you will need first reinstall the base Windows 7 32 bit license, activate it then do the Anytime Upgrade to the particular edition and then reactivate again.</p>
<p>Starting the Installation<br />
Boot to the Windows 7 64 bit desktop, insert your Windows 7 32 bit DVD, click Run setup.exe when the Auto Play dialog appears. If you want, you can also boot from the Windows 7 32 bit DVD and also do a custom install. Its just that, it’s a bit more elegant
 when you simply boot to the desktop and start the installation from there.</p>
<p>Click Yes when the User Account Control window appears</p>
<p>Click Install Now</p>
<p>Unlike the Windows 7 64 bit disk, you can start the installation from within Windows 7 64 bit because the Setup program in Windows 7 32 bit is a full 32 bit application.</p>
<p>When the setup menu appears, select the custom (advanced) option, select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 7 32 bit. Click Next.</p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. It is still recommended you do a manual backup, because you might explicitly format the drive during setup which will delete all information on the drive. Click OK</p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers. Persons running Windows Vista 64 bit, can also use this method when contemplating whether they should upgrade to Windows 7 32 or 64 bit. If you decide to go the other way around by migrating from Windows 7 32 bit to 64 bit, the same principles apply
 with some exceptions. You can use Windows Easy Transfer to backup your personal files and settings and you will need to boot from the Windows 7 64 bit DVD to start the installation.<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
I suggest you attempt another installation of Windows 7.</p>
<p>When you start the computer, a Boot Menu should be presented with the option to Roll back the installation to your previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>If you are unable to do that or continue the existing installation, I suggest you do a custom install and recover any important personal files from the Windows.old folder.</p>
<p>Boot from the Windows 7 DVD<br />
Click Install Now<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 7 Click Next.</p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<p>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your
 previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>(At all cost, do NOT click anything named Format or Delete or Partition. So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. Click OK</p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and
 drivers.</p>
<p>You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Firstly, let us run the SFC scan and check if some system files are missing and can be repaired.</div>
<div>More Information about SFC scan can be found in this document:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>2. If the above method does not help let us uninstall the Musicmatch jukebox completely using the Windows Installer Cleanup utility.</div>
<div>After it is uninstalled re-install the program again and check.<br />
<div>Remove the&nbsp;Musicmatch jukebox&nbsp;using windows cleanup utility.<br />
Click <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/e/9/d/e9d80355-7ab4-45b8-80e8-983a48d5e1bd/msicuu2.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>here</span></a> to download the Windows Installer Cleanup utility. Install this program and use it to uninstall the Welcome launcher.
<br />
Here is how:<br />
1. Select Welcome launcher&nbsp;which was installed by Windows Installer from the Windows Installer CleanUp dialog box.<br />
2. To do this, select the programs that you want in the Installed Products list in the Windows Installer CleanUp dialog box. (this will remove all the files which still exists.)<br />
3. After you make this selection, the utility removes only Windows Installer configuration information that is related to those programs.<br />

<p>Hi Bwax687,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The incorrect configuration setting is one of the reasons why you are getting this error: "There might be a problem with the service, or it could be because of your privacy settings or past behavior.&nbsp; To check your privacy settings, go to Xbox.com." when
 you are trying to share your game clips. To help you resolve this concern, I need to collect more information. Kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did the issue start?</li><li>What are the troubleshooting steps you have done so far?</li><li>Have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling the Xbox app?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I suggest that you run the troubleshooter for Windows apps. This can help remove problem with an app from Microsoft Store.</p>

<h2>            When I say &#34;Hey Cortana&#34; she only responds with a beep instead of saying hello</h2>
                    I had to upgrade to windows 10 via a usb a friend made for me because of my domain it thinks im a business so doesnt offer it to me (dont know if this affects it). When I say "Hey" to Cortana she responds with a beep but otherwise acts normally, I heard
 she was meant to greet you back. It does show her saying hello in text in the Cortana area but she never actually says it. This means she never uses my name I set unless I ask her what I'm called and makes her seem lacking.

            <p>I tried these methods and Cortana still only responds with a beep. The scan in cmd returns that it detected no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I built my PC myself so it has no model and I had to upgrade from windows 8.1 to 10 using an executable because of my domain, I wasnt offered the upgrade for free despite having windows 8. Is it possible my version of windows 10 is an old one? I heard
 the Cortana used to respond with a beep in some of the testing builds, however I have checked for updates and found none</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.The issue has been happening since I upgraded to windows 10 (Sunday 16th August)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.There are no error messages, the only issue is that Cortana doesnt say "Hey [name]" when I say "Hey Cortana" which I thought she was meant to but the Cortana window still opens and she listens to what I say and acts upon it so everything else is as should
 be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.The only changes I made was turning on Cortana and then following the setup instructions, no major or advanced changes.</p>

<h2>            Cannot send or receive emails</h2>
                    My wife and I share the same PC but have different account names and passwords, but I'm the principle account holder. Last weekend for some unknown reason neither of us could not get online so assumed there was some kind of system failure. Later my wife
 was able to access her emails, etc. But since then I cannot access send or receive emails. I have spent 6 hours this week talking on the phone to Sky engineers to overcome the problem, each one would try something different but all end up by saying contact
 Microsoft. I'm totally lost!

            Hi 99Holmes,<br />
<br />
Did you get a blue screen error? <br />
Did Windows completely boot up before it crashed or just crashed on boot?<br />
If it is a blue screen error, it might be hardware problem.&nbsp; Try to remove your component one by one and try to boot each time.&nbsp; Use another video card, memory,&nbsp;any add on cards.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Let us know,&nbsp;

<h2>            &#34;Add Mirror&#34; option on dynamic drive is missing</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just built a new PC running Windows 8.1&nbsp;with an SSD main drive and two 4TB HDD’s that I want to use for mirrored storage using Windows RAID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this working successfully under Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set one of the 4TB Drives as a dynamic drive partitioned as GPT. &nbsp;When I go in to disc management and right click on that drive (or any other drive) I don’t get the option to “Add Mirror”.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone shed some light on this and suggestions for a possible fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For you ref the main system components are:</p>
<p>ASUS X99 Deluxe motherboard</p>
<p>Intel i7-5820K</p>
<p>16GB RAM</p>
<p>SAMSUNG 850 Pro 512GB SSD</p>
<p>2 x WDC WD40EFRX-68WT0N0 </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi HF</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for replying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an identical 4TB unallocated drive to the drive I want to mirror.&nbsp; But the option to “add mirror” just isn’t in the list when I right click on the drive or partitions I want to mirror.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drive I want to mirror is set up as a dynamic disc, formatted as GPT and has two 1862.95GB partitions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried several things to get this work...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the unallocated drive I have tried this as a simple disc and as a dynamic disc. I have also tried these both with identical partitions to the one I want to mirror as well as being totally unallocated. But still I don’t get the option to “Add Mirror”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m really baffled here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Should the drive I want to mirror be empty of data?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just thought… is the mirror option only available in the 8.1 Pro version? I don’t have Pro. Could that be it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>Thanks again for your time.</span><span><br />

            <p>Some guides indicate both drives have to be empty to establish a mirror but it should work from a single drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to look at Storage Spaces as an alternative management tool to set this up. However it does specifically warn that to set this up the drives have to be cleared of data.</p>

No, once the Surface is fully powered, the charger light will continue to stay on as it is still giving power to the Surface.

            It takes about an hour to charge halfway. It should be fully charged in about two hours.<br />
<br />
If it takes longer than that, make sure your power connector is attached securely to your Surface's charging port.<br />
<br />
When the the power connector begins charging the Surface, a little light begins glowing on the connector's flat end.<br />

    <title>change Cortana search box color independent of default app mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thegreg858  say:</h3>
<h2>            change Cortana search box color independent of default app mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp; I'm wondering whether there's any way to change the Cortana search box color independent of default app mode.&nbsp; I've read about and tried things that other people have reported working (disabling Cortana via setting a different region then re-enabling,
 editing the registry, etc.), but nothing has worked yet.&nbsp; On my version of Windows, the search box color is still strictly connected to the default app mode.&nbsp; It really needs to have its own distinct setting - I'm sure I'm not the only person who wants their
 apps to appear with white backgrounds by default (so that it's not a jarring switch going from viewing at web pages where that's pretty common to viewing my own apps), yet doesn't want a giant glaring white search box at the side of the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is there any way to resolve this yet?&nbsp; If not, can MS please de-couple these in a future release?&nbsp; I'm about ready to disable Cortana completely because the annoyance factor outweighs the value of the search capabilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hello TheGreg858,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, Cortana's search box color only depends on the color chosen from the default app mode (Light and Dark).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To request the feature to freely select the desired search box color for Cortana, it would be best to send our developers a report regarding this item through the Feedback Hub. You can either vote on an existing submission or submit a new issue. When you
 submit a feedback item we gather additional details and information about your issue that will help determine what’s causing it and address it. Feedback items regularly receive Microsoft responses on the submissions in the Feedback app so you can see what
 we are doing about your feedback. Please revisit frequently to see the status of your feedback items.
</p>
<br />
In order to submit new feedback, please follow these steps:
<p>
</p><p>1. On a Windows 10 device, search for Feedback Hub in Cortana search, then launch the app.
<br />
2. Navigate to Feedback in the left menu, then press + Add new feedback. <br />
3. Select the Problem, and share any details you think are relevant, and choose an appropriate category and subcategory.
<br />
4. Important: If possible, reproduce the problem(s) after clicking Begin monitoring (or Start capture) near the end of the form; Stop monitoring when you’re done.
<br />
5. Once you’ve completed the form and monitoring, click Submit. <br />
6. Click Continue using Feedback Hub. <br />
7. Click My feedback at the top, then find the item you submitted (it may take a while to appear).
<br />
8. Open the item you submitted, then click Share. <br />
9. Click Copy link, then paste the link here in your response (it will look like https://aka.ms/ link&gt;).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            How to disable the Windows key in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone know how to turn off the Windows key in Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the instructions I have found online work. They all point to areas in the registry that were present in Windows XP, 7, and 8, but are not present in Windows 10. Even the options in the Edit menu aren't there, so the option to wing it and try something
 doesn't exist. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've managed to turn off the Windows+ shortcuts through gpedit.msc, but that doesn't turn off the key itself. I want it dead! No function whatsoever. That used to be pretty simple to do, but I'm stumped now.</p>

<h2>            Verify microsoft account dialog automatically disappears</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just installed Windows 10 build 1607 on my computer, what I did was a clean install.</p>
<p>Since Windows didn't have the driver for my Killer E2200 LAN Card, I had to sign in a local account instead during installation.</p>
<p>When I was inside Windows, I went to Settings/Account, sign in using a microsoft account instead. I clicked on that and a dialog appeared for input microsoft account information. However, the dialog automatically disappeared so quickly so that I couldn't
 sign in. I've tried some ways faster than disappearing process then I finally could sign in to my microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, after that, I have to verify my account, and the dialog keeps disappearing so that I can't go on anymore :D.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried restarting PC, doing wsreset.exe, doing SFC /scannow, doing DISM tool. But nothing has worked so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attached here the photo of my problem. Hope someone could help. Thanks so much.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this is not the first time I installed Windows on my current PC :D, all other installations in the past didn't encounter this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">EDITED:</span> Finally I found a way to fix this problem. Just reinstall windows, but during "Collection" part, choose "Load Drivers" and point to the folder where your LAN card driver is. There would be 3 files, .cat,
 .inf and .sys. Signing into microsoft account during windows installation is the most stable way =))</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is normal for chargers for&nbsp;devices like the Surface to get warm to the touch. It is not normal for them to get as very hot though. If it is hot, I would consider it to be faulty and a possible fire risk and would contact Microsoft Surface support&nbsp;with
 a view to getting it replaced. Please see:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/support/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/surface/support/contact-us/</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Surface RT charger gets just noticeably warm, not hot.</p>

<h2>            Unable to select &#34;Yes&#34; when asked to clear TPM during Win10 Reset</h2>
                    <p>I am running Win10 on a HP Pavilion X2 2-in-1 PC.</p>
<p>Ran a full reset (not the quick one) and it all went well until I was prompted:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A configuration change was requested to clear this computer's TPM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press YES to clear the TPM</p>
<p>Press NO to reject this change request and continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Tablet's touch screen doesn't work so I cannot click YES.</p>
<p>The hardware buttons do not work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried powering off and doing a BIOS restore by holding Volume Up, Volume Down and the Power button, but it returns a BIOS flashing failed and reboots to the TPM change prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not own an OTG cable or USB keyboard - is there any other way I can fix the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reason for a reset was that it was to be repurposed for someone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Te error message is a pre-OS boot message so I cannot access windows at all and hence cannot use the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connecting a USB mouse did not work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attached a picture of the message.</p>

            <p>It would be very difficult to do a System Restore Point after the Major Windows 10 Update that was recently applied. The entire Windows Folder was replaced, the Start Menu has been fully revised. And the update process literally took almost 2 hours. I do
 not feel that the Probability of a Successful Restore Operation is very high. What am I going to Restore Back too?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Three Computers (2 Laptops &amp; 1 Desktop), that have gone through the Major Windows 10 Update Process, and only the desktop is causing the Boot Issue from a Cold Start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All Three Computers have the same MSCONFIG Setting on the General Tab, "Selective Startup, with the "Use Original Boot Configuration" Grayed Out. And all three computers you "Can Not" Change that to the other selections, such as "Normal Startup". Why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will review on How to Perform a Clean Boot. I will also try the Safe Mode Route. But there should be a way to repair the Boot File. Why does the Computer Only Lock Up, During the 1st Start up from a Cold Start? And why will the computer Boot after a Forced
 Shut Down then a Restart? What is changing? And Last why can't I change the Setting in the MSCONFIG File?</p>

<p>When you start Windows by using a normal startup operation, several applications and services start automatically, and then run in the background. These programs include basic system processes, antivirus software, system utility applications, and other software
 that has been previously installed. These applications and services can cause software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8,
 Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a

            <p>I Tried to do the Clean Boot; Which requires you to make changes through MSCONFIG. I unchecked all of the Services per the write up in the web document. There were No Start Up items to disable. Clicked Apply Changes and then Restarted per the message box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer Restarted as Expected, wasn't starting from a Cold Start. And all of the changes that I made while in MSCONFIG, were right back to where they were before I unselected them. So MSCONFIG although giving the "Appearance" of doing something, Did
 Absolutely Nothing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then shut the computer down through the start menu, as always. The computer powered down. I Waited for 60 Seconds. Then hit the Power Button and the Boot Process started, then "HUNG" at the "WINDOWS BLUE LOGO". The little Revolving White Dots never showed
 their Faces. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I Did a Forced Shut Down. Waited 60 Seconds. Hit the Power Button, the Boot Process Started, and the Computer Booted Properly. My Programs run properly, and I am able to access&nbsp;"My" Files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am tired of the Windows 10 update Process. I am Tired of having to go through this routine to Start "MY COMPUTER", that Belongs to Me;&nbsp;Not MICROSOFT. I will take it into a repair shop. And will look for Remedy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will Tell them that after Windows 10 did their Glorious Major Update, that my computer will not start form a Cold Start.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my Computers every day from My Home Network for Work to earn a Living. And NOW have to start early just to get my computers to run because of Windows 10. I know my desktop computer will not last "Abusing It" by doing Forced Shut Downs all of the Time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Can't wait for the time that All 3 of my Windows 10 Machines Update at the Same Time Again....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files on my Computer Belong to Me, and Not System, or&nbsp;Microsoft.</p>

            <p>I performed the Clean Reboot per the Description from the Windows 10 Web Page&nbsp;from the link embedded in the email,&nbsp;multiple Times from "Safe Mode" with and without Network Connection Selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time, "After Doing the Clean Reboot Process", and after doing a standard "Shut Down" from the Windows Menu, the Computer will not get past the Black Boot Screen with the Small 4 "Pain" Windows Logo. A forced Shutdown after 3 minutes of waiting for the
 Computer to Start, and then another wait of 30 seconds after the Computer Shuts Down, and the computer "Will" restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent hours and days&nbsp;trying to find a remedy, and the only solution that I have&nbsp;that will work at present; is to put the computer in sleep mode, disconnect the network cable, and in the morning, "Restart the Computer" to refresh Memory and other files
 and applications and reconnect to My Network. . </p>
<p>
</p><p>I use my computers to earn a living, and until my ordered replacement arrives, I will continue with this remedy. This was a good computer, AMD 3.0 GHZ Processor, 16 GB of Memory, 1.8 TB Hard Drive, Dual Monitor Video Card for HDMI monitors, etc....
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a reliable computer that starts at 5:00 AM or 6:15 AM, or 7:05 AM, or 9:30 PM, whenever I need it. This one after the Windows 10 Great Major Update; "Is No Longer Reliable" I will not attend another network conference, and not have my computers working
 properly, because of Windows 10 Updates. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I will take this one to a repair shop, and let them wipe the hard drive completely and install a new copy of Windows 10, and relegate this computer to a backup and file server. Thousands of Dollars, Wasted.</p>

<p>Bringing your PC to a repair shop and let them wipe the hard drive completely and install a new copy of Windows 10 would be another option. However, please be advise that this will totally wipe out all your important Files and Data.<br />
<br />
Moreover, doing a System restore is much recommended as that can save you time and energy in going to the repair shop.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, if you opted to send it to the repair shop, make sure that all your important Files and Data are backed up prior to doing a complete re installation.</p>

            <p>I have Run the System File Check along with performing the DISM more than a few times, some from protected Terminal Mode. To No Avail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Trying to do a System Restore would require going back to a point before the "Feature Update to Windows 10" called 1607. During the application of this update is when my Boot File became Corrupted. The Windows Directories were exchanged with new ones,
 and the Old Windows Directory was saved as Windows.Old. To think that Trying to Revert to a previous state would resolve my Boot File dilemma is Hoping for A&nbsp;Low Probability Outcome on a High Risk Operation. If it fails I could have No Operating Computer for
 Monday Morning. Not a Risk that I am willing to take. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done so many Restore Operations, Reset Operations, and have Suffered through countless Windows 10 Updates. My Desktop PC is now unreliable as it is suffering from "Memory Leaks" during the day and needs to be refreshed by Restarting. These Memory
 Leaks are from Tried and True Applications that I have been running without problem until The Feature Update 1607.&nbsp; I use my Computers to Earn A Living, that Windows 10 has Interfered With....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a New Computer On Order, and upon arrival and configuration will replace this Desktop Unit. Update 1607 has Cost me Thousands of Dollars in Expense and Lost Time and Compensation. The AMD Desktop computer will be put to use as a Linux File Server
 and FTP Site. At least&nbsp;with that Configuration I have confidence that the Computer will run:&nbsp;"Without Difficulty" and&nbsp;"WITHOUT INTERUPTION by MICROSOFT&nbsp;AND HARRASSING UPDATE SERVICES"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am more than Disappointed that Not One Person has come forward to offer any realistic help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last, I keep all of my Daily Work &amp; Personal&nbsp;Files saved on External Devices, DropBox, and Google. The Windows 10 Computers have proved Unreliable and have had to go through to many Resets and Restore operations. And like today when my Laptops had to go
 through Updates during the day, those files were basically unavailable while the Update Process Utilized System Resources and Disk Time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After my New Computer Arrives and is put in Service; I will Try the System Restore Operation&nbsp;to before 1607. And I will Post the results. If it Fails. I will Also Post that Result...</p>
