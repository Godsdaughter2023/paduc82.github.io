    <title>How can I change all of my existing Word documents&#39; file type from - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I change all of my existing Word documents&#39; file type from being &#34;DOCX File&#34; back to &#34;Word 2007 Document&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I use Microsoft Office Word 2007.&nbsp; When I used to save a document, it would save as a "Word 2007 Document", and when I accessed it from my Documents folder I had various options when I would right click it (similar to those of a 97-2003 document).&nbsp; Now,
 when I save a file, it displays as a "DOCX File" in my Documents folder, and the options I previously had upon right clicking the file in the Documents folder are now changed.&nbsp; The icon for all my Word 2007 files has also changed.</p>
<p>Rather than the first option upon right clicking being "Open", and being followed by other options such as "Save As..." (which allowed me to convert file formats right from the folder), now the first option is "Edit".&nbsp; Under Edit is "Open With", and it gives
 me 3 program options of Microsoft Word 2007, Microsoft Open XML Converter (which I have never heard of and cannot find on my computer), and Microsoft Works Word Processor.&nbsp; I can't do the "Save As..." thing anymore, nor some other common options.</p>
<p>All I want to know is how I can restore my existing 2007 Word documents to their original format, as Word 2007 Documents rather than "DOCX File".</p>
<p>Thank you if you can solve this issue!<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
-I have already tried editing the properties, changing the Word Save options within the program, and saving a word file in different formats to try and change the options for all word files.&nbsp; None of these has worked.</p>

            I have alaways backed up my Windows 7 computer to a Flash Drive.&nbsp; Now I am supposed to be able to use Windows 7 Backup in Windows 10 - but it won't continue the backup.&nbsp; Why did you decide I shouldn't backup my computer to a flash drive?&nbsp; The drive is
 always home, it doesn't get thrown around outside, so unless my house burns down, it is safe.&nbsp; If my home burns down, my whole computer, some other backup drive included, is gone!

<p>I'd like to know why I can copy &amp; paste files from file history to a USB Flash Drive but can't copy them directly to the same same flash drive within file history...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files I'm interested in backing up to the flash drive are "favorites, documents, pictures, etc. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I boot up the computer I get a notification that those files have been copied to my hard drive because my F: drive has been disconnected, but I can't find those files using file explorer in C: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll attempt using a CDRW/DVD as you say but getting frustrated that the files I want to find are so hard to find.</p>

            <p>I just attempted backing up files to CDRW/DVD (D: drive) but it's not detected by file history and makes me think contrary to what you suggested - this doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was formatted prior to trying to copy to it and I tried 4 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this back up only possible with a USB external drive connected? &nbsp;If so that's one more disappointment with Windows10...</p>

<p>I do it the same way (find the files, copy &amp; paste to flash drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I share your feeling about not wanting to buy an external drive to back up files... &nbsp;it would seem too much trouble to perform a simple function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running a free windows10 upgrade and understand there are glitches that need worked out. &nbsp;That's why it was released free - to see how it works and find the bugs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not going to give the OS a bad rating because overall it's been an improvement. &nbsp;Don't get me wrong - it's got some very frustrating bugs but MS/Windows support has been great.</p>

            What a moronic feature! I bought flash drives for the express purpose of backing up files to them. I have had bad luck with external hard drives in the past, and thought I was doing the right thing only to find out you idiots have made it impossible. Why
 was this done? Because Microsoft doesn't sell flash drives?

<h2>            Unable to delete a school email account</h2>
                    <p>My wife graduated from school from where she got rights to use Office programs on our home computer. Some of these programs created an account that is named after her school email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After graduation Office didn't work anymore so I removed it from the apps. But the email account stayed and causes a pop up window after starting the laptop saying "some account have problems etc".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if I try to delete the account first control panel guides me to manage that account -&gt; which then redirects it to the schools sign in page. As she isn't a student she doesn't have rights to the schools system anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how how do you delete the account?</p>

<h2>            Wireless Mouse doesn&#39;t work properly</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I am having troubles with my wireless mouse. I have this mouse, it's a Logitech M185 wireless mouse, I received this mouse a year ago and it stopped working yesterday.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to say that, my buttons work, but not the sensor for the mouse to move anywhere; like it's frozen. I searched all over Google and it's always saying to re-sync the mouse (which my mouse can't), to uninstall the driver(didn't work), restart the computer/laptop(still
 didn't work), and Microsoft itself to rollback the new update (same result as uninstalling the driver), also the same reaction when I connect it with another computer, buttons work, but not sensor...<br />
<br />
So, what I'm trying to say is, how do I make my mouse move again, and I repeat: The buttons work, but not the sensor. So what's the solution? Get a new wireless mouse? I'd prefer not to.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>If the problem mouse fails to work properly on two different PCs then it is obviously defective. There is no need to look at mouse drivers, Windows roll-backs or other&nbsp; contortions. Mice do not live forever!</p>

<h2>            Communications Service using a constant 10&#37; of my CPU</h2>
                    It seems that when I have the Mail app open in Windows 8, task manager tells me that 'Communications Service' (also known as livecomm.exe), uses up a constant 10% of my i7 3770k processor. Way too much usage for an idling email app. I don't know when this started happening, but it has not always been doing this. The service also seems to be downloading/uploading something constantly. It used up 3GB yesterday in three hours just sitting there. This is really **** me off. I don't have hours to waste on the phone or chatting with tech support, and Microsoft has removed email support. Somehow I doubt they would understand the problem anyway. Anyone else having problems?

            The same happens for me. I am connected to 3 imap mail accounts with high email traffic in this client. Sometimes this metro app freezes. Loading of mail bodies, marking us unread, deleting is very slow, CPU load is 100% (older Intel Core 2 Duo CPU...
 but anyway ...)

            I had the same problem and i realized that all my 3 imap accounts were set to constantly check for e-mails, and i think because of that the service was consuming the internet way to much. So i changed this option to check every 1 hour and the problem was
 solved.

<p>I have the same problem like the above individual. My home use desktop PC is only 4GB - according to a technician at Fry's Electronics&nbsp; -&nbsp;Window 10 crushed the entire contents and they have to rebuild&nbsp;it - now the problem is, I lost my Microsoft office duly
 purchased from Microsoft.&nbsp;I want you to help restore it using the same IP. </p>

<br />
I am trying to hear audio from a Marine Corps government website in order to conduct online training. Before the training starts, a window appears with a short audio clip and text next to it stating: "if you can't hear this video, you do not have the correct
 version of Windows Media Player" When I click the Windows Media Player icon next to this message in order to download it, the download process starts but then a message appears saying "This version of Windows Media Technologies is incompatible with or has
 been superseded by this version of Windows. For more information, view the information at the Microsoft website." I currently have Windows 7 and the most up to date version of Windows Media Player. Why am I unable to download Windos Media Player 9 Series?

            Windows 7 comes with Windows Media Player 12, it isn't possible to install older versions. If the only problem is with the one website and assuming you are using Internet Explorer, you can try using compatibility mode.<br />

<h2>            This application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin &#34;windows&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So recently I got some adware in my computer and after running a standard battery of anti-virus/adware programs I finally defeated the beast. However, since then my PC has stopped being able to open any Qt based program citing that a plugin was missing.
 I have looked thoroughly through directories and program installs and have not found any DLL's missing for these programs and the list of problem programs includes malwarebytes and EA's Origin client. I have found nearly 10 programs which no longer work so
 I'm inclined to believe this error is to do with windows itself and certain files being corrupt/missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any ideas on how best to resolve this? I have tried running the win10 installer and it encountered and error and failed to reinstall so that option is a no-go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading and hopefully for your answers!<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted with the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If it still does not help, I suggest you to download the <strong>Windows 10 ISO
</strong>and create a Media Creation tool from&nbsp;another computer and then perform Automatic Repair using the same ISO media.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the following link: </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(Refer to the section <strong>Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool&nbsp;</strong>in the above article for creating the tool).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you have the installation media, follow the steps:&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.&nbsp;Start your computer from the installation media. Insert the disk or USB stick and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to
<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>, do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the disk or USB. When you see the
<strong>Install Windows</strong> page, tap or click <strong>Repair your computer </strong>
link to start the <strong>Windows Recovery Environment</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
2.&nbsp;In the Windows Recovery Environment, on the Choose an option screen, click <strong>
Troubleshoot</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
3.&nbsp;Click, <strong>Advanced Options </strong>and then click on <strong>Startup Repair</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
4.&nbsp;After this complete the repair and see if you are able to boot in to your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> There will be no data loss by performing Startup repair. It will format c: driver and reinstall Windows 10. It will remove all the installed apps and updates.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Important: <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You might require to change the <strong>

    <title>Trouble updating gamer picture on website - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hoku kim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble updating gamer picture on website</h2>
                    
<p>Last night I tried updating my gamer picture. It was quite a hassle, and it still isn't showing the correct avatar (8 hours later).</p>
<p>Repro:</p>
<p>1. Sign in to Xbox Live on website.</p>
<p>2. Go to "My Account", then "View Profile", then "Edit My Profile".</p>
<p>3. Go to "Change your gamer pic in the Avatar Editor", then "Gamer Picture".</p>
<p>4. Choose a fun pose and a new background color.</p>
<p>5. Take picture, Save.</p>
<p>6. Wait for "Gamer pic saved successfully".</p>
<p>7. Close message box.</p>
<p>Expected:<br />
1. My new gamer picture updated in the upper right of the screen.<br />
2. My new gamer picture is used in all places on the website.</p>
<p>Actual:<br />
1. My new gamer picture does not display in the upper right of the screen. There is no indication that saving a new gamer picture actually worked, and it looks like it didn't work since I don't see my new gamer picture.<br />
2. Some parts of the website are showing up to&nbsp;2 different gamer pictures on the same page (my profile page): my old old one in one place on the page, and my last one on a different place on the same page, but my new picture is not displayed anywhere.</p>
<p>Viewing my friend's profile who also tried to update his gamer pic, I see two different gamer pics for him as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was a terrible, horrible, frustrating user experience for me.</p>

If this does not resolve it, then retake your Gamerpic after clearing your Xbox Memory cache in the Settings tab on the Xbox LIVE Dashboard and it should update on here. Please report back if these two solutions do not work. Best of luck!<br />

<p>1. When I got to My Account on xbox.com, I see a different gamer picture than the one I saved. When I view my profile on xbox.com, I see two different gamer pictures on the same page!</p>
<p>2. How is a normal user supposed to know that saving a picture on xbox.com actually worked when the pictures on xbox.com aren't updated to the saved picture.</p>
<p>3. How is a normal user supposed to know that a picture is saved one place and not another.</p>
<p>4. How is a normal user supposed to know that he/she then has to change the public gamer picture on the Xbox 360 itself.</p>
<p>5. Why is the entire process so complicated and convoluted.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you follow my instructions in the above post, you will find the Gamerpic you took on Xbox.com and be able to have it appear to everyone. On Xbox LIVE you have a Gamerpicture, which everyone can see and a Personal Picture, which
 only your friends list can see. Creating a Gamerpic on Xbox.com only adds to it the Personal Picture. However you can go onto your Xbox and make it viewable to everyone. Here is a breakdown on what to do.</span><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you are can access Edit Profile on your Xbox, then do the following:<br />

<p>I don't care so much for the answer to "how do I make this work?" My concern is that the experience of making this work is a horrible one (on the website, as the title of this thread indicates).</p>
<p>I hope someone over there recognizes how frustrating it is when things don't just work the way a common user would expect them to and how convoluted the steps are to do something as simple as update a gamer picture.</p>
<p>I hope some there over there understands that a common user doesn't know that there are multiple gamer pictures, for which the website only changes one of them but then you have to use your Xbox console to change the other. That makes no sense at all.</p>
<p>I appreciate your response. Please send my concerns to whoever designed this whole mess and maybe they will be able to come up with a better way do all this.</p>

<p>A customer tells you that he's concerned about a very bad user experience. And your repsponse is, "patience is a virtue"?
</p>
<p>:(</p>
<p>How about acknowledgement that this is a frustrating experience and you'll take action to get some resolution for it?</p>
<p>How about a message box after updating the gamer pic or some kind of visual indication that it'll take up to 48 hours? That'd a simple compromise until you can build a system that doesn't take 48 hours to copy a file :p</p>

 find it and select it so everyone can see. It is not that much of a frustrating experience though and you're welcome.</span><br />

<p>Really sorry about that, hokuna matata. Mister Barakus was simply stating that sometimes your gamerpic can take a little bit of time to prop and I want to reassure you that it was in no way intended to discount your experience.<br />

                    Hi,
<div><br />
When I login to my windows 7 laptop, I am greeted witht eh message that the explorerframe.dll file is missing and that it needs to be replaced.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If i click OK, all I can see is a blank desktop screen (no folders, no start menu, just the blank background image).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, I don't have an OS CD/DVD. I have read that loading this is a recommended way to solve this error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm wondering whether there are any other work arounds?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried system restore via holding down f8 on bootup, but always receive the message that system restore did not complete successfully, and that it "failed to replace the file (D:\Program Files\Windows Sidebar\ Gadgets\ Norton.Gadget\en.us\gadget(17).css)
 with its original copy from the restore point.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be greatly appreciated,&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks, Al.</div>

    <title>Windows 8.1 Code 31 for Portable Devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnnylight416  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Code 31 for Portable Devices</h2>
                    <p>I've recently had an issue with a code 31 appearing for all of my devices under portable devices. It seems the culprit is the WPD FileSystem Volume Driver, but I can't seem to find out how to reinstall that particular driver. The error appears on all internal
 hard drives connected to my Marvell controller (I have a Z77X-UD5H motherboard), and my Nexus 5. All the devices have seen the error for a few days, but have continued to work. Today, I plugged in my phone and my computer didn't see it. It sees that there's
 an MTP USB Device, and it recognizes it as a Nexus 5 under Other Devices in device manager. But, it says Code 31 for all portable devices. The hard drives still run as expected, but show the error code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Current devices that show Code 31 in Device Manager</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nexus 5 phone as "MTP USB Device"</p>
<p>Hitachi 3TB internal hard drive as "WPD FileSystem Volume Driver"</p>
<p>Seagate ST320006 2TB hard drive as "WPD FileSystem Volume Driver"</p>
<p>Seagate ST3000DM 3TB hard drive as "WPD FileSystem Volume Driver"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most recent change to hardware has been adding a CPU fan about a month ago, and after my reinstall of windows I installed two 3TB Hitachi hard drives, one of which is seeing the error. The other is connected to the other SATA controller on my motherboard,
 as is my OS drive. I've also recently used bitlocker to encrypt all of my drives, but again, this error had already appeared prior to any of this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched online for ways to fix this the past few days. Editing the registry to remove upper and lower limits did not help. Nor has anything else suggested on posts I've found.</p>
<p>I did a clean reinstall of windows 8.1 on my computer within the past week in the hopes that it may solve this problem. It has not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've downloaded the most recent versions of all motherboard drivers (a Gigabyte Z77X-UD5H rev 1.1).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reinstalling Google USB driver has not helped see my Nexus 5.</p>
<p>Uninstalling and reinstalling Marvell drivers twice over has not had an effect.</p>
<p>Uninstalling all devices via Device Manager and restarting has not helped.</p>
<p>Windows Update has had it's way and installed everything it's wanted, including all optional updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really I think reinstalling the WPD FileSystem Volume Driver may fix the issue, but I can't figure out if there's a way to do that. At this point I'm looking at doing a Windows Refresh, but given that a clean install didn't clear the codes, I'm not sure
 that will fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I forgot to mention I also ran windows Troubleshooter, which recognized that yes, a driver was down, and yes, reinstalling it would help, but it failed to actually reinstall the driver or fix the problem.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Johnny,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span><span>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I can understand the inconvenience caused to you. I will certainly help you with this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A<strong> Code 31</strong> error is generated in Device Manager in one of the following situations:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Device Manager can't start the device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b) </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c) Device Manager has insufficient information to recognize the error that is bubbled up by the device driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It seems that there are still some corrupted drivers existing in the device manager. Let’s work together to get this problem resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps to <strong>uninstall all the hidden drivers for USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller
</strong>and restart the computer. Let the Windows install the generic drivers and then see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, click on <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow.</strong></em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Command prompt Window will be open.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. At the command prompt, type the following lines, pressing <strong>Enter
</strong>after each line:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1 </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>cd\ %SystemRoot% \System32 </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>start devmgmt.msc <br />
</strong><br />
4. Device manager Window will open.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. Click on <strong>show hidden devices</strong> under View menu Tab.</span><strong><br />
<span><br />
</span></strong><span>6. Expand all the nods under device manager</span><span><span><strong>.<br />
<br />
</strong>7. There would be many greyed out entries in device manager <strong>uninstall all the greyed out entries
</strong>under all the nods and then restart the computer<strong>. </strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>8. In the list of hardware categories, find and expand&nbsp;<strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>9. <strong>Right-click</strong> on every device under the Universal Serial Bus controllers node, and then click&nbsp;on
<strong>Uninstall</strong>&nbsp;to remove them one at a time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>10. Restart the computer. On restart, Windows will re-install the generic drivers automatically.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>11. Plug in the removable USB device and then test to make sure that the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would also suggest you to update the BIOS from the manufacturer website and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><em>Important: </em></strong><em>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft

            <p>It's a custom built computer. Specs are as follows</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gigabyte Z77X-UD5H motherboard</p>
<p>3770K processor</p>
<p>GTX780 GPU</p>
<p>32GB RAM</p>
<p>4 Internal hard drives (3 of which are showing the code 31 under portable devices, but appear fine under the disk drives node in Device manager. I've looked into it and only the hard drives attached to the Marvell SATA controller on the motherboard show
 up as portable drives)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've uninstalled all greyed out items in device manager, but I can't uninstall all of the items under USB controllers since I use both a USB keyboard and a USB mouse, and the motherboard does not have a PS/2 input for older keyboards/mice. There has been
 no change. All affected internal drives show a Code 31 and are listed as "WPD FileSystem Volume Driver" in the Portable Devices node in Device Manager, and my phone shows up as "MTP USB Device", still with a code 31.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But regardless, I'm not sure how uninstalling USB controllers would help. Some of the items that show a code 31 are SATA drives connected internally, not USB drives. But as I've said, the main issue is still that my phone is not seen by my computer when
 connected and showing a Code 31 under portable devices when connected.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{eec5ad98-8080-425f-922a-dabf3de3f69a}</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>At that registry key, in the right window, is there a "Name"<em> UpperFilters</em> and/or
<em>LowerFilters</em>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, what is "Data" for those Names?</p>

            <p>I have the latest modified BIOS found here:&nbsp;http://forums.tweaktown.com/gigabyte/48085-gigabyte-modified-bios.html. I'd upgraded to this modified BIOS in an effort to fix the problem, prior I had the latest official beta BIOS, F15q. The Code 31s appeared
 months after installing that. I just tried reinstalling F15q, and there's no change.

            There's only an entry for UpperFilters, with data "WpdUpFltr". Prior to posting I'd followed a lead that said to delete the UpperFilters registry entry and restart, and that didn't work either.

            <p>I've found the fix. Apparently Intel Management Engine did two bad installs, the first before I reinstalled windows, then again after (and I think possibly again when I tried to reinstall it). But for whatever reason, when I reinstalled IME this time, it
 worked and has stuck. Have no idea what might have caused it to do bad installs before, or what might've corrupted the installs afterwards, but I'm no longer getting code 31s for my hard drives and my phone is recognized in file explorer now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do however have a code 43 for one of my USB devices (shows up as "Unknown USB Device (Link in Compliance Mode). Something tells me this'll be easier for me to figure out on my own.</p>

            <p>Hi Johnny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue and sorry for delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have reinstalled the whole Operating System again, it has repaired all the system files and corruption which was causing problem in the working of IME (&nbsp;Intel Management Engine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>System repair and reinstallation of the system is the last troubleshooting step which resolves most of the issue. It happens the same way in your case too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to that feel free to post on the forum if you have any more concern related to Windows, we will be more than happy to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

    <title>After Windows 10 Upgrade PC&#39;s fan runs nonstop and is causing my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janetst.onge  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Windows 10 Upgrade PC&#39;s fan runs nonstop and is causing my laptop to overheat&#59; desktop icons got duplicated.</h2>
                    <p>I had Windows 7 and upgraded the Windows 7 driver.&nbsp; After I did that, all of my program icons made a duplicate icon.&nbsp; One would work and one was frozen to the desktop.&nbsp; Some icons don't work at all, but work from the start up bar.&nbsp; Word document icons are
 frozen to the desktop and won't move or open.&nbsp; In an attempt to resolve this, I downloaded Windows 10.&nbsp; It not only did not correct the issue but now my fan runs nonstop and is causing my laptop to overheat.&nbsp; If I do a recovery back to Windows 7, it says I
 will lose some programs and would have to reload them.&nbsp; Any idea on why the fan is running since the upgrade and what I should do?&nbsp; Also, any help with the icon issue would be appreciated.</p>

    <title>Hitman - 2 Final Chapters Bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the_gimlet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hitman - 2 Final Chapters Bug</h2>
                    <div>I am playing a disc version of <strong>Hitman Definitive Edition</strong> on the Xbox One. I cannot access the last 2 chapters, no matter what I try. When I install the disc I get the game, the first 4 chapters, patient zero and a load of bonus content;
 but no mention of the final 2 chapters at all.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>I have already searched forums and followed several proposed solutions to this (deleting, reinstalling, ensuring all updates are installed, ensuring the game is installed before the chapters etc. etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now fully deleted and reinstalled it 10+ times, trying different suggestions each time.<br />
</p>
</div>
<div>If I try to access these chapters in game I am take to a screen where it says it/they are not for sale.<br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have even paid extra for the <span><strong>Game of the Year Edition Upgrade</strong>, hoping that this would add the chapters; but all it does is add the legacy upgrades without the chapters themselves.<br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<p><span>Please can someone suggest a solution (other than the ones described above)?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This seems like an XBOX Store issue, but they do not accept support requests about games from publishers other than Microsoft. I have contacted IOI, no response, but cannot find contact details for Square Enix.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Appreciate this is an old game but would have thought that would mean all bugs would have been fixed by now.</span></p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try uninstalling, Clearing local saved games ( don't worry you won't lose anything its all saved to the cloud) Then power cycle the console before installing again. Also check in games and apps under the game itself if you click manage game, They may be
 available downloads there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the two chapters that you are missing? And when you go to the game's DLC management section do you see each chapter individually installed or is all of the content for this edition group in one installation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the content for the definitive edition should be installed from the disc unless there was a code you had to redeem for any of the content. From what I can see of the digital version of the Game of the Year edition, everything including the final 2
 episodes should have been installed with your edition. Where did you buy the disc?</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks I will try them too. All chapters apart from Colorado and Hokkaido install fine, including a load of bonus content that doesn't require redeem codes. Those two chapters aren't mentioned apart from in game where you can "buy" them, except clicking
 through just takes you to the xbox store where it says they aren't available for sale.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have sen that this was a common fault with earlier versions of the game, tried all solutions people were using but I am nevet even offered the chance to install them.</p>

<h2>            C&#58; Drive does not appear in Disk Defragmenter after upgrading to Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>My C: drive does not appear in my disk defragmenter after upgrading from a 64-bit Windows Vista version to a 32-bit Windows 7 version. I had to do a custom installation since it went from 64 to 32-bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I try to configure a schedule or defrag in general, my HP Recovery shows up and my backup drive but not my main C: drive</p>
<p>What is the reason for this and how can I fix it?</p>

<h2>            Alarms &#38; Clock Not Working</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have an issue with the Alarms &amp; Clock app. Basically, when I try to start timer the app closes itself. When I reopen it, the timer is on and ticking down, but the notification never sounds at the end. It just runs itself out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What exactly can I do to fix this?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A reset of the app should help. To do this, open Settings - click the gear icon left-most column the Start menu. The click Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features. Scroll down and click Alarms &amp; Clock &gt; Advanced options &gt; reset button. Restart Alarms &amp; Clock to see if the
 issue is resolved.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did this, but it has not fixed my problem. The app still decides to close, but continues counting in the background - only for it not to sound at the end of the alarm.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards, </p>
