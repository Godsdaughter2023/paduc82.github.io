<h2>            Installshield Wizard was interrupted before &#91;program&#93; could be installed.</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to install a USB Driver to connect to a PBX system. The install exe extracts an msi and runs it. The msi always gets most of the way through the installation then "rolls back" the installation and shows the error:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Installshield Wizard was interrupted before [program] could be completely installed.</p>
<p>Your system has not been modified. To complete installation at another time, please run setup again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on Windows 8.1 Pro x64. When researching this issue, almost all occurrences date back to a problem caused by Windows XP SP2. I have tried every fix that I have found but none have worked. I have all startup items and non-microsoft services disabled
 and the issue still persists.</p>

            I have have already tried all of those suggestions with no success. I ended up connecting to the PBX system over the building's network but I would still like to know how to get the USB driver to install.

            Hi anderson115
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on an OEM licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new PC, if it is OEM it will not . .. 
<br />
<br />If you do have a Retail Licence, on a weekday, have your product key at hand and contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Choose a local Phone Number:

            It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.
<br />
<br />	If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a OEM preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is NOT transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	Learn more about transferring your license:

<br />
<br />If its a retail license, learn how to reactivate:
<br /><a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/activate-windows-10-license-microsoft-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/activate-window...</a>
<br />
<br />You could try chatting with support agent and explain the situation in detail and they might be able to activate it. We were able to confirm with Microsoft under some circumstances, OEM licenses can be reactivated even under the free upgrade offer. Its not guaranteed every support agent will do it though, but you can try your luck.
<br />
<br />Microsoft's view is, as long as you are not abusing the license, you should get a pass.

<h2>            Polish language pack installation failure</h2>
                    Hi I've encountered a problem during installation of polish language pack on my fresh win8 copy which was
<u>not</u> updated from win7.<br />
<br />
I tried to install it several times using 3 methods: <br />
- standard method (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2607607" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a>) [it says 'the following updates were not installed: Polish Language Pack - Windows 8 for x64-based Systems - (KB2607607)']<br />
- using LPKSetup.exe<br />
- using dism command in command prompt (admin) (<span> <span>dism /online /add-package /packagepath:<i>path_to_.cab_file</i>)<br />
but none of those woked for me.<br />
<br />
I also used </span></span>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth which turned out to be pointless.<br />
<br />
Installation stops at about 30% and dism shows me this error number:&nbsp; 0x80092004 (in log file: Error in operation: (null) (CBS HRESULT=0x80092004) - CCbsConUIHandler::Error)<br />
<br />
I am able to provide you that dism log if needed.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Tom.<br />

<h3> slyboyseth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updates Not Working No Matter What I Do</h2>
                    
<p>So about a few days ago, after I was done playing a game and decided to save and quit, Xbox Live suddenly asked for an update so I said yes and let it try updating, but it wouldn't update. After trying a few more times, I decided to just call it quits and
 try again in the morning. But upon finding the problem kept persisting even then, I ended up trying the methods listed, but none of them worked, not even downloading the update on a USB flash drive!</p>
<p>And besides that, my profile and my system database on my console (not my hard drive, everything there is perfectly fine) are corrupted, so whenever I try deleting them and restarting the update, the update fails and the corrupted items come back! I also
 can't put the corrupted items on the USB flash drive to delete because the drive isn't configured. And I can't do that because it requires me to go onto Xbox Live to do so, which I can't do because the updates keep failing! And worse now is that I accidentally
 deleted my working profile because my corrupted one wouldn't delete!</p>
<p>And to top it all off, this is on an Xbox 360 E that I just got earlier this year! It's brand new and I haven't even installed the Kinect to it yet!</p>

<p><strong>Modem Brand and Model Number: Xbox 360 E (Number: Clarify please)<br />
Router Brand and Model Number: (Again, clarify please)<br />
Wired or Wireless connection: Wired<br />
Update Error Message: "Can't process the update."</strong><br />
<strong>Update Error Code (6 sets of 4 digits/letters each):</strong> 4168-4174-1380-267F-C000-0185 (before flash drive); 4168-4174-1600-267F-C000-0185 (after flash drive)<br />
<strong>What you've tried:</strong> Solutions 1-5 didn't work; not bothering with solutions 6 and 7 since they have nothing to do with the problem and solution 8 doesn't have the error codes I have. At all.</p>

            <p>Hey there Sly! I'm sorry to hear about the update troubles. Let's see what we can do to get things sorted.<br /><br /><strong>To start things off, here's a few questions for you to help us better understand the situation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Which system database are you referring to that is not your hard drive?</li>
<li>Where exactly are the corrupted files stored?</li>
<li>Which troubleshooting steps have you tried, specifically?</li>
<li>Do you have a friend or family member who lives nearby that can let you try downloading the update from their house?</li>
</ol>
<p><br />At first glance, it sounds like the hard drive might be on it's way out. Before we jump to that conclusion however, hit us back with the answers to those questions and we'll be standing by to hear back from you. =)</p>

<p>2. It's the memory unit that has the corrupted files. The memory unit has about 4GB of memory (this is the Xbox 360 E that came with a kinect and a free game with it), and 2.3MB of it is the corrupted file that keeps coming back and the content cache containing
 60KB that switches between corrupted and uncorrupted on its own accord.</p>
<p>But other than that, my main problem is still the fact that my Xbox 360 cannot update. Like I said, I only found the corrupted files after that.</p>
<p>3. In order from solutions 1-5: </p>
<p>I tried restarting and updating several times through Xbox Live and got the first error code I listed above.</p>
<p>I deleted some of the unneeded items I had and I still got the first error code.</p>
<p>I cleared the system cache and I still got the error code and now I can't even get my title updates the same way.</p>
<p>I took out the hard drive and put it back in and it still got the error code (after that I discovered I had corrupted files in the Xbox's memory unit, NOT the hard drive).</p>
<p>And I tried uploading the update from a USB drive but I instead got the second error code several times.</p>
<p>I'm not bothering with solutions 6 and 7 because I know the internet works fine and I don't need to disconnect or disable anything to do so. Plus, my father's confident the problem isn't the internet either.</p>
<p>Solution 8 isn't of any help either due to the fact it doesn't have any of the error codes I have listed on it. So I had to go with solution 9.</p>
<p>4. No, I'm the only one with a 360 and there's no one I know in town that has one. I'm very much on my own here.</p>
<p>I'd like to clarify that my hard drive, which has about 50.6GB of game data, 6.2GB of system data and 3MB of avatar items out of 236 GB left, is completely uncorrupted. My memory unit, not my hard drive, is the one with the corrupted profile and the content
 cache that switches between corrupted and uncorrupted.</p>

            <p>Hey again Sly! Thanks for all that information you provided! That was very helpful in figuring out what's going on.<br /><br />The 4gb of internal memory that you're referring to is just flash memory. It comes standard with the unit type that you purchased and that's where the issue seems&nbsp;to lie. It appears that the memory is on the way out and is corrupted. When you try to install the update (by downloading it or by USB drive) it automatically tries to install the update to the 4gb flash memory (since it's the default storage device). Unfortunately, since the memory is corrupted, the update gives you an error code.<br /><br />The best course of action would be to send the console in for a repair. You can head over to the <a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/Pages/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Online Service Center</a> to get that started or you can use the <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a> page to

<p>Just one last question, Mister Cerb.</p>
<p>By removing any games, do you mean just disc-based games that are in the 360's tray or games I've downloaded from Xbox Live before the problem?</p>

<p>That's great and all.</p>

<p>416B-000-0080-0300-8007-045D.</p>
<p>Now not only am I not able to get a proper update thanks to a corrupted profile and internal memory, I can't bloody download the update to start with at all! I'm starting to get pretty sick of making my Xbox worse now, so I'm just going to send the console

            <p>Error code, <strong>8007 045D</strong>, is indeed pointing to an issue with a corrupted storage device.</p>
<p>Before sending your console in for repair, maybe you might consider to format the internal flash memory, as long as this unit doesn't show as "unformatted".</p>
<p>If you consider this as an option, don't forget to move contents you wish to save to a different storage device.</p>

            HI, Jared Frye
<br />
<br />Angel.I’m  Independent Advisor
<br />
<br />
<br />If Windows 10 has issues or is not working as expected, you can perform a repair upgrade to fix the problem. Performing this can repair broken operating system files while preserving your personal files, settings and installed applications.
<br />
<br />When you download the .ISO file, you can start the upgrade by simply double clicking the .ISO file to mount it.
<br />
<br />You can download the latest .ISO file available for Windows 10 from this link:

<p>So you computer is stuck at 64% and keeps restarting </p>
<p>
</p><p>do not under stand why you want to get into you bios if the issue centre around being stuck at 64 percent so I am going to guess you need access to your dvd drive if so just press F11 key as the computer restarts and keep press until the options screen appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>now if you want to get into your bios its usually the del or F2 key and it not a matter of pressing 3 times you must keep pressing while the computer is restarting until the bios screen appears even when you have UFEI enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now being stuck at 64% wont be fix by entering your bios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can try boot into advanced option screen for repairs by&nbsp;Pressing F8 key and keep pressing as the computer starts up until it gives you option screen this may take a few restarts in the process if it does not work the first time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>your best choose is going into the safe mode with networking and give that ago see if it helps otherwise get out your dvd of Windows 10 if you have one and use the dvd to do a scan of the disk to see if there is a hard disk sector issue and or some corruption
 going on and proceed from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the reset of Windows 10 being stuck at 64% and restarting if I remember correctly this happens with a reset to reconfigure the setup of hard ware its does this between 3 to 5 times then proceed to hang for&nbsp;a long period of time before the count jumps
 to something like 73 to 78% before it repeat restart a number of times and goes into another pause jumps up to 85% percent then quickly counts to 91% your screen flashes a number of time then it counts up to 98% percent takes a pause then 99% 100 % then sits
 there until it decides when it wants to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now this does not mean your computer has not encounter a issue as there is little information to go on about how long this has occurred and how many times its restarted and or if the process starts from scratch and counts back up to 64 %.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also did not give much of a back ground as to why you reset Windows 10 so we could determine if you had hardware installation issue or a software installation problem that could be causing the reset of Windows 10 to become stuck at 64%.</p>
<p>

            Hi Jared,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Let us try repairing the existing OS.
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>

<br />
<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help, consider doing a clean install after rescuing your files.

                    <p>Just got Windows 8.1. Was able to use it with a wireless mouse and keyboard. Because my husband has low vision, we looked at using the on screen keyboard. Decided against it but when we tried to type with the regular keyboard, it would not. I have now completely
 disabled the on screen keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can enter the password by holding down the shift key for the count of 8 and then I can type it in;however, when I go to type on anything after that, I cannot - not on a word document, website, etc.</p>

<h2>            I need help with getting the right settings to use EPIC emr for hospital rounds using surface go</h2>
                    <p>Any suggestions for the following issues are appreciated.</p>
<p>1. When I log in through the hospital network I get disconnected when the PC goes to sleep or if I close the typecover. I need at least15 minutes per encounter and average about 20 encounters or more per day. I chat with them, stop for about 5 minutes ,
 put my PC in my labcoat pocket , examine patient and then come back and am already logged out. So far I have just been using onenote2016 to jot down thing then cut and paste and delete later but I would like to type write into the EMR system and be completely
 done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I need to figure out how I can log in and type in the EMR program without using the type cover and just using the touch keyboard. Often theres not any surface for me to set things down . When I open the touch keyboard it keeps closing after each character</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Baby doctor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will have to check different settings to understand why your Surface Go performs this way. To address the first issue, let's review the current power settings. Refer to these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> (<strong>Windows key </strong>+ <strong>I</strong>, or click on
<strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong>).</li><li>Go to <strong>System</strong> and choose <strong>Power &amp; sleep</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Network connection</strong>, make sure the option for <strong>When my PC is asleep and on battery power, disconnect from the network</strong> is set to
<strong>Never</strong>. If Never is selected, it will not terminate the Surface's connection to the network even when it enters sleep mode.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Next, let's work on the problem with the touch keyboard. First, make sure that the touch keyboard button is available in the taskbar. This will make it easier for you to launch the touch keyboard when you need it. Just right-click on the taskbar, then select
<strong>Show touch keyboard button</strong>. If it's selected, it would have a check mark right next to it on the list. Then, let's configure the Tablet mode settings. Follow the instructions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>From <strong>Settings</strong>, go to <strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Tablet mode</strong>.</li><li>For the second item, <strong>When this device automatically switches tablet mode on or off</strong>, choose
<strong>Always ask me before switching</strong>. If this is applied, the Surface will always prompt you if you like to switch to tablet mode or exit this mode when the Type Cover is flipped all the way to the back of the tablet, and when it is positioned normally.
 Make sure that you always answer the prompt with <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>
No</strong> so the Surface will apply the necessary changes when you switch modes. Remember that in tablet mode, the primary input will be the touchscreen and touch keyboard. If the device was not instructed to enter tablet mode, it will assume that the Type
 Cover is in full use.</li><li>You can also apply <strong>Don't ask me and always switch</strong>, which will allow the Surface to automatically switch to tablet mode whenever you flip the Type Cover, then go back to normal mode when the Type Cover is placed normally.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In case none of the solutions work, please <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">install and run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong>
 to check for possible software issues that could be affecting your device's performance. It will also make sure that you have the recommended driver and firmware updates.After running the tool, perform a forced shutdown by pressing the power button for 10
 seconds or until the screen goes off. When you restart the Surface, the update/s will be applied and the software will be reloaded properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to experience the problem, please let me know by responding to this post. I will get back to your the soonest I can so we can continue working towards a resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab - click<br />
Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL - REBOOT
<br />
this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose cable or<br />
slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
Hope these help and Happy Holidays!<br />

<h2>            Run a python script using Task Scheduler</h2>
                    I have searched google for an answer to how to do this, and none of the solutions have worked. I am using windows 7 and python 3.7. I would like a simple explanation of what to type in the 3 spaces in the action tab of the task properties. The other solutions
 generally take forever to run, throw up an error message, or tell me that the task was successful, but I can tell that the script was never started.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Is it the built in Movie Maker tool or Windows Live Movie Maker?</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentione below:</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p>Run System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files and check if the issue occurs.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Follow the steps in the link:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p>If the above step fails
<span>perform system restore to undo the changes on system, when everything was working fine. Follow the steps in the link:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions</a></p>
<p><b>Method 3</b>:</p>
<p>If the above step fails create new user account and check if the issue occurs. Follow the steps in the link:</p>

<p>If you are using Windows live movie maker. I would suggest you to post your query in Windows live movie maker community. Please visit the link below to find a community that will

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            It is the built in MovieMaker. I did the first step and there were no corrupt files. I just noticed a message that the Data Execution Program turned it off--around 23 minutes into it. I tried to change it for MovieMaker and got a message that I cannot
 change it for the program. Step two won't help because I have not used MovieMaker for about a year and have no idea when this problem occurred. I did download MovieMakerLive awhile ago. I don't know if that makes a difference. I tried importing with Window
 Photo Gallery and the same thing happened so something is going on with Windows, not necessarily MovieMaker. Again, NEVER have had a problem like this.

<h3> rreptile  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help me with my internet connection</h2>
                    <p>For the past few months or so I have had an annoying problem of my internet working very irregularly. If I close my laptop (asus k55v) and then open it again I will lose connection again and not be able to connect until I leave the laptop open for a couple
 of hours. Because of this very frustrating issue, I leave my laptop open &nbsp;at all times... This usually results in me being able to connect whenever I go on it, in fact connection can be fine for almost a period of 3 weeks. Then suddenly I get the same issue
 that I have when I initially open my laptop in give first place: I can't connect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>During this issue my connection icon will give me no indication there is anything wrong. I will then load a website and then get a message from my explorer saying the page can't load and at that point my connection icon will say limited access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't identify what problem there is aside from the fact I have limited connection. I have trawled through dozens of forums where solutions say things like restart your router, bridge connections, set internet protocol to obtain ip + DNS automatically,
 disable firewall... None of these things have helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if someone could at least tell me what the problem is even if there's no damn solution (hopefully there is) I will eternally grateful.</p>

<h3> waquoitwonder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Should I&#47;how do I  uninstall my windows 7 enterprise software&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP elitebook 8460p laptop purchased from my former employer. About six months after leaving the company, the laptop began displaying "windows not genuine" error message. The tech department at my former employer tells me that the OS software on
 the machine is Windows Enterprise and because the machine has not communicated with the network, the software cannot be validated by the administrator or something to that effect. I cannot download anything &nbsp;- because I am not the administrator for the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are my options? The software is genuine but will not operate properly. Do I need to uninstall the current windows 7 enterprise software on the machine? If so, how do I do this? And will I now have to purchase a new copy of windows 7? Is there any way
 to "override" the enterprise restrictions and remove the former employer as administrator?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts? Suggestions?</p>

            <p>You have some options here and its up to you which one you want to exercise:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Option 1</strong>, try using the recovery partition if its still functional and reset the machine back to its original factory state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<p>
</p><p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>
</p><p>--------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Because your system was running Windows 7 Enterprise, the computer might have been reimaged with a corporate image which made the recovery partition non-functional.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Option 2</strong>, request recovery media from the manufacturer of your computer and use that to reinstall Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because it was reimaged using Windows 7 Enterprise, it must have been running a valid premium business SKU (edition) of Windows 7 prior to being upgraded, in this case, Windows 7 Professional. Windows 7 Enterprise requires this as part of its licensing requirement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can confirm it was running Windows 7 Professional which still has support until January 14th 2020. So there is no need to really rush to Windows 8.1 and you can hold out and upgrade to Windows 10 Pro when that becomes available later this year.</p>
<p>

</p><p><strong>About Windows 7 Enterprise:</strong></p>
<span>
<p>Your copy of Windows 7 is using KMS licensing, which requires that it reactivates the license every 180 days (6 months) by connecting to the KMS Host. The KMS Host is usually hosted on the Domain at your work place where the license was issued. Reactivation
 can be done by authenticating on the domain at work (log in) or VPN into your Network.
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Note that if you purchase the licenses this way, the perpetual licenses are your
<em>company’s</em> property, as it should be. When staff leaves, you can ask them to uninstall the software, and even if they don’t, you can restore them to your inventory if they have been activated with Microsoft’s Key Management Service. Since the departed
 staff should no longer have access to your network and therefore to your KMS server, the software will stop working on the home machines after 180 days and the license can then be redeployed elsewhere in your organization. Even under HUP this is still the
 case: when they leave, they are to uninstall their rented software, although the burden is not put on the company to confirm this.

    <title>Windows 10 version 1607 update freezes at 95&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bert22306  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 version 1607 update freezes at 95&#37;</h2>
                    <p>Another monthly update, more evidence of Microsoft's new-found incompetence. As of the last two updates I installed on Windows 10 version 1511, and all of the updates of version 1607 (which I installed as soon as it became available), not a single one of
 these has gone smoothly. Not one. In all the years I've been using Windows, this level of continued incompetence is new, is it not? I never previously had to make an issue of updates. They would take a few minutes to install, end of story.&nbsp;Now, they are ALWAYS
 an issue. Always have to dedicate hours to the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's bad enough that the UI does not show the download progress accurately, but I now go to Task Manager, to see if anything is happening at all. Nothing. Sometimes, Microsoft finds it okay to saturate my DSL line 100%, for long periods of time. This time,
 it just sits at 95% complete and goes catatonic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will someone at Microsoft take it upon himself to hire competent help, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: The computer sat idle for just under 2 hours, after the download had reached 95%, no activity at all, and suddenly the download completed. Rebooting installed the updates with no further drama.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any excuse for this behavior, every single time Windows 10 gets any update (other than just Defender updates)? Why has this become the new normal? Is it on purpose, for some sort of "download optimization" excuse?</p>

            Same problem, BUT with a very cool twist.
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Mine is struck, and I mean dead stuck, at 45%. And the best part is that it's cutting into my relaxing computer time, I have a Happauge TV card running WinTV (because they&nbsp;ditched the BEST TV player ever...media center)&nbsp;that&nbsp;just this evening started to&nbsp;stutter
 every now and then and just stopped with an unknown error. Well it turns out that this "update"&nbsp;started downloading,<strong> even though I have my busy hours set from 1PM to 1AM</strong>, and it&nbsp;caused my WinTV to just crash!! And now I'm afraid to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now, for no apparent reason,&nbsp;the update is stopped at 45%, going no place doing nothing just sitting there..</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;There MUST be a better way to do this. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I really believe in Windows 10, I bought it rather then getting it free, BUT I want to be warned about "major" updates and CHOOSE when to install them myself. There has got to be a better way.</p>

            Nothing other than the monitor and audio system. I deliberately tried this update when nothing else was going on. But don't think it's the first time. This is the new normal for all Microsoft updates. It's actually the cumulative updates that it gets stuck
 on, every time. All the other updates, and all the Dell device driver or BIOS updates, work fine.

            <p>I was asked to provide an update, but I have no update. Look and see how many people reported the same problem, and does anyone provide an answer? No.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been a problem for many months. The Windows 10 cumulative updates, after the first few months of Win10 updates, have become a real hassle. I find myself having to leave the computer on throughout the night, although I have it configured to shut
 off after 2 hours, and next day, the update is still not complete. I get the computer out of sleep mode, and have to wait another long while for this to end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IO thought at first, this is just a really huge update. But when it kept happening, and I investigated into the problem with Task Manager, no. They aren't all huge updates. Just updates that are incompetently set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get that most people just let Microsoft do its own thing, and never pay attention to updates, but I prefer to get them installed and know everything is running right. Would be nice if Microsoft made this possible again. Where are your good coders, Microsoft?
 Have they all jumped ship? It's incredibly frustrating to see everyone complain about the same thing, and Microsoft out there like a deer in the headlights.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update Diagnostic Error&#58; RC_DataStore 0x80070057 &#40;SOLVED&#33;&#41;</h2>
                    <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong><br />
<br />
In a brand new installation of Windows 8.1 (fully formatting the only harddrive present on the computer, which is worth mentioning it is a new SSD disk). I then proceed to update the system via Windows Update before installing any third-party program at all.
 Worth noting: Windows Update installed the april update KB2919355 successfully, with no apparent problem. Then, once I reboot the machine, Windows Update shows me some new updates, which I accept to download and install. Apparently they were successfully installed
 and it kindly asks me to restart. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing so, (OHHH SO FRUSTRATING) I can not open Windows Update anymore. Two things happen:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) When I try to open Windows Update it immediately closes the window, leaving me at the windows desktop with no notice at all.</p>
<p>2) After trying to restart the PC several times and repeatedly open Windows Update, on the Windows Update window SOMETIMES I get a blank screen with an animated-circle-dots icon (suggesting that something is "Loading"?) but actually nothing happens ... I
 have left it for hours there and it would not go over that white screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would cycle through those two behaviours randomly. No patterns I could identify.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>WHAT HAVE I DONE TO TRY TO FIX THIS:</strong><br />
<br />
I visited several official Microsoft KB web pages, forums, third party blog posts trying to solve this issues and have never come to a solution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I have tried:<br />
<br />
<strong>1) Install the Windows Update Diagnostic:</strong> (also known as "Microsoft Fix It"? dumb name BTW) (see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2714434) I run the app and I proceed carefully following the steps. It does her thing and concludes this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problems Found:<br />
</p>
<p>- Service Registration is missing or corrupt (Fixed)<br />
- Windows Update Error 0x80070057 (2014-12-11-T-01-01-39) Fixed)<br />
- Problems installing latest updates (Fixed)</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Then I see an interesting option that says "View details". I click there and then click on "Detection Details" and I can see the following which seems to indicate where the problem is:</em><br />
<br />
Error report:<br />
Root Cause: RC_DataStore<br />
ErrorCode: 0x80070057<br />
Detected Time: 11/12/2014-T-01: 01: 39<br />
<br />
Collected File:<br />
File name: CheckSURLog.cab <em>(this is actually a link to the file, but when I click, it tells me that the file does not exist. Which is odd, but anyways... moving on)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Service Status:<br />
Problem with Bits Service: The requested service has already been started. You can get more help with the command NET HELPMSG 2182.<br />
<br />
<em>Despite the little program claims to have solved all the problems, this is notthe case, because Windows Update still wont work and keeps exactly the same behavior as described above.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>2) Another official solution suggested by Microsoft:&nbsp;</strong>run the "DSim or System Update Readiness" and follow the steps on this webpage (http://support2.microsoft.com/kb/947821/es). Tried it, carefully following all the steps. The little program
 "does its thing" and concludes that it found and solved all problems, but unfortunately the reality is that it didn't, either. Windows Update still has the same faulty behavior described above.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>MY RIG:</strong></p>
<p>Intel Core i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60Ghz<br />
8.00 GB RAM GSkill<br />
ATI Radeon HD5780<br />
SSD SAMSUNG 840EVO 250GB<br />
Motherboard ASUS Z97-A<br />
Windows 8.1 Pro &nbsp;(Activated)<br />
(ID: 00261-80359-41592-AA266)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>3) Disabled UEFI Secure boot on the BIOS:</strong> then&nbsp;formated and installed windows without that functionality. I read somewhere that this may be the cause, but nope. Still the same stubborn error. So frustrating!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help with this, I've tried so hard and I cannot find how to fix this. I've looked all over the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've even formated the harddrive and installed windows like 4 times now, begin updating and I'm always stuck with the same issue. Could this be a hardware issue? It seems to me there is nothing I can do to avoid this. I cannot believe every user is facing
 this... ¿?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Alright, after many hours and even days of trying all sorts of stuff... I finally figured it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to format my HD again to get it, but maybe you dont have to go trough all of this. You'll get the idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>This is the story:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>With my new and fresh windows installation I begun the Windows Update process. But this time I didnt let it update automatically. So I set it up to fully manual, manually selecting updates by groups of 10... taking note of each update I made. This way I
 finally snatched the faulty one!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">KB2975719</span></strong>&nbsp;which looks like an important update to the Windows Update sotware itself. Check it out in the KB page for more info. So this is what happened: when I applied this update in its
 group of 10, it appearently installed correctly but it didnt. So I moved on and continued installing the next update group and thats when Windows Update crashed on me. Now I had an idea of what update might be causing the issues!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked back the latest group of updates by comparing it with my notes and realized KB2975719 was missing and actually not installed (which is odd... but anyway) so I manually downloaded&nbsp;KB2975719 from microsoft website, installed "succesfully", restarted
 and VOILA!!! Windows Update is working again!!! Then I was able to install all updates up to date and they ALL installed correctly. No more issues. Gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heres the link to manually download the update:</p>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44055</p>
<p>
</p><p>And heres more info about it:</p>
<p>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2975719</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps anyone with the same issues!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>To Microsoft: guys... take note on this. I'm no expert but all your "solutions" did nothing, they were all so confusing and complicated, a complete waste of time, resources, and they all did nothing. I bet the problem is&nbsp;KB2975719, there you go. So check
 it out for the sake of other users like me!</p>
