    <title>Office Activation WHY MICROSOFT WHY&#33;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john_mccauley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Activation WHY MICROSOFT WHY&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Office 2016 Professional DFO purchased on WORK pc with WORK money, for a DOCTOR who wants his documents to look professional.
</p>
<p>To activate, it asks for his WORK email address, which is given, and then it says that email is unusable and suggests that he create yet another account. THIS IS A WORK COMPUTER, PURCHASED WITH WORK MONEY, HE SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE A WORK EMAIL TO ACTIVATE
 IT. He should not have to create another personal email account to activate Office, he wants the documents that he creates to come authored from his work email, not *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
</p>
<p>With other computers and users, we should be able to tie the Office activation to a work email account, so when employees leave they can't 'take' the copy of Office that work paid for with them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>FIX THIS MICROSOFT!</p>

            You seem to be saying that the employee has left his employment and as such no longer has access to that work mail account that the original install of Office was associated with. - is that correct?

<p>No, Microsoft in all their wisdom, by not allowing valid work email accounts, forces you to make you create a personal email account to sign into Office and activate it, which if and when the person leaves employment, they still have access to.</p>
<p>So, I cannot sign into Office 2016 Professional, using the work email address, for a work computer, paid for with work dollars.</p>
<p>I could understand if Office rejected a work email address for a copy of Office that is for Home users, or Student users, but this is Professional.</p>

            Perpetual - One-time-Purchases of Office 2013/2016 are permanently tied to the email for the Microsoft Account used to setup/install Office 2013/2016.&nbsp; Only Microsoft can change it. A small business owner can create his/her own “company” Microsoft Account
 to use and activate the Office 2013/2016 perpetual licenses. The employee will still be able to sign in with their own Microsoft Account and use the product but the license will appear under the “company” Microsoft Account.

</p><p>Not sure I am with you.&nbsp; I do not see/understand what it has to do with Dell, unless of course Office was installed by Dell?&nbsp; If Dell installed your Office they have wrongly associated it with one of their Microsoft Accounts.&nbsp; I don't think that there is
 anything Dell can do. Only Microsoft can change the email for the Microsoft Account associated with Office 2013/2016 perpetual licenses.</p>

<p>John</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think that I am explaining this clearly.&nbsp; Think of it this way, have you ever attempted to change the email address for your internet provider? Well if you have you will find that they will not let you.&nbsp; You can add alias email accounts/addresses
 but you cannot change the email address you were given when you first set up your internet account.&nbsp; I know that because I have tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, getting back to your problem, when I say that ONLY Microsoft can change the email address that was used to setup/install Office 2013/2016 perpetual licenses, I mean that you have to contact Microsoft directly with one of the help links on Windows 10
 (or other help links on the internet).&nbsp; You need to prove purchase.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The starting point is the Product Key, (that really should be called a Redemption Key) that was used to install/setup Office in the first place. Obviously, in your case you will also need to prove that you paid for the licence as at the moment Microsoft
 thinks the employee who left paid for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what you mean by work email address?&nbsp; You can setup a Microsoft Account for your company.&nbsp; You can add up to 25 Office Account with that one Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when you setup an Office Account you should sign into the Office Account using the email address and password for the company Microsoft Account at:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.office.com/Myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://www.office.com/Myaccount</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>When you access your Office Account on the left hand side you will see a link 'View Your Product Key'.&nbsp; This the ACTUAL Product Key. (It is not the Product Key/Redemption Key used to setup office for the first time).&nbsp; If you
 take a note of this Key and note which computer this particular office is on, you will be able in future to identify which office is associated with which computer.&nbsp;</p>

            The company bought it, I signed in with the Microsoft Account for the company, it would not activate.&nbsp; At Dell's suggestion I signed in with my work email account, since the purchase was made by me, and still it would not activate.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I want to be able to sign into and activate the Office 2016 Professional product that we have purchased using the work email address.&nbsp; I am able to sign into a Microsoft Live account for this particular user, but I cannot activate Office using the same credentials.&nbsp;
 I should be able to plug in a code and have it validate that code and tie it to the user account I choose.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Here is the cycle, I open Office, it prompts me to sign in, one of the options is a work email address.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I enter the work email address, and it tells me that Microsoft account does not exist, enter a new account or get a new one.<br />
<br />
I am already signed into Microsoft Live at this point.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let me repeat that.<br />
<br />
I am already signed into Microsoft Live at this point, so the work email that Microsoft is telling me does not exist, exists and is associated with an active Microsoft Live account.&nbsp; Since it will not let me use the work email address for activating Office
 2016 Professional on a work computer, paid for with work dollars, it asks me to create a new email address, then specifically says I cannot use a work email address.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
"Obviously, in your case you will also need to prove that you paid for the licence as at the moment Microsoft thinks the employee who left paid for it."<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not talking about a past employee, this is for the current user of the new pc.&nbsp;

<p>This is what you said in your first post: <em>"He should not have to create another personal email account to activate Office, he wants the documents that he creates to come authored from his work email..."&nbsp;
</em>The email address that you use to setup Office has nothing whatsoever to do with production/sending documents by email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>we should be able to tie the Office activation to a work email account, so when employees leave they can't 'take' the copy of Office that work paid for with them."
</em>This is why I suggested that you use a company email address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Work email address are usually associated with Office 365, which includes Office 2016.&nbsp; But these accounts are quite different from Office perpetual account.&nbsp; See:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/What-s-the-difference-between-Office-365-and-Office-2016-ed447ebf-6060-46f9-9e90-a239bd27eb96" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What's

<p>Yes, there is a trial version of Office 365 on the computer, what is supposed to happen as far as I understand it, I log into Office to activate it using the company admin email address, the same one I have used before to
 activate others, Office is supposed to go out to the internet and update, changing the version to the Office 2016 Professional that we paid for, done, end of story.</p>
<p>Instead, I sign in as the admin email, it does not activate, was told to give it time, I did, and it still did not work, was told to sign in under a different account,&nbsp;it does not activate, was told to give it time, I did, and it
 still did not work, tried signing in as the intended user,&nbsp;it does not activate, was told to give it time, I did, and it still did not work, now I'm here going around in circles trying to explain the issue to get it resolved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Mohammad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you need help tracking your laptop, however, we can do nothing to track or recover a missing property. In addition, there is no way to track a laptop unless you had preinstalled a special tracking software. However, we do not want to leave
 you hanging out there without getting any assistance from us, with that, we recommend that you reach out to your laptop's manufacturer for additional assistance on tracking the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, please contact the local law enforcement authorities about the theft, provide them all the information that they need and show them some proof of ownership. You will most likely need to this to have them return the laptop to you if they find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For security purposes and to avoid identity theft, please sign in your Microsoft account into a different machine and change your password by following the steps on this

</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>I installed Office 2013 (typical install - no customization and no errors during it) earlier this week and could not get PowerPivot to come up in Excel. After Office had been installed,&nbsp;I&nbsp;went to the Add-Ins under the Excel options on the start page and
 clicked on the PowerPivot COM add-in, then selected OK. As it said it would come up after I restarted Excel I did just that, only to see that the PowerPivot tab wasn’t ackg.&nbsp;Next, I went to the Developer tab and selected it&nbsp;from the COM add-ins drop down.
 I saved the worksheet (even though I knew it wouldn’t make a difference but I just had to do it), exited Excel and restarted it. Again, no PowerPivot, and when I looked at the COM add-ins dropdown on the Developer tab, it was no longer selected.&nbsp; I checked
 an&nbsp;Office 2013 Excel help article, which included the steps I had&nbsp;just tried and&nbsp;it also&nbsp;suggested that I make sure&nbsp;the add-in wasn’t disabled; it&nbsp;wasn’t. I then&nbsp;spent&nbsp;2 days trying&nbsp;every suggestion that I could find on the internet, I repaired&nbsp;Office 2013,
 I uninstalled and reinstalled it, and I also messed with&nbsp;every Trust Center setting combination possible - all without success. So this morning I decided to go back to basics, which is when I finally came up&nbsp;with what needed to be done to get this to work
 -&nbsp;and&nbsp;it’s something that shouldn’t have even been necessary. You’ll understand why&nbsp;as you keep reading. &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I thought the typical, non customized install would take care of what it needed for the COM add-ins to work, but that was incorrect apparently.&nbsp;For some incomprehensible reason the path to the PowerPivot&nbsp;add-in wasn’t considered a “trusted location” and
 had to be manually added as one&nbsp;in Excel’s Trust Center.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I added this path on that tab:&nbsp;&nbsp; C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Officel5\ADDINS\PowerPivot Excel Add-in\PowerPivotExcelClientAddIn.dlI&nbsp;
</p>
<p>To do this, go to Excel Options -&gt; Trust Center -&gt; Trust Center Settings and select the Trusted Locations tab, which is where you add it. While on this tab&nbsp;you’ll probably notice a couple of things:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are already several of the Excel&nbsp;locations for&nbsp;it’s extension&nbsp;in here as a default. (Not sure why this one wasn’t included as a default too.)
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You may notice on the bottom left of this tab&nbsp;there is an option to select “Allow Trusted Locations on my Network” but it says “not recommended”. (So does this mean we have to manually add all
 of the paths to the Trusted Center that weren’t added during the&nbsp;install of the Microsoft product?)</p>
<p>After I added the path, I wanted to&nbsp;make sure all possible “trust issues” would be addressed,&nbsp;so I&nbsp;checked the Trusted Publishers tab&nbsp;to see if&nbsp;there was a row with the &nbsp;Microsoft Corporation (found in the “Issued to” column) and&nbsp;Microsoft Code Signing PCA
 (found in the “Issued By” column). It was - luckily during&nbsp;my numerous attempts to make this work it got added when I had selected an&nbsp;option presented in the trust center to make the&nbsp;publisher of this add-in&nbsp;a trusted one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>After I did these things, voila, I now have PowerPivot up and running. But man, this took far&nbsp;too&nbsp;much effort and was&nbsp;very frustrating, which is why I’ve added this post - hopefully this helps reduce the amount of frustration for someone else with this same
 issue. </p>

<span>http://www.infoworld.com/t/office-software/how-buy-microsoft-volume-license-the-cheap-213214</span></a>
</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; Lemington Consulting, which works extensively with Access volume licenses,
<a href="http://lemingtonit.com/services/FAQMVLS.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>explains the details</span></a> in its FAQ:</p>
<p>Is there a ackgro number of licenses that must be purchased under a Volume License Agreement?</p>
<p>Yes. The minimum number of licenses required for a Volume License Agreement is five (5). However, the five licenses can be made up of any combination of products. Quantities of less than five can also be purchased economically by making up the additional
 license using an inexpensive “make up” product SKU.</p>
<p>Once the initial Volume License Agreement is in place, additional licenses can be added to the Agreement in quantities of less than five. For example, if a company purchases five Office 2010 Professional Plus licenses under a new agreement, three months
 later the same company can purchase one additional Office 2010 Professional Plus license under the same agreement. The minimum license number therefore only applies to the initial Volume License agreement.</p>
<p>One of the worst-kept secrets in VL cognoscenti circles: The Microsoft DVD Playback Pack for Windows Vista Business is (as you would imagine) quite cheap. I’ve seen it for
<a href="http://www.cdwg.com/shop/products/Microsoft-DVD-Playback-Pack-for-Windows-Vista-Business-license/2232707.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>as little as $7</span></a>. (Then buy what ever Office product / bundle you want, ie genuine VL Excel 2013 ($173).)</p>

<p>The Photos APP on 10 is just not working. It eats photos.</p>
<p>Seems nobody is interested in editing photos on Windows. AND NO WONDER!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't been able to rotate, crop, adjust or even TAG photos on 7, 8, 8.1 or any build of 10.</p>
<p>I've tried photo gallery, the photo APP (including the latest one in 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use explorer to rotate or tag a photo in File Explorer, it simply disappears.
</p>
<p>I use several PC's and OneDrive. I can monitor the local copies on each PC and monitor the OneDrive web page. When I rotate or tag a group of photos in one PC, they quickly disappear from the web OneDrive View and all the PC's.</p>
<p>If I rotate and crop a file in the new TP10 APP, and click the larger save icon (a floppy?) it saves a edited copy (PHOTONAME.JPG.jpg) That properly replicates to all the other PC's through OneDrive.</p>
<p>I can edit dozens of photos and&nbsp; they are all safely replicated to the other PC's. Unlike the file manager, they do not disappear.... UNTIL YOU CLOSE THE PHOTO APP. Then, one by one, in rapid succession every photo I have edited vanishes from all the computers
 right before my eyes. Not just the edited copies but <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
the ORIGINALS vanish too</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying for a week to figure this out. Most MS answers forums and other places&nbsp;blame this problem on third party anti virus programs, but, I am not using any, other than the built-in one on 8 and 10, and the MS Security essentials on 7.
</p>
<p>Another solution says the files are not deleted, but simply hidden. I always set File Explorer to show hidden and system files.
<p>Other solutions say that the files are in the AppData folder for the application. Depending on which application is used, this is sometimes true, but only for the original file.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some Applications cause the photos to disappear instantly if you monitor the folder where the photo is stored, yet the application continues to show the edited folder, ... until you try to edit the photo a second time, then the Application will tell you
 the photo is not available, (Photo App on 10), or it will crash (Photo Gallery on 7)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solutions I found on the forums usually have several posts after a MVP provides a proposed solution saying the solution did not work. I've not seen any final solution, but I do see lots of requests to change the status of answers form "Answered" to "Not
 Answered" there are a lot of posts complaining of this behavior going back to 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have about 4.2 TB of digital photos and HD videos. I am also&nbsp;using a Sony&nbsp;Digital SLR to convert three generations of family 35mm slides. &nbsp;I use 5 computer in this project.
</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;All In One Windows 7 PC&nbsp;to transfer SD cards and receive photos from Wireless equipped cameras.
</p>
<p>(2) A 7.5 " Windows 8&nbsp;.1 Bing&nbsp;tablet to monitor incoming photos from the cameras.</p>
<p>(3) A Windows 7&nbsp;Ultmate dual monitor desktop to catalog, sort and comment the family photo history and backup the 9TB internals to USB 3.0 - 3 TB externals.</p>
<p>(4) A 8" Windows 8.1 tablet I use to call up photos on to show other family members when I need to ask about details. (where taken, Who is that. Etc.</p>
<p>(5) a recently added Dual monitor Desktop running Windows 10 to see if the new Photo App might solve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the PC,s have the latest appropriate version on onedrive and all are registered, genuine Windows with automatic updates enabled. I checked them all and they are up to date. All security is enabled. I did a complete scan for viruses using Security Essentials
 and Malware Bytes including the entire 5 drives in computer (3). Firewall is turned on.</p>

<p>OKAY!! I have figured it out, finally....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the latest software on my Android Device (Google Play Store), but only had Microsoft Office 2007 on my laptop, I now acknowledge that the Windows version has to be 2010 or higher, as the latest versions automatically sync your notebooks to your Windows

    <title>New Custom Template does not apply properly to previous Slide Master - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New Custom Template does not apply properly to previous Slide Master</h2>
                    <div>
<p><span>&nbsp;I am currently updating a client's template with new brand and graphic elements in PowerPoint 2008. Unlike the previous version on (.pot 97 - 2004), applying the new template (which is now saved at as an Office theme)
<span style="font-weight: bold">does not</span> replace images/logo and ppt objects.
<br />
<br />
Is there a new way to apply an existing presentation to a new template/theme with out leaving behind artwork/logos from the previous master?
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a test, I saved my template back to 97-2004 .pot and applied to an the older ppt (using Office 2004 on my Power Mac G5) And the transition was seamless – old logos, art etc was replaced with the new.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope we did not lose the ability to seamlessly update to new slide masters in the newer versions of PPT.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span>: I also am preparing the same template for use on a PC using Office 2007 and having the same issues. I know this is a Mac support; if there is a way on the PC and you can help,
 would be a bonus.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have given the client these instructions:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>To set up the Xxxx template for use on your computer(s):</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Open 2011 XxxxTemplate PC.potx</span></li><li><span>Click the Microsoft Office Button, and then click Save As</span></li><li><span>In the Save as type list, click Office Theme, and then click Save</span></li><li><span>The directory should say ‘Document Themes’ at the top <br />
of the Save dialog</span></li><li><span>Do not change the directory or path of the file </span></li></ul>
<p><span>Applying the Design Theme to an existing presentation:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Open an existing presentation that does not use the <br />
new design template.</span></li><li><span>On the Design tab, in the Themes group, click More.</span></li><li><span>Under Custom, select the 2011 Xxxx template</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Starting a new, blank presentation:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Open 2011 XxxxTemplate PC.potx, Save it with a new filename and use the built-in layouts to create your presentation.</span></li></ul>
<span><br />
<span><br />
Please let me know if there is something I should be doing differently or if my instructions are incorrect.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.<br />

Office 2011 All-In-One for Dummies reference book</a> we go into quite a bit of detail to explain the difference between a Theme and a Template. Here is a much abridged (and not nearly as correct or detailed as the book) summary:<br />
<br />
Template: Saved as (.pot) or (.potx) is an entire presentation exactly as it was when you saved it.
<br />
<br />
Theme: Saved as (.thmx). The idea of a Theme is to provide a consistent color scheme and font family across Word, Excel and PowerPoint. You set the Theme colors in PowerPoint using the Format menu and choosing Theme Colors. For PowerPoint, a theme also includes
 other elements of a slide presentation, including slide master and slide design elements and a font family.
<br />
<br />
This link from the book's co-author might be helpful:<br />

<br />
It seems to me that you want to include the complete presentation as a starting point to make a new presentation, so you should be saving as a Template, not a Theme. Again, I refer you to the book for a complete reference on this topic.<br />

            There is no Upgrade assistant for win 10 yet. The requirements&nbsp;don't include programs that don't work--just the hardware requirements you need. AND Office 2007<strong> is
</strong>compatible with Windows 8.1 and should install OK on the win 10 preview. If it is an OEM version that came installed on another computer, you can't install it on a diff computer since the OEM Office&nbsp;software cannot be transferred and used on a diff
 computer.

<p>Office typically has issues installing office outlook so if that's included in your version that might of been why,</p>

            <p>If you hold your cursor on a sender's name, the ensuing popup ought to show an address for a legitimate Microsoft webpage.&nbsp; If you receive a message (such as yours), all&nbsp;internal links -- when you hold your cursor on those links will show a redirect that
 must redirect to a legitimate Microsoft webpage (You will need to have your <strong>
Status bar </strong>selected in your browser's <strong>Toolbar </strong>settings in order to see this.)&nbsp; But more important than anything else is that all messages from Outlook and Microsoft's legitimate email will be marked with a&nbsp;<strong>green safety shield</strong>
 as in the below image.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, Microsoft webpage-urls are shielded in the <strong>
Address bar</strong> in a similar manner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line to your question: the messages you are receiving are a phishing scam.&nbsp; Deal with&nbsp;them accordingly.</p>

    <title>Setting up an ATT email account in Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> teresamaschger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting up an ATT email account in Outlook.com</h2>
                    I cannot get Outlook.com or my own Outlook to work with my Att.net email account. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I go to Outlook.com email settings I am trying to add a send-and-receive account. &nbsp;Microsoft account uses my att email as the primary account but show it as a send only. &nbsp;Keeps telling me to make sure email address and pw are correct and they are.
 &nbsp;It then tells me to try advanced settings. &nbsp;the incoming shows inbound.att.net Port 995 and outgoing shows outbound.att.net Port 465. &nbsp;Then it tells me it can't sign into POP3 server and to check email address and PW which are still correct.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My windows mail is set as incoming with imap.mail.yahoo.com port 993 and outgoing with smtp.mail.yahoo.com port 465 and works beautifully. Outlook won't allow a port 993 for incoming mail when I try to change Outlook settings.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anybody can help, would really appreciate it. &nbsp;I have had this computer with Win8 for almost a year and have yet to get either Outlook to work properly. &nbsp;Thought using Outlook might solve another problem I keep having with Win Mail for another account.
 &nbsp;Have really had it with both Win Mail and Outlook. &nbsp;My phone handles all 3 of my email accounts without a hitch. Microsoft has stepped on my last nerve.</div>

            Evidently from reading other post to MS Community this is a big problem for all outlook and windows mail users. &nbsp;There are 5 related content items on this page all about the same problems. &nbsp;It is about time MS deals with this and finds a solution. &nbsp;I have
 just given up for now. &nbsp;Tired of &nbsp;trying the same suggested things over and over only for it not to work. &nbsp;Too busy to spend any more time messing with Forum Moderators. &nbsp;They are not able to help. &nbsp;Good Luck. &nbsp; &nbsp;

            First of all, I am NOT computer illiterate. In fact, I build computers, websites etc. I have successfully enabled my att account using MS Outlook and other email programs, some just to test the settings. It is outlook.com only..... that will not work.
 I receive a message saying that "we cannot connect with outlook at this time, try again later."

            Thank you, Raju, for taking the time to respond!!&nbsp; I use POP for receiving and SMTP for incoming. I will try your suggestion to log on to webmail. I found the AT&amp;T Yahoo e-mail account is working and have been able to read all current e-mails. This is
 curious, given they both operate under the same e-mail address....but with different passwords. I had some help, today, from a friend, who is very knowledgeable about computers, to investigate the hang-up, but he could not discover how Microsoft Outlook has
 been corrupted. I did reset the password without success, given the menu asks for the old password, which the system fails to recognize.<br />
<br />
I will keep trying to find a solution to the problem. Perhaps, the best solution is to uninstall and reinstall the Microsoft Outlook program. Again, thank you for your time and interest!<br />
<br />

    <title>Internet Explorer IE Favourites Icons Updates &#47; Upload - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wissam dagher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer IE Favourites Icons Updates &#47; Upload</h2>
                    <p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Dear Sir / Madam,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would like to know what is the standard process for Internet Explorer IE Favourites Icons Updates / Upload.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;When Importing a file of IE Favourites Bookmarks, how would IE upload the corresponding Icons and where From? [1]</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;and how would IE update&nbsp;an Icon if the corresponding website does so? [2]</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;This would be easy to understand if on every website visit, but what if I load a file of more than 100 Favourites Links?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Any available brief description on that mechanism?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Many thanks for your help and support,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Sincerely,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Wissam Dagher,</p>
                </div>

            <p><em>&gt; I understand the first export method might be the best adapted for keeping the Favorites Icons.&nbsp; Thank you.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, sorry. Exporting/importing Favorites will not transfer favicons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&gt; I am afraid however that the Favorites Icons are not updated on every visit, but sometimes are.&nbsp; And sometimes they are updated without the website visit.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen the same inconsistent behavior, hence this suggestion:</p>
<p>To speed up the process or insure that the current Favicon is downloaded you can open the
</p>
<p>Favorites folder ( C:\Users\username\Favorites ) on the desktop and drag&nbsp;a website's Favicon
</p>
<p>from the Address Bar to that folder, renaming the Favorite if you wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearing the Temporary Internet Files (and perhaps also the History) should refresh/reload Favicons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&gt; Any further explanation on the Favorites Icons Update Process?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These 2 articles provide much more information that I ever could.&nbsp; ;-)</p>

<h2>            editing ppt recordings</h2>
                    <p><span>I am hainge trouble editing ppt narrations. I have lectures from last semester&nbsp;and I just want to change what I say on the first slide. I then export&nbsp;them&nbsp;as video. I can clear the narration and easily&nbsp;re record but
 the new recording&nbsp;does not integrate with the old. &nbsp;It's all there (I can hear it as edited when I click the speaker icon on a slide), but when I play the presentation, the narration stops at the point where I edited it. If I export as video I only get the
 sound of the new recordings The slides continue to play, with the recorded timing, but no narration. Another user asked this question back in 2014 but no useful answer. The slides with the original&nbsp;recordings&nbsp;have the icon in the top right corner, the new
 recordings&nbsp;have the icon in the bottom right.</span></p>
<p>

<p>There are probably more elegant/less geeky ways to accomplish this but:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make a copy of your file. DO NOT work on the original, because minor mistakes in what follows could corrupt your file.&nbsp; Now, working on the COPY:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change the file's extension to .ZIP</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doubleclick to open it as a ZIP file</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doubleclick the "ppt" folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doubleclick the "media" folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inside the "media" folder, you'll find any pictures/sounds/videos you've inserted into your presentation.&nbsp; With luck, your recorded sounds will have names that match the slide sequence.&nbsp; You can doubleclick them to verify that you've got the right one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use an external sound recording program to re-record your narration (Audacity is excellent and free).&nbsp; Save the recording to the Windows desktop (or any other convenient location) under same name and type as the sound you want to replace, the one you found
 inside the unzipped PPT file.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete the sound file from inside the ZIP, then drag the newly created recording (same name, same file format) into the ZIP to replace it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Close the ZIP, rename it to Whatever.PPTX and fire it up.</p>

            You should not need to do this, despite what the program is requesting.<br />
<br />
However, open MSE, SETTINGS tab, select REAL-TIME PROTECTION, and uncheck "Turn on real-time protection".<br />
<br />
Turn it back on when done.<br />

<h2>            XPSP3 - Explorer Window at startup and no MSE tray icon - AUTO FIX INSIDE&#33;</h2>
                    
<blockquote>If the icon doesn't appear on the task bar it could be one of two things.&nbsp; Either the Microsoft Security Essentials application has failed to start, resulting in the icon being missing, or it could be that the icon is in fact there but is hidden.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If the icon is hidden, you can right click on the taskbar and choose Properties.&nbsp; Here you will see an option to "Hide Inactive Icons" which can be unchecked as a test, then click OK.&nbsp; This will display all the icons that are hidden or inactive; please check
 to see if you see the Microsoft Security Essentials icon appear.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If not, we can try to launch the application manually to see if it starts.&nbsp; Check the desktop or under Start / Programs for the Microsoft Security Essentials icon and try to launch it manually.&nbsp; If you receive an error message make sure to write it down.&nbsp; After
 launching it manually, check again for the icon in the taskbar.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Lastly, the problem might be that Windows is not configured to launch the Microsoft Security Essentials application when you boot the computer.&nbsp; Click Start then Run, and type MSCONFIG and click OK.&nbsp; Here click on the Startup tab and ensure that Microsoft Security
 Essentials is listed here and it is checked. <br />
<br />
If all else fails you can contact support for assistance.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps!

as you see in my other post i am having the same problem with xp pro sp3 but i get an additional popup explorer box that shows- c:/Program Files/Microsoft/Search Enhancement Pack<br />
there is nothing in event viewer in error msgs- it is listed in msconfig and checked- my other icons are not hidden, if i double click the icon on the desktop it puts it in the taskbar<br />
<br />
also it seems to be running in the backround somewhat.&nbsp; I did an eicar test, nothing popped up but when double clicking the desktop icon it now showed that it grabbed it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I submitted an email to microsoft but have heard nothing as of yet&nbsp; It would be nice if one of you figured out what is wrong since it might be days before microsoft responds<br />
