<h2>            Windows VIsta vs Windows XP</h2>
                    <b>Hi there,&nbsp; I currently have a Dell Inspiron 1501 laptop running Windows Vista home premium. I have a desktop computer that runs Windows XP...Now, I have no problems running Vista, but I liked XP just
 fine too...MY children and father really hate Vista!&nbsp; My question is....Is it even possible to remove Vista from the laptop, and install XP onto the laptop? Would I even want to? By that I mean, would it be advisable? I would assume that you would have to
 reformat the drive, and then just use the XP discs when reloading afterwards, and then just pray that nothing went wrong?&nbsp; Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp; Thank you in advance for your time.<br />

            Windows Vista&nbsp;has far more advanced security features than Windows XP.&nbsp; If you really want to install Windows XP, you'll need to purchase a "full version" of Windows XP and perform a complete "clean install".<br />
<br />
Clean install Windows XP:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/cleanxpinstall.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.michaelstevenstech.com/cleanxpinstall.html</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Afterward, you'll need to visit Dell Support to download the Windows XP hardware drivers designed for your Dell Inspiron 1501.<br />
<a href="http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />
Then you'll need to visit Windows Update to download the recommended updates.<br />
<br />
In addition, if you want to play DVD movies, you'll need to purchase and install a DVD Decoder since one is not included with Windows XP<br />
as it is with Windows Vista.&nbsp; Writing to DVDs will also require you to purchase and install&nbsp;third-party DVD disc recording software, such as Roxio or Nero.<br />
<br />
The whole process will take you about&nbsp;4-5 hours.<br />
<br />
You may want to consider installing Windows XP in a Virtual PC.&nbsp; Instuctions are here:<br />
<a href="http://www.petri.co.il/virtual_create_virtual_machines_virtual_pc_2007.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.petri.co.il/virtual_create_virtual_machines_virtual_pc_2007.htm</a><br />
<br />
The drawback to using a Virtual Machine is that it cannot use a USB connected printer to print.<br />

<h2>            I hate Windows 10 restarting automatically without my consent</h2>
                    <p>I hate that Windows 10 restarts automatically without my consent just to install new updates I didnt asked for. It made me lost a day of work and I just have to write everything I had worked for all over again. I do not want to hear the excuse of "You didn't
 save your work?".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I don't want to have updates for a certain laps of time is my decision.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I stop this updates for restarting my computer again without my consent?</p>

<h2>            Why do apps need access to communicate through firewalls&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently downloaded Unity and it wants me to allow access through the firewall. I trust it and I allowed it through private networks but I don't understand why I need to do this. What does Unity need to have from my computer that my firewall blocks? And
 not just unity but also all apps. Take chrome for example, it wants access to communicate through private or public networks. What does this mean to begin with?</p>

            Hi TsavoCole14 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />A lot of time these apps have a built in debugger that sends info to the company.
<br />You can block it and it shouldn't harm the app, meaning it will function normally.
<br />
<br />A private network is when you are behind a NAT.  So basically your IP is private but your modem translate it so you can get out to the internet.
<br />It is also will allow you to find other computers on your network.
<br />
<br />A public network is when you using a public connection like at Starbucks or Hotel and it will not enable any discovery features so you are not able to find others on your network which is what you want.
<br />
<br />See link for further explanations.
<br />

<h2>            Windows Mail-Outgoing mail doesnt send</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I have windows mail, I am receiving incoming mail but my outgoing is not working. I went thru Bellsouth tech support and concluded that the problem is Windows, not bellsouth.
<br />
<br />
This is the following error message that shows up..<br />
<br />
The connection to the server has failed. Subject 'hola', Account: 'mail.bellsouth.net', Server: 'mail.bellsouth.net', Protocol: SMTP, Port: 25, Secure(SSL): No, Socket Error: 10060, Error Number: 0x800CCC0E<br />
<br />
<br />
I went to tools and in accounts-Servers <br />
my incoming mail server is a POP3 and outgoing SMTP both say.... mail.bellsouth.net<br />
<br />
then under the tab advanced... it says<br />
Server port numbers<br />
outgoing mail SMTP 25<br />
Incoming mail POP3 110<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont know what to do.. I need to respond to my business messages.<br />

<p>This has been a constant problem with me.&nbsp; The best answer ive gotten is "thats Vista for you."&nbsp; to resolve this problem I have to continously reset my default programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First close out of windows mail then follow these steps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. click on START button</p>
<p>2. Click on Default Programs</p>
<p>3. Set default programs</p>
<p>4. select windows mail</p>
<p>5. set this program as default</p>
<p>6. Okay</p>
<p>Go back to outbox&nbsp;folder and open one of the emails and press send.&nbsp; This should unlock and send all that is in the outbox folder.</p>
<p>I have to do this process ever so often (every other week or so.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to find the answer to this problem forever and finally resolved to following the process of reseting my windows mail program every time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not to say that this is what your specific problem is but, its worth a try and won't hurt anything in the process.</p>

 I had granted Francis permission to control the desktop. Some time ago I had a problem with Windows and allowed access to Microsoft. Does Microsoft still have free access? I've not been able to locate LogInRescue in my list of programs so have been unable

<p>Hi Wendy,</p>

<p>Thank you Jelu Cal. Your response is very appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Yes I tried closing the window by pressing the X button many times. Sometimes it wouldn't close. Other times it would close and then pop up again.&nbsp;</li><li>Yes I have restarted the device several times both offline and online and it keeps popping up.</li><li>Cortana located the LogMeIn rescue pop up but that was all. It showed that there were 2 pop ups, both the same.</li><li>I'm not sure what you mean by your last question. I can just see what is on the screen shot before and after rebooting.</li></ol>
<p>I rang Microsoft and their technical support person connected with my PC via LogMeIn Rescue (providing a code) and advised that I had been hacked. I was asked what type of firewall I had and advised that my problem could only be fixed by a certified Microsoft
 repairer. I was given 2 options for repair both requiring payment. I was directed to www.mytechsquad.com.au as verification as I was concerned that perhaps the session had been intercepted somehow. This may have been legitimate but when asked for payment I
 got nervous. Should I have gone ahead with this?</p>

<p>I tried disabling "program" (the item with no publisher) and restarted my PC but that didn't appear to change anything. I&nbsp;ran MS malicious software removal tool for Windows 10 (full check)&nbsp;but that didn't&nbsp;detect any problems.&nbsp;If you could suggest something
 to try next that would be great.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wendy</p>

<p>We'd recommend performing a clean boot in Windows to isolate software conflicts on your device. To do this, you can perform the steps posted on this

link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the clean boot environment, check if you'll still experience your concern. Once done troubleshooting, you'd need to revert your device to normal boot. To do this, check the
<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong> section of the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes after you've performed the steps.</p>

<ol>
<li><span>Are you signed in to standard account?</span></li><li><span>How many user profiles are present in the computer?</span></li><li><span>The administrator account is Microsoft account or local account?</span></li><li><span>What is the exact error message/code you get?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If you are using a standard account, there are several things which needs administrator password to access them. For example, installing apps, opening command prompt in administrator mode etc.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
<span>Hi
</span><span>yh8me,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forums.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>For better understanding of the issue, I would like to ask few questions about the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span><span>Are
 you able to browse/visit websites normally and the Internet connectivity working properly other than Bearshare not being able to connect?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>If your Internet Connectivity is not working, could you please tell us from when are you facing this issue?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Bearshare, Limewire and Frostwire are all Peer to Peer connecting software’s, sometimes their server might be down which makes your program not getting connected to the
 server.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Limewire version 5 is compatible with Windows 7 which you can use. For assistance regarding the P2P (Peer to Peer) software’s, you have to contact them for assistance.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>As a workaround, disable your security software firewall and windows firewall to check if you are able to get connected using Bearshare.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>It would be possible that your security software or windows firewall blocking the program for security reasons.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>You may also check if it works in “Safe mode with Networking”. Please see the s</span></span><span><span>teps
 below to start your computer in <strong>“Safe mode with Networking”,</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart your computer and before Windows logon screen appears press F8 continuously which would bring
<strong>“Advanced Boot”</strong> options.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Please select
<strong>“Safe mode with networking”</strong> and hit enter to start your computer in Safe mode with networking.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>After you login in safe mode with networking, check if the issue is persisting.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong><span> is a Diagnostic Mode of Microsoft Windows Operating System running with
 minimal set of services and drivers.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Hope this helps you.</span></span></p>

<p>Hello yh98me,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting with the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you try running Bearshare in Compatibility Mode. First for vista and then try XP.<br />
<br />
If you have an older application for Windows XP or Vista that doesn't run in Windows 7, you may be able to get it working properly by running the program in compatibility mode.<br />
<br />
1. To begin, find the application or shortcut that is causing the problem, then right click on it and select Properties.<br />
2. Then, select Compatibility from the tabbed menu at the top of the properties page:<br />
3. Now, check the "Run this program in compatibility mode for..." box and select the OS you wish to emulate. For most applications, it will be Windows XP SP2. Once you are done, click OK.<br />
4. When you next launch the application it should run under compatibility mode using the OS you selected. If it still fails to run correctly, try another OS selection in step 3 and try again.<br />
<br />
Please reply back and let us know if this helped to resolve your issue or if you still need assistance.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,</p>

            Hello ReserveTruls,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your post. &nbsp;You can try running the setup.exe or install.exe file in compatibility mode. &nbsp;Instead of double-clicking the file, right-click and select 'Troubleshoot Compatibility'. &nbsp;Follow through with the wizard and try to run your game.
 &nbsp;If this doesn't work, and depending on your Windows 7 version, you may be able to install and run XP or Vista in a Virtual Machine. &nbsp;Click&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>&nbsp;to see if that is an option for you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Cheers</div>

<h2>            My xbox one will only read certain discs...</h2>
                    <p>Help! My xbox one stopped read blu rays and will only play certain games. It reads dvds no problem. Ive tried turning off instant on clearing the persistent storage and plugging my console directly into a socket as opposed to a power strip. Still nothing. Id say the disc drive was shot but some of my games work no problem. I am part of the xbox one preview program so im not sure if thats a factor</p>

Have Xbox One discs stopped reading as well?&nbsp;If your Xbox One console isn't able to read to Blu-ray's and Xbox One discs, but can read DVDs and Xbox 360 discs (that are backward compatible with the&nbsp;Xbox One), that may indicate a hardware issue. If you're able to test different types of discs and report your finding back here, we'll be able to determine what next steps should be.</p><p><br /></p><p>I definitely encourage you to report this along with any issues you encounter while in the Xbox Insider program too!

            I believe its the laser that reads your discs. I can tell you with my xbox it wont read any 360 games but will xbox one. first time I tried using a 360 disc it would not work and I had to use my ladys console. but personally I&nbsp; think its your laser in
 the console. been my biggest issue with xbox consoles.

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like some help understanding a recent BSOD event I had. I was running a few programs on my computer when I heard a loud squealing noise. The noise lasted only a few seconds, and was intermittent over 5 minutes. I presume the noise is my fan as I have
 a SSD drive. At the end of the 5 minutes the noise got very loud and stopped abruptly and the computer went BSOD. The error it gave was KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR (volmgrx.sys). Here is a link to the .DMP file:</p>

            Not having that error in my notes (that means I have not seen it at least 2 times), I Googled it and first came across a MS KB article:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/810558" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/810558</a><br />
<br />
That article includes this statement:<br />
<br />
Contact Microsoft Product Support Services for help with curing the corruption in the registry.<br />
<br />
I think that is about where you are right now, so let's see what the Microsoft Support Engineer response is now that there is more information.&nbsp; I always like to see what they have to offer first.<br />
<br />
Why and how did you modify System Restore to create 3 Restore Points a day for 30 days (FYI - that is not the same as a backup).<br />
<br />
If you were troubleshooting some issue at the time, what was the issue?<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I would run a chkdsk /r on your XP volume from the XP Recovery Console.<br />
<br />
If you are not 100% sure the SP2 CD you have is a genuine bootable XP installation CD and not some kind of system recovery CD from Dell, I would recommend this (which I
<br />
<br />
<div>
<p>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure (no XP media required).<br />
</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come with a store bought system.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD (do not install UniBlue or the Ask Toolbar - ever!):<br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recovery_console_cmds.mspx?mfr=true</a></p>
<p>A good idea before starting things is to first verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear
 to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>
<p>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</p>
<p>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will not be present.</p>

    <title>How do I restore my playlists in the Windows Media Player library - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vesper110  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I restore my playlists in the Windows Media Player library</h2>
                    <p>My PC sort of froze for some unknown reason and when I rebooted my PC and opened Media player, I saw the icons for the playlists but there were no names and when I clicked on one of them the program froze; it did fix my Media player but it wiped the path
 to the playlists, the playlists are still in the playlist folder but not in the library,</p>
<p>to fix my Media Player library I followed a post to a question that was resolved by deleting the Windows Media player files in the media player folder so Media Player could rebuild the database; so my question is how do we restore the links to the playlists
 in the playlist folder so media player can see them?<br />

<p><span>Each hardware brand and peripherals have its own design or way on how does their product work. Most devices work best if the manufacturer provides the necessary driver updates to run on
<strong>Windows</strong> computers. <strong>Microsoft</strong> has already the capability called "plug and play" to automatically detect if the device is compatible with your computer or not.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since you are using a third-party device, the hardware compatibility will only be limited. At this time, we recommend contacting the manufacturer of your

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have upgraded to Windows 10 recently. After the upgrade browsing internet through wifi has slowed down drastically. Its all most like connecting through good old dial up connection. It should be noted that the issue is only in wifi and I have absolutely
 no issues while connected through the ethernet. Web browsing through wifi in all other devices such as mobiles has absolutely no issues. Its only my laptop which seems to have the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked with my ISP and there does not seem to be any issues with broad band speed. I have a dell inspiron laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unable to figure out the issue. Request help from the community is resolving the issue</p>

            Hi Megan, 
<br />
<br />This has helped others out in the past. They've had 32gb HP Streams, and they were able to download the update to external media. 
<br />
<br />Create a Windows 10 usb flash installer using the free Media Creation Tool at Microsoft. At least 8gb flash drive required:
<br />
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Select Download tool now, and select Run.
<br />If you agree to the license terms, select Accept.
<br />On the What do you want to do? page, select Create installation media for another PC, and then select Next.
<br />Select the language, edition, and architecture (64-bit or 32-bit) for Windows 10.
<br />
<br />-------------------------------
<br />
<br />When the flash drive is prepared insert it in a usb port. Browse it and find Setup.exe. Click to run it and choose Upgrade
<br />

<p>Thank you so much!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>After the last step, it says "You need to free up at least 8GB of space on C:" - with no option to use any other drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this so difficult?!&nbsp; I'm surprised an update is this hard...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know something else I could try?&nbsp; Or what the next step would be?</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.

Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.
