<h2>            One person in network showing up as offline in Outlook 2010&#63;</h2>
                    We use ShoreTel Communicator for our network at work, which integrates nicely with Outlook 2010 99.99% of the time. However, we have one user that shows up as offline when looking at her in Outlook. Everyone else will have a green or yellow square next
 to their name, but she is always gray. We've checked her settings and they are correct; she has it set to online and doesn't have the 'show as offline' box checked.

            <p>This feature is provided by ShoreTel Communicator and not by Outlook. Outlook collects the information from&nbsp;a framework to which ShoreTel Communicator report. If that reports that the user is offline, than that is what Outlook displays as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does&nbsp;her status show to others in the communicator itself?<br />
Is there anything different about this user account? For instance, works here longer than others, has been migrated from another system, has at some time been renamed due to marriage/divorce, etc...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might also want to involve ShoreTel support as well:<br />

What is your Home page set to?&nbsp;&nbsp; Did you recently install Office 2011?&nbsp; Looks like you have a bad install if so.</p>
<p><br />
Apparently others have seen your symptom even after, presumably, a more conventional install:</p>

<h2>            New Site Column added to existing Custom Content Type will not display on View&#47;Edit&#47;New form</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
I created a Custom Content Type (inherited from Document) called 'work instruction'.&nbsp; I added about 6 custom Site Columns to it - they are all optional and none are hidden.&nbsp; Then I added the content type to a document library.&nbsp; I can create new documents from
 this content type and I see all those fields on view/edit/new forms.</p>
<p><br />
A few days later, after about test documents were created I needed to add another column to the content type.&nbsp; So I created a List column first.&nbsp; However, I remembered I wanted them to all be site columns so I deleted that then created a Site Column.&nbsp; I added
 this column to the Content Type and have it set to Optional.</p>
<p><br />
Now in the library, I am showing the new site column (called "originator", a Person type). in the list empty, as you'd expect.&nbsp; I went to an existing document, edited it, and the edit form shows all content type columns except for the new one.&nbsp; However, if
 I create a new document from the Content Type I do see the column in the Document Information Panel in the Word client, so it is there.</p>
<p>Why is the site column I added to the content type not appearing in the New/Edit/View forms?</p>

<h2>            Move mailbox to different domain and user</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Due to a company merge we currently have quite complex domain structure. &nbsp;We are also in the process of trying to migrate users to our Office 365 tenancy.</p>
<p>A little bit about our environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>DomainA running Exchange 2010 with users and maiboxes on premise currently. </li><li>ADFS setup to sync with our Office 365 tenancy </li><li>Use a domain name of company1.com.au </li><li>DomainB running no exchange and we have user mailboxes only in the Office 365 tenancy.
</li><li>ADFS setup to sync to the same Office 365 tenancy </li><li>Use a domain name of company2.com.au </li></ul>
<p>We are hoping to move to a single Domain for all users accounts which will be DomainB but we still need to maintain different email address domains within the same Office 365 tenancy. &nbsp;I'm struggling to find out the best way to move the mailboxes from DomainA
 into Office 365 and then somehow attach that mailbox to the new domain account created in DomainB.</p>
<p>I've looked at making the mailbox a linked mailbox to the user account in DomainB which works but then I'm not able to migrate using the Office 365 console.</p>
<p>Really appreciate assistance with this.</p>

<p>Hi ScottMacdonald2839,</p>
<p>There is no Microsoft Official document to achieve your requirement.</p>
<p>Based on my knowledge, your steps are correct. However, since you are using 3rd party Migration Tool to migrate mailboxes, we may not appropriate to give further support.</p>
<p>Hope any community member can share their experience here if they have the same scenario.</p>
<p>Regards,<br />

    <title>Compare Docs issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rhuckerby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Compare Docs issue</h2>
                    <p>I'm having an issue with Word's Compare Documents function. that's driving me mad. Basically I go to Tools/Track Changes/Compare Documents and select the two documents to compare (let's call them document 1 and 2), with changes to be shown in a new document
 (3). I then click OK to start the compare and the new document 3 appears. As it appears you can clearly, but briefly, see coloured changes and balloons, but these almost immediately disappear and a clean document 3 remains with no changes showing. On investigation
 it's clear that what's happened is that changes in document 2 have been merged into document 1. This renders document 3 useless as a means of finding changes. I should add that I know for certain that there are differences between documents 1 and 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't get this on every document, but I haven't been able to identify a pattern to indicate what's different about documents where this problem occurs. With the latest occurrence I tried comparing documents 1 and 2 separately with a totally different document
 and that works fine, with red-lining and balloons showing as expected in the compare documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a Mac with OSX 10.6.8 and Word for Mac 2011, but I've also I've tried this with the same documents on a Windows 7 PC, running Word 2010 and I get the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on what might be the issue please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ThanksRoger<br />

    <title>OneDrive recurring sync issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> issacm  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive recurring sync issues</h2>
                    <p>Our company has Office 365 and we have been using OneDrive for about a year now with no major problems until now. Our operations manager holds the master file for our scheduling and he created a folder in his OneDrive and shared it to other employees who
 would regularly edit the file. The ops manager has had his files synced to his desktop for ease of access as have all other employees. This system we set up for editing the schedule worked for a few days then his computer started having syncing issues. I handle
 most of the tech issues for the company and could usually resolve most issues quickly but this one keeps causing problems. I have tried all suggested fixes such as re-linking the account, closing and reopening OneDrive on the desktop, closing it through task
 manager, and pretty much every other fix I can find on the web. The only thing that seems to work is exiting and reopening OneDrive but that solution only lasts about 1-3 minutes then it goes back to having syncing problems. I checked the internet connection,
 did a virus scan, reconfigured folders and everything seems fine but the OneDrive still does not connect. The weirdest thing was when I tried the reset command prompt (%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset) it tells me that the command cannot
 be executed. I searched for the root folder in another possible location but was unable to find it. Another thing to take into account is that we synced via the web app with the section on the tool bar that says sync to computer. This was how all the company
 devices were set up yet for some reason the ops managers computer shows two OneDrives in his file explorer on the left window pane whereas everyone else only has one. I figured it made one the personal OneDrive and the other the Business account but it turns
 out one is the app and the other is through the web app sync. Fortunately, the other employees can still edit and rename files but we need the ops manager to be able to edit as he makes 85% of the changes to the file to begin with. Any help will be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I have the same issue, you cannot get a refund because there is apparently no subscription, I have a record of the calls received while paying for the subscription confirming the right account but my account says i do not have a subscription so i cannot
 get a refund.</p>
<p>Now I cannot even get a live chat because that does not work.</p>
<p>trying to find a phone number to call but this is proving impossible too.</p>
<p>I love skype but this is getting very annoying</p>

<p>A kind community user shared with me today that tou have to click on this link and then click want refund. Then it will say do you want to chat with a live person. I finally was able to cancel. They will credit you back the last month but unfortunately not
 as long as we both have been trying to cancel. Im shocked that such a large company like this has customer aervice like this. Highly recommend using a new product.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;M.Paterson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Skype!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked the email you used to sign in to community and noticed that the subscription you want to be cancelled/refunded is your Skype number. You can view this subscription when you log in to Skype website using the correct Skype user name indicated
 on the order details our system sent to your email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're signed in to <a href="http://www.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype website</a> using the Skype user name provided on the order details &gt; Under Manage features &gt; Click on Skype number &gt; Settings &gt; Click on Cancel. By clicking the cancel button, it will only cancel the recurring payment of your subscription and that does
 not cancel the subscription itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For refund request, I would suggest to contact our chat support team for them to process your request. You may use this link:&nbsp;https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype &gt; I want a refund &gt; Click on Chat with Skype support.<br />

                    <p>We have a small DB with 8 fields very basic, wish to make it work with the runtime version for data entry people so we have built a PC just for testing WIN10 32bit it has no version of office on it just the runtime version for access 2016.&nbsp; In trying to
 open the xxx.accdb file we keep getting a security error message and if we try to run all we get is a blank access screen and can't go from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went so far as to recreate the database with Access 2007 and try that version of runtime and we get the same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to place the database file in a "Trusted Folder"&nbsp; &nbsp;IE&nbsp; &nbsp;C:/user/documents&nbsp; same error message</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>no folder is trusted if you didn't add it as trusted explicitely.</p>
<p>To do this you can go to <a href="https://www.accessribbon.de/?Sicherheit:Vertrauenswuerdige_Speicherorte" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this website</a>. It is German but&nbsp;that doesn't matter. Scroll down to the tool downloads for AddPath, choose the right version, download it, place it in the folder of your database and double click on the file in Win Explorer. This adds the folder to the Trusted
 Folders.</p>

<p>Looks like I have this going on the DB file was created on a 64bit machine both the laptop and desktop have 64bit Office.&nbsp; I don't see a way to tell what the file is as it can only be opened with the main machines not the test box with runtime on it.&nbsp; So
 I will do this pull out a old 32 bit version of office and install that on the test box and then remove it and try the runtime.&nbsp; &nbsp;The DB is simple and won't take long to do it.</p>

<p>First, Did you set a default form to load? What you describe sounds like the file is loading, but to a ballnk Access window. Since the Runtime does not show the Nav Pane or full ribbons, All you would see if the File tab unless you set a default form to
 load at startup. The same thing is true is you compile to accde. Unless you have a startup form, you get a blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do have a startup form, is there any code in the On Load or On Open events? If there is you need to error trap that code as it would appear it not running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, If the app was designed in 64 bit Access, then you need to use the 64 bit Runtime to run it.</p>

<p>I did nor set a form to open so did that and now after a go around with 2016 runtime we can get in. As I have a "click to run" version of office we can't use the 2016 runtime needed to rollback to 2013 and it works.</p>

</p><p>Now if the DB grows as it will I need to include a print report to it can a switchboard be used in place of a form in startup??&nbsp; &nbsp;I would think so have not done much with switchboard so am not up to speed with it.&nbsp; Thanks for the info on set default form
 as did not see anything online about that.</p>

<p>Ok, so the fact that there was no startup form was the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, of course you can use a switchboard or some other type of menu form as your default form. That is generally what happens. Access does have a built in Switchboard Manager, but you can create your own easily.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 install freezes on blue logo screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I'm trying to install Windows 10 preview on a spare laptop. It starts to install OK but after rebooting it gets stuck on a screen which bears only the Windows logo (solid blue). There is no other text or information at all on the screen and the logo is static
 (there are <strong>no </strong>"spinning dots" and <strong>no </strong>"getting ready" text mentioned in other posts. &nbsp;It stays like this all night with no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem occurs whether I install from Windows Update or from the DVD. &nbsp;If I reboot, Windows 7 boots up and the install process seems to have been cancelled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody have any ideas about how I can diagnose or fix this problem? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            It might not work if you do that because W10 is still in the experimental state. Try to defrag and shrink minimum space required for installation and see if that will work and you'll have a dual boot!<br />

<h2>            Emails sent on Android phone by IMAP are not in &#34;sent&#34; folder</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
On my android phone (5.0.2), my mail box is configured as IMAP. I can send and receive emails without troubles. However, if I send an email from my phone, the email is not in the "sent" folder. I have checked on the Outlook of my desktop PC and the Web interface
 of Outlook, and it's not there either.</p>
<p>I noticed a post of someone who describe exactly the same problem as mine, but the solution seems not found.</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/158/t/289163</p>
<p><br />
I need help please. And I cannot use activesync, I need IMAP.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

<p>hi benoitroue,</p>
<p>to troubleshoot the issue, i need some information below:</p>
<p>1. which mail app you are using on your phone, outlook for android, owa for android or any other app? you can upload screenshots about the mail app. to upload screenshots, select&nbsp;the
<b>use rich formatting </b>button in the forum, and then click&nbsp;<b>insert /edit media</b> like the screenshot shows below:</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=6067c26b-3602-44f9-aaa8-17da979c65ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d6067c26b-3602-44f9-aaa8-17da979c65ba" /></a></p>
<p>2. regarding “if i send an email from my phone, the email is not in the "sent" folder.<b>
</b>i have checked on the outlook of my desktop pc and the web interface of outlook, and it's not there either.”, do you mean that emails not in the
<b>sent</b> folder only when they were sent out from your phone but works well when sending out from the desktop outlook client on your pc and owa (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">outlook web app</a>)? if so, are emails move to the
<b>sent</b> folder on your phone if you sent them from the desktop outlook client on your pc and owa?</p>
<p>3. can you see which folder did the emails located after sending them out from your phone? if no, can the emails be searched in outlook client or owa?</p>
<p>4. have you tried to configure your office 365 account on another android phone to test if the issue persists? if not, please test it and then let us know the result.</p>
<p>5. regarding “<em>i cannot use activesync</em>”, could you please provide us with the detailed information about why you can’t use activesync? is there any problem when using activesync?</p>
<p>regards,<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>1. The email app is the stock app from Samsung on Galaxy S4.</p>
<p>2. I mean that emails are not in "Sent" folder only when I send out by phone. If I send emails by PC or OWA, I they are well in the "Sent" folder of my phone.</p>
<p>3. After sending an email from Phone, I can't find it nowhere, even by starting a search in OWA. These emails are lost</p>
<p>4. no other phone to make the test. However, I have Gmail account on the same phone and it is configured as IMAP, and there is not this problem.</p>
<p>5. I don't want Activesync for personal reasons. Why IMAP cannot work?</p>

 in the chat and I get the notification but every time I click on it I am just redirected to another chat. They also can't unadd me from the group since I am the admin. Please help this is a very important group chat.

    <title>Subdomain in single tenant - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joniseth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Subdomain in single tenant</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; We used to have our student accounts in a separate Office 365 tenant, and everything they used was online, no Office program installations anywhere. Our instructors had an account created in our Hybrid Exchange and our "main" tenant, then had an account
 added online to the student tenant. When they worked in their Teams, they used the student tenant accounts, and everything was separate and tidy. We now can only use one tenant as we have signed up for EES licensing. One of our teachers expressed the concern
 that when he will be using his classroom Team, that all of the student files that will eventually be shared with him will be combined with all of the "non-student" files (from administration, staff, etc) in his OneDrive Shared With Me and will be difficult
 to manage. </p>
<p>&nbsp; We were wondering if there is a way to "separate" out the student accounts, maybe by using a subdomain in our tenant? I've read many of the articles about adding subdomains in an Office 365 tenant, but can't quite get my head around if this would be any
 help at all. I also don't see the value in putting the students in a separate forest, but I'm no expert in this. Would anyone have any suggestions? Does our objective make sense? Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Joni,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding "the documents in our SharePoint that we had shared with the permissions of "everyone except external users" now are also visible to the students who of course were not previously in our domain."</p>
<p>We'd like to explain that when your tenant has added several domains, it is expected all users in the same
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my opinion, the best practice to separately manage the students files and non-students files on the teacher side are the followings:</p>
<p>When students want to share/submit files to teacher, let they do not share files via OneDrive for business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the teacher and students are communicating in Teams, students can upload files to the
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note</span>: when students upload their files, they need to rename the file name as
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ce9f8d7-9156-4568-8275-8a7ca25b79fd?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ce9f8d7-9156-4568-8275-8a7ca25b79fd?upload=true" height="164" width="591" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>All the files uploaded by students will be saved in the <span style="font-weight: bold">

<h2>            Visio Database Plug-in&#47;Template</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This might be a shot in the dark, but is there by any chance a way one can map (Oracle) database objects to .NET classes (preferably c#) for use with Visio? I am working on a project where I have to load database information into visio and allow users (without
 authentication) edit, create or delete this information. I already know how to get objects from the database and use them within the ASP .NET framework, but I do not know how to "convert" them into Visio elements (the type of elements one works with while
 using Visio for drawing diagrams and such). My programming language is c#, so I would prefer answers that imply the use of this language. Thank you!</p>

<p>In Visio Professional (and with 2010, also in Premium), there are two separate solutions for doing Database schema diagrams and UML model diagrams.&nbsp; However, they are not able to work together in the way that you describe.&nbsp; If you want to create a comprehensive
 Database diagram using the Reverse Engineering capability of the "Database Model Diagram", you could possibly create your own shapes to represent the classes and essentially annotate the schema diagram.&nbsp; But this would not be easy, and neither the DB model
 solution or the UML model solution have public APIs, so you can't automate either one.</p>
<p>There are likely other modeling tools that will get you much closer than Visio will out of the box.&nbsp; Just by searching on "Model database and C# classes", I found several sites that you can scan for more information :<a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=model+database+and+C%23+classes&amp;form=QBRE&amp;qs=n&amp;sk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bing.com/search?q=model+database+and+C%23+classes&amp;form=QBRE&amp;qs=n&amp;sk</a>=</p>
<p>If you really want to have a go at creating your own solution, I suggest you start with the Visio SDK.&nbsp; For Visio 2010, the SDK can be viewed / download starting from here :<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff758690.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff758690.aspx</a></p>

<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Do you mean that you have overall 2500 emails r you have received that amount in couple of minutes ? Please provide more detail explanation. Also please mention of those emails are from one sender or different ones ?
<br />
<br />If you have disabled focus inbox, all emails were brought to inbox, so you will find them all there.

            Hello Mary-BethDoria,
<br />
<br />I am sorry to hear that your inbox has been swarmed with tens of thousands of e-mails in Outlook. Can I check, are they your past emails?
<br />
<br />If they are your past emails, and you are using POP3, it could be a corruption in your .pst file and the following solution might be helpful to you:
<br />
<br /><pre><code>it is applicable for all who are using "leave a copy to server" option
1. Create one folder in live mailbox. (I named it as Downloaded)
2. Move all mail from your inbox to this folder which are already downloaded to your .pst fille.
Now your outlook will stop downloading duplicate entries.
Remember to move your Inbox items to the newly created folder.
In future if your local pst is lost or damaged then, in live mailbox move all mails to Inbox and create a new outlook profile; your all mails again will be available in pst.</code></pre>
<br />

            Don't store an active pst file in OneDrive. It can lead to corruption and lost mail. You can store a backup in it (if you have space) but should copy it to a folder outside of onedrive to use it. 
<br />
<br />Do you have a godaddy account that supports IMAP? That would allow you to have the same email on all devices, including sent messages. It won't sync calendar and contacts though.  
<br />
<br />Better would be an office 365 exchange mailbox - godaddy is an office 365 reseller or you can buy directly from Microsoft for as little as $4/month for email-only ($5 for additional business services). This will sync calendar, contacts, tasks, mail to all devices. (IMHO, I think going directly through microsoft is a better deal.)
<br />
<br />Another option is an Outlook.com account but you can't use your custom domain with outlook.com. 
<br />
<br />Finally, there are sync utilities to sync the desktop and laptop. See <a href="https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/sync-outlook/synchronizing-outlook-on-two-machines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slipstick.com/outlook/sync-outlook/...</a> for a list.

            From the description, you have the email account(s) configured as a POP3 account which does not sync data across devices. POP3 only downloads &lt;Inbox&gt; data to the local device where the PST is stored.
<br />
<br />To sync all your data (email, contacts, calendar etc) you would need to either use an Outlook.com or hosted Exchange account (i.e. Office 365 email account).
<br />
<br />Some background info on email account protocols

<br />
<br />As a sidenote, storing PST files on OneDrive that are actively being using by Outlook on a device is not supported and can lead to file corruption.

            Are both systems configured identically as in
<br />- both are configured to the same &lt;Root&gt; folder in Account Advanced settings (Root folder set to &lt;Inbox&gt;
<br />- both are set to save &lt;Sent tiems&gt; (also in Advanced Settings)
<br />
<br />Also in the interests of time - kind of confused as to what the actual question/issue/problem is given the original post about requiring everything to be sync'd across devices as well as being able to work offline. In addition, just as an observation, Imap accounts don't use PST files in OL'2013/'2016 so the original reference to these files on OneDrive are offline backup files....or......?

            The sent items folder should sync - it did when i tested it with a godaddy account. (I logged into webmail to see if it synced up). 
<br />
<br />Right click on the email account name in the folder list and choose IMAP folders, the click Query. Is the Sent Items folder marked with a folder icon? If so, it syncs. 
<br />
<br />Are you saving sent items? If sent items are not showing up on the computer that sent them, its turned off. Go to file, double click on the account then click More Settings. The option to save sent mail is on the Advanced tab. (It should be on for all imap accounts except gmail.)

<h2>            Password reset issues and problems</h2>
                    Hello Microsoft,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To be honest I am sick and tired of the back and forth trying to reset password of my personal email account. I've literally gone mad and nothing is working to be honest. First of all I don't know why I got the message when trying to sign in with my email
 *** Email address is removed for privacy ***'&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><u>"We've detected something unusual about this sign-in. For example, you might be signing in from a new location, device, or app."</u></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just deleted my browser history and then tried to sign in from the browser and got the message above, whereas i sign-in everyday with the same password and never had to face an error. On the other hand I do have my account configured on Microsoft Outlook
 application.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then when i got this message i tried to reset my password by filling in the questionnaire form managed to do that and recieved an email verification and asking to reset password the moment i clicked the link enter my new password i got a message Session
 Timed out "THE LINK HAS EXPIRED" I literally took less than 20 seconds to enter my new password and came up with that insane message. I tried this whole process again and the same message appeared AGAIN! I tried the third now it's giving me the following</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You've reached the limit for account recovery requests"</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span></div>
<div><font color="#000000"><span>seriously</span></font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;i am very frustrated with all this nonsense. please advise!!!</span></div>

            I just had similar issue, trying to sign in to Skype with my old MSN/LIVE account details. "We've detected something unusual about this sign-in."etc. When asked to fill in a form to identify myself, and even answering the security question, I got turned
 down, not enough information to verify you...seriously, acct name, password and even security question correctly filled in. Followed by the link expired and the reaching the limit for recovery requests, "try again in 24 hours."&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>My acct name was correct, my password was correct, yet it blocked me as there is "something unusual".. and even answering the security question correctly, I still got turned down. I have been using this sign-on with MSN/live for maybe 15 years, and it
 migrated to Skype. It was not based on a hotmail or outlook account, so they can't verify recent emails. And I can't find a human connection yet.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It appears I just have to update my 2ndary email account reference, but no opportunity found to do so. I count to 10 and wait 24 hours and try again to access what has been already working for years.</div>

            I see, but in my case after filling the questionnaire form I got an email from Microsoft accepting that the information i provided was spot on and they give me a link to reset password. It is from here onwards i face problems with the link "session timed
 out" even though I enter a new password in less than 20 sec. It shouldnt do that!!!

            OK, understood.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Mainly a date-coincident automatic block message received on the same day 16 Dec 2013:</div>
<div><u>"We've detected something unusual about this sign-in. For example, you might be signing in from a new location, device, or app."</u></div>
<div><br />
<div>My "un-block" requires an update to my secondary email reference.</div>
