<h2>            Power View Error HRESULT E_FAIL</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have MS Office Professional Plus 2016. I wanted to check Power View and I added it in. When I try to use it I get the error:</p>
<p>"Error HRESULT E-FAILhas been returned from a call to a COM component."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on a PC with Windows 10 Pro. Any ideas why Power View is not working? Thank you in advance for any help.</p>

    <title>Mac WORD 2016&#58; Disappearing footnotes and appearing chart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> disciphone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mac WORD 2016&#58; Disappearing footnotes and appearing chart info&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I would really appreciate help with these two problems as they have been tormenting me for a long time and are hindering my ability to provide work to my client.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded from 2011 to 2016 in hopes that a 64-bit version would get rid of the demons I have been struggling with, but so far no luck. I have two issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I'm editing a thesis. Footnotes often do not display properly. Usually, I cannot view them but in 2016 I actually have one bleeding over to the footnotes section of the following page. In the past, I have been able to save the file and it goes away, but
 promptly returns. I should note that my client is on an older version of Word (PC), which may be making things worse. How do I fix this more than temporarily?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The chapter of the thesis that I am working on now has graphs (I do not know how they were created or inserted). I have not edited any chart, yet at random times a brown text box will appear on my screen. The text has something to do with the chart, such
 as "vertical axis" or "Argentina 1998," but it doesn't appear over the chart. It will stay in place on my screen as I scroll text. I cannot select it or move it. Then it will, seemingly at random, disappear. I cannot connect the appearance and disappearance
 of the text boxes (it's not the same one, it seems to be different each time) to anything that I have done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to search for help on these, but so far have not found anything that has worked. If someone could kindly direct me to a solution for these, I would be very grateful!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi DISCiPhone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this file was created in an older version of Word, then this might be the root of the issue, such as &nbsp;a result of an older file type being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest copying over the content of the thesis into a new document, save it, and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does, we suggest using the new document from now on, and make sure that the client can open it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Sheen</p>

<h2>            Sent emails are not showing up in the Sent folder in Outlook.com &#40;Outlook Mail&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>I just started using Outlook.com, with a connected account. I've noticed that emails that I'm sending&nbsp;are not being saved in the Sent folder. Also, there doesn't seem to be an option in the Options panel to tell Outlook.com to do so. So how do I get copies
 of my sent emails to be saved? I'm using Windows 10 Home and Internet Explorer 11. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            I've only tried accessing my Outlook account using Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. It happens in both browsers. Also, I've already deleted the history and nothing has changed. I've narrowed down the situation. It only happens when I use a connected
 account's email address to send emails. If I use my outlook.com email address to send, it does save a copy of the sent email in my Sent folder. However, I didn't want to use that address to send, which is why I connected my other email account to begin with.

    <title>How do I install Office Starter 2010 on Windows 8&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> formburden  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I install Office Starter 2010 on Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    I looked online and apparently you have to install Office Starter 2010 before upgrading to Windows 8 from 7 to actually use it. Before I went to Windows 8 I had to reinstall my computer for specific reasons, and I had no idea nor did I remember to open
 office starter before upgrading to Windows 8. Anyway, is there any way to install Office Starter 2010 on Windows 8? I mean when I try and activate Office Starter 2010 I get an error that states you have to have SP1 Vista or higher. Is there some kind of update/thing
 I can install to fix it so I can install it, because all I really need is Excel and Word so there is no point in buying the entire package, even if I did buy the whole package I don't even know if it would work anyway, since I can't install Office Starter
 2010.<br />
<br />
Anyone know anything I can do? Thanks in advance! <br />

            It is my understanding that there will be no Office Starter included with Windows 8. Instead it will be replaced by Office web Apps.

<h2>            Outlook.com&#47;People contacts not syncing to iPhone</h2>
                    <p>I have just recently switched all of my contacts on my phone from Gmail over to Outlook.com. I exported from Gmail, and imported into Outlook.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They all show up just fine in the People app on Outlook.com and my Windows 8 laptop - however, half of them are missing on my iPhone when they sync. I set up my account using the "Hotmail" option just as the steps said to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure where to go from here.</p>

            After looking through all these replies, its clear, (from what I saw), the moderators have not given an answer to the OP, rather they seem to be trying to do what I will explain below.
<div><br />
<div>Outlook.com will not sync contacts to your iPhone that have been imported from Gmail. There is something about the connection between Outlook.com and Google that will not allow them to play nice together. To remedy this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Export your gmail contacts to a .csv and save to your computer.</div>
<div>2. Log into Outlook.com and disconnect the link between google and your Outlook.com account entirely. (log into Outlook.com, on the top right side of your screen click on your name and choose edit profile, under your name on the top right side you will
 not see the services you are connected to. Click the Google icon and choose Disconnect Entirely).</div>
<div>3. After you have disconnected your google account from Outlook.com check your contacts. If the Google contacts are still there, delete them all. If it doesnt delete them all and says they are connected to another service, verify you no longer have google
 connected to Outlook.com.</div>
<div>Once your contacts section is cleared out, go ahead and import the .csv you saved earlier.</div>
<div>4. ON YOUR iPHONE: go into the mail settings and switch the contacts tab OFF. Wait a second, then switch it back ON.</div>
<div>Your contacts will now sync.&nbsp;</div>

            The short answer is yes, but having recently updated my web site (around 100 pages), I found it worth starting from scratch with a new layout to take advantage of the features of Expression Web - in particular producing a range of standard templates for
 the different file types. It was then easier to import the text and images from the old site to the new one. Nevertheless there is a fairly steep learning curve and it took several days to complete the work, and users still report the odd anomaly, but I can
 now make changes fairly quickly, and easily alter the appearance of the whole site should it be required.<br />
<br />
I was also quite pleased how it looked on an iPad (though that had not been a consideration).<br />

            Hi, sorry, the question is incomplete because I had not been able to type, and have the phone respond. I can't train Cortana. She doesn't recognise my iris, doesn't wake up to 'Hey Cortana ' doesn't actually offer any assistance. She used to say that it
 was time to set off to appointments in my calendar. Currently she is nothing more than a very annoying app that comes to life when I accidentally hit the search icon and then takes ages to close. In my car she is a very slow interface with the Bluetooth and
 of course no use at all without 4G. Before I bought the phone I read so much about how she could become an integral part of my life and that was what I wanted. It just hasn't happened at all. Thanks so much for responding , kind regards Claire

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got this<strong> </strong>message again.</p>
<p>I thought I fixed the problem but didn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have a<strong> tblApplicant: lngAppID-AutoNumber/ strFirstname-Text/ strlastName-Text/ dtmApplyDate-Date/ strAddress-Text,and so on.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a <strong>tblApplicantJobHistory: lngJobhistoryID-AutoNumber/ lngAppID-Number/strCompanyName-Text/ dtmDateOfHire-Date/ dtmDateOfTerm-Text/</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>tblApplicant and tblApplicanJobHistory are one to many relationship because one applicant has many jobs before applying.</p>
<p>lngAppID is the foreign key,am I right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I made a Form for tblApplicant and&nbsp; I used the tblApplicantJobHistory for subform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I input some data to the subform(tblApplicantJobHistory), I got that message.</p>
<p>I can't save the data that I tried to input.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What was wrong?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I access Outlook through web browsers: sometimes through Microsoft Explorer (Edge), sometimes through Google Chrome. The wrong picture appers in emails through both browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've configured my outlook adress with my iPhone, but I have not added a photo to the phone access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My outlook (hotmail) account is associated with Facebook, but my Facebook photo does NOT show up in my hotmail email, which it should. I've placed that photo as my outlook/hotmail photo, but for some reason, it keeps using an old photo, which I've NEVER
 added to my outlook/hotmail profile. Where is it getting that old photo??</p>

    <title>Excel&#58; Close book &#38; Auto Save after Idle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> allanfatzinger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel&#58; Close book &#38; Auto Save after Idle</h2>
                    <p>There was a workbook previously created in Excel 2007 in our office that would auto save and close a document after 10 min if an employee was idle. Recently everyone was switched to Excel 2010 and documents copied over. The macro seems to be working the&nbsp;userform
 box shows up to "click to continue working or sheet will close" The problem I am running into is that the document does not save and close even if the userform box is not clicked unless the excel window is the active window on desktop. Employees are in other
 programs and the document is not closing down, locking everyone else out. The maco is written as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Public BootTime As Date<br />
Public Timer2Active As Boolean</p>
<p>Sub StartTimer()<br />
' Start the Activity Timer<br />
BootTime = Now + TimeValue("00:10:00")<br />
' If the Activity Timer runs for the specified time<br />
' call the "CloseBook" sub<br />
Application.OnTime BootTime, "CloseBook"<br />
End Sub<br />
Sub CloseBook()<br />
' At this point the main Timer has elapsed.<br />
' Display and let the UserForm take charge.<br />
UserForm1.Show<br />
End Sub<br />
Sub ReallyCloseBook()<br />
If Timer2Active = False Then Exit Sub<br />
Unload UserForm1<br />
ThisWorkbook.Save<br />
' Application.Quit<br />
ThisWorkbook.Close<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wondering if there needs to be an adjustment with 2010, or what may be causing this. Any help or tips is appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Additional Insider Preview downloads - How to use&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have downloaded and installed Insider Preview 15025 via the ISO on this page: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are six additional ISOs on that page. I have downloaded one&nbsp;of them: "Language Pack Bundle Insider Preview – Build 15025".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have mounted the&nbsp;ISO&nbsp;in Preview 15025, but I don't know how to initiate the install of the Japanese Language Pack. I&nbsp;assumed that an app would start when the ISO was mounted, but this did not&nbsp;occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have located the Japanese language pack on this ISO: "Microsoft-Windows-Client-Language-Pack_x64_ja-jp". It is a Cabinet file. Double clicking on it just opens the folder to show its contents, but nothing executes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How&nbsp;do I proceed to install the Japanese language pack?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>On a running system, go to Settings - Time &amp; language - Region &amp; language Add a language and select Japanese from the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The off-line&nbsp;language features in the ISO are meant to be used with dism to add language features to an install&nbsp;image. So you could add Japanese to the install.wim found in the downloaded 19025 ISO.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 free trial - went to cancel and it says it&#39;s been paid for</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to cancel my office 365 one month free trial before I got charged for a subscription, only to be informed that it has been paid for until 2/1/2017. I don't want it and didn't want to pay for it as I have a disk copy of office 2016 I want to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I find out how/why the money was taken and get it back? It says it was paid for by a 'prepaid' card. I'm in the UK and I've never heard of a 'prepaid' card is that equivalent to a debit card?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks</p>
<p>

 the entire Office Suite, i.e., no way to uninstall just Word or Outlook) and then install Office 2003?&nbsp; I have some mission-critical work and cannot take the time to figure out how to do it with Word 2010.&nbsp;

<div>It's generally advised that you install Office components in order, so yes, it would be preferable to uninstall Office 2010, install Word/Office 2003, and then reinstall Office 2010. You will not lose any of your data, which will not be
 affected, but you will need to find a backup copy of your Word 2003 Normal.dot if you had it customized.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>This may not be necessary, however. What is it that you cannot figure out how to do in Word 2010? Surely someone here can help.</span></div>

<p>There is a little more to running parallel versions that install oldest first here are a couple of links that go into detail on how to make it work best. One of the Key "Gotcha's" of running parallel versions is that you can have only 1 outlook installed,
 you pick the version.</p>
<p>Yes there is provision for uninstalling individual programs. In Programs &amp; Features you do a Change, then you can selelct which programs you want to install or uninstall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, the clipboard is missing under the Home tab. We need to confirm some information to clarify your situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Could you please provide a screenshot to clarify what clipboard icon you mentioned?</p>
<p>2. You can go to <strong>Excel/Word &gt; Preferences &gt; Ribbon &amp; Toolbar</strong>, to customize the Ribbon to display Clipboard under
<strong>Home</strong> tab.</p>
<p>

    <title>Fillable form Word 2103 content control - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timhendrickson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fillable form Word 2103 content control</h2>
                    <p><span>I have created fillable forms in Word 2013 using the modern content controls and the group feature to lock document to only the content control. The forms have content control that will not always
 be filled out leaving the placeholder text "Click her to&nbsp;enter text"&nbsp;in place. When you print the document either to paper or PDF the placeholder text is included in the printing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I found this article
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/content_controls_do_not_print_pht.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/content_controls_do_not_print_pht.html</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And used method 1 which works fine however it involved modifying the normal I need to have this carry across with word file from computer to computer. I have not been able to make the methods
 described work when I copy the file from computer to computer and when I try to add the custom VBA modules to my form when I try to save it tells me I can not save to a macro free document so I save form as a macro enabled document and still prints the placeholder
 text only way I get the placeholder text not to print is o modify the normal template.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So I am looking for a way not to print empty content control in word 2013 that is part of the form not word so file can be copied to other computers.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Any help would be great</span></p>

            For a form that you are distributing, it would probably be better to use Method 3 on Greg's site.&nbsp; (You will have to distribute the form as a .docm file however).

            Thanks for the response I have tried that method did not seem to work for me perhaps I did not do right however, but think I did. The only method I got not to print the placeholder text was method 1 I am no expert by any means but generally do get things
 to work. Perhaps I need a more detailed step by step to deploy method 3 and have it work.

            <p>Greg's site does really give all that you need.&nbsp; However, you will get less confused if you insert the Content Controls in the Document, before you copy and paste the code into the This Document Module.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason that I say that is because, if you already have the code in the this document module when you insert a content control and then exit from that control, the placeholder text will disappear and you may wonder if you have inserted the control or
 not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only proviso on the use of this method is that you must exit from the content control for the placeholder text to "disappear"</p>
<p>
</p><p>With respect to the use of Method I, I believe that I am correct in saying that the only alternative to modifying the Normal.dotm template, is to create another macro enabled template (.dotm) and save that in the user's Word\Startup folder so that it is
 treated as an Add-in and the code in it will be available to all documents (and to re-start Word after saving it there).&nbsp; That means that in addition to distributing your form, you would also need to distribute the dotm add-in and, from my experience, get
 users to save such an add-in in the right place can be a bit of an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to send me a copy of your form, I will set up Method III in it for you.</p>

            <p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are unable to update Windows 10 TP. I will be glad to help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us try the methods below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Disconnect all external devices except keyboard and mouse, disable your antivirus software and then try to install the update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue persists proceed with method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Run Windows Update troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try to run the Windows Update troubleshooter that will automatically fix some common problems with Windows Update.

<p>
</p><p>If issue persists proceed with method 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> There could be a possibility that third party program could cause this conflict hence put the computer in Clean boot and install the update.

    <title>Windows 10 Windows Defender vs Other Third-Party Security Tools - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> semian m. s. kanimarani  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Windows Defender vs Other Third-Party Security Tools - Equitable Comparison</h2>
                    <p><span>Many people compare or read a comparison between Windows Defender with third-party's Internet Security, Total Security and so on. Most of these comparisons are not equitable because these tools have antivirus as well as other security tools such as
 Firewalls, Internet security and others, while Windows Defender is just an&nbsp;antivirus program.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What Windows built-in security services </strong><strong>are </strong>
<strong>included and enabled by default?</strong></p>
<p><span>Windows Defender is an&nbsp;</span><span>antivirus software that protects your system against viruses, malware,
</span>spywares and network threats<span>.&nbsp;It is&nbsp;a Windows Service that works with other Microsoft security and maintenance services such as Windows Firewall and Microsoft SmartScreen (which is Internet security: phishing and malware filter used in several
 Microsoft products including Internet Explorer, Hotmail and Microsoft Edge). All of these services are enabled by default and starts at system startup, of course, if you do not have installed a
</span>third-party <span>security software. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you install a third party security tool, Windows turns off its corresponding security service. For instance, Windows turns off Windows Defender automatically when you install a third party antivirus and you cannot turn it back on because Windows
 Defender settings become inactive unless you uninstall the third party antivirus.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, security updates and critical updates protect against vulnerabilities to malware and security exploits. By default these updates are downloaded and installed by Windows Update service automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Moreover, Windows Update takes care of updating Windows Defender automatically. Updating Windows Defender does not require system restart.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Finally, take </span><span>in your consideration that Microsoft security tools are built into the Windows operating system and fully compatible, reliable and working smoothly with fewest bugs and side effects</span>.<span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>How to schedule Windows Defender to run system scan?</strong></p>
<p><span>By default, Windows Defender is&nbsp;scheduled to run quick scan as part of daily basis Windows Automatic Maintenance job when the system is in idle status. When the task is missed or interrupted by the user (when the user returned to use the computer),
 the system re-runs the scan</span><span>&nbsp;the next time the system goes to idle status</span><span> (re-runs the scan from beginning and does not resume&nbsp;it from the point it stopped last time).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To see what tasks are included in the system Automatic Maintenance, change the time or run the system maintenance manually in Windows 10, open "Security and Maintenance" window in Windows Control Panel (or type Security and Maintenance in the search
 box near to the Start menu). Then expand Maintenance section to see the Automatic Maintenance.
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Security and Maintenance -&gt; Maintenance -&gt; Automatic Maintenance</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows Task Scheduler service is used to schedule a Windows Defender system scan. Do not change the default quick scan to full system scan. Microsoft, the system builder and developer, sets all necessary settings of security and maintenance tasks
 to give you&nbsp;the best over-all system security and performance for most consumers to perform their normal daily works.</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 10: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/schedule-a-scan-in-windows-defender" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/schedule-a-scan-in-windows-defender</span></a></p>
<p><span>Windows 8 (More detailed with screenshots - Same procedures&nbsp;for Windows 10):
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/schedule-scans-in-windows-defender" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/schedule-scans-in-windows-defender</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There is no need for, and I do not recommend, a daily full system scan. This (full scan) takes more computer resources for a long time and slows down your system performance. In my opinion, the best practice to perform a full system scan is when you
 feel that your system is infected by a virus or when you clicked on a suspicious link online or in an email message and the quick scan did not solve the problem. In these cases, run the full system scan manually. If you want, you can run the&nbsp;full system scan
 from time to time (once a month for instance) manually. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Although, you don’t need to schedule a full system scan, you can setup your own scheduled task to perform a full system scan and, again, don’t change the&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;default settings. For this purpose, use Windows Task Scheduler tool.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To run a Quick, Full or Custom&nbsp;scan manually, open Windows Defender then from the main page (Home) select a scan option and click "Scan now" button to start&nbsp;the scan.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Who needs to change built-in security tools?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Maybe, you need to change some of default settings, built-in tools and/or use additional security tools using higher-rated 3rd-party software, if you are working on public place and using many of others possibly infected external memories (such as
 Flash drives and External HDDs), connecting to an unsafe public Wi-Fi frequently, opening unknown and dangerous websites, playing with hackers or visiting their websites (maybe for downloading, installing or testing some illegal apps), visiting porn websites,
 and/or downloading and testing apps from unknown sources. In these cases, you are exposing to viruses and external attacks from hackers more than usual.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>Although, for many of these cases, Windows built-in security tools with default settings are good enough to block these external attacks, you can use higher-rated 3rd-party tools and/or antiviruses depending on the case you have.<span>&nbsp;

<p><span>To increase your system security, if you want, you can install Malwarebytes Anti-Malware as a precaution.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Why we prefer third-party antiviruses?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>There are some key points that most consumers prefer third-party antiviruses:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Virus and Spyware Protection:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Most of higher rated third-party antiviruses, as I saw, give you around 5% to 15% more virus detection capability than Windows Defender. If you want to play with hackers or visit unknown and dangerous websites, then you need higher
 rated antivirus and firewall to protect your computer. The thing that most of people do not.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Virus Scan Speed</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Many of higher rated antiviruses scans for viruses faster than Windows Defender. However this is an advantage, but you will not do a full scan for viruses every day. There are situations that you need to scan a driver or full computer
 scan such as when you feel that your system not working properly and the quick scan did not solve the problem. Maybe, this happens once in several months and sometimes a quick-scan solves the problem, if your antivirus includes this option.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Resource Usage</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Some antiviruses needs less system CPU and memory usage to protect your pc. Although, Windows Defender has good system resource usage, some third-party software give higher rating in some tests.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>What are the advantages of Windows Defender and Windows security system?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you want to choose between Windows built-in security and a third-party security software, take the following points&nbsp;into&nbsp;consideration that many people do not think about.</span></p>
<ol>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows security </span><span>tools including Windows Defender, Windows Firewall and Microsoft SmartScreen are fully integrated in Windows operating system and working in the background. You will not even&nbsp;feel that they exist in
 normal conditions.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">When you upgrade your Windows to a newer version or install an update of current version, Windows security services are updated as well. Many third-party antiviruses have some issues when you upgrade your Windows or, sometimes,
 when you apply some updates to current version, and some of them stop working </span>
completely<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Quick-scan&nbsp;checks the places on your computer's hard disk that spyware is most likely to infect.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows Defender has a feature called Real-Time Protection (RTP). RTP is running in the context of the logged-on user. It monitors the registry and file system on the computer by using agents that monitor auto-start extensibility
 points (ASEP). RTP continuously monitors your computer and scans everything you download or run on your PC.
</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">
</p><p><span>Although, many other third-party systems have this feature (RTP) and/or quick-scan option, RTP in Windows Defender with the&nbsp;default scheduled quick-scan&nbsp;kills some advantages of other higher rated&nbsp;third-party antiviruses such as lower system resource
 usage, and higher scan speed. With the existence of RTP and scheduled quick-scan, you do not need full system scan and startup scan because the RTP and quick-scan do the job. Therefore, the higher rated “higher speed of&nbsp;full system&nbsp;scan” and “lower system
 resource usage” are no longer advantages of third-party antiviruses. This is because you do not need startup scan and full system scan anymore except in some situations, such as when you feel that you system is infected and quick scan did not solve the problem,
 you perform a custom or full system scan depending on the case you face.</span></p>
<ol>
</ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Summary:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you want to compare or read a comparison between Microsoft security system with other
</span>third-party <span>security systems, such as Internet Security and Total Security tools, you have to consider Windows Defender along with Windows Firewall, Microsoft SmartScreen, Windows Update, and Windows Schedule Tasks all together to get accurate
 and reliable results.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Recommendations</strong><span><strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If you want to give a priority to higher security, then choose a higher-rated third-party security software. In the&nbsp;other hand, if you want to use your computer for your daily business and give the priority to higher</span>&nbsp;over-all<span>&nbsp;system&nbsp;performance
 and reliability with good security level, then the best choice for you is Windows built-ins security including Windows Defender, Windows Firewall and Microsoft SmartScreen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not on a public Wi-Fi, Windows Firewall does its job efficiently and you don't need to install a third party firewall.
<span>If you&nbsp;chose to use a third-party product&nbsp;and you are not on a public Wi-Fi and you do not need extra services included in the third-party security systems, it is enough to get an anti-virus&nbsp;rather than a complete security set.&nbsp;For example, use ESET NOD32
<span>If you&nbsp;chose to use a third-party product&nbsp;and you are not on a public Wi-Fi and you do not need extra services included in the third-party security systems, it is enough to get an anti-virus&nbsp;rather than a complete security set.&nbsp;For example, use ESET NOD32
 Antivirus instead of ESET SmartSecurity or&nbsp;Bitdefender Antivirus instead of Bitdefender Internet/Total Security</span><span>.
</span>Moreover, these extra tools usually slow down the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In my personal opinion, I recommend to stay on Microsoft built-in security system&nbsp;for a while, and do not purchase any third-party product because, as I see, most of them (if not all) have issues on windows 10 and they are not fully stable on the newly&nbsp;released
 operating system. </span><span>After a couple of weeks, maybe you will find more stable security systems in the market. Then you can decide whether you want to use one of them or stay on Windows built-in security system – the most stable security system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you decided to stay on Windows built-in systems, you can improve your system security by using some of additional free tools. When you feel your system is infected or attacked:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Scan your system with ESET Online Scanner (free) to scan for malwares (viruses, spywares and Trojans) that Windows Defender could not catch.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.eset.co.nz/for-home/products/eset-online-scanner/#tab-1=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.eset.co.nz/for-home/products/eset-online-scanner/#tab-1=1</span></a></p>
<p>You can use any other vendor’s equivalent system you trust.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Use Malwarebytes Anti-Malware (free edition), or any equivalent software,&nbsp;to scan for spywares in your system on demand. The premium version (paid) has Real-Time-Protection that monitors you system along with Windows security systems
 with no conflicts, according to Malwarebytes website.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Many people compares Windows Defender with 3ed party's Internet Security, Total Security and so on. Most of these comparisons are not equitable because these tools have antivirus as well as other security tools such as Firewalls,
 Internet security and others, while Windows Defender is just Anti-Malware program.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows Defender is a Windows Service that works with other Microsoft security and maintenance services such as Windows Firewall and Microsoft SmartScreen (which is Internet security: phishing and malware filter used in several
 Microsoft products including Internet Explorer, Hotmail and Microsoft Edge). All of these services are enabled by default and starts at system startup, of course, if you do not have installed a 3ed party security software.
<br />
If you have installed a security tool, the Windows corresponding security tool stops working. For instance, if you have installed a 3ed party antivirus, Windows Defender stops working. If you have installed a 3ed party firewall, Windows disables Windows Firewall.
 Same thing is true for Microsoft SmartScreen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Although, you do not need to setup a custom schedule scan for Windows Defender, you can serve Task Scheduler to schedule Windows Defender scan at any time you want.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Moreover, Windows Update takes care of updating Windows Defender automatically. Updating Windows Defender does not require system restart.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Finally, take in your consideration that Microsoft security tools are built into&nbsp;the Windows operating system and fully compatible, reliable and working smoothly with least bugs and side effects.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Summary:<br />
If someone wants to compare between Microsoft security system with other security systems, such as Internet Security and Total Security tools from other 3ed party companies, he/she has to include Windows Defender along with Windows Firewall, Microsoft SmartScreen,
 Windows Update, and Windows Schedule Tasks all together to get accurate and reliable results.</span></p>

<p>Windows Defender does not shut itself off if you have a third party software installed. I HAVE a third party software and have to go in every time I logon and turn Defender off. This is a terrible way to have this setup. Just because grandma can't protect
 her computer without help, does not mean the rest of us are incompetent. This should NOT be set to on by default, and certainly, if it is, I should have the option of turning it off permanently.

            <p>After discovering recently that a top Antivirus Internet security company had been hacked I removed there software.</p>
<p>I checked the Windows firewall with GRC shields up can't recall if it went into true stealth mode immediately or after a couple of scans but it does the job</p>
<p>whereas the 3rd party software was unable to learn it kept failing don't know why.</p>
<p>I do run a malwarebytes app as a precaution, runs fine alongside windows security tools supplied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figure if someone wants to hack in to your computer doesn't matter what you do, if they know what their doing they'll get in anyway. All these large companies spending bucket loads of money throwing it at the problem still get done over by stupidity.</p>

            <p>Rule number 1 is <strong>don't user Windows Defender </strong>unless you aren't going to pay for an antivirus software solution. Windows Defender is now classified as the base or benchmark for antivirus / anti malware, it stops less than 80% of viruses and
 malware that get in. Please think about using a paid solution or at the very least use a free version of a paid solution.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Of course you can use your own paid or free antivirus software but there is no rule says that don’t use some free antivirus unless you aren't going to pay for an antivirus software solution.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In my opinion and based on my knowledge, the followings are some rules you should consider to decide which antivirus and security tool you need.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Rule number 1:</strong> You have to have an antivirus (built-in, free or paid). Bad antivirus is better than no antivirus.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Rule number 2:</strong> There is no 100% perfect solution.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Rule number 3:</strong> You are the first level antivirus if you know what you open and what you click.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Rule number 4:</strong> Any 3rd party solution may affect your system’s performance, stability, and/or Windows upgrading issues more than built-in services such as Windows Defender and Windows Firewall.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Rule number 5:</strong> Windows Firewall is enough and you don’t need a 3</span><sup><span>rd</span></sup><span>-party firewall If you are sitting behind a private local firewall (hardware) such as home and office private routers (most
 routers include a firewall).</span></span></p>
<p>

<p><span>The following page shows AV Test test results for Windows 10 Windows Defender 4.8 for September and October 2015.
</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/windows-10/october-2015/microsoft-windows-defender-4.8-153747/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/windows-10/october-2015/microsoft-windows-defender-4.8-153747/</span></a></p>
<p><span>The following page shows the best antivirus software for Windows&nbsp;10 according to AV Test.
</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/</span></a></p>
<p><span>From this page you can see that Windows Defender is even better than some famous antiviruses in protection perspectives and better than others in system performance. And it is one of the best antiviruses and gained highest score in usability perspectives.
 Note that some of these tools that comes after Windows Defender in some criteria are paid tools.</span></p>

            I have used Windows Defender and Firewall only, and found that I ended up with many adware programs and so many PUPs that my computer wouldn't run proper.&nbsp; The programs that come and change your home page, search engine.&nbsp; That may not seem a n<span>uisance
 to some, but a real pain when you don't know what happened, not to mention the time needed to remove these blasted things from the computer.&nbsp; Don't tell me Defender is enough, you're crazy if you think so.

            Updating Windows shouldn't affect Office programs. Are you sure you haven't just lost the shortcuts to Word and Excel? If you search your hard drive for winword.exe, do you find it?

            Thanks for that tip, Stefan... I did find it on the hard drive and created a shortcut for it (but it doesn't match the one that shows up on the computer- that one still says "This action is only valid for products that are currently installed" and also
 I can't pull up any of the other parts of the suite, such as Xcel or Access. Can you help me with this as well?<br />

            I tried to delete shortcuts I made for two other things (that looked like they were part of the group because they had similiar icon as the winword.exe) and it won't let me delete them. The shortcut I made says winword.exe, not windows office. And regarding
 the programs, others <b>do</b> show up in the start up menu- I forgot that they were there - &nbsp;it's that the shortcuts don't work and in the control panel under programs there is nothing and it says "There are no items to display."

            Based on your description, there seem to be problems not only with Word, but with the whole system. Going back to an earlier restore point is probably a good idea. For specific instructions with that, ask in a Windows forum; see

            I just located the windows update history and see now that there were 18 security updates on july 12 (all considered 'important') that affected windows vista, micro 2010, micro silverlight appeared, updated micro 2007&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Then, on July 17, two more updates were done (they were 'recommended')</div>
<div>1. microsoft framework 3.5 sp1 on windows xp, server 2003, vista and server2008</div>
<div>2. microsoft framework 4 on XP, server 2003, visa windows 7, server 2008 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div>I changed my setting so that updates are not automatically done.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Should I remove some or all of these updates? Or should I do the restore as you said in the previous response?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have changed my computers settings so that these updates no longer happen without permission.</div>

            <p>Given the strange symptoms you have experienced, I'd just restore Windows to a working state.<br />
<br />
Note that it's a good idea to have Windows <strong>download</strong> updates automatically but then choose when to actually
<strong>install</strong> them. That way, you make sure that your computer doesn't install and restart unexpectedly. (Of course, these "unexpected" restarts usually don't cause any trouble, unless you keep applications running all the time and don't carefully
 save files.)</p>

<h2>            PowerPoint keeps crashing or not responding</h2>
                    Lately my PowerPoint has been crashing or when I try to save a project, it says "not responding".&nbsp; I have lost several projects because of this.&nbsp; Also, when it actually opens, all of my images have red x's.&nbsp; I am really getting tired of this, as I have
 wasted many hours creating only to have my project crash.&nbsp; Any advice?

            Hello LisaMadill,
<br />
<br />1-Try open it in safe mode and see if the problem still persists. If the problem doesn't happens in safe mode, disable all the add-ins and re-enable them   one by one to find which one is causing the problem. See below how to open in safe mode and how to disable the add-ins:   
<br />
<br />Safe Mode:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-o...</a>
<br />
<br />Disabling add-ins:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-manage-and-install-add-ins-in-office-programs-16278816-1948-4028-91e5-76dca5380f8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-m...</a>
<br />
<br />2-If this doesn't work, try an online repair, see the procedure about below:
<br />

<h2>            How can I tell if someone has read receipts turned off&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It's great that Skype *finally* has read receipts, but allowing people to turn it off kind of defeats the purpose.&nbsp; &nbsp;So far, I have not seen it work with anyone I talk to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I know if they have it turned off or it's just not working?&nbsp; Under their name, it says "last seen 1d ago" but I just talked to them....?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Does any of this work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
