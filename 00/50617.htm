<h2>            I keep getting error code 0x80190001 when I try to reach the Feedback Hub.</h2>
                    <p>Hope I am in the right category...I have been through the mill with Windows 10 these last few months.&nbsp; Ended up doing a repair of Windows 10 from within 10 because I could not get Windows Updates.&nbsp; Updates now work but Microsoft Edge is still not connecting...
 luckily I can use my MSN Explorer and Chrome for internet access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After yesterday's update, I now get messages (just got it for the 3rd time)&nbsp;that Microsoft needs to "fix" my account in order to fix my "Share Experience".&nbsp; Not really an issue for me because I do not sync my desktop computer with any other device.&nbsp; What
 is bothering me though is that when I attempt to sign in, I keep getting error code 0x80190001 when I click on my account or even if I choose the option to use another Microsoft account (though I only have one email address).&nbsp; So what is really bothering me
 now is if Edge is the only way to get through to the Feedback Hub, what good is it if it isn't connecting?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any suggestions because it's just getting to be an overall bother.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We cannot imagine how frustrating this situation could be. Let's work on this together. Help us verify the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How long have you had your Microsoft account?</li><li>Did you verify your account already?</li><li>Does the login issue persist even after changing your password?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>To troubleshoot your Microsoft Edge issue, let's try to reset it and check if it will make a difference. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p><span><span>Close<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><strong>Microsoft
 Edge</strong></span><span><span>.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>In<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><strong>File
 Explorer</strong></span><span><span>, go to:<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><strong>C:\Users\(Username)\AppData\Local\Packages</strong></span><span><span>.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Look for the folder named<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><span>Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe</span></strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>and
 delete it.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Restart your computer.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>At this point, nothing should happen if you try to launch Microsoft Edge.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Press<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><strong>Windows
 key</strong></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>+</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><strong>S</strong></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>and
 type<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><strong>Windows PowerShell</strong></span><span><span>.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Right-click the first result and select<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><strong>Run
 as administrator</strong></span><span><span>.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Copy and paste this command:<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><strong>Get-AppXPackage
 | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"</strong></span><span><span>.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>As soon as it's done, re-launch<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><strong>Microsoft
 Edge</strong></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The method above will also reinstall Windows 10 default apps. One of which is the Feedback Hub. After resetting Microsoft Edge, also check if Feedback Hub is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise as necessary.</p>

            <p>I have had my same email address (and therefore account) since 2000... I have gone through the transitions with this computer since 2012 upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10.&nbsp; Have never needed to change my password and with all the flaky things happening
 since Windows 10 come out, I am not about to go there.&nbsp; I have done all the appropriate verifications when asked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Share Experience seems to be fine today (not that I am sharing info between devices) so not getting that message today.&nbsp; I never purposely go into Microsoft Edge, it's just that some programs will kick into it if I check for updates while in them.&nbsp; I will
 try the above later after I have printed out the instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the biggest problem is having Edge fully integrated within Windows 10... at least Internet Explorer stood by itself.&nbsp; You could always remove it, download and reinstall again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the response... will get back to you when I have checked it out.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Ok... I followed the instructions and it didn't work.&nbsp; It just made it so I cannot open Microsoft Edge as a browser at all.&nbsp; The blue Edge screen comes on and then closes, I got a message that it cannot open my MSN page in the small app failure box that
 appeared.&nbsp; Luckily though Windows Update still works but at attempt to access the Feedback Hub there again resulted in Error Code 0x80190001 when I clicked on my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wanted to point out that when I deleted the Edge folder as instructed and ran the Windows PowerShell as an administrator and copied the command as instructed and it almost immediately just came back with "&gt;&gt;" so does that mean it did not find anything?&nbsp;
 I double checked (thinking I could repeat the steps seeing how nothing has changed) but the folder no longer exists.</p>

    <title>Drive randomly disconnected, severe lag follows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Drive randomly disconnected, severe lag follows</h2>
                    <p>I have had this issue in the past which occurred when I had plugged in an external drive. The exact same one that gave me problems a while back. Anyways, I would be doing my regular things which includes playing games and multi-tasking then I receive a notification
 from Intel RST that a drive has been disconnected which I did not disconnect myself. Soon after, my PC begins to stutter very badly. I checked Explorer and the drive that has been causing issues was not in the list. After a restart, the stutter issue was mitigated
 temporarily and the drive appeared in the list again. A little while after and the same thing occurred. Throughout both instances, the same things have occurred. Just to see what may have been the culprit, I checked task manager and nothing was spiking/using
 abnormal amounts of resources. I checked Windows Defender to see when a scan was last performed and it was around the time a drive got disconnected but I have the drive excluded in defender so I don't believe Defender is causing issues but anything is possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello Shafeeq,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the swift reply. Upon posting this question, I realized that I had failed to provide that the drive I'm using is a HDD which is connected via sata and not USB. As for answering your questions;<br />
1. I'm not sure I understand what you mean as far as changes made to this computer extend and at what point should I date back to. I only recently plugged back in the HDD and noticed the same performance issues that I had previously. Prior to plugging it back
 in, I had been exclusively using an SSD. During that time frame, no changes hardware and software wise had been made.</p>
<p>2. The drive is a Samsung HDD HM160HI.</p>
<p>3. My computer was custom built but I believe what you're after is my motherboard which is an ASUS Z170-E.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I had made no attempts at the potential solutions you had provided. Given this new information, should I attempt said solutions?</p>

<p>Hi Papi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that the issue is with your external hard drive because once you unplug the hard drive from your computer, your computer comes back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the below methods to check what exactly is causing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Scanning External Hard Drive With Microsoft Safety Scanner</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please download the&nbsp;<strong><em><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/intelligence/safety-scanner-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Safety Scanner</a></em></strong> and scan your external hard drive
 with the Microsoft Safety Scanner and check if you find any virus or malware.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Checking The External Hard Drive For Any Errors</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Note</strong>: While performing Check Disk on the hard drive, if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive then Check Disk tries to repair that sector, if any data available on that might be lost. Also, note that while
 performing Check Disk, if there is any power loss or the hard drive gets disconnected, the hard drive might get corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Plug your external hard drive to the computer &gt; Go to <strong>This PC</strong> &gt;
<strong>Right-click</strong> on the external hard drive &gt; Click on <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Tools</strong> tab &gt; Click on <strong>Check Now</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Check Disk</strong> window, select the <strong>Automatically fix file system errors</strong> and
<strong>Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors</strong> check boxes and click on
<strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Windows will check the external hard drive for errors. When it finishes, Windows will display the status of the check in the
<strong>Check Disk</strong> window. Click <strong>Close</strong> to close the window.</li><li><strong>Restart the computer once</strong> and check for the issue.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Give it a shot and let us know of any changes.</p>

<p>Hello again Shafeeq,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I gave both of your methods a try and all of the results returned with no errors/viruses/bad sectors in my drive. Attached are screenshots of the results. Regardless, I restarted my pc with the drive still connected and soon afterwards, the issue was still
 present. Again, disconnecting the drive immediately remedied the issues.<br />

<p>Hi Papi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying and trying the above troubleshooting methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As there are no errors after scanning the hard drive with Microsoft Safety Scanner and Check Disk, try the below methods and check if the issue still persist.</p>

</p><p>So far, none of the methods provided have resolved my issue. I did update the chipset and usb drivers. The issue was still present some time after a restart. I also could not enable Better performance on my drive but I attempted the other steps regardless
 and the issue was still present.</p>

<p><span>Hi Papi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for replying and apologize for the delayed response as I was researching on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It might be that the issue is with the hard drive itself, so to narrow down the issue, I suggest you to plug in the hard drive to another computer and keep using it for some time and check if you
 are facing the same issue in that computer as well.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are facing the same issue on another computer as well, then the issue is with the hard drive itself.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are not facing any issues with another computer, then go back to your original computer and download the
<strong><em><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/55005/Intel-Rapid-Storage-Technology-Intel-RST" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Intel Rapid Storage Technology Drivers</span></a></em></strong> and install it on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong>: Disconnect your external hard drive before installing the driver and restart the computer once after installing the driver and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please reply to us with the result after checking the external hard drive on another computer, so that we can help you further.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We're looking forward to your response.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Terribly sorry for my late reply. I do not have access to another PC to test this drive. It used to a hard drive to a laptop which I salvaged from it. No issues were present on that device. I also already had RST installed so I would hope that the proper
 drivers would have been present already.</p>

            Jessen - I appreciate your reply to my post. Do you think we might be able to include a Microsoft Excel Dev' in this thread? Consider please that number crunchers like
<b>nrekz</b> above (myself included) have been using ten-key adding machines and many other input devices with the same numeric layout for over 100 years. Now, we know that Microsoft Dev's are working on a new version of Office coded for the Modern UI. That
 is very much about touch. Which means that when we want to work with Excel spreadsheets that aren't too complex we can kick back on the sofa with our Microsoft Surface sans keyboard. It is very important that we get the software numeric keyboard right. I hope
 you understand the importance of this issue.&nbsp;
<div><br />

<p>At long last, I was able to recover from this problem based on suggestions offered on this site, as well as some others.&nbsp; I went through every suggested solution&nbsp;without any success.&nbsp; None of the Startup Repair programs worked for me.&nbsp; Whatever was blocking
 the boot affected every solution, except one.&nbsp; I can only guess, but I believe the problem occurred with an update to some program (e.g., Windows, ipod, McAfee, HP, or whatever) that got interrupted or corrupted at some point.&nbsp; I would have the boot and status
 screen for hours at a time.</p>
<p>Here's what worked for me (and it took almost two days to ultimately find).&nbsp; Boot from dvd and go to safe mode (booting to safe mode from hard drive did not work).&nbsp; Once in, I selected a specific restore point occuring before when I believe the update happened.&nbsp;
 It worked.&nbsp; My next step would have been the dreaded&nbsp;"clean install."&nbsp; In fact, I already had the various software disks laid out.</p>
<p>So, thanks to the advisors on this site and the others.</p>

<h2>            What happened to copy&#47;paste when right click in Windows 10 &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Its not there &nbsp;, it has been there since Windows 95 , who's stupid idea was it to remove it ?? , i just switched to Windows 10 (not willingly) and the only 10 about it , is its 10 times harder and takes 10 times as many steps to do the same thing , than
 it is/was in Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do i enable Windows 10 to allow me to Right Click and Copy (a file/folder) then go where i want and Right Click and Paste like i was able to do for the last 20 years ?? &nbsp;, who ever thought this was a good idea to remove copy/paste needs to be fired and
 slapped about 10 times</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find any way to copy/paste in Windows 10 &nbsp;, i tried the Home menu but it does nothing , it shows copy/paste but they are grayed out and won't work , "Select All" does not make them work either &nbsp;, neither does Control C/Control V, i also can't "Drag/Drop
 , when i drag the files to the folder i made it gives the red circle with the arrow thru it (meaning NO/not allowed)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also i recently had a accident and have a broken wrist/arm , so everything i do i can only do with 1 hand , so i can't do complex keyboard commands that require the use of 2 hands or multiple keys being pushed at the same time &nbsp;, i am typing with 1 finger
 so i need a easy fix , like how it used to work , right click copy/paste</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help asap as i have a file i need to save off my phone and can't copy it to my pc &nbsp;, and have to do so before a Dr appointment i have that i need to leave for and i need to save the data before i leave , then i need to re-set my phone , so i need
 to save the data before i clear the phone so it can repair itself , but because of this stupid change that did nothing but complicate something that used to be easy to do , i am instead searching Microsoft for a answer to a issue that never should have been
 allowed to happen , someone please slap Bill for me....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyone ??????</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hello ????????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone work here ??????</p>

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For you to resolve this. check this link and follow the steps carefully regarding your issues with
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/kb/309662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
cannot drag or copy and paste file</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important: </strong>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For
 added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, refer to the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to back up and restore the registry in Windows.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>Sorry been busy the last few days&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried it yet for 2 reasons</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) You did not mention WHY Microsoft took away this key thing that 100% of its customers use ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)When i read the link it stated that this "fix" is to be used on a OS that Microsoft no longer supports &nbsp;, so your saying Microsoft now no longer supports Windows 10 ??? , and that there is NO OTHER SOLUTION ?? , to resolve a issue that should not even
 be a issue ?? &nbsp;, why has a "fix" not already been implemented to make Windows 10 work like it "should" ?? , and allow its customers the ability to right click and copy/paste like they have been able to do since Windows 95 ?? ....Why was it removed ?? , or
 if it was not removed and this is a bug , then why is there not already a update that resolves this issue for us ???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need answers before i continue , as this can't be the only solution &nbsp;, not that i am afraid of changing the registry , but more of a question of why i have to do Microsoft's job for them by fixing something (if this actually fixes the issue) that
<strong>they</strong> should have fixed for their customers &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because if we are going to fix things that need fixing , then we need to bring back full support for XP and for Windows Live Mail with Delta Sync (because Outlook sucks) , and continue support for Windows 7 for at least another 10 years minimum&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean , if we are really going to fix things , we might as well fix the things that were not broke that they insisted on breaking ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i will continue once the 2 main concerns are addressed , if you can answer them , &nbsp;please do so , so i know why i need to change the registry , as i would like to know WHY i am doing this before i waste time with something Microsoft should be doing ,
 or should have already done and made a update/patch for</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any helpful info would be appreciated ... Thanks ...Jim..</p>

<div>
<p>i have been a member of www.fraggednation.com for several years and recently has my account deactivated for cheating.</p>
<p>not only was i not cheating but they provided no evidence to prove so. they provided a video of a friends account whom i played with.</p>
<p>in the video you cant see his achivments because he has his account set to private. they said that account hasnt played crysis 2 because it doesn't have achivements.<br />
but the account does.&nbsp; false evidence. you can see this account by looking up cephillis&nbsp; gamertag.</p>
<p>now onto the reason not to partake in www.fraggednation or tactical gaming.<br />
a lot of the admins on fragged nation are members of tactical gaming.<br />
on the crysis 2 ladder i was in second place and holder of the crown for beating the first place person.</p>
<p>a former tactical gaming member took first place during my break from the game.<br />
this person is a known booster so i refused to play him. <br />
so this meant for him to get the crown from me i would have to lose it to somebody else then him play them. well the tg mebers and tg related admins on fragged nation didn't like this. so they changed the crown rule so that you had to play once every 7 days
 or they could take it and give it to whomever they want. of course this would be another tg member lol? my solution too this problem was to play my room mate.&nbsp; once every 7 days if i couldnt get a game with another ladder member wich was often as sevral people
 ducked me and the ladder was pretty dead. well i had a funeral of a friend to attend and missed the 7 day mark.<br />
<br />
the crown was taken from me and at first i was ok with this. then i looked at other crysis 2 ladders on fn more specifically the crash site ladder.<br />
i noticed something fishy the team tg nostromo had the crown for crash site yet they hadn't played a game since may 28 their crown should have been taken long before my crown as my last game played was in june now here is the messed up part. the fn admin teemedic
 that's her screen name on www.fraggednation.com was on team tg nostromo. so the admin removed my crown but not her own teams. i submitted a support ticket and even though they rightfully took my crown they decided to give it back because they then would have
 to take their own crown away. they then found another way around this problem accuse me of cheating with not actual evidence and deactivate my account without letting me disprove the so called evidence. then&nbsp; teemedic put up a pole to get the crown rule changed
 so her team would not be in violation of the rule. the votes did not go her way and the rule stayed the same. leaving her team in violation of the crown rule. i created a new account as mine was blocked and seen tg nostromo still had the crown. and submitted
 a ticket stating they were still in violation of the rule. wouldnt you know it my ticket was handed off from one admin to teemedic the very person who's team was in violation of the crown rule. the very person that had me deactivated.</p>
<p>well the ticket was never taken care of and they blocked the new account i created so i could contact support and submit the ticket. this happened today. it is now the end of the season of crysis 2 on fraggednation and her team tg nostromo still have the
 crown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is clear evidince&nbsp; of&nbsp; teemedic cheating as a player on www.fraggednation.com and abusing her admin privliges as an admin on the same ladder.</p>
<p>everytime i try to get this cleared up the lower admins especially ones that are members of tactical gaming sweep it under the rug. i'm now in the process of going higher up in staff at fragged nation. all you need to do to see for yourself is goto www.fraggednation.com
 goto the crysis 2 ladder section look up rules.<br />
look for crown rule it will say must play once every 7 days. then look up the crash site ladder tg nostromo is in first place click matches then recent matches and you will see in their recent matches that they didn't play for well over 7 days after may 28.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;teemedic is a cheater and abuses her fn admin powers. note i am posting her fraggednation account name not her gamertag.</p>
<p>i was suspended before for accusing her of cheating because i couldn't prove it. now i have proven it and what do they do nothing.<br />
<br />
if you have read this whole rant sorry for the wall of text and thank you. if you feel this type of thing should not go unpunished boycott www.fraggednation.com use gamebattles or something else. and dont play tactical gaming teams. if you have a www.fraggednation.com
 account write the admins and enter support tickets and post in the forums. if you are a member of tactical gaming please mention this to your superiors. and if you could care less go ahead and flame. lol</p>

<p>to any tactical gaming members if teemedic is kicked from tg for cheating i will take tg out of this post. and to fragged nation if teemedic is removed as admin. i will remove fraggednation from this post. and no i dont want my account back it's gone way
 past that now.</p>

<p>Hello John, </p>
<p>I am a new head admin on Fraggednation for Crysis 2 singles ladders. &nbsp;I am really sorry about this whole situation from my personal point of view. &nbsp;I see what I can possibly do for you and hopefully help you out .</p>

<p>That's how those sites can be and which is why I quit doing GB</p>
<p>And also left TG. TG used to be a fun, fair, friendly clan until all the cool squad leaders and officers left. It's turned into a pile of crap now</p>
<p>Sorry this happened to you. Hopefully epic could help you out. I would tale this whole text you typed and send it to as many people as you can at fragged nation, try to get higher up people and don't give up</p>
<p>Good luck, I would like to know how this turns out</p>

<p>I've hit up several people problem is I'm having trouble finding a way to get this to someone high enough in fragged nation support. the highest point I've gotten to is dbl he happens to be a member of tactical gaming. every account i create to submit a
 support ticket is handled by a member of tactical gaming and those accounts get deactivated before i get a final closed ticket communication. i have saved emails and communications through out all of this. although my above post was made in hast as a rant
 and probably hard to read and understand. once i have compiled all the communications i will be creating a new document that shows what happens step by step and all communications through that process.</p>
<p>the last email i got from dbl was that he was in the process of changing the crown rule. and resetting them so that the next team to play a match gets it. but that did not remove the crown from the tg team that shouldn't have had it and the season was set
 to end on 7-1-2011 witch means the season ended with them holding a crown they should not have had. even if they fix this the admin abuse and cheating has already occurred. that makes the only right choice for fragged nation if they want to prove they don't
 condone cheating by thier admins. is to remove those admins that have broken rules and over stepped their bounds.</p>
<p>silent scop i understand how you feel about gamebattles. i once had to deal with an admin their that was giving wins to friends on game results that were being contested. fragged nation used to be the better place for fair gaming ladders. but5 because the
 staff at fn has lost a certain amount of diversity it now is less fair than gamebattles. like i said a lot of the fn staff are all in tactical gaming too much power in one teams hand. btw i was once in tactical gaming and it was once a great clan with great
 leadership. i watched as many of those i learned from left. and i was finally booted myself for cracking what was a semi inappropriate joke in a public mw2 lobby. but the real reason is because i was creating to many waves with my questions and statements
 about cheating &nbsp;that brought some attention to the very &nbsp;person that i have just accused of cheating. only this time i have the evidence that they wanted me to provide the first time around. anyways gamebattles is a much better place as it stands now. there
 is more diversity in the admins as the majority of them are not all from one clan.</p>

<p>It's there loss. They just lost one of the best players on there ladders from the sounds of it. If I were you I wouldn't attempt to go back after that mess. Eventually all that
<strong>[Mod Removed - Profanity]</strong> will come back and bite them in the <strong>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>This is a specific typing glitch on my Samsung Q430-11:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1) The cursor jumps either to the beginning of the line or up a space after I press the spacebar after typing any word that ends with an "N". &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;any word that ends in an "N" (i just had to adjust after typing "in" and "an" in this line)</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) "1\2" appears after I type "1" and "2" consecutively.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Of course I could adjust the way I type by typing slower or reminding myself to slow down after any word that ends with an "N"....but what's the whole point of typing if I can't type fast!!</strong></p>
<p>I've updated my pointing device driver (synaptics&nbsp;15.0.10.0) but am wondering if I have to update the keyboard driver? I can't find any and didn't think i'd have to. I am hoping that I am not the only one, otherwise I would be the one guy who just happened
 to get a laptop with a keyboard that makes these specific glitches!!</p>

To identify what loads when you boot use Autoruns (freeware from Microsoft).<br /> <br /><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/ProcessesAndThreads/Autoruns.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/ProcessesAndThreads/Autoruns.mspx</span></a><br />
 <br />With Autoruns you can uncheck an item, which disables it from<br />starting,or you can right click an item and then delete it. If you<br />uncheck you can recheck to re-enable the item. It is a much safer<br />approach than editing the Registry and better than using msconfig..<br />Another useful feature of the programme is that you can right click an<br />item and select Search Online to get information about the item<br />selected.<br />

Hope this helps, Gerry Cornell

<div><span>As far as I'm concerned, like most other programs that come with Windows (almost all programs in all versions of Windows), the e-mail app that comes with Windows 10 is a very poor choice. There are many other choices available: some by Microsoft
 and some by third parties, some for sale and some free. They are almost all better than what comes with Windows.</span></div>
<div><span><br />

<h2>            Just upgraded Toshiba Laptop To Windows 10&#59; Errors&#47;Issues Abound With No Way To Fix</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just upgraded my Toshiba Satellite s55-a5375 laptop from Windows 7 Professional 64-bit to Windows 10 Professional 64-bit. Now I'm getting all kinds of issues/errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) My user profile in Windows 7 had been corrupted, but I fixed it....or so I thought. I searched the community and followed instructions posted here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/38817-youve-been-signed-temporary-profile-fix.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to unlock the administrator account and I was able to follow the instructions in the above link. I saved my files in the administrator account as backup (I don't have any removable media that's free right now). The corrupted account was deleted
 and I know what caused it (old files from a school assignment several years ago; apparently the desktop had somehow been saved it that folder and it really screwed things up).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I deleted the corrupted account, I had a VERY hard time trying to create a new one. Every time I tried to create the account (by clicking Add a new user in PC settings), the screen would flicker and do nothing. I would also get an error message saying:<br />
<br />
EXPLORER.EXE</p>
<p>Element Not Found</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went online again to see if there's a workaround.&nbsp; I found this:<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/windows-10-cannot-create-additional-account/8183a433-7a8e-4d23-bc15-c91267932ef3<br />
<br />
I used "</p>
WORKAROUND FOUND: &nbsp;From an elevated command prompt, use command line to manually create the new account. &nbsp;i.e.
<p>net user Username Password /add" (without the password) and it seemed to work. I changed the level to Administrator from Local User.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I, then, found the folder for the new user (Raptorsama) and proceeded to copy my backed up files and whatnot from the corrupted account. I DID NOT copy over the Desktop folder as that one was corrupted in the first place. I was going to check on it, but
 now I'm having major problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Because I didn't copy the Desktop folder over, my desktop is all messed up. When I try to click on anything, it's REALLY slow. I'm also getting the following error:<br />
<br />
"EXPLORER.EXE Element Not Found"</p>
<p>Again, I looked on the Microsoft Forum and found that I can use a Windows 10 Installation disk. I have a Windows 10 ISO disk, but I'm not sure if that's it. I've noticed on the affected laptop that pressing ANY of the function keys does absolutely nothing.
 How do I make an installation disk (NOT the USB one)? Here's where I found the information:<br />
<br />
<em>&lt;Removed link&gt;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had actually looked in the Task Manager processes and didn't even see explorer.exe running when I use the computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I upgraded to 10, I had not set up Hibernation or access to the boot menu (like when you press F8 for Safe Mode) so I cannot access these features. I didn't know they had to be activated. I thought they were automatic.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I tried a fix where you reset Windows 10 and keep your files. Due to my Nvidia GeForce card (I think) it failed. I got this error:<br />
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Windows 10 won't install, due to computer unexpectedly restarted or encountered an unexpected error. It's undoing the changes. Help! I need this computer to run! I got Windows 10 installed on my Macbook Pro with no issues. This
 really has me upset. :(</p>

            <p>Well, what I ended up doing was I restored my computer to out-of-box settings that Toshiba had (with my files intact :)). All that would be left would be to reinstall my programs. Before I do this, however, I have a question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, I only have the programs that came with the laptop originally, installed. No MS Office, Steam, Visual Basic, etc installed (yet). If I run Windows Update (Windows 7 Professional 64-bit) and get Windows 100% updated, then get it updated to Windows
 10 (with the ISO disk I made, not Windows Update; my internet is terrible for big downloads) before I reinstall my programs, will I have issues and whatnot? Has anyone tried this? The Windows 10 updater originally said all of my programs were compatible. Also,
 I have 2 graphics cards: Intel Graphics HD 4600 and Nvidia GeForce GT 740M. I have read somewhere that the Nvidia cards have major issues with Windows 10's installation process. Will the Nvidia card cause issues in Windows 10 (BSOD's, etc)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you suggest I try doing the above? Any insight and guidance is appreciated. I want to make sure I don't mess up. I'm a game designer and I need to be able to continue working on my projects (all of my documents, videos, pictures, etc were backed up
 before I attempted the upgrade in the first place). I also have all of the installation files for my programs. It'll take a while, but I will get my computer back to form. Thank you.</p>

            Your reply is actually more helpful than Microsoft's guidance on this, you need to not only setup program defaults, but also disable Mail's notifications from the Action Center as you wrote, and make sure Outlook's are enabled. Found this with a bit of
 digging here :&nbsp;http://www.msoutlook.info/question/outlook-notifications-in-windows-10-action-center .

            This does not change the default mail app for the Action Center, this only changes the Email app for general email links and composing. The original poster, asked about changing the email app in the Action Center

<p>You can only install the game using a single CD key 5 separate times. After that, the key becomes unusable</p>

            His solution is vague. &nbsp;I'm not sure which account is being instructed to convert from local to Microsoft and vice versa, the new test account or the old corrupt account. &nbsp;If this is clarified, I'll give it a try. &nbsp;For now, I'm still not able to sync.

<h2>            Unable to boot Windows after removing second hard drive.</h2>
                    <p>My computer has an SSD and an HDD, each of which has an installation of Windows 7. I can boot either copy if both drives are connected,
</p>
<p>but if I remove the HDD then my computer says that there aren't any bootable drives present. (The HDD has no problem booting without the SDD.) Is there any way to make it so that the SSD boots, even if it's the only drive?</p>

<p>Glad to see that you sorted it out. It appears that your second installation never acquired the necessary boot files, and it lacked an active partition.</p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, the classic Skype app download link has been disabled on Skype’s download page. This is due to security issues with the Skype app
 installer. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I strongly advise you to utilize the new versions of Skype to continue Skype services.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you need further help.

When is this elusive "later"? &nbsp;Why have I been tricked into paying full price for only half a game?<br />
<br />
Before anyone asks. &nbsp;Yes, my network connection is fine. &nbsp; Yes, I can connect to Live in other games. &nbsp;The problem is I can not connect to this game.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I have the same issue, I am on Xbox Live. I start the game, it prompted me for an update. Accepted, watched it DL, went to save game to cloud. It told me I was not online. At that point, I tried to reconnect. And had to go all the way back to the dashboard
 and test connection which tested fine with no errors. Restarted the game connected to XBL and I was kicked off again.</p>
<p>That was last night at Home. I have another xbox at work I play on and the same exact thing happened. Different xbox different network.</p>
<p>Update: It is working now. I am not sure what changed. I will try tonight on my main xbox when I get home.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Jayram,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a corrupt file, uninstalling to reinstall will not work--the app troubleshooter won't work either.&nbsp; The best advice I can give is to take your surface/laptop to the closest Microsoft store (hopefully there is one relatively close to you) and get one
 of their techs to help you out.&nbsp; This is not a knock on the community forum; however, I followed all the advice posted above and ended up doing more harm than good; my entire system had to be reloaded (hence the Microsoft store tech advice).&nbsp; Everything works
 beautifully again, but please save yourself the frustration I went through and take your device to someone whom has training to fix whatever necessary.</p>

            <p>I think it stinks that a "support engineer" isn't able to provide a workable solution to this problem.&nbsp; Mail and calendar was working, then it quit but after a month or so started working again.&nbsp; That only lasted for about a month and it quit again, which
 is it's current status.&nbsp; I've tried all suggestions but <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>NONE</strong></span> of them work.&nbsp; Microsoft should either fix the problem or allow "uninstall" option for forced upon us apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note to "support engineer": get to know your product&nbsp; - there is no "uninstall" option with this app, probably not available for any of the "forced" apps.</p>

<p>Ran the System File Checker, "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."&nbsp; Guess that means there is another problem.&nbsp; BTW: the mail and calendar apps work fine on my laptops and the other windows 10 computers in the household.</p>

<p>Startup repair wasn't necessary.&nbsp; Microsoft had 3 updates that were downloaded and installed today (05/10/2016) and mail / calendar are both working, at least for now.&nbsp; They have both worked&nbsp; before, lets hope that Microsoft made this a permanent fix and
 they will keep on working.&nbsp; Somehow I'm not very optimistic, I will give them the benefit of the doubt.</p>

                    <p>My wife's PC running Windows 10 has recently started displaying a small pop-up window on her desktop which reads as follows:</p>

    <title>Reinstalling Windows 10 wiped out my BIOS, what to do&#63; Can I claim - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ivicanesic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstalling Windows 10 wiped out my BIOS, what to do&#63; Can I claim my license&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span><span>Greetings community,</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>A little history about licensing: Before I gave it away, I had a computer which came with OEM Windows Vista Home Premium. When Windows 8 came out I bought upgrade disk, and leveled
 it up to Windows 8 Pro. Few years later they offered upgrade to Windows 10 for free, and being naïve I upgraded it. That was actually first time when I called local Microsoft support service, because I wanted a clean install. They told me that, considering
 that it was OEM OS, I had to upgrade it first, then download ISO and reinstall it again. When I asked which product number I had to use, they said I was to skip that part because product number would be saved in BIOS on motherboard during initial upgrade process.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Now, don’t get me wrong it worked pretty fine while it was with me, but one year ago I decided to cheer up myself with new machine, so I clean-reinstalled my old machine, with
</span></span><span>USB Windows 10 stick, that came with my&nbsp;new machine,</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;and gave it away to my neighbor’s kids.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Problem raised a month ago when my neighbor called me to reinstall unstable machine, because kids were being installing and uninstalling all sorts of games (probably pirated), and
 went to all sorts of websites (you know, boys will be boys). </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>So, I came and started the process. Everything went fine until the restart. After restart machine became unresponsive, with nothing on the screen, only coolers humming inside. Not
 having a better choice, I carried machine to the service.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Few days later man from service called me, and told me that he was puzzled. He couldn’t believe at first so he tested every component separately: memory, graphic card, hard disks,
 and he even pulled out the processor and slotted it in one old machine that was also here for service. He said he have never seen it in his life, it was about BIOS. Not that it was deleted, but what was inside was not a BIOS.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>He introduced me to my options: he may try (no guaranties for success) to find BIOS for that old motherboard and push it inside using some tricks, but I will lose my license that
 way, if Microsoft doesn’t have it saved somewhere else. Other costlier option is to buy new motherboard (probably processor too, because it’s hard to find motherboard with LGA775), and of course new Windows. He said if I buy parts at their place, service is
 for free.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>So here I am with perfectly good computer except for BIOS, and what I want to ask is this: is there any way that I can claim my license, if service people can implant new bios (or
 the old one from cd that came with it), or I have to buy new license anyway?</span></span></p>

            As noted, the BIOS and the Operating System are two separate things. Updating your BIOS should not be done on a whim unless required by the operating system. Updating the BIOS should not invalidate the operating system, but changing your motherboard can.
 In your case, you can refresh the BIOS without invalidating your license.
