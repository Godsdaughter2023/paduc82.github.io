<h2>            My Windows 10 power button is partly off the left side monitor</h2>
                    My Windows 10 power button is partly off the left side of the monitor It isvery difficult to read the settings. When you right-click you can see "ep", "utdown" and "tart" instead of "Sleep", "Shutdown" and "Restart". The first column&nbsp;of icons is also half
 off the left side monitor.

            You need to use the display monitors physical display to reset the display orientation. You can usually find this at the side, but how you use them will vary by manufacturer.

    <title>Windows 10 corrupted my BIOS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> niksuski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 corrupted my BIOS</h2>
                    <p>When Windows 10 was first released and made available to the public I was one of the first to try to upgrade. I didn't care about all the negative feedback it had received, I was willing to give Windows 10 the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For many months, Windows 10 worked fine for me. Even better than Windows 8 at the beginning. Now I feel so stupid, defeated and done fixing what Microsoft seems to be destroying on a daily basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Windows today means that you have to sacrifice a functioning computer. If it's an update that was released way before it was REALLY stable or you just encounter a bug that just didn't rear its ugly head before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I put my computer to sleep like I always do because I want to get back to work quickly, to have all my programs open when I return. Instead of being able to get back to work in less than a minute, what do I see once again. Black screens after waking
 my computer from sleep. This has happened at least five times already, in the span of more than three months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wiggle the mouse for a few seconds, that should help. Right? Nope. Usually I see the mouse, but this time the displays didn't even wake from the power saving mode. What am I supposed to do at this point? Nothing I can think of other than hold down the power
 button to make my PC shut down and then reboot. Hopefully I will get back to work soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's this? BIOS says my computer can't boot properly? Ah, just ignore that, I close it and reboot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see the Windows booting screen. Windows seems to start up, but I see the update message; "Windows is installing an update". Fair enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Few minutes later the computer needs to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see the BIOS splash screen, after which I'm greeted with one of the most gruesome sights any PC owner never wants to see:</p>
<p>The Main BIOS is corrupted.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d636d517-8c93-4dcc-91c9-db676aa83189" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d636d517-8c93-4dcc-91c9-db676aa83189" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Windows 10. Thanks Microsoft. If my computer would've happened to be a few years older then my BIOS would be toast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you didn't know, Windows 10 saves your license to the UEFI, so that means they can alter your BIOS and this CAN happen because of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 was released unfinished, not ready to be used by end users. And it was bascially forced on people, like a plague. Something you do not want. This is destroying the workstations of your loyal customers, and you're constantly churning out unfinished,
 untested and BROKEN updates that make using our computers a pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why should I, as a Windows user, SACRIFICE the usability of my OWN computer? One of the latest updates broke gaming on multi-screen setups. Fix for that? Use single screen. Is that in any way fair to the users?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was it really worth firing all the employees that did invaluable work testing the updates and features before you unleash **** on all who dare use Windows? Well, to Microsoft it probably was. At the end of the day, nothing is more important to them than
 turnout and revenue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This needs to change. It's not fair to always have to be on your toes when you see that Windows wants to reboot to install updates. You can't know if this one is going to destroy your computer, throw you off track and make it impossible to work anymore.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've encountered the same problem but not during an update, during working on Adobe After Effects CC. Windows gave me an blue screen of death saying that my computer have encountered an error a'd need to restart, but it won't (no video signal on both gpu
 and mobo). Since one month, I've tried everything possible to start when I discover that Windows have simply destroy my bios !</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way i'be found to fix it is to use my mobo warranty and buy a new one and tru to find a solution to reactivate windows license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm with you in this problem...</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

                    <p>Occasionally when I'm playing a full screen game it freezes and Ctrl+Alt+Delete has no effect, the computer locks up completely and I cannot minimise or exit the frozen game. In these situations the only way to make the computer usable again is to force
 shutdown and restart. Is there another way to force something to close?</p>

<p>Sounds like hardware issues.&nbsp; Possibly heat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are regularly having to force a power-off (holding the power button) because things like CTRL+SHIFT+ESC do not bring up a way for you to end processes, etc. - it is unlikely you have software/OS issues.</p>

            Hi there,
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, you cannot buy a Skype Number for Ecuador to receive incoming calls. However, you can purchase a subscription or Skype Credit and make outoging calls this way. More information on this can be found here:-

<h2>            Skype call hangs up immediately saying &#39;Insufficient Skype credit&#39; on reactivated account.</h2>
                    <p>I hadn't used this account for a while, and thought the account had been deleted, so signed up again with the same email as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I try to make a call (I can receive them from another Skype account) I get this message&nbsp;&nbsp;'Insufficient Skype credit...'&nbsp; immediately, then after a couple of tries, I got another message saying my account has been temporarily suspended since it may
 have been hacked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the on screen instructions to remove the suspension, and apparently succeeded - I was able to sign in again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't I make a skype call now?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried half a dozen times, and get the same message 'Insufficient Skype credit...' every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have NEVER had Skype credit, nor needed it before, to make Skype-to-Skype calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried closing and reopening the Skype window. No change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to get the account working again for Skype-to-Skype calls?</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Skype&nbsp;to Skype call is still a free feature of Skype. However, if you are calling a phone&nbsp;number (mobile or landline) you will be needing a little Skype Credit.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that being said, we&nbsp;would like to clarify when&nbsp;making a call in Skype, are you calling&nbsp;to a&nbsp;Skype contact/s or a mobile number?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does&nbsp;the status of the person you would like to&nbsp;call is online/active? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We look &nbsp;forward to your response. </p>

It was a Skype to Skype call to one recipient, but the recipient probably wasn't on line. However, it usually 'rings' if he is offline, doesn't just drop out.

<p>Thank you for your response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to inform&nbsp;you the error <strong>"Insufficient Skype credit..." </strong>will only appear if you're calling a landline or mobile number. This the reason why I confirmed the type of call your are doing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the status of your contact is <strong>offline </strong>it will only ring once and it will be redirected to a voicemail if your contact set it up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Have&nbsp;you tried&nbsp;to use a&nbsp;different device and internet connection when&nbsp;making a call? This&nbsp;will&nbsp;help us to isolate the case. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Western Digital My Passport Drive intermittent access problems</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There seem to be numerous quaestions about accessing WD external drives.&nbsp; Let me add to the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a new 2 TB Western Digital Passport Drive which worked well for a week. After a week, like its predecessor a 500 GB Passport Studio drive which had become inaccessible, the computer would crash if I right clicked on safely removing the hardware.&nbsp;
 The crash indicated <span>
<font color="#000000">23833369.sys DRIVER_VERIFIER_IOMANAGER_VIOLATION, but then gave the option of starting in various safe modes or in normal mode. The error&nbsp;is a reference to the WD drivers, which WD checked and found satisfactory. I could live with this
 because there is no need for me to disconnect the external drive, and on those few occasions I can do so when the computer is shut down and power is off.
</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The difficulty that I don't want to live with is that after considerable work on the drive, the data becomes inaccessible, which is not good for a storage drive.&nbsp;
 For example, the WDF drive has&nbsp; become inaccessible during a Microsoft backup of the the computer to the WD drive, but not for all backups.&nbsp; There is sometimes a similar result when I move considerable data manually from the WD drive to the harddrive, although
 this is rare. For my Backup4All program a long backup always results in the data beceoming inaccessible.&nbsp;Sometimes, when the data is unavailalle I can see that the drive has only 1.58 TB free. However, most recently, when the drive becomes inaccessible, &nbsp;I
 can identify every file, but I can not open any because of an I/O error. In all cases the&nbsp;drive becomes fully accessible if I shut down the computer disconnect the power and the WD drive for a few minutes and restart normally.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a way to make the WD drive accessible consistently, particularly for the Backup4All backups? Os should I&nbsp;just consider another manufacturers</font>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Dear Deepak,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks. The only change is that the problems seemed to appear to after lightning struck my apartment and caused a computer crash. The motherboard and the card with USB ports have been replaced.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before these replacements the WD&nbsp;drive would not only
 disappear but the card would shut down.&nbsp; Now the card continues to work but the WD&nbsp;drive&nbsp;shuts down. Two WD drives failed several months after the drive after shutting down on repeated occasions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Connecting the WD drive to different ports does not change the behavior. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can access the drive on my computer. I could take it to another computer to test the eject command, but not the more serious problem of shutting down which seems to require considerable use of the drive.&nbsp; I prefer not to let someone else have my drive
 for an extended time because it has private information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There aren numerous complaints about connectivity problems with WD drive in the Microsoft Community so I am wondering if changing to another manufacturer's&nbsp;drive would solve the problem or if there is a simple fix to Windows that would address the WD
 issue..</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The difficulty with the link is that it is to a discontinued beta product&nbsp; See&nbsp;

            <p>Dear&nbsp; Deepak,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; Before your e-mail I checked and updated all motherboard drivers. &nbsp;I then did a quick reformat of the disk using the Microsoft system to eliminate the WD driver issue.&nbsp; For some reason the drive came in as a G rather than the prior F drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I then trired Bckup4All. The short one worked well. The more extensive one caused the drive to disappear and the USB card with the four USB&nbsp;ports to be off. A flash drive is not detected&nbsp;in any of the ports.&nbsp; Disk Manager sees the WD drive with a healthy
 partition but does not detect the flash drive. Restarting the computer made the flashdrive totally accessible but the WD drive was not detected by Window Explorer or Disk Manager. Shurring off the computer turning off power and disconnecting the WD drive results
 in the WD drive and data becoing accessible. I adddd a folder with a WordPerfect file so I can easily check access to the drive</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried Checkdisk in accord with your suggestion. As usual nothing happened when I chose the checkdisk and repair options from Windows&nbsp;Explorer&nbsp;so I restarted the computer.&nbsp; I have noticed Checkdisk usually The WD drive was not detected by Windows Explorer
 or Disk Manager. My usual shutdowm turn off the power, and disconnect the drive did not work as well as usual.&nbsp; The WD drive is dtected as a G drive and explorer detects the file. However, when I try to open the WP file I see nothing. When i try to&nbsp;open the
 file from Wordperfect the response is Detected&nbsp;File is not Supported.</p>
<p>&nbsp; By the way Microsoft Security Essentials and MalwareBytes find no evidence of any computer infection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Dear Deepak,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I shut down the computer a second time disconnected the power and the drive a second time.&nbsp; I still could not open the WP file. However, when I copied the original from the C drive it could be opened, so the original file may have been damaged either
 by checkdesk or by something unrelated.</p>

<p>&nbsp; I tried changing the cable which did not change the performance of the WD drive.&nbsp; WD claims there is an operating system issue.&nbsp; I tried the WD drive in another Windows 2007 computer and there were no difficulties transferring files to the WD drive and
 accessing them.</p>

                    <p>why does my laptop use 87,2 gb to system files on my SSD drive. i only have 128 gb on the ssd drive and the system is running on it. it uses 87,2 gb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just reset my laptop sunday, and before i reset it, it didn't use 87,2 gb ov space for the system files. why is that?? is it because it has two windows on it or is it because it has stored the old system files somewhere on the drive or what is it?? i think
 that before i reset the laptop, it used only about 45 gb for the system files and now it is almost the double of that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another laptop too, and i am looking the the system files on it, and it is only using 35,5 gb of space for the system files. And the new laptop uses 87,2 gb for the system files now. i think that before i reset it it was about the same as the old
 laptop. (35,5-45 gb)</p>

<p>Hi Róland,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be a result of how you have reset your computer. This can also happen if you have backed up your files on the same drive/storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possible reason for this is the one that you have stated that the drive has two Windows on it. Can you confirm if you have installed 2 different Windows operating system in it? Have you checked the files if they have been duplicated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly describe to us how you have reset your computer for us to look into that further for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>

    <title>Black Screen with cursor when OS tries to load. Tried F8, and Repair - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Black Screen with cursor when OS tries to load.  Tried F8, and Repair from DVD.</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I like to think of myself as being pretty good with windows and troubleshooting, but this one has me completely stumped.&nbsp; Any ideas I haven't tried?
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been running Windows 7 for about a month.&nbsp; I tried to install an additional HDD, PC wouldn't boot, so removed drive and reverted to original setup.&nbsp; First boot after removing drive got a black screen instead of login.&nbsp; That being said:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tried Safe-mode and got the same.&nbsp; Tried removing all unnecessary peripherals leaving only mouse, keyboard, monitor.&nbsp; Around post hit F8, tried rolling back to previous restore point, tried low resolution video, tried repair your computer, nothing.&nbsp; Removed
 video card.&nbsp; Went in through DVD, tried about 3 restore points, tried system image recovery, and memory diagnostic and got nothing.&nbsp; Also went in through command, opened task manager, tried to run anything, nothing worked.&nbsp; Tried System file check and got
 nothing.<br />
<br />
Did a startup repair and all I got was 1 root cause which was something to the effect of:
<br />
<br />
No OS files found on disk<br />
Repair Action: Partition Table Repair<br />
Result Failed&nbsp;&nbsp; Error code = 0x490<br />
<br />
Looked up Error code, found "Error Not Found"<br />
<br />
I took that to mean there was an error, but Windows doesn't have a clue what it is.&nbsp; But I could be mistaken.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated<br />
<br />

So I guess my new question would be would it be in my best interest to cut my losses and reinstall?&nbsp; And if that is the best course of action, would I have to pay to reinstall bc of a damaged OS?

            I am having the same issue and have followed the same steps.<br />
I have a display when I restart windows in safe mode, but no display (but audio) when I reboot windows 7 in normal mode.<br />
This is so frustrating and to make matters worse I am traveling and my copy of windows 7 is at home.&nbsp; Must I repuchase 7, download and reinstall???

<p>Hi llunga,</p>
<p>Maybe these will help - Black Screens can be extremely tough to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>Why is my screen black when I start Windows 7?<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/why-is-my-screen-black-when-i-start-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/why-is-my-screen-black-when-i-start-windows-7</span></a></p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>Saving any needed data and re-installing Windows 7 might be the best option though here are a<br />
few others.</p>
<p>You can save your files by putting the drive in another computer or an external drive case and then<br />
backing them up. Do so using several methods in a redundant manner. Of course a real computer<br />
shop or your System maker can help recover the files.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel<br />
- Device Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver -<br />
then Right Click on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.<br />
<br />
Another method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and Safe Mode)<br />
is to CTRL + ALT + DEL and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it -<br />
then on Applications Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe . Safe Mode is<br />
reached by repeatedly tapping F8 as you boot up.<br />
<br />
First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.<br />
<br />
<span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/50247d5e-0ae0-446c-a1bd-11287fd1478a</span><br />
<br />
Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss<br />
basis. That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just<br />
adds to the difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect.<br />
You can try a google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these<br />
cover a wide field of efforts.<br />
<br />
Here is a video of one fix.<br />
<br />

</span><br />
Here is another fix<br />
<span>http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2008/12/the_mysterious_black_screen_of.php</span><br />
<br />
Do you have a&nbsp;Window 7&nbsp;Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the<br />
disks your system maker will sell them cheap. Or try from Safe Mode if you can get<br />
there.<br />

<br />
You can create a Recovery Disk or use someone else's same version (to do the System Restore<br />
it only has to be bootable).<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
These require the correct Vista Disks since you can't boot to Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair -</p>

If needed and you can access regular Windows at all.<br />
<br />
If nothing works you can do a repair installation.<br />

<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Another method that sometimes works : In the Command Prompt of a Vista boot disk type :<br />
(type one line or copy and paste one line at a time and then hit enter - <strong>
do not type <br />
parenthesis or BOLD</strong>)<br />
<br />
c:<br />
<br />
cd\<br />
<br />
cd c:\Windows\System32\winevt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>(there is a space between cd and C: )<br />
</strong><br />
ren Logs&nbsp;LogsOLD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(there are spaces between&nbsp;ren&nbsp;and Logs and&nbsp;Logsold)</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
REBOOT to Windows<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Why was the link to the Media Guide website removed?&nbsp; You've broken something that worked well - nice job MSFT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Agree with Elroy - navigating to the "...windowsmedia.com" is just another step that wasn't&nbsp;necessary in the past.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a partial workaround.&nbsp; 1. Navigate to the wondowsmedia.com site.&nbsp; 2. find an internet radio&nbsp;station, click Listen --&gt; WMP should open and start playing the station.&nbsp; 3. In WMP, on the right side, drop down and click&nbsp;"show list".&nbsp; The name of the
 radio station should be listed.&nbsp; 4. Save the Radio station as a List (will show up in Playlists from now on).&nbsp; 5. As you listen to other stations, you can right click the station name in the List window and add it to your saved playlist.&nbsp; 6. Your saved playlist
 (Internet Radio Stations) becomes your link to play directly from WMP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, not a full workaround (you can't browse stations from w/in WMP), but if you have a few favorites, the above is a way to listen directly from WMP.</p>

            The link to the website that is Media Guide has been removed in Windows 8.&nbsp; Browse with IE or other browser to www.<b>windowsmedia</b>.com/ .&nbsp; The Media Guide at the bottom left of earlier windows versions of Media Player was simply a link to the above
 website.&nbsp; If you go to the website you will immediately recognize it.&nbsp; When you click on the Internet Radio link at the website Media Player in Windows 8 will play your choices.

<p>&nbsp;I went to the lenovo drivers site, and they don't recommend down loading, as it may it not be compatible.&nbsp;</p>

            I had this problem too. I fixed it a different way. The problem started just after a popup informed me that I no longer had the latest version of Java. At that point I tried to fix it restarting my computer and various bluetooth devices -- no dice. But
 then I finished uninstalling the old version of Java and installing the new one. Did that, but the problem was still there. But then I restarted my computer again. And at that point the bug was completely gone. Not sure why this worked!

<h2>            Windows 8.1 KB2919355 Update error 80073712.</h2>
                    <p>Windows 8.1 update for x64-based systems (KB2919355) repeatedly fails. <strong>
Ideally I would like to find a solution that would avoid having to do a Restore.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT My new email is *** Email address is removed for privacy *** &nbsp;(The Microsoft email I signed in with is no longer in service) Thanks Frank White</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>My troubleshooting attempts have included the following --</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1) Downloaded and ran&nbsp;<span><span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update Troubleshooter</a>&nbsp;and got the following report -</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 1in"><strong><span>Windows Update error -- Fixed</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Step 1 -- Opened elevated command prompt and entered DISM command as follows;&nbsp;<strong><span>C:\Windows\system32&gt;DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It ran for about 10 minutes and reported: <strong>"The component store is repairable. The operation completed successfully."</strong></p>
<p>Step 2 -- I entered the next DISM command as follows:&nbsp;<strong><span>C:\Windows\system32&gt;DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; It also ran for about 10 minutes and reported: "<strong>DISM failed</strong>.
<strong>No operation was performed. For more information review the log file at C:Windows\Logs\DISM/\dism.log"&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apprecite the efforts which you have put to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try to install the Update in Clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Clean boot:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is
 known as a "<strong>cleanboot</strong>." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.

            <p><strong>IMPORTANT UPDATE </strong>-- I just spoke to a support technician at Microsoft Canada who advised me that the problems I am experiencing with the Windows 8.1 update is
<strong>MOST LIKELY CAUSED BY AN ERROR IN THE UPDATE ITSELF. He mentioned that many users have called reporting problems with this update. When I pointed out that I successfully installed this update on my laptop he said it's machine specific -- it will work
 on some PCs but not others.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He added that there will be a fix available in the next week or two.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: My email problem has been fixed so replies will be sent to my correct address,</p>

            <p>Prana, thanks for your suggestion. I did follow the Clean Boot instructions carefully. But when I finished disabling the items in the Startup tab of the Task Manager and clicked on OK, the hourglass cursor appeared and kept running but nothing happened beyond
 that point. I finally had to power off to stop the processing. Fortunately my PC started normally when I powered on again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you have another suggestion I may just leave this for a couple of weeks for a replacement update as the MS Canada tech suggested. (SEE my IMPORTANT UPDATE comment in this thread.)</p>

            <p>LATEST UPDATE -- Microsoft tech support (from India) is working with me on this problem. Techie tried unsuccessfully to fix it yesterday (Apr 16). The issue has been elevated to Level 2 support. Next Wed (April 23) a tech support person will give it another
 try. In the meantime, I'm not going to try a clean boot or any other solutions on my own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll update again after next Wednesday's attempt.</p>

            <p>Final Update -- Microsoft Technician worked on this issue for 4 hours 45 minutes. He spent 1 hour 20 minutes troubleshooting without success.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>He spent the other 3 hours 25 minutes downloading, reinstalling and updating the latest version of 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, he was unable to give me a clear and concise explanation of what may have caused this problem with Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked him if using Revo Uninstaller or other non-Windows uninstall software, which gives users the option of deleting Registry settings, might have corrupted the registry and caused the problem. He said that non-Windows uninstall applications might corrupt
 the registry. But he did not say that is what necessarily happened in this case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line, I'm none the wiser. But from now on I will stick with Windows Uninstall program in the Control Panel.</p>

            <p>As the person who started this thread, let me add this update. After trouble-free use of my PC following installation of the latest update to Windows 8.1 a couple of weeks ago, the other day I got the dreaded "blue screen" when I powered up. The message
 in part read "The boot configuration file is missing some required information. Error code 0xc0000034. You'll need to use the recovery tools on your installation media." The message also referred me to run UEFI application link below. I did run the application
 but it took me to menu upon menu of technical options which meant nothing to me. (And I was out of my depth when I researched the error code and UEFI reference).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I called HP, the manufacturer of my PC. Unfortunately I ended up with a tech support person who was not helpful. As directed I ran 5 hardware tests that all passed successfully and that was it. No additional help from that source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I turned to Microsoft support because it was MS that helped me to install the troublesome Windows 8.1 update that kept failing to install. This person asked for the model number of my PC, and with that asked me to hold while did some research. He soon
 returned to say the PC model I had was not capable of running Windows 8.1 -- only 8.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, back to HP. The tech support person there agree with the MS technician and said I should not have had MS upgrade me to 8.1 -- and that was the cause, a couple of weeks later, to the blue screen indicating a corrupt OS. She said I had no choice but to
 do a full recovery. She transferred me to her supervisor to arrange for free installation disks to be sent to me (my PC came with an OEM version of Windows installed). I happened to ask the supervisor if it was true that my PC could not be upgraded beyond
 Windows 8, and she said I had been misinformed, and it could be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By this time I was thoroughly confused. So here I sit awaiting the arrival of the recovery disk(s). I called HP Support again and insisted that a competent technician guide me through the Recovery process via a phone connection. I also received verbal assurance
 that if there are any problems during or after this recovery my warranty will be honored and I will get a new comparable replacement PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course the worst part about this whole messay process (besides the time-consuming troubleshooting) is that Recovery will delete all my personal files and installed software. I do have a complete backup of all my files. Nevertheless, I am not looking forward
 to reloading my files and reinstalling and setting up my software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By now I'm wondering if technology is a blessing or a curse -- or a mix of both.</p>

<h2>            Update on 1&#47;4&#47;2018 said Installing Windows 11.</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I turned on my PC and it immediately went to a Microsoft Update. I waited for it to finish, than the screen went black, with a little white box in the left upper corner that said something like (server not responding) and under it&nbsp;said something
 like (Updating your personal desktop software). I waited about 45 seconds, than the screen went to blue, and it said something like "Hit enter to Install Windows 11". I didn't know there was no Windows 11, so I hit enter. Than&nbsp;appeared the update circle, spinned
 once, and than went to my desktop screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer was working fine all day. Than today when checking to make sure I had all the latest updates because of Meltdown and the other chip virus, I saw that Microsoft is not going to have a Windows 11 ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So.....did anyone else have this happen and if not, what do you think happened and what should I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Windows 10, Internet Explorer, on a Lenovo all in once desktop PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't run a scan using Windows defender Offline. My 3rd party anti virus blocked it, and I don't know how to run it any other way. (I am "Mary the PC Idiot")</p>
<p>I tried to download from the link above for Microsoft Safety Scanner. The first time I got an error page. This page doesn't exist. I hit "fix this connection" and a download was at the bottom at my screen. I hit "run", and when it finished, I got a pop up
 saying that this download was not from the Windows store and could be malicious, or something like that. So, I didn't finish the download. I went to Microsoft.com and couldn't find Microsoft Safety Scanner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran my antivirus and it was acting up.&nbsp;Would not let me sign in, which I never have to sign in. Finally did a restart&nbsp;and it let me sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, when it finished it said everything was safe. Not sure if I believe it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I am going to run a root&nbsp;scan off my 3rd party and maybe you can send me the URL for the Microsoft safety scan&nbsp;that I can enter into my address bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, at this time it is a work in progress. Sorry it took awhile to get back to you. Was not on PC for 2 days while sick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your help. When I click the link for Microsoft Safety Scanner, it says webpage doesn't exist and to check link or URL. When I go to Microsoft to search for it, I cannot find it. Can you check on this because my computer is really a mess.</p>
<p>As soon as I open a browser,&nbsp;I get a pop up from my anti-virus saying "High CPU usage". My start up programs are only what I need and/or understand. Most of them I don't understand what they&nbsp;are, so I leave them.</p>
<p>I have tried to opt out of all Microsoft and IE ads, but I can only opt out of 1/3 of them. They hang up my system when they are loading. I tried to get a higher speed wifi and it is not offered in the rural area where I live. Facebook locked me out of one
 of my accounts, "for security purposes", and won't let me back in until they review the photos of me I had to send them.</p>
<p>Everytime I get on the computer, instead of doing what I came here to do, I sit here trying to fix it for an hour.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to assume I have a virus. I was part of the yahoo breach twice, and the Equifax breach and Lord only knows what other ones I don't know about yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 3rd party Norton&nbsp;scans say everything is fine. Lenovo keeps installing the service bridge, and every time they do that my computer screws up. I don't even install it. It just installs itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Arghhhh!!! Very frustrating. I get hung up on Realtor.com and my screen freezes everytime I try to get on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can't do a screenshot because it popped up and disappeared in half a second. After I hit enter, the update circle span like half a circle than it disappeared and my desktop screen came up. I can try to run a log of January 3rd, but I would have to be taught

<p>We appreciate the update, Mary. It is possible that this issue is caused by a malware (malicious software) that affects your web browsers. We understand that you have already scanned your system using Norton and it came out clean. However, if you continue
 to experience performance and advertisement issues, we suggest that you start your computer in
<em>safe mode</em> and scan your system using Windows Defender or Norton while in safe mode.
<span>Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers, and can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC. For steps on how to start your computer in safe mode, you may refer to the following link:
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Start your PC in safe mode in Windows 10</a>.
<em>(The easiest way to start in safe mode is from the Settings.)</em><br />
<br />
Once you are in safe mode<em>, </em>scan your system for any infection using your preferred antivirus and security software. If your computer is updated to the latest version (<em>Fall Creators Update</em>), you may use the
<em>Windows Defender Security Center</em> to track your device's performance and health. For more information, you may refer to the following link:

            <p>Hi Lizzie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message (<strong>Internal&nbsp;error 33</strong>) that occurs when you login to Windows could occur as you have deleted one of the file for the game. You were required to uninstall the game from Start screen (if it's an app) or from Control Panel.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you directly delete one of the folder for the game from the desktop screen or uninstalled it from Programs and Features?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have mentioned that you had deleted a link placed on the desktop screen. perhaps, the game wasn't installed properly or completely. What we will do now is we will reinstall the game from Freerides games website and then uninstall the game (if you want)
 by going to Programs and Features under Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the instructions from the link:</p>

            I was able to restore my notebook from three days earlier.&nbsp; After saving my files, I restored it to factory default and reinstalled my programs.&nbsp; I plan to ensure that the video driver is up-to-date although Windows is now updated.

    <title>USB Ports providing power but not recognizing devices - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB Ports providing power but not recognizing devices</h2>
                    I booted my pc yesterday (02/21/10) - for the first time&nbsp; since the blue-death-screen incident got solved on 02/10/10 (please see 'recent history of problem' below).
<strong>I got a screen which said "cleaning dirty volume in 3 steps"</strong> or something like that.
<strong>Thereafter</strong>, the windows started up fine but the <strong>USB ports stopped working.<br />
</strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">All the 3 USB ports</span></strong> are now
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>providing power</strong></span> (confirmed by my laptop fan)
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>but none of them are giving me access to&nbsp;any external devices</strong></span> like my flash drives.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: I did not say"not <em>recognizing</em> the devices" and instead&nbsp;said "<em>not giving me access</em> to the devices" because&nbsp;when I plug in my flash drive, it is showing up as a hardware added by the ususal
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>icon diplaying at the right bottom of the task bar</strong></span>. Moreover when I am trying to eject the hardware, the
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>flash drive is showing up as "Kingston Data Traveller"</strong></span>. It is
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>just not letting me access the flash drive</strong></span> - instead when I click on the flash drive icon (F: drive) it is
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">asking me to format the disk</span></strong> before using it. But then when I am trying to format it is saying that
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"windows cannot format the device."<br />
<br />
</span></strong>[Please note, the USB ports were all working perfectly between these two dates. Also, I have not done any changes , hardware or software, recently. ]<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Recent history of problems</strong>&nbsp;(might be helpful):<br />
<br />
I had a Blue death screen problem 2 weeks back after I had installed Windows XP updates on 02/09/10. I could solve this problem by uninstalling all the following patches : KB978262 KB971468 KB978037 KB975713 KB978251 KB978706 KB977165 KB975560 KB977914. (as
 suggested in forum: <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistawu/thread/73cea559-ebbd-4274-96bc-e292b69f2fd1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
After this I did not boot my PC at all, until yesterday. This is when the USB problem started.<br />

            hello <br />
((in order to complete the above answer you must know who made the motherboard and what model its then you must find out who made the chip set&nbsp; and what model it is then you can google it some times this info is inside the computer and some times it is noT
 ))not a bad answer but a lot of work and you can make mistakes<br />
do a sfc /scannow as shown here it will reinstall missing and corrupt files <a href="http://www.updatexp.com/scannow-sfc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.updatexp.com/scannow-sfc.html</a>&nbsp;i also noticed in your answer <strong>
"cleaning dirty volume in 3 steps"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are you using some sort of cleanup software registry cleaner etc registry cleaners for the most part are not much good and they will mess up your computer....<br />
if you are not using a cleaner than get some anti malware software download and run
<br />
i am partial and use <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a></strong>
