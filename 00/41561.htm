    <title>Battery icon in notification area shows incorrect charge level - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bar foo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battery icon in notification area shows incorrect charge level</h2>
                    <p>I've noticed that sometimes the battery/power icon in the notification area shows an incorrect charge percentage (both visually, in the proportion of the icon that is filled in, and in the percentage available indicated in the mouseover text). Clicking the
 icon brings up the little power menu with a choice of power schemes, and that indicates the correct charge level. For example, right now the icon shows 84%, but the battery is in fact fully charged (my laptop was plugged in overnight). This is an Acer Aspire
 S3 running Windows 8 Pro 64-bit, upgraded from Win7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone else have a similar experience? This seems like a (minor) bug.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with Acer's Support, their on-line documentation, and&nbsp;drivers. Many makers&nbsp;<br />
have utilities&nbsp;that control battery charging.<br />
<br />

<br />
There could also be issues with an Upgrade so also ask about that. Be sure BIOS, chipset<br />
drivers, and other on-board drivers are up-to-date.<br />
<br />
Check the Compatibility Center.<br />
<br />
Windows Compatibility Center<br />

<br />
The&nbsp;real answer will probably come from the System Maker's Support, their <br />
on-line documentation, and ask in their forums (if any) about any known issues <br />
and solutions. Check for updates to the BIOS, chipset, and other&nbsp;on-board drivers
<br />
such as video, sound,&nbsp; and network at both the System Maker and the actual <br />
device maker's sites. Video drivers in particular can affect the battery life.<br />
<br />
I have not seen many battery related issues with Windows 8 which points to<br />
something about your brand/model/particular computer in that order. It is<br />
possible that a hardware issue with the battery, charger, or computer just <br />
came up at the same time you did the upgrade. (Yes tiny chance however since<br />
millions will be doing the upgrade it will happen to a few for the same reason<br />
someone wins a many million to one lottery.)<br />
<br />
Check the wall outlet and any power strip or UPS used. Try plugging the computer<br />
directly into a different circuit. Be sure your charger is solidly connected to both
<br />
outlet and computer. Remove the battery and check that the terminals are clean.<br />
On most you can use a pencil eraser to clean the contacts.<br />
<br />
Please let us know the results of your troubleshooting.<br />

            Thanks for your reply. I don't see anything relevant on Acer's site. The reason I suspect it's a Windows issue rather than a driver problem is that the percentage of battery power remaining shows properly in the pop-up windows, so Windows clearly knows
 the correct value (and I get warnings about low battery, for example), but the notification tray icon is not updating.

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You need to actually ask Acer's Support. There may be a control program in use or the unit<br />
may even need a BIOS, chipset, or other update.<br />
<br />
If this was a Windows 8 issue there would be millions with the problem. So you need to check</p>
<p>all the other possibilities.<br />
<br />
And there is always a chance there is a hardware issue with the battery and/or charging circuit.<br />
<br />
Did you double check the Compatibility Center?<br />

<h2>            Virtual Machine Additions causes Windows 7 to Bluescreen</h2>
                    I have Windows Vista SP2 installed as my base OS.&nbsp; I used Virtual PC and installed Windows 7 RC.&nbsp; After successfully installing windows 7 to my virtual harddrive, I installed the virtual machine additions. Upon reboot windows 7 bluescreens. It obviously
 cannot handle the virtual machine additions.&nbsp; I assume an update to virtual machine additions/virtual pc&nbsp;will be necessary. I am using version 6.0.156.0 which i assume is the latest version of virtual pc. Anybody else notice this?

<h2>            Windows said that license is about to expire.</h2>
                    <p><span><span>Greetings community,</span></span></p>
<p>

</p><p><span><span>This question as about one HP laptop that came with OEM Windows 7 pro 32-bit, that was bought several years ago. For a few years computer worked without any complains about product
 key. Then we upgraded it to Windows 10 in the period when that was for free.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Before the upgrade, we contacted local Microsoft support to ask about license product key. We’ve been told that we should leave that field empty, and that Windows would save new
 key somewhere in motherboard’s BIOS memory.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Everything had been working fine until some 10 days ago, when Windows started to complain that license is about to expire, and that it should be reactivated.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Now, would anybody venture to guess what is this all about? Would it help if we reinstall the OS and hope that it would pull its product key from motherboard? Does anyone have any
 idea what to do?</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Thanks in advance.</span></span></p>

            hi Ivica.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.    
<br />
<br />Check at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation at the top under Status.  If it says that Activation is managed by your organization, this error means that someone has activated Windows with a Volume License Key  that is meant only for large organizations and businesses and not consumers.  These keys expire regularly and must be reactivated by the IT department of the owner organization.   
<br />
<br />How was Windows 10 originally activated as you know it?  If it was free Upgrade it should have a Digital LIcense stored in Microsoft servers that will reactivate whenever you reinstall as long as the generic key determining version is not tampered with in Activation Settings (as installing a VLK can do).  
<br />
<br /> If the PC came with Windows preinstalled from Factory remove the VLK and insert the embedded Product Key which can be read by installing ProducKey and looking for the OEM-BIOS key (only):  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a>
<br />
<br />To remove the VLK, type CMD in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator.  Type in Command Prompt: slmgr -upk with the space included, press Enter.  
<br />
<br />Then for a Digital License insert the Generic Product Key determining version in Activation Settings under Change Product Key:  <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a>
<br />
<br />For a Factory installed Windows with embedded Product Key you read with ProducKey, insert the OEM BIOS key at that link. See if it activates.  
<br />
<br />For Windows 7 Upgrades insert the Product Key from the COA sticker on PC.
<br />
<br />There is more about this here:  <a href="https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/49-why-does-windows-10-say-your-license-will-expire-soon-and-how-to-fix-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/49-why-does-...</a>

<p><span><span>Greetings Greg,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>First of all, big thanks for sharing the link to ProduKey application. Not that it helped much with this particular case, but it came very useful in place I work, for product keys
 for two machines, we lost during moving our office to another location.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As for the problem described in original post, well, I tried, I honestly tried to follow your instructions about activating Windows, but I came incapable of going through all the
 complexity of the problem. Actually, I was afraid to do something wrong and make problem irreparable.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>At the end, I decided to call local Microsoft support. One woman answered the line, asked me to let her access to the computer, which I did, and she started to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>She found that Windows 10 was activated with volume license something, which I couldn’t explain how happened, because I upgraded it from existing OEM Windows 7 pro. She said it
 could happen if computer was on service, and repair person needed to accomplish something.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>She asked if I know Windows 7 product key. I used my Lumia 950 to photograph COA sticker from the bottom of laptop and send it to e-mail on the laptop she had control of, so she
 could see it. Unfortunately, sticker itself appears to be slightly damaged, and not all characters are readable. Few of those numbers are missing, even though the bar code on it appears somehow readable.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now, in spite of all bad things I’ve heard about Microsoft support, the woman I had on line genuinely and honestly tried to do a great job. She actually tried to do some human OCR,
 she tried to guess what’s written on damaged COA sticker, and to use it, and she tried several times. After one hour of her work, I felt sorry much more for her, than for my neighbor who owns this laptop. She said it would be possible to reactivate Windows
 if we knew product ID of previous Widows that was upgraded to current one, but COA sticker was damaged enough so she wasn’t able to accomplish that.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I don’t really understand why that poor COA sticker was doomed anyway. During last ten years I’ve purchased 5 licenses for different OS’s from Microsoft, and 2 licenses for different
 versions of Office. Those were always physical copies on DVD (only Windows 10 came as USB thumb), and they always came with physical COA. I never came to the idea to actually stick it on my desktop. After all, if you need to reinstall something, you have to
 go under your desk and read product key. I called the store where laptop was purchased, and they told me that they were obligated to actually attach COA sticker on every laptop they sell.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Bottom line is this. Greg, do you, as installation specialist, know if Microsoft has any way of recovering product key from damaged COA sticker? If there is that possibility, I
 would send a photo of COA sticker on e-mail address you provide.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Of course, if you have any other idea how to solve this, please do tell. I don’t have great hope about those other ideas, because as long as support woman could see, the only remaining
 of previous OEM OS on this machine is damaged COA sticker, and nothing in its registry. That’s the only proof that machine came with genuine OS.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>However, we would be grateful for any help.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Greetings Sumit,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please don’t get wrong the fact that I replied to mostly to Greg. I needed to say thanks for providing useful tool, and there’s the fact that he said he was the installation specialist.
 Surely that any idea from you would be welcomed also.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Having this problem, I did some research last several days, and I feel the need to share a report about it here, because Microsoft loves to ask us to fill up some surveys every
 now and then.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It’s about purchasing licenses. In my country, we have one big reseller of software, and they are specialized for volume licensing. You cannot buy retail software there, but you
 can buy retail in many stores, where you can also buy hardware.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So, when contacting that software reseller, they told me that as home user, in some near future, I will not be able to buy Windows or Office as retail package. Office is already
 present as service, and they said that even Windows would take some similar form of licensing. They told me that in some near future, I might get physical COA only with OEM OS, and that retail would not exist.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When it comes to biz people, that’s mostly fine. They would simply choose the most convenient model of licensing. Business guys would buy new car every 2-3 years, even though the
 old one works ok. When it comes to hardware and software, they would buy new only when the old ones are ruined. So, when with new computer comes new version of USB, or more memory you’d need new OS to cover that.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Typical reaction of biz guys is: OK, fine, I’ll buy new OS, but please don’t redesign GUI too much: add new options and features if you must, but please leave the old ones where they were in old OS. I work for small biz, and I had the opportunity
 to talk with small biz owners about renewing IT equipment. They don’t like it, but not only because of money. It’s also about the need to invest the time in learning the new things and changing habits. They don’t have the time, they have their business to
 run.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now, try to see this from perspective of one gamer. You know how they are. They love having screwdriver in their hands. When new game comes out, if their configuration isn’t good
 enough, they would strip it apart, they would install new video card, more memory, new processor and even new motherboard if processor is new enough. For them, computing is not about biz; it’s qualitatively different thing, and they need a freedom to change
 the feeling of it much more often than we do. What I want to say is that they need a possibility to buy retail license, so they could change their computer to their current needs. It’s too much to expect them to purchase new license for OS every year, and
 there’s a need for Microsoft to know that.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I’m talking about this because I want to know how Microsoft would solve transferring license from one machine to other. I want to know what waits for me in future, and what kind
 of licensing I should choose as home user. I’m not gamer, I live of solving problems in MS Excel, but I love having retail version of software because it’s most comfortable. Few years ago, I bought new computer with Windows 10, and I needed to transfer retail
 license of Windows 7 from old machine to virtual machine I created on a&nbsp;new computer, so I could be compatible with environment I have in my work place. So, I called local Microsoft support and asked them to help me deactivate Windows 7 on old machine. They
 told me that deactivation option is not actually available, and that I have simply to format system drive on old machine. They explained that this deactivation idea for retail OS would not work anyway, because there’s a possibility that source machine was
 fried during some overvoltage in power supply, so if deactivation before transfer would be requirement, the transfer itself may never happen.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>So, I wanted to know what option of licensing for OS for home users would be available in near future. I could live with Office 365, but when it comes to virus strike, my experience
 says that clean reinstalling of OS costs much less time than searching for solutions through various forums, because there’s always possibility that you do something wrong in the process. So, when it comes to OS reinstalling, I prefer having hard copy of COA.
 Are there any indications about that?</span></span></p>

<p>Sorry Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I needed to share the experience in details, because when it was about upgrading for free that Microsoft so strongly recommended at the time, I came to their support representatives, collected all info, and did exactly what I was told.</p>

            Continue Reading - My other XP Laptop Runs Great online and offline, I had to create 2 replies, because my browser EDGE stopped responding again and keyboard slowed down to a crawl. I rebooted my Cable Modem and here we go again, browser starting to Lag
 after typing 3 lines in this reply, keyboard typing lagging too. There's something wrong with EDGE or BING or WIN 10. My Device Manager says NO Issues. I have searched the Community for last 5 Months for a Fix, I have done your solution twice already, can't&nbsp;
 seem to find a fix. I have rebooted back to WIN 7 once, it works great and I reinstalled WIN 10 about 3 Times, I like Win 10 but I don't like EDGE Browser or Google Chrome, I have always been a IE fan. How do I shutoff Edge and install IE? Would like to try
 before I go back to WIN7 permanently..

            <p>Thanks for all the Worthless Fixes for Microsoft's Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since gone back to Windows 7 Home Premium and it is working 110% Better than Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now since I'm Back to my OEM Software, from now on I have realized, "Don't Trust Microsoft with FREE Upgrades" when Windows Operating Systems are offered as a Free Upgrade such as Windows 10, you know there's something wrong with the Software as why Microsoft
 Offers it for Free!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if it's Free, stay away from it and Don't Trust Free Software from Microsoft!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#8216;s Start Screen Tiles become blank</h2>
                    <p>Recently, every time I start my Surface Pro 3 with Windows 10 Creator Update, the Start Screen will soon be blank and I have to restart "explorer.exe" to fix it. But the problem will be again soon later.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We just want to confirm, have you already tried performing a clean boot? If you haven't, we recommend checking this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> and give it a try. Note that performing it, will
<span>help eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>

<p>I did a clean boot. And I can confirm that this is a bug in Windows 10, because I did a clean install and, after Surface Pro 4 came back from sleep, my Start menu showed empty/blank tiles as it shows below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b0814b9-1f70-4c2f-9c65-a524f33de98c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b0814b9-1f70-4c2f-9c65-a524f33de98c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And I couldn't find any solution for this bug. The only way to fix it temporarly is to restart explorer.exe proccess (not a real solution). So, I hope Microsoft can fix this bug soon.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the there is an issue with the system files of Windows 10. There may also be an issue with the current user profile. These can be the reason why you're unable to see the icons of some of apps in the Start Menu.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, have you ran the Deployment Image Servicing&nbsp; and Management tool, and the System File Checker tools? If not, we suggest that you do so because these tools can scan the image and system files of Windows 10 for corruptions. Kindly access this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Forum Article</strong></span></a></span> to know how to run
 these tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you already ran the tools, we recommend <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">creating a new administratoraccount</a></strong>.

    <title>Xbox One is a pile - Microsoft provides no reasonable support - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One is a pile - Microsoft provides no reasonable support</h2>
                    
<p>So, I am going to go on a campaign at this point and send messages to every place I can until I can get some type of answer based on the time frame I am dealing with being limited and the support in place for Xbox users subpar from industry standards. Why
 am I upset? The simple answer is that as an early adopter for my Xbox One, I assumed I would be given a product that was ready for release, endurance tested, and up to the standards that Microsoft would feel worthy of putting their name on it. I was wrong.
 My headset went after 60 days. Not realizing the headset was under warranty, I replaced it on my own with a new one. Still a piece of junk (made out of cheap plastic and seems to have been designed as a way to shut up those upset that they would have to talk
 through the Kinect and put in a mic as an afterthought). My Xbox One started giving me disc read errors, making awful noises, and telling me to put in games in order to play them towards the end of last year. Luckily, this was still under warranty and I was
 able to (at my own expense) have them ship me a replacement console so they could take mine back. Understanding of the fact that they do not replace with a new console, but a "reconditioned" console, I went with this method knowing full well that I would be
 receiving a former used piece of junk. Shortly after, my Kinect stopped powering on. At this point, it's in for service and the original warranty is expired, but I am unsure (as are you until you take a look at it) whether it's the Kinect that's not working
 or the replacement console. So, that is all three pieces of the Xbox One that are down and out for the count.</p>
<p>After speaking with the chat service, the phone service, and any other method I could find, I was given a very confusing conversation from someone who had a slight grasp on written English explain that it is my problem your quality control is poor and that
 I would be out the cost for shipping and that the only way to have a replacement sent to me in the meantime was to put a hold on a credit card for the amount of a new Kinect until you receive my broken (possibly broken) Kinect. It is on its way to you now,
 though I expect Microsoft to drag their feet looking at it.</p>
<p>Here is the ultimate issue. We are unsure if the problem is with the Kinect or the replacement console. For all we know, the issues with the original console were never sorted out and I was given a bad console. Apparently, as I found out today from your
 phone service, I am only given a 90-day warranty on replacement products. The short of it is that I need to know who I can speak to that can make an exception to extend this warranty until this entire issue is solved? I cannot believe that none of these individuals
 I speak to lack managers and decision makers, yet that is how it is explained to me. I am told that there are no employees who are capable of making a judgment call based on what is write versus what is written.
<strong>The fact is, you are showing that you do not stand behind your own product. Based on this being a $400+ investment for most people, as well as loyalty in my 10th year of membership to Gold, exceptions need to be made and I need to know who to contact
 in the event that this is not resolved.</strong></p>
<p>I find it embarrassing for Xbox, Xbox One, and Microsoft as an entire company that you are selling poorly made products and blaming the customers for the problems they are experiencing. It was embarrassing enough with the 360 and the RRoD incident for you
 to finally admit there was an issue, but now you are back to telling me that it is my problem and up to me to find a way to solve it. I understand that you have many users and many requests each day, but the infrastructure should be set up to accommodate for
 that and as a large company that comes up with brilliant products and services, I find it hard to believe that you lack the brainpower to figure this out.</p>
<p>I would try contacting your company via phone again, but your call back service already called me back to tell me they couldn't connect me and hang up. Thanks for the super long wait on my weekend for nothing!</p>

<p>Exactly what answer are you looking for? For someone to waltz in and say hey ReToM7 we're going to go ahead and make an exception for you? That's not going to happen. There are hundreds of thousands of Xbox's just in the US, so if they make an exception
 for you that means they'd have to make an exception for hundreds of thousands of other people.
</p>
<p>Headsets: By no means are you required to use the headset that came with the xbox, nor did you have to go and buy the exact same headset. There are different headsets that are available for purchase. I've been using the original headset since I've had my
 Xbox with no issues, except that I forget to unmute myself. </p>
<p>Shipping the console: In the amount of time it would take for xbox to send you this wonderful box, you could have already had the xbox shipped off and not have had to wait that much longer. As far as the "former used piece of junk", they don't send out paperweights.
 They make sure the console is fully functional before it ever ships out. </p>
<p>Xbox Warranty: To my knowledge you are given a full standard year warranty for the Xbox One. You are then able to purchase an extended warranty to add an additional two years.</p>
<p>As far as speaking with tech support they never say "This is your fault" they tend to give you steps towards fixing it and if those steps don't work then yes they ask that you send the console in to be repaired. From someone that has had to contact customer
 support (for a dumb issue) I've never heard anyone tell me it was my fault. They've been curteous and extremely helpful.
</p>
<p>A 90 day warranty gives you plenty of time to see if issues are continuing. Gives you time to get it sent back in. That goes back up to my point of you being able to purchase an extended warranty.</p>
<p>I've never seen anyone spend $350+ for an electronic and not purchase an extended warranty. You never know what will happen, that is why they provide that service.
</p>
<p>I highly doubt anyone is going to make an exception just for you to extend a warranty. Again, there are ways to continously protect your Xbox should anything happen to it.
</p>
<p>I am sorry that you're having this issue, however throwing in the "I expect an exception because I've been a customer for 10 years" was unnecessary.
</p>
<p>You have the customer support phone number, there's also that handy contact us feature on the support pages. Of course you'll wait on hold, Xbox is a fairly large company.</p>
<p>"Selling poorly made products" The only issue I've had with my xbox is a nat issue which was fixed AFTER calling customer support in about 5 minutes. So it isn't a poorly made product. Things happen. It is technology it will not be perfect. Just like your
 smart phone, things just happen.</p>
<p>Again I would recommend hitting up the customer service phone number, or the contact us located on support.xbox.com at the bottom of the page.
</p>
<p>Your question being that you demand an exception because you've been a gold user for 10 years? 98% sure it isn't going to happen. Best thing to do is to go through the proper channels.</p>
<p>Again I am sorry that you seem to be having so many issues.</p>

<p>Retom, I also noticed that you didn't add in your post that the reason for the "hold on your credit card" is because they send you the Kinect before you ever send yours in, at which time you receive the box to pack it in ALONG with the shipping label to
 cover the shipping and handling. &nbsp;So they are simply covering themselves in case you receive the Kinect and decide not to send yours in. &nbsp;Hmm, at least they aren't out of that money now.....I wonder if that's how they made all of that money, by being smart!</p>

<p>Funny, over a year and still nobody from Xbox had a response. Anyway, since I'm back with another issue I figure I might as well comment...
</p>
<p>"Exactly what answer are you looking for? For someone to waltz in and say hey ReToM7 we're going to go ahead and make an exception for you? That's not going to happen. There are hundreds of thousands of Xbox's just in the US, so if they make an exception

<p>Xbox takes no responsibility for the quality of their products or services. Numerous outages and never a message saying, "sorry everyone. As a result of our inability to provide constant service as an multi-billion dollar company, we are extending your live
 service for X days based on the time you were without the service you paid for." My cable company always did that, and there are far more cable users than Xbox players. Not looking for an exception, looking for a reasonable response or sign that there is concern
 for their users.</p>
<p>"Headsets: By no means are you required to use the headset that came with the xbox, nor did you have to go and buy the exact same headset. There are different headsets that are available for purchase. I've been using the original headset since I've had my
 Xbox with no issues, except that I forget to unmute myself."</p>
<p>At the time Xbox One came out, there were few options for headsets. Now that there is a 3.5mm jack in the new controllers there are more options. At the time, I am not going to go out and buy a set of Turtle Beach headphones when there's one that came with
 the system. They were obviously an after thought thrown in at the last minute when they did finally listen that people didn't want to talk through the Kinect. Glad yours continues to work. Unfortunately, that was not my experience, or most of my friends and
 family who are now on #2 or higher. Cheap components, cheap build, and cheap quality is not what's expected on a device that revolves around the social side of gaming.</p>
<p>"Shipping the console: In the amount of time it would take for xbox to send you this wonderful box, you could have already had the xbox shipped off and not have had to wait that much longer. As far as the "former used piece of junk", they don't send out
 paperweights. They make sure the console is fully functional before it ever ships out."</p>
<p>Former piece of junk applies. It broke already, which means there was something wrong with it. They "fixed" it but the fact remains that it comes with a shorter warranty meaning they don't stand behind the quality of their refurbished product. The shear
 numbers they are working with, they don't have time to do anything more than a basic test. As to your warranty comment, replacement products only come with a 90-day warranty and if you read my story you would have seen that there were issues about the 90-day
 running out before the entire issue was resolved.</p>
<p>"As far as speaking with tech support they never say "This is your fault" they tend to give you steps towards fixing it and if those steps don't work then yes they ask that you send the console in to be repaired. From someone that has had to contact customer
 support (for a dumb issue) I've never heard anyone tell me it was my fault. They've been curteous and extremely helpful."</p>
<p>They are a courteous and helpful as the script books allow them to be. The problem is not with the individuals, it's with the system. There are no higher steps, no managers, and no decision makers. This is an awful system.
</p>
<p>"A 90 day warranty gives you plenty of time to see if issues are continuing. Gives you time to get it sent back in. That goes back up to my point of you being able to purchase an extended warranty."</p>
<p>I shouldn't have to purchase an extended warranty, and your 90 day comment doesn't not take into account the length of time it takes to send, fix, and send back taking a sizable chunk of that 90-day. Some of the issues I have been having do not show up every
 day, so being in a time crunch to have them finally show up is stressful to a user.</p>
<p>"I've never seen anyone spend $350+ for an electronic and not purchase an extended warranty. You never know what will happen, that is why they provide that service."</p>
<p>You haven't met a lot of people out there then. Some car companies offer short term warranties, and as a result, I would never purchase one of those cars. The necessity to purchase an extended warranty is a direct reflection over the quality of a product.
 The price is not the issue. I understand I'm taking my chances and if this was a year out of the warranty, I wouldn't be here. Also, your decision to criticize someone based on their choices is neither helpful or appreciated. There are plenty of people out
 there who purchase products and can't afford the add-ons.</p>
<p>"I highly doubt anyone is going to make an exception just for you to extend a warranty. Again, there are ways to continously protect your Xbox should anything happen to it."</p>
<p>Does not apply. I would rather make an attempt vs. some of the others who would just purchase a new xbox and swap boxes. My purpose here was more to bring attention to me not being happy about the service and methods of provided by Xbox. If nobody speaks
 up, there will be no attention drawn to parts that need to be improved. If I'm alone, they can choose to ignore it. I'm not alone and they still ignore it, but that's on them. These things catch up sooner or later.</p>
<p>"I am sorry that you're having this issue, however throwing in the "I expect an exception because I've been a customer for 10 years" was unnecessary."</p>
<p>10-years is a long time and a loyal customer. I'm not sure your background, but long term customers are highly valued because of the financial gain that comes from loyal users. I'll decide what is necessary for me. I didn't expect it to matter to you.</p>
<p>"You have the customer support phone number, there's also that handy contact us feature on the support pages. Of course you'll wait on hold, Xbox is a fairly large company."</p>
<p>Chase is a large company, but when I call them over an issue or question, I'm on the phone with someone in 2 minutes or less. Size of company just means they need to invest more on the support services. They don't care about customer service as is clear
 by my experiences.</p>
<p>""Selling poorly made products" The only issue I've had with my xbox is a nat issue which was fixed AFTER calling customer support in about 5 minutes. So it isn't a poorly made product. Things happen. It is technology it will not be perfect. Just like your
 smart phone, things just happen."</p>
<p>I'm glad to hear you got a good one. I had a good Xbox 360, but that doesn't mean there weren't THOUSANDS of people who bought a system that eventually hit the RRoD. I understand technology is not perfect, and that's why most companies stand behind their
 products. You better believe I do this with all products that don't live up to the standards I expect or am promised. In all other cases, I have been able to speak to people who can make decisions. Amazon is a great example of customer service. I have had
 Amazon employees call me after an issue to be sure it's resolved. Do I think it's really the CS Rep wanting to call me? No, but Amazon has certain procedures in place to ensure customer satisfaction is as close to 100% as possible.</p>
<p>"Again I would recommend hitting up the customer service phone number, or the contact us located on support.xbox.com at the bottom of the page."</p>
<p>Clearly I have contacted them multiple times. I mentioned that, as well as waiting and being hung up on. This is a much more public method of contact, but it's an available method.</p>
<p>"Your question being that you demand an exception because you've been a gold user for 10 years? 98% sure it isn't going to happen. Best thing to do is to go through the proper channels."
</p>
<p>Thank you for your opinion, but you're opinion doesn't matter. It was resolved in the end. I went through the proper channels to begin with. There are limited proper channels.</p>
<p>"Again I am sorry that you seem to be having so many issues."</p>
<p>Thank you for your concern. It is unfortunate. My experiences in this case directly led to 3 individuals purchasing a PS4. In the end, it's not a make it or break it number, but you need to look at the big picture. There are individuals out there with a
 lot more influence than I have, but that's still 3 users who will not be buying annual gold memberships or items from the store.</p>

<p>I understand the reason for the hold. However, place your snarky comments to the side and realize many other places keep a credit card on file and will charge it accordingly if you don't hold up your end of the bargain. This is how Amazon works ("if we do
 not receive your item in 90-days, we will charge your card the full amount of the item"), this is how hotels work ("if there is damage to your room, we will charge your card the full amount of the damage"), and there is no need to collect up front.</p>
<p>I wouldn't call it smart. It's a method that's used to deter people from following through with a return or exchange. In general, the harder and more inconvenient a procedure is, the less likely people are to use it. Keep in mind that not everyone has the
 money to have a hold placed on their cards. It can have serious implications to those who are living paycheck to paycheck. Just because I'm not in that boat doesn't mean I don't understand the potential problems that can come from these practices.</p>

            Yes you can use the snipping tool to capture the full screen, when the tool appears there's a small bar at the top choose the far right icon to capture full screen.
<br />If you require a visual of this let me know.

            Hi Megan, my name is Max and I'm an independent advisor.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, it is a design limitation. Currently, the snipping tool can only be used to capture the information available in the screen view and you cannot capture the entire article if it exceeds the window's border.
<br />
<br />I suggest you refer to the article Use Snipping Tool to capture screenshots for further information

<br />I also suggest that you post your query in the Feedback Hub so that the developers can look into this issue and check if it can be included in the upcoming Updates

<h2>            Windows 10 boots up slowly &#38; black screen display before login</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP laptop (dv7-6150ev) with i7-2630QM processor, 8 Gb RAM and an AMD 6770M graphics card. I recently upgraded to Windows 10 without any problems and everything seems to work fine. All devices seem to work and, according to the Device Manager, I
 dont have any driver issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But i have an issue when i boot my laptop. Every time i boot, first the microsoft logo appears for a few seconds and then...
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">black screen with no cursor</span>. This black screen lasts for about 1 minute and perhaps more, then the cursor and the login page appear (i dont have a password) and also my desktop after a few seconds. &nbsp;After this
 point everything is normal and functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I was wondering what can i do to resolve this issue because the above mentioned behavior doesnt seem normal to me an the total boot up time is about 1.30 minutes which is slow in my opinion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all in advance for any suggestions and excuse me if my English seem poor, its not my native language.</p>

    <title>How to permanently stop automatic maintenance&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bigmike777  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to permanently stop automatic maintenance&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Windows 8.1, and I disabled&nbsp; all the features associated with automatic maintenance in the task scheduler.
</p>
<p>However, every time I reboot and don't use it for about 20 minutes it starts automatic maintenance. This constantly keeps happening and I want to know how to stop it permanently.</p>
<p>How do I stop/delete everything that makes it start without my permission? Why does it keep reinstating itself even when I deliberately go out of my way to disable it? This is getting a little bit annoying. I shouldn't have to fight with my operating system
 like this. </p>

    <title>WiFi Icon turned into Ethernet icon after shutting down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            WiFi Icon turned into Ethernet icon after shutting down</h2>
                    <p>So this weird thing happen a few days ago...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I shut down and restart, the wifi icon turned into Ethernet icon for some reason even though I only have WiFi connection.</p>
<p>However when I restart by clicking the restart option, the Ethernet icon turned back into WiFi icon.</p>
<p>This happened consistently so I was wondering if anybody can help me get rid of the Ethernet icon once and for all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I read up on corrupt system icons, but that did not help...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hello Michel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>May we know if you have made any changes to your device prior to the issue of the network icon changing to Ethernet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a first troubleshooting step, we suggest that you run the Network adapter troubleshooter and let Windows find and resolve problems within your network adapter. Here's how to run the troubleshooter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Start </strong>button, then type <strong>troubleshooting</strong>, click
<strong>Troubleshooting </strong>from the list of results.</li><li>Click <strong>View all</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Network Adapter</strong>.</li><li>Follow the onscreen instructions to finish the troubleshooting.</li></ol>
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>There is no change to device before this happened...</p>
<p>It just happen out of nowhere....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the troubleshooting cannot find anything</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I can temporarily fix it by restarting from Start menu</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if this have to do with those system volume information files that had gathered and increased in size these past few days</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>When you say "restarting from Start menu", do you mean to restart the device completely or restarting the network adapter?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, we suggest that you check if your network adapter has the latest driver version, if not, update it and see if the icon changes to Ethernet. You may do this by going to the
<strong>Device Manager</strong>, then expand <strong>Network adapters</strong>, right-click the driver, and select
<strong>Update Driver</strong>. Make sure to select <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>.</p>

    <title>Sending JPEG images - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colonel biggs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sending JPEG images</h2>
                    <p>There are several sites that I visit where I can send an email to myself containing a graphic as a JPEG attachment.&nbsp; Lately, the graphic is being embedded in the email, which makes it more difficult to view when received, although one has the option to download
 the JPEG image from Skydrive, which must be where WLM saves it.&nbsp; There is a message in the email that states "The album has one photo that will be available on Skydrive until such and such&nbsp;a date."&nbsp; (I don't use Skydrive.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than embedding the image in my email, I would prefer to send the email with the graphic&nbsp;as an attachment, which then gives me the ability to save the attachment immediately to whatever folder that I choose.&nbsp; However, when I right-click on these images
 to select the option to send to myself, WLM comes up with the image automatically embedded.</p>
<p>Is there an option that has been set that is causing the images to be embedded, as opposed to being attached?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using Vista Home Premium, and I recently installed WLM 2011, which may have caused the problem, since I did not have this issue with earlier versions of WLM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>There are two paperclips. The one you want is the one on the <em>Format</em> tab that appears when you click on the inserted image. It is in fact a bug in WLMail 2011 that causes a photo email to be created when you use Explorer's
<em>Send to &gt; Mail recipient </em>function even though you only want to send an attachment.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you currently access your email?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are simply trying to select a file and clicking <strong>Send To/Mail Recipient</strong>, this will not work with a Mail App, such as the default mail app in Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to have a Local Desktop Email program installed for this to work, such as
<strong>Windows Live Mail</strong> which is a part of the Windows Essentials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Live Mail - Free</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-other-programs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-other-programs</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To attach the picture using the Windows 8 Mail App, open the Mail App and select
<strong>New email</strong> message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Paper Clip</strong> Icon at the <strong>top/right</strong> (Attachments).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Navigate to the folder where the picture is stored and <strong>select</strong> the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click the <strong>Attach</strong> button on the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will attach the file to the new email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Let us know if this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            <p>Okay I have downloaded the Microsoft Essen. and it took alooong time. finally over night it finished.So now it is doing something else updating I think so I haven't tried the part to send a picture from my documents to an e-mail yet as soon as I do I will
 let you know if it worked. </p>
<p>&nbsp; It also said something about payments??? is this Microsoft.Ess. going to cost me???I thought it was free to download??? All I want it for is so I can put attchements to my e-mails,do I have to pay for that???I'm not a business person just an old lady on
 Social Security and I can't afford to pay for anything at this point. Please tell me if this is going to cost because I will have to delet it ,cause I can't afford anymore bills now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I do want so much to share my pictures with my family an friends though. We moved to Missouri in Jan. from the mountains of Pa. and all my family and friends are back in Pa.and they want to see the picturs I have taken of Missouri.So far I have them in
 my doctuments in the computer,I did learn how to put my pictures from the ditial camera to the computer after about 3 months,.I wish I wasn't so computer stupid,we were lucky to have catulators when I was young. a 4 yr. ld knows more about how to use these
 computers than hubby and I do.But we are trying. I will let you know how things goes,when I try toput a picture on the e-mail. Thanks again. Hugs Peggy8650.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade from Windows 8.1 continues to fail</h2>
                    I have a HP laptop that I updated from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 Home Edition. When the "<strong>feature update to Windows 10, version 1709</strong>" tries to install, it says, 'in order to continue Windows needs to restart." I restart the computer and
 it start the entire procedure again: download, install, restart. This has been going on for months and I need help. My computer person rolled back to 8.1, then re-installed Windows 10, but that didn't work. Any ideas, please?

A corrupted Windows system files is one of the possible reasons why you are having issues upgrading your computer to Windows 10. I would suggest that you download the latest Windows 10 ISO file from this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> on a different computer and perform a clean install of Windows 10. You can follow the steps in this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install-insiderplat_pc/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">
Forum Article </a>that was provided by <strong>Andre Da Costa </strong>to perform a clean install or reinstall of Windows 10.<br />

            I did try a clean install of Windows 10, but that still didn't work. Is there any way to stop it from trying to download version 1709?

<p>Hello Barbara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since you want to stop the Windows 10 1709 update, I would suggest that read Andre Da Costa's (One of the Microsoft MVP) article on this
<strong><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/block-windows-10-feature-update-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">website</a></strong> so that you will know if it is compatible with 1709 and how to prevent it from installing on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further queries, feel free to post back.</p>
<p>

<h3> jayson-27  say:</h3>
<h2>            sound card stops working and cannot play videos&#33;</h2>
                    ok well i had this all typed out and was trying to get the message Windows Media Player gave me when putting the video in there instead of VLC Player when it froze my computer.<br />
<br />
I have had my computer on all day and no problem at all, I had been playing Heroes of Newerth earlier and all was fine. I decided to start editing in Adobe After Effects and anyway..<br />
<br />
I tried to open a file i had previously rendered a few days ago (900MB for 8 seconds.. what the?)<br />
and when i opened it in VLC Player&nbsp; my screen changed and a little bar down the bottom said something like " a problem running is not compatible with some visuals of windows." the thing is VLC's play bar was playing as if it was playing the actual clip when
 all i seen was a black screen.<br />
<br />
now its not the file as i had tried a few other video files to which the same happened in VLC<br />
so i tried in windows media player and it said something about my sound card being damaged or something about my sound card.<br />
i was trying to see exactly what it said by running it in windows media player again and it froze my computer.<br />
the only way to fix this and get videos playing again is to restart my computer<br />
<br />
This isnt just video related aswell, randomly on a game Heroes of Newerth it will just close with no crash report and if i load it back up and rejoin the game.<br />
it loads all well and everything but as soon as i go into combat(attack or get attacked by anyone) (aka sounds and cpu being used) it will just closed again.
<br />
it will keep closing at the milisecond of a battle vsing someone. This is not a game related error as it would post a error report and it doesnt seem like its corrupt game files as its not a specific hero or sound. and i can play just fine for days until this
 happens.<br />
<br />
<br />
the only way to fix this yet again is to restart the computer and it works 100%<br />
<br />
youtube videos seem to load slow aswell (maybe just my internet tho)<br />
<br />
NOTE: the above does not freeze my computer, i dont know why but that was the first time it froze when opening windows media player.<br />
help is appreciated.<br />
i can still do anything i want.<br />
<br />

    <title>Win 10 Update Changed The Look Of My Display - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gordonjack  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 Update Changed The Look Of My Display</h2>
                    <p>Hello All</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been happily using Win 10 Home 64bit for easily over a year now. Absolutely no complaints.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then last night I noticed my login screen looked different (stretched) after an update restart.</p>
<p>When I logged in, everything looks stretched. Like a 4:3 stretched to 16:9.</p>
<p>Nothing looked sharp anymore.</p>
<p>I actually changed it to 4:3 and it looked sharp again then back to widescreen where it looked stretched again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed screen resolutions, checked my display adapter driver was ATI Radeon 3000 and forced my monitor driver AOC F22s to replace the Generic pnp monitor. I even uninstalled the last 2 updates. &nbsp;All to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still the same look (stretched) and not sharp like it was yesterday before the updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked my ATI Radeon 3000 and it's under 'not supported by Win 10'. But I have enjoyed a crystal clear display for the past year or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have I just been getting away with it for the past year? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Have Microsoft caught up with me and I'm now forced to buy a new graphics card?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All thoughts/experiences will be read with interest.</p>

<p>Hi Gordon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be compatibility issues with your graphics card driver and your Windows 10 after the update. In this case, we suggest that you contact the graphics card manufacturer to check if there's an updated driver that is compatible with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other questions or concerns in the future, we're just a click away.</p>

<p>23 Nov 2107 update KB4055254 has stretched my Acer Aspire 5738G running a&nbsp;Win 10 OS.&nbsp; An online chat with MS Answer Desk (service request 1405555454) ran a system restore.&nbsp; This temporarily fixed the display problem but after KB4055254 again downloaded and
 installed, the problem returned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've messed around with display device&nbsp;drivers and rolling back resolved the problem.&nbsp; So far attempting to resolve this&nbsp;problem&nbsp;has&nbsp;wasted several hours of messing around in hyperspace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can MS support get in touch to the tech boffins to let them know that there is a problem with KB055254 asap?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<div>&nbsp;This is a silly answer. Basically Microsoft has said, “something we have done has damage the software on your computer that runs the video display. But it’s not our fault, it’s your software’s fault. So try to get them to fix it.“</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>Chsrisnne, &nbsp;these are ATI 3000 graphics cards. Integrated on our motherboards for thousands upon thousands of computer users. Are you trying to tell us that Microsoft sent out this update automatically on our computers without regard to all the people who
 have this graphics card? If that’s true, I’m shutting down automatic updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;It’s irresponsible and stupid of Microsoft to do such a thing. It is no sense “support“ for you personally to say contact the video manufacturer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do we have any other options besides windows to run our computers?</p>

<p>

<p>Sounds to me like a display adapter driver problem.&nbsp; This is a known issue currently, rather widespread for devices using AMD graphics cards.&nbsp; It resulted from MS providing less than perfect driver updates for AMD Radeon
 display adapters.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Do you have an AMD display adapter?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Determine what brand name graphics card aka (display adapter, video card, graphics processing unit) you have on your device... by&nbsp;<span>right</span><span>&nbsp;</span>clicking the Start menu&gt;Device Manager&gt;Display Adapter&gt;Expand it&gt;Properties&gt;all
 right clicks.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>AMD is your brand name display adapter, you should update the driver by going to the manufacture's website&nbsp;<a href="https://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>&nbsp;
 selecting "Autodetect" then download what autodetect finds for you.&nbsp; This is the easiest way to do it&nbsp;<span><strong>if</strong></span>&nbsp;you have an AMD display adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have a AMD Radeon Display Adapter on your device, then this wouldn't apply to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My display resolution problems were corrected immediately after updating the Display Adapter Driver from the AMD website found above using AutoDetect.&nbsp; Sleep mode was again found in the shut down options&nbsp;</p>
<p>
