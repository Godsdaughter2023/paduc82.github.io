<h2>            Windows 8.1 Pro Student Edition .iso product key not working.</h2>
                    Hi All,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have downloaded my Windows 8.1 Pro Student Edition online.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I downloaded the file and then when prompted I downloaded the ISO file onto a dvd.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now my plan was to load the ISO file onto a brand new SSD. I installed the SSD and unplugged my HDD with Windows 7 on it and switched the memory type ACHI in my bios.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I booted the dvd fine and the installation began. Now when prompted to put in my product key I entered the one I was emailed and got the message: your product key can not be verified. please check your installation media....</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am kinda at a loss on what to do.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone please help?<br />
<br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I make all group video callers cams same size anymore&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Before this new version of Skype, I could make all the video callers in our group call cameras the same size. Now it only shows 4 participants in large size with any one else being little cams in the corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to enlarge ALL 6 callers like I use to be able to. Can any one help me? Example down below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Old Skype</strong> - Just an example...But all cams are same size when activated and how we need it!</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d5b963b4-8abd-498a-b9f2-3e50628bdb19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d5b963b4-8abd-498a-b9f2-3e50628bdb19" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>NEW SKYPE</strong> - Only 4 cams will enlarge with any other callers staying small and in the corner...Doesn't work for what we need it to do</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b31c25a8-26a8-422d-9261-2c6bc3a40933" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b31c25a8-26a8-422d-9261-2c6bc3a40933" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Mind you, if we could get all 6 cams showing (not including me) the way the new Skype is, that would be awesome...Just can't get more than 4 in full size. PLEASE HELP!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Awesome! I think the reboot was absolutely fantastic, especially when you compare it to Underworld. I'm very excited to see what the next gen capabilities will do to push this saga to its limit. If they bring back multiplayer, I want more tomb raider style
 game modes like "first to find the artefact wins" or "first to make it out of a collapsing tomb, wins". Etc..

<p>Agreed. I think the important thing for Enix right now, is to NOT get the idea of a co-op campaign in their heads lol. I mean don't get me wrong, I will likely still grab a copy but I prefer if it retains its root to at least a certain degree.</p>

<p>The original Tomb Raider she fought just one human if I recall correctly, spending the rest killing endangered species, here she's murdering left and right with no moral qualms.</p>

<p>Yeah I think it goes without saying that she killed more people in the reboot, then she did in the entire franchise prior to the latest instalment. Though I'm pretty sure they did that to emphasise on the survival aspects of the game. I'm not too sure that
 the game would of been received as well, had there only been tigers, lions and bears on the island. I don't think the next game will be as murderous and cold and&nbsp;I imagine they just built on that to show the audience who Lara is, and how she became who she's
 going to become.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I knew from the moment I saw her pick up duel wield, that the next game would be amazing lol.</p>

<p>Great news, completed the first one last week after picking it up for only £7.50.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Loved the way the game was presented, hopefully the next one will have a bit more of an 'isolated Lara' feel to it to tie it in with the old Tomb Raiders but continue to have the polish of the most recent offering. Less quicktime events aswell please!
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I know I'm sounding very specific about it, but as a massive fan since the first tomb raider (it was my first game for the PS1 when I was 13) I don't want to see it go to pot and just become a cash cow like other 'AAA' titles that I won't say out loud for
 fear of offending certain people.</p>

    <title>Xbox Live account region changed, cannot access Live on Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Live account region changed, cannot access Live on Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>At this point I'm really just posting to see if I show up as Gold in the forum.</p>

<p>Found that my account was eligible for a 1-month trial of Gold so wanted to get on my bro's Xbox One (I don't own one yet and my 360 is a whole other batch of headaches). &nbsp;For some reason, when I went to enter my billing information, I was transferred to
 Xbox New Zealand page and couldn't enter a U.S. address. &nbsp;Since I use a prepaid Virtual Credit Card based in the U.K. (but in U.S. dollars; point is, I've used it before) the address doesn't even matter. &nbsp;The subscription shows up on my account but I cannot
 access any Live features on the console or website (except messaging from Xbox.com but that might not be a Gold feature anymore) and my account shows purchases from multiple regions (US and NZ). &nbsp;All of the purchases are legitimate but I have never lived in
 NZ and would have no reason to have my region set to it. &nbsp;I have no idea how or when it happened because I don't use Xbox very often right now, but it seems to go back several months. &nbsp;I tried saying "screw it" and just doing another trial now that I can navigate
 to the US Xbox.com site, but it won't let me because it sees I already have a Gold subscription (I just can't actually use it).</p>

<p>The Twitter support team has elevated it to "you need to call it." &nbsp;I hate calling people. &nbsp;It takes forever and I don't have time to compose my thoughts. &nbsp;I'm not exactly well-spoken. &nbsp;Any thoughts about getting this fixed some other way? &nbsp;I can't change
 the region from the Xbox One or change my account region, but I've manged to change my Xbox.com region (or something; these new menus are stupid hard to navigate).</p>

<p>Okay, since someone else can do this for me (sorry Miss Quinzel, I have an itch clicker finger) I'll just post my solution.</p>
<p>I wrote Online chat support again and this time they were able to do a bit more digging into my issue. &nbsp;I don't think they're 100% sure what happened, but they were able to cancel my faulty subscription and issue me a code for a new month. &nbsp;Everything is
 working square now.</p>
<p>My advice when they're having trouble with your issue is to be polite, diligent and detailed. &nbsp;At first the chat rap could not even see my subscription, but when I explained the region-change issue and asked them to take a look at my Microsoft billing and
 subscriptions, they were able to see my Gold subscription even though it did now show up in my Xbox billing and subscriptions page.</p>
<p>Sorry for the bump. &nbsp;This forum needs an edit function. &nbsp;Anyway, this was the solution.</p>

<p>Chat got the issue fixed after another try. &nbsp;They canceled my subscription and gave me a one month code that worked for my account. &nbsp;They also made a note of whatever was causing my billing issues and what was keeping me from connecting to Live services.</p>

    <title>Windows event ID 6008 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darraghdonohoe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows event ID 6008</h2>
                    <p>My laptop shuts down under medium to high stress (from Watching YouTube/Twitch or updating a steam game, to playing a big game). I've had this problem since the start of summer this year, and have brought it to multiple pc repair shops, each giving me a
 different cause or reason as to why this is happening. First guy said it was the fan, and that it was clogged up or dirty, but I had cleaned it myself prior to bringing it in to him. Another thought my heat sink was the problem, but I personally can't see
 what could be the problem with a heat sink as long as it's not cracked or anything (which it isn't). And even one guy told me that the thermal paste on my CPU/GPU was at fault, and so replaced the paste. All of them have charged me for their "work", but none
 could fix the problem. I've been looking on-line for similar issues with other people, and I have tried multiple "fixes" to no avail. And so, as a result, I'm about ready to throw my laptop against a wall...</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The laptop is not overheating in any way, as I have thoroughly cleaned it, and the fan is working perfectly fine.</li><li>It was suggested by a forum that the problem may be caused by Daemon tools and sptd, I was getting an error event id 4 source sptd at the same time as 6008, and so have removed both, but the event 6008 still occurs, but the sptd error does not.</li><li>most forums were suggesting a PSU problem, so I have removed the battery from the laptop, and then re-installed it, fully charged it, and plugged out charger, but either way, the problem still occurred.</li><li>I have not installed any new hard/software prior to this problem starting. And just in case a windows update or something was the problem, I tried rolling back to a previous time when I did not have this problem, but it didn't work &nbsp;</li><li>The problem still occurs during safe mode.</li><li>I've seen on many forums that the problem occurs due to a Windows security update called ME872389471, &nbsp;or something like that, but 
</li><li>I'm getting the event id 1101, which just says source as event log, in the "audit success" tab, but under the "log" tab it says security, so maybe it is that Windows security update? However this event logs about one minute after crash.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>Can't think of any further relevant information to include, but if there's anything I'm missing please ask away.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, in advance to anyone that helps :)</p>
<p><br />

    <title>Buying and Selling accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> get the borgore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Buying and Selling accounts</h2>
                    <p>So I was recently wondering and thought I'd ask is it legal or illegal to buy, sell, and/or Trade accounts not just on Xbox but any game, console, and/or computer</p><p>I looked it up outta curiosity and some say it's legal and others say it's illegal but what got me curious about this subject is I heard someone say they bought his&nbsp;account from his&nbsp;friend that lives near him because his friend got rid of his xbox so he sold it to him. Now I am not going to mention the name of the account but I did want to know about this.</p>

    <title>Auto Open Next Item in Windows 10 Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jameswgerber  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto Open Next Item in Windows 10 Mail</h2>
                    I have an 8" Windows tablet made by Dell.&nbsp; A while ago, Microsoft added the ability to open the next email item after deleting an email.&nbsp; Now it no longer works in portrait mode.&nbsp; Also, there is no delete button at the top, only archive.&nbsp; I have to click
 on the three dots to see the delete button so I need three clicks to delete an email and move to the next item unlike the one click on every other email program.&nbsp; Any chance of getting this working correctly?&nbsp; There is plenty of screen room to have a delete
 button.&nbsp; In all the time I have been reading email on Windows, I've used archive maybe 4 or 5 times so why is this given preference with no way to change?

            <p>That information is actually in the program's FAQ. You just don't necessarily have to opt out in order for it to work.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>Will I still receive Xbox Live Rewards Credits if I change my Microsoft account (email)?
</p>
<p>Yes. Updating your Microsoft account (email) associated with your Gamertag will not impact your Xbox Live Rewards Credits deposits. However, if you do make this change, you won't be able to sign into the Xbox Live Rewards site with your old Microsoft account (email) until you take an extra step. After 72 hours, you will need to re-register for the program with the new Microsoft account (email). After 4 days you should be able to sign in with your new Microsoft account and view your information on the MyRewards page.</p>
<p>Phone/chat support do not handle the rewards program so they don't have correct information on how it works. That's why they couldn't answer it for you.</p>

https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/xbox-live/error-code-807b0193</a> ,came back with the exact same steps you listed out. Reading ahead into it the phrase "Error 807b0193 occurs when you try to download you Xbox Live profile." So, this may mean that the
 Netflix app on the Xbox 360 is having trouble reading your account information and not exactly the Xbox itself. Try to uninstall or reinstall the Netflix app after waiting a bit and see what happens when you boot it back up/log back in. Alternatively, the
 troubleshooter does simply recommend waiting... so you may not get to watch Netflix for a few hours. If you've confirmed all services are up and you are connected to Xbox Live then the waiting game is what you'll have to play.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Joey.  
<br />I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Try restarting your modem, router and PC in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try updating the Network adapter driver from the PC's Support Downloads webpage.   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Try Rolling back and then Uninstalling the Network adapter driver in Device Manager.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose the Network adapter you're using, on Driver tab choose Roll back, restart PC.  If that doesn't help  ry Uninstall, restart to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else works check which version of WIndows 10 you're running at Settings&gt;System&gt;About.  If not 1709 what I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.  
<br />
<br />If problems persist with the new version then you can roll it back and hide it with the Hide Updates tool to wait for it to mature more:   <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstall-windows-10-creators-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstal...</a>
<br />Hide Updates Tool:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>
<br />
<br />If an older version then you can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I'd also check at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates if there were WIndows Updates installed before this problem started.  You can uninstall them from the link there to see if the problem goes away.  If so you can hide the Updates using the same tool above.  
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If still no luck then I'd download the latest media for your version of Windows 10 from this site, click on the ISO or open the bootable media, right click Setup to run it as a Repair Install:  <a href="https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-and-office-iso-download-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-scienc...</a>
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            You should contact the game's developer for information on that.&nbsp; However, currently MS is not doing any additional BC games for the time being while they get ready for the release of Scarlett in 18 months so we will have to wait until the program is started
 back.&nbsp;

<h2>            Linksys wireless card</h2>
                    Hey, I'm having a bit of trouble getting my wireless card to work on a Windows Vista 64-bit OS. I've installed updated drivers for my version (4.0 for the model number WMP54G) but they don't seem to be working correctly. Once the installation finishes
 Windows asks me to install the Network Controller and when I try using the automatic search or manually search for it I can't seem to find it. Is this just a compatibility issue or is there something I can do to get it to work properly?

<p><span><span>Hi Stockus,</span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for choosing Windows Vista Forums.<br />
<br />
You can follow the below steps to download and install WMP54G wireless card.</span></p>
<p><span>Go to
</span><span><a href="http://www.linksys.com/vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.linksys.com/vista</a>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Search for "WMP54G v4.0" and click on the 64 bit driver download
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download and save the drivers and you will have to unzip the file</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go to your computer, click on START and click on Control Panel, then search for the Systems icon.&nbsp; Once you open the Systems icon, on the left hand side
 click on Device Manager.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Scroll down to Networks, click on the + sign, (if you have installed the software already you should have a plus sign and you should see Linksys Wireless-G
 PCI Adapter)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Double click on the Linksys Wireless-G PCI Adapter, and then click on the Driver Tab on the top of the window, and click on Update Driver.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the first selection "Search automatically for updated driver software” Your computer will start the search for the drivers that you recently downloaded
 and saved on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<br />
</span><span><br />
Drivers designed for 32-bit versions of Windows do not work on computers running a 64-bit version of Windows. If you're trying to install a device that only has 32-bit drivers available, it won't work correctly on a 64-bit version of Windows. If you are unsure
 whether there is a 64-bit driver available for your device, go online to the </span>

    <title>Unusually slow internet connection only on Windows 10 system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> happymonkey003  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unusually slow internet connection only on Windows 10 system</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need some help identifying why the connection on my Windows 10 system is suddenly experiencing significantly below 1mbps speeds, often completely failing to load webpages. Here are some notes and troubleshooting steps I've taken so far.</p>
<p><br />
Observations:</p>
<p>- Problem persists across main browser (chrome) as well as firefox and edge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Problem persists in other programs (Steam, Discord, etc).&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Not experiencing unusual or excessive cpu, memory, disk, or network load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting steps taken:</p>
<p>- Restart computer</p>
<p>- Tried other browsers and disabling browser extensions</p>
<p>- Run CCleaner</p>
<p>- Checked for any viruses (with Malwarebytes, Avast, and Windows Defender). No problems found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nathan</p>

<br />If that does not work
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network Adapters 
<br />Select the Network card listed,
<br />Select “Update Driver”

<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network adapters
<br />Right click your adapter
<br />Click Uninstall

<br />Disable Energy Efficient Ethernet in "Client for Microsoft Networks"
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager, expand Network Adapters, right-click the adapter &gt; Properties &gt; Power Management, and then clear the Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power check box.
<br />
<br />If you don't have that option, see other ways to disable it:

<br />
<br />If the network connection is slow or lagging, check if Windows 10 is downloading Windows Update or the Microsoft Store is downloading updates. These can sometimes affect the performance your network connection.
<br />
<br />Try adding the Google Public DNS to your router then see if you can successfully browse the site:

<br />
<br />
<br />If the connection is slow, remove any special bundled software that came with the motherboard.

<p>Thanks for the response!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- run netsh int ip reset command, then reset computer</p>
<p>- run troubleshooter for wireless card, didn't identify any problems</p>
<p>- run troubleshooter for all network cards, says "problem resolved", or words to that effect. then reset computer</p>
<p>- tried to revert to old wireless card driver, unable to do so. only gives the option to automatically or manually search for driver files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- uninstalled wireless card, then reset computer</p>
<p>- tried to disable "cloud wireless network" setting, as described. Only similar setting I found was "Hotspot 2.0 networks. I disabled this, then reset computer<br />
</p>
<p>at this point, nothing has worked and my download speed is still well &lt;1Mbps down, showing 0.05Mbps down on google speed test. All other devices on this connection are running at the usual 10-15+Mbps down consistently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll post this then continue working through suggested troubleshooting steps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I attempted to add the described static dns addresses to my router with no success. I'm not sure why, but the boxes where I'd enter new DNS addresses are greyed out and I don't know how to access them. In any case, this option surely can't be causing the
 problem because it wasn't doing so before, and all the other computers are working fine.&nbsp; As a result, I'm going to skip this step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've uninstalled my third party antivirus software and am only running Windows Defender, but the problem still persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other actions you can suggest that may help identify the problem?&nbsp;</p>

            Update: I've just tested the system with a wired connection and it speed immediately went to 28Mbps down when the wireless connection was 0.05 down (until today 10+ down). Seems the problem is something to do with this specific wireless card.

<br />8 -  I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

Hi sleasyridr,</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers!</p>
<p>a. Who is the manufacturer of the computer?<br />
b. Have you installed the display drivers for the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Snap is a quick (and fun) new way to resize open windows, simply by dragging them to the edges of your screen. Depending on which edge you choose—top or bottom, left or right—the window will expand vertically, fill the screen, or you can even position windows
 side by side. Snap makes reading, organizing, and comparing windows a...well, you get the picture.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/features/snap.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/features/snap.aspx</a></p>
<p>Check out this link:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Expand-windows-vertically-on-the-desktop-using-Snap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Expand-windows-vertically-on-the-desktop-using-Snap</a></p>
<p>Here the Note says: Snap might not work some programs that have custom window behaviors.</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>To change the custom window behaviors visit the following link and follow the steps accordingly and select the Default Windows theme and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/customize-a-theme" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/customize-a-theme</a></p>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p>Install the display drivers for the computer by following these steps:</p>
<p>Some devices have drivers that you need to install yourself.</p>
<p>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Security, and then, under System, clicking Device Manager.&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide
 confirmation.‌</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the list of hardware categories, find the device that you want to update, and then double-click the device name.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Driver tab, click Update Driver, and then follow the instructions.&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If this does not help, visit the system manufacturer's website and download the latest updated display drivers compatible with Windows 7 Operating system and install the same and check if the issue persists.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Trying to install Epson driver but installer tries to install an old - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dougmack  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to install Epson driver but installer tries to install an old deleted program instead &#40;Win 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to install a driver for an Epson Perfection V300 Photo scanner, with the install program epson13534.exe.</p>
<p>When the installer says it is going to install the file, an install routine for Spectrum Software Micro-Cap 11 Evaluation Setup</p>
<p>comes up, and if left to run, will install that program.</p>
<p>History: Windows10 was upgraded from Win8.1, which was upgraded from Win8, which was upgraded from Win7. Win7</p>
<p>or Win 8.1 (I don't remember which) had the Micro-Cap program installed, and I would like to reinstall it and use it again, but first I want to install my scanner driver, and I can't.
</p>
<p>I have tried to uninstall Micro-Cap using the Windows uninstaller, and also Revo Uninstaller and !Obit Uninstaller. (I have to</p>
<p>reinstall the Micro-Cap app each time, because all the uninstallers say they have done the job, and then nothing will</p>
<p>list the file as being there.) BUT IT IS--or at least some part of it!</p>
<p>How can I search and destroy the entire Micro-Cap milieu so I can install the Epson software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: All the versions of Microsoft Uninstaller and Cleanup Utility and whatever followed it are obsolete, as far as I can tell,</p>
<p>and don't work on Windows10. Is there a modern utility that I can download from somewhere trustworthy that takes
</p>
<p>its place?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to all who help--doug</p>

            <p>I solved the problem. The problem is in the Epson driver install file., epson13534.exe.</p>
<p>I don't know just what the problem is, but I accidentally solved it this way:</p>
<p>I decided to copy the file to a Flash Drive. The copy routine said that there were some
</p>
<p>special features (or something like that) and would I like to copy without the special features?</p>
<p>I said yes. then I installed the file from the dongle, and all went perfectly, so there is something</p>
<p>not kosher with the Epson installer file. I'll try and get ahold of Epson and advise them, but</p>
<p>they are not so easy to contact, if some attempts a year or two ago are still in force.</p>
<p>

<p>problem.</p>

            It sounds liks the batteries could be dying or just about dead, I would recommend putting in fresh ones as well as power cycling your console.&nbsp; That should most likely take care of the issue!

            I would recommend testing to see if this happens whilst connected via USB too, you can use a couple testing apps also. One is the official Xbox Accessories app, or one of the controller testing apps on the MS store on PC. The PC testing apps can pick up
 more issues like thumb stick drift too. Hope this helps.

            If none of the above solutions work you might have a wandering controller.&nbsp; &nbsp;If your controller is still under warranty you can take it to a local Microsoft store for a replacement or send it in to Microsoft.&nbsp; All Microsoft controllers come with a 90 day
 warranty.

            When it wanders are the LS and RS in the upright position? Is this an official xbox&nbsp; controller or one made other than by microsoft? How long have you had it and how long have you been having this issue? Have you tried making sure it has the latest updates?
 What about connecting to a USB to see if the same issue exists or impairing it from the console and then re-pairing it? Have you tried pairing it to a different xbox if one is available like in another room or a friend's? Try a few of these methods if you
 haven't. If the controller is fairly new from a store you can always return it for an exchange or check the manufactuer warranty.&nbsp;

<p><span>My Xbox one console was banned randomly in the middle of my gameplay. I have no idea why it happened. I called Microsoft and they seem to not have any record of the reason why it was banned. I DID NOT get a email saying why I was banned. I also check
 the enforcement website and when I checked my pass enforcement actions against me, there was nothing on the wensite saying that I'm console banned. I'm very upset about this and would like to see if someone can uplift the ban on my console. The Gamertag is
 xX ColdHearted. I've never did anything to get console banned (no hacks, glitches etc). I've been a long time Xbox/Microsoft customer and don't appreciate the treatment I'm receiving on this matter. Can someone please get back in touch with me regarding a
 uplifting of this console ban. Thank you!</span></p>

<p>Sign in to enforcement.xbox.com with the account that received the enforcement action and select the large box with an orange hammer icon, or visit your Enforcement History.</p>
<p>Find the enforcement action that you wish to have reviewed, and select Apply for Review.</p>
<p>Read the Case Review Terms of Use and agree by clicking the checkbox and selecting Agree.</p>
<p>If you are already eligible for a Case Review, select the green arrow icon. If you are not yet eligible, you will be presented with a short questionnaire. These questions help gauge your understanding of the Code of Conduct and associated policies. Upon
 successful completion of the questionnaire, select the green arrow icon.</p>
<p>Provide any details (up to 500 characters) regarding the enforcement action that may help XBLPET conduct a more complete investigation. This may include context around the activity or content that received enforcement, information about your game activity,
 or any other facts that you believe are worth noting. When complete, select Submit.</p>
<p>After submitting, an XBLPET agent will begin a thorough review of the enforcement action. This includes reviewing available data and re-examining evidence that contributed to the enforcement, taking into account any new details that you have provided.</p>
<p>For additional information about the Case Review process, please visit this page on enforcement.xbox.com.</p>

            Internet Explorer 11 is already Installed in Windows 10. Just click on start, scroll through apps till you find Windows Accessories, click on it, and you will find Internet Explorer. You can Pin it tp your start scree and/or Taskbar. Hope this helps and
 if you need any further assistance post and we be glad to help.

            Hi you should still have internet explorer. Check in the start menu under windows accessories. If your start menu doesnt show when you open it there is a hamburger menu in the upper left corner.Click on that then scroll down to windows accessories and&nbsp;
 click the down button. I like to pin it to the taskbar as I use it most. If you cant find it that way type internet explorer into cortana search .

<p>If you don't like Microsoft Edge, that's fine, but don't use Internet Explorer. That's old technology that hasn't been updated in years, except for security updates, and won't be updated in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE was included in Windows 10 for the benefit of businesses who have old software that relies on the outmoded technologies of Internet Explorer, like ActiveX controls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't like Microsoft Edge, switch to a modern browser that's up to date with current standards, like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox or the Opera browser.</p>

            First, put the startup CD away.<br />
<br />
Second, since we know nothing about your system, you could tell us about it.<br />
<br />
Third, follow the directions in this thread:<br />

    <title>Two profiles but the mouse only works on one - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Two profiles but the mouse only works on one</h2>
                    I have two profiles set up on my Samsung laptop, this morning when I logged into my primary profile the mouse works on the opening page (displaying the time and date), it also works on the sign in page, but as soon as I signed into my primary profile and
 the Start Page loads the mouse disappears leaving me unable to navigate. The Start screen appears to be functioning normally. &nbsp;I then rebooted my machine and logged in under my other profile and the mouse works just fine. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I resolve this issue?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

            <div>Hi Rob,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community and giving us an opportunity to assist you.</div>
<div><br />
As per the issue description, it seems like the mouse does not work properly on one of the user account after you sign in to the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would like to ask some questions on this issue to help you in a better way:</div>
<div><br />
1) Which account are you referring to when you say primary profile? Is it a standard account or an administrator account on the computer?<br />
2) Are you trying to sign in using a Microsoft account or a local account&nbsp;to the primary user account?<br />
3) Is this issue specific to the primary account only?<br />
4) Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This issue might be because of the corrupt user account. Let’s create another user account and check if you get the same issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can refer to the link to create another user account:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the section “<strong>To create a local account</strong>”:</div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-CA/windows-8/create-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-CA/windows-8/create-user-account</a>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Check if the issue still occurs on the new user account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope it helps.</div>
<div><br />
Please feel free to contact us if you have any other Windows related issue and we would be happy to help you.<br />

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>I have managed to correct the problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I connected an external mouse while logged in to the primary (administrator) account.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This allowed me to navigate through to the system settings.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For some reason in this user profile the moose/track pad had been disabled.<span>&nbsp;
