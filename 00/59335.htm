<h2>            The USB Controller Is In a Failed State</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP Compaq Presario CQ57</p>
<p>Windows 10</p>
<p>4.00 GB RAM</p>
<p>5.00 GB HDD</p>
<p>Intel(R) Celeron(R) CPU B800 @ 1.50 GHz</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I updated my laptop with the Windows 10 1st, Anniverssary Update some of my apps stop working and some others were unistalled. Windows Store was unable to fix them. After a few day of searching for a solution in the WEB to no avail, I decided to format
 the unit. I used the built-in feature. The update wizard toll me that the system was unable to undo the changes but it offered two options, to keep my files or to do a complete clean-up, I chose the second one. Everything ran perfectly to successfully install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to <span><span>comfort</span> <span>and convenience I use an external USB keyboard and a USB mouse, but when I tried to use them&nbsp; just after I formatted the laptop they didn't work. THE USB CONTROLLER is not showing in the DEVICE MANAGEMENT so refresh
 is not an option.</span></span><span><span>I tried to install them manually but it didn't work. Windows Update fail to install (Intel - Other Hardware - Interl(R) 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller - 1C2D - Error 0x800f0219) I
 looked for the error code solutions&nbsp; nut none of the metods I could found worked.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>AMONG OTHERS, I HAVE TRIED THIS:</span></span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to uninstall the drivers from the device manager and then re-install it.</span></p>
<p><span>You may also try to refresh device manager and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click on&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong> and type&nbsp;“<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong>” (without quotes), and then Enter. The&nbsp;Device Manager&nbsp;window opens.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click to select your computer as the location for the scan.</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;On the&nbsp;Action&nbsp;menu, click&nbsp;<strong>Scan for hardware changes</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>d.&nbsp;Close the Device Manager window and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue is not resolved, I would suggest you to disable and re-enable the USB controllers:
</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on <strong>Start</strong>, and then click on
<strong>Run</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type “<strong>devmgmt.msc” </strong>
without quotes, and then click <strong>OK</strong>. Device Manager opens. </span>
</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Expand <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>.
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> You might have to scroll down the list to find this item. </span>
</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right click the first USB controller under
<strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>, and then click <strong>Uninstall</strong> to remove it.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Repeat step 4 for each USB controller that is listed under
<strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Restart the computer. After the computer starts, Windows will automatically scan for hardware changes and reinstall all the USB controllers that you uninstalled.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I ran the USB troubleshooter and automatic fix and also results in an error:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>"</span></span>the usb controller is in a failed state or is not currently installed"</p>
<p><span><span>No device connected to the USB port works but the power charger </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>I will keep searching through the WEB while I wait for an answer.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>PS I have tried almost every popular metod to no success!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks in advance.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: </strong><br />
I would suggest you to restart the computer in clean boot mode and check if the issue persists.<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>Also, see the section on how to return your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps under
<strong>“Reset the computer to start as usual”.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>If the issue still persists you may scan your computer for virus using Microsoft Safety Scanner.</p>
<p>Microsoft Safety Scanner will help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.</p>
<p>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.<br />
<br />
<strong>Disclaimer: </strong>If you run the virus scan the program that is infected with virus will get deleted. So you have to reinstall the program. Also if the files and folders are affected with virus then they might even get deleted.</p>
<p><strong>Method 3: </strong><br />
If the issue is still not resolved you may run [System File Checker] SFC scan on the computer which would scan for corrupt system files on the computer and replace them.<br />

    <title>Preview Registration pending after almost 3 days - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aruantec 8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Preview Registration pending after almost 3 days</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, i registered a while ago to the program and got enrolled very quick. I was having fun testing the new features as well as sending my Feedback. Recently i wanted to test Mass Effect backwards compatibility and wanted to test the game on my console.
 After purchasing the game and inserting the disc on my drive i found out that my drive was not working and because of that i send the console to the&nbsp;Microsoft Service Center for repair. The repair didn't took long and my console was back within a week. Now
 everything is working but obviously my Xbox One was resetted which is fine for me. However, i just found out that the preview update was not installed. Since my account was enrolled i simply installed the preview dashboard back but i found out very quick that
 all my quests and feedback was gone. After checking the registration i saw that my console was not registred(even if my console still has the exact same ID) so i registered back. Now the status is pending for almost 3 days and nothing has changed since then
 why? i check the "Other consoles" Option and it says that my ID is enrolled but nothing happens.</p>
<p>I decided to remove that to see if that was the problem but after hitting the remove button i had no way to cancel the operation and now that says "un-enrolling pending" so what i did wrong and why is taking so long???</p>

<p>Short answer yes you have removed yourself from preview programme you will need to be reinvited

<p>I still have the registration app and the preview dashboard but can i register myself again? also is kinda weird since it says that i'm enrolled but when i go to "Manage other Consoles" it says "Unenrolling pending". I think Microsoft should improve the
 preview dashboard a bit in order to prevent such scenarios and if for some reason happen then at least there should be a way to cancel it before requesting the removal.</p>

<p>Alright, the preview app says that i'm enrolled and there is no "Manage other Consoles" anymore but my console still haven't got any preview updates. What should i do now?? should i remove myself again and register once again or just wait more? it's been
 over a week now and nothing. At least a answer from a moderator or someone at Microsoft would be appreciated.</p>

<p>This is the final build until release? While it's running well for me, I wouldn't call it "ready for prime time" just yet.

<h2>            video_tdr_failure windows 8 while playing video games</h2>
                    hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Just recently after a few updates for windows 8, while playing video games the computer freezes, screen goes black, then a BsoD appears with the message video_tdr_failure your computer will restart. This happens after ~5 to 10 mins of game play, Thus far
 i have tried with 2 games and it was causing this problem. I've reinstalled graphic drivers, even tried using older drivers still was having same problem. I'm not sure if its a windows update problem, a graphic card hardware malfunction or a software issue
 (it could also be the games themselves causing an error, im not sure).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>desktop feature:</div>
<div>windows 8 pro 64bit</div>
<div>intel core 2 quad 2.33GHz</div>
<div>memory 8 Gb</div>
<div>graphic card: geforce 9600 GSO - v320.18</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Initial problem: first started with "display driver stopped working and has recovered"&nbsp;</div>
<div>Current problem: BsoD video_tdr_failure crash after 10 mins of Gaming</div>
<div>Games: League of Legends, Diablo 3</div>
<div>Solutions I've tried:</div>
<div>- reinstall graphic drivers</div>
<div>- go to older version of graphic driver</div>
<div>- add tdrdelay 8 to regedit</div>
<div>- ran "diagnose your computers memory problems"</div>
<div>- complete clean, dust removed</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If someone out there knows something, this would help. I could try reinstalling windows. but i want to keep that as a last resort. Thanks in advance</div>
<div><br />
</div>
                </div>

"It's not a true crash, in the sense that the Blue Screen was initiated only because the combination of video driver and video hardware was being unresponsive, and not because of any synchronous processing exception".</b><br />
<br />
<i>Since Vista, the "Timeout Detection and Recovery" (TDR) components of the OS video subsystem have been capable of doing some truly impressive things to try to recover from issues which would have caused earlier OS's like XP to crash.</i><br />
<br />
<i>As a last resort, the TDR subsystem sends the video driver a "please restart yourself now!" command and waits a few seconds.<br />
If there's no response, the OS concludes that the video driver/hardware combo has truly collapsed in a heap, and it fires off that stop 0x116 BSOD.</i><br />
<br />
<i>If playing with video driver versions hasn't helped, make sure the box is not overheating.<br />
&nbsp;Try removing a side panel and aiming a big mains fan straight at the motherboard and GPU.<br />
&nbsp;Run it like that for a few hours or days - long enough to ascertain whether cooler temperatures make a difference.</i><br />
<br />
<span>If so, it might be as simple as dust buildup and subsequently inadequate cooling.</span><br />

            <div>Thank you for your respond,</div>
<div><br />
I will try cpu-z and gpu-z and see what happens while gaming and idle.&nbsp;
<div>But i don't think its temperature issue. Because everything was fine until yesterday, after a windows update occurred, this problem began.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is it possible to undo any update, and go back to older version. I'm thinking something in the update may be interfering with the graphics software.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will be monitoring the Temperature for next couple hours see what happens. Thanks again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>p.s. another thing i was reading on, was to use a windows 7 based 64bit driver for my graphics card. Perhaps the windows 8 version is not stable.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>edit - i just read that article you sent me, I was thinking it might be a directx corrupt file or problem with&nbsp;</div>
<div>corrupt registry.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>What steps should i take to diagnose and repair this if it happens to be the case.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>edit - i just ran the GPU-z and was reading 56oC during Idle, which is pretty high in my opinion, but im not sure.</div>

<p>
</p><p>What's up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried uninstalling and reinstalling.&nbsp; I tried repairing and clearing data.&nbsp; But those features are no longer there.</p>

<p>Hey Beamup!</p>
<p>Has the game been updated since you had last played? Some times features are added or removed through updates to keep the game fresh. If there are missing features you can try submitting feedback from the game itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know with a&nbsp; reply how it goes</p>

<h3> jorgenberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            The new Skype</h2>
                    <p>This is in my opinion a dreadful update Microsoft has made with the new Skype.&nbsp; Now you cannot write more than about 6 lines at a time.&nbsp; The ENTER you have AGAIN made to result in SEND, where "we" always wanted it to mean just a line shift. Why do you change
 that and not make it possible to change it back to the old system.&nbsp; The new colors resulting in messages received are in white font on pink background - who's idea was that?&nbsp; There are limited ways of changing the presentation now to how you really want it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally - just for the moment - WHAT SHOULD I CLICK TO GET BACK TO THE OLD SKYPE WITH ALL THE ADVANTAGES ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or maybe the secret is that Microsoft want us all to change to their "Messenger" which in my view is far to intrusive to enjoy using.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jorgen Berg again here,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also needed to ad the question. Why in the world have you suddenly changed my SKYPE name to something totally new and irrelevant. I have now lost 90% of my usual contacts and how do I get them back&nbsp; &nbsp;. The solution seems to make it possible for me to get
 back to the old SKYPE which in my view - after our user modifications - were perfect to work with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft engineers - to be honest you are not popular with me for the time being, and I have a yearly subscription to Office 365 - in the hope that you don't mess it up again&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do I make a Complaint&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to find contact details to make a complaint but cannot find any.</p>
<p>I contacted the online chat who said they would send me the details but didn't.</p>
<p>My issues include, but are not limited to:</p>
<p>1. One more than one occasion, my surface has restarted, loosing all the apps. When I go to re-install the apps it says they are already installed but I cannot find them.</p>
<p>2. I cannot click on "WiFi Available" to connect to WiFi, so I am limited to connecting to networks that I connected to when this function worked.</p>
<p>3. My touchscreen works 70% of the time.</p>
<p>4. My keyboard mouse works 50% of the time.</p>
<p>5. I am now receiving a blue screen every 15 mins saying there is an error and I need to restart.</p>
<p>6. I contacted the support team who were unable to &nbsp;help as my surface won't even allow a factory reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To sum up, my surface is not fit for purpose, a waste of money, and I now cannot afford a replacement for finish my final year in University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please provide me with contact details to escalate my complaint.</strong></p>

    <title>Suddenly Getting Weird Permission Errors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fredbiles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suddenly Getting Weird Permission Errors</h2>
                    <p>I've been running Windows 10 64 bit since it first came out. I have a number of desktop shortcuts, some linked to .exe files some linked to text files. Only within the last 2 weeks have I been getting permission errors with the message: "Windows cannot access
 the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item." It doesn't matter if they are the .exe files or the text files (which open up in Notepad). They both generate that error msg.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The weird thing is, I get the error msg. the first time that I dbl-click to run or open the files. After, that first time, they all open up fine if I try to open them again. Also, once they have opened, I never get that error message again until I shut down
 and restart. The next time I restart it does the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas about what could be causing this weird behavior?</p>

            Since I wrote that reply, I decided to try disabling my antivirus (Avast free) and see if that did anything. The permission errors I described stopped. However, when I turned it back on (after a restart) , I'm still not getting the errors. I've shut down
 and restarted several times to be sure.&nbsp; So, I don't know if the antivirus was the culprit or if maybe there was some Microsoft update in the interim that fixed the problem but whatever the case, it appears fixed.<br />

<h2>            Why is update KB2536276 causing a block in permissions to access a network SMB server&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On 15th July 2011 Windows Updates downloaded security update KB2536276, however upon installation it would no longer let me access the SMB servers on our network, can anyone suggest what would need to be done on our SMB servers to compensate for the windows
 update or alternatively how to permantely skip ever installing this update through a WSUS group policy?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

            <p>We have found a new solution to this problem, just change the domain name on SMB config file to greater than 7 characters. Doesn't even need to be a legitimate domain name just anything then restart the SMB share, doens tappear to be anything to do with
 encryption for us.&nbsp; Many thanks to all those who responded to original question&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am having a problem similar to this one but I'm stuck on Method #3 and would appreciate any help that might be available on how to proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error I'm getting is "Install server not responding."&nbsp; It only happens when I try to install one specific program.&nbsp; The program worked fine prior to when Dell had me do an "operating system refresh" to resolve some other issues.&nbsp; The Dell tech was careful
 to point out that we were doing an "OS refresh," and not an "OS reinstall" or "clean install," although the difference was not really clear to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had no problems reinstalling any of the other software I had running prior to the "OS refresh," but I get the same trouble when I try to install the software I use to maintain continuous backups of my files.&nbsp; The software's installer extracts a whole
 lot of files and then stops after it gets to "Extract: C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Memeo\ProfMan.dll... 100%"&nbsp; The Windows Installer window opens sometime during that extraction process and says, "Preparing to install..." for a VERY long time until
 it eventually gives me the "Install server not responding" error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried each of the three methods recommended above but none of them have really helped.&nbsp; Method 1 said there was nothing to fix.&nbsp; Attempting to install the software following Method 2 resulted in the same behavior without the error - that is, the Windows
 Installer window just said "Preparing to install..." for over an hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3 resulted in the following:&nbsp; "Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log
<var>%WinDir%</var>\Logs\CBS\CBS.log."&nbsp; The instructions recommended for this result appeared to be beyond my skill level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've contacted the vendor and they have provided me with updated versions of the software, but I get the same error no matter which version I try to install.&nbsp; Can anyone suggest what to do next or help somehow?&nbsp; Thanks!!</p>

<h2>            Quick Access folder lose its default look sometimes</h2>
                    <p>I use Quick Access everyday, but sometimes it represents just recent files without favorite folders and without any grouping. It can be either big thumbnails or list view.<br />
I can go to Explorer settings and reset to default look for all folders, then Quick Access displays everything correctly. I don't like to do that everytime, because then many folders lose view mode I have setup before.<br />
How can I track which program or service cause this bug? Or what do I do to prevent it?</p>
<p>

            Sorry, there is no way you can install selective updates.
<br />The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.

            Please note, Microsoft's approach to updates is very different that earlier releases. They are basically mandatory because of Microsoft's past history with customers sometimes failing to install important updates.
<br />
<br />See options for managing how and when Windows Updates are installed.
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Set your Internet connection as metered:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-10-data-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Use Active Hours and Restart options:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windows-update-behavior-using-active-hours-and-restart-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windo...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 3: 
<br />
<br />Use Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update:
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />Option 4:
<br />
<br />You can create a stop and start script for Windows Update. 
<br />
<br />Create a Notepad file with each of the following and save them with the .bat extension.
<br />
<br />stop-updates.bat:
<br />
<br />sc config wuauserv start= disabled
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />sc config bits start= disabled
<br />net stop bits
<br />
<br />sc config dosvc start= disabled
<br />net stop dosvc
<br />
<br />pause
<br />
<br />start-updates.bat:
<br />
<br />sc config wuauserv start= auto
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />sc config bits start= auto
<br />net start bits
<br />
<br />sc config dosvc start= auto
<br />net start dosvc
<br />
<br />pause
<br />
<br />Now you can simply right click on stop-updates.bat and select “Run as Administrator”

<h2>            WIndows 10 firewall blocking inbound network traffic</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having difficulty trying to get access to play on external Minecraft servers though windows 10. I've narrowed the issue down to the firewall blocking the traffic. Turned the firewall off completely and I have access. Read much about creating
 rules to allow inbound traffic through port 25565 (Minecraft, I'm guessing) for TCP and UDP ports to no avail... I also think there are certain orders that the rules are evaluated in. Not super sure about that :( Tried to allow a program through the firewall
 using "Allow an app or feature through Windows firewall" [Java (TM) Platform SE binary; C:\program files (x86)\minecraft\runtime\jre-x64\1.8.0_25\bin\javaw.exe] also to no avail. This also happened overnight, my son went to bed and everything was fine. Woke
 up unable to connect to external servers. Unsure if it was due to an update or....?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Java version 8 update 151. Windows update is version 1607 for x64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise, Thank you</p>

            Hi Daniel,<br />
<br />
We understand that you would like to know how to configure the firewall ports on your computer. However, your question is beyond the scope of what is typically answered in this consumer forum and would be better suited for the IT Pro audience in

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To help you install apps from Windows Store successfully, we need to ask you a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Does this issue occur with all apps, or one particular app?</li><li>Did you get an error message?</li><li>Did you make any changes to your computer prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some possibilities why you can't install an app from the Windows Store:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span><strong>The app isn't available in your country or region.</strong> Not all apps are available worldwide. So the app your friend saw in France might not be available in Germany. If you bought an app in one country or region and then you moved to another
 one, apps you had might disappear.</span></li><li><span><strong>Family Safety settings might be hiding apps.</strong> Parents can use Family Safety settings to make sure that their child can’t view or install apps that are inappropriate for their age.
</span></li><li><span><strong>The app is no longer available.</strong> Sometimes an app is removed from the Windows Store, but it takes a little time for the app description page on the web to get pulled down.</span></li><li><span><strong>The app is not compatible with your device.</strong> The&nbsp;Windows Store&nbsp;automatically hides or blocks the Buy button on apps that are incompatible with your device. You might see an app from&nbsp;the Windows Store&nbsp;available on your PC, but not on
 another PC, or your Xbox.</span></li><li><span><strong>Your PC was recently updated, but wasn't restarted.</strong> If updates for Windows were recently installed, you'll need to restart your PC before you can install apps from the Windows Store.</span></li></ul>
<span><span>If you've check all of the possible reasons listed and are still unable to find or install apps, you can try clearing the cache for the Windows Store.</span></span>
<p>
</p><p>You may also run the troubleshooter for Windows apps, click this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/69e76f90-d54c-44cf-9851-c2d1542790db/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Skype audio crackle SOLUTION for HP Laptop &#40;may work on others&#41;  WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a bit of trial and error, anyone who has crackle on the speakers giving a lagging effects I found that the DTS control was causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a HP laptop (mines an AMD A6 5200 if that helps).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps I took.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Goto start and type CONTROL and click CONTROL PANEL</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d950418d-0d3f-4165-85bd-542b39ae57be?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d950418d-0d3f-4165-85bd-542b39ae57be?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Then when control panel is open click the DTS Control panel Icon</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d7e2a03b-c3d8-476e-beb9-1e1a96f90f38?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d7e2a03b-c3d8-476e-beb9-1e1a96f90f38?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>It will show this</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d8a4e10-5e6a-4698-87a0-ebafa81d735a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1d8a4e10-5e6a-4698-87a0-ebafa81d735a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Click LISTENING EXPERIENCE (already shown) and make sure the check box is not checked where AUDIO ENHANCEMENTS is as I believe its the dialog clarity setting that is causing the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I enabled and disabled this setting many times testing it today, after also testing different audio and apu drivers, and just this check box being disabled stopped the crackle and lag in the audio received.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do hope this helps someone else. e</p>

            so the physical left pad still does not work after switching, then I think you have a bad pad and
<br />
need repair help.

<h2>            Renamed title for recorded TV shows does not show in WMC list of recordings</h2>
                    When a TV show is recorded it is given the name of the TV show but I want it to apear with another name in the list of recordings in WMC. I can rename the file and even rename the title of the recording in Windows explorer but WMC persists in displaying
 only the original title. There is no means of editing the name within WMC as far as I can see so how can I get my edited name to show in WMC?

<p>Thank you for that link which leads to a nice little utility by Stephen Toub to edit the metadata in the file. However I think that was created several years ago and it is no longer needed in Windows 7 as it is now possible to edit some of the metadata (including
 the title) in the Windows Explorer properties bar. I had already edited the title there but whilst the new title and new filename show fine in Windows Explorer, the new title does not show in WMC. Someone in the blog about Toub's utility did mention this problem
 way back in 2005 and Toub thought it might be because WMC is seeing a cached version of the file but a link to a possible solution to that problem is no longer valid.</p>
<p>After a few days the file I retitled has not refreshed by itself. Is there any way to refresh the cached version? I cannot understand why Microsoft do not provide any means of retitling recorded TV files within Media Center as I would have thought it would
 be quite a common requirement. Surely it is not just me that finds this an inexplicable ommision!</p>

<p><span>Hello, Mike</span></p>
<p><span>You can refresh the fields by removing the folder from the library and re-adding it. To do this, go to Tasks, Settings, Media Libraries, select your library, Remove, uncheck the folder you wish
 to remove and continue. After removing, repeat the steps and choose Add folder and then re-select the folder that was removed.</span></p>
<p><span>Some data fields may not update, if this is the case, you can try removing the database file. Note: This will remove your settings and recording information from Media Center.</span></p>
<p><span>Go to Start, type <span>
&nbsp;</span><strong>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\eHome\</strong> in the search box and press enter. In the eHome folder, rename the mcepg2-0.db file and the mcepg2-0 folder.</span></p>
<p><span>If that still doesn’t change the information, unfortunately there is nothing we will be able to do.</span></p>

            OK thanks for that but I'll just give up on this as it just seems altogether too much hassle for a simple job. I'll just use Windows Explorer to manage my recordings - I never did bother much with the 'Recorded TV' section of WMC anyway. I need to retitle/rename
 my TV recordings on a very regular basis as a lot of them are just a few minutes snippets rather than complete TV shows so the assigned title is not of much use in these cases.

<p>GOOD NEWS<br />
What's required here, is a flush/rebuild of the WMC database library.&nbsp; Forcing the rebuild will reseed the file properties from the metadata.&nbsp; See instructions below.</p>
<p>BAD NEWS<br />
Although all the metadata will be refreshed, all other information will be lost.&nbsp; This includes live TV channel setup, scheduled recordings etc.&nbsp; -- everything else will be returned to factory settings.</p>
<p>REBUILD<br />
1. Go to &lt;C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\eHome&gt; (some folders may be hidden so type the path)<br />
2. create a db.bkup folder and move all files with a *.db extension into this folder.<br />
2a These *.db files can be used to restore all your settings so its not a bad idea to save them offline as well.<br />
2b These files may be locked, so either restart or stop the related services in order to release them for the move.<br />
3. Restart the system, restarting WMC only does not work.<br />
4. That's it, the titles will be reseeded from the properties, all else will be lost :(</p>
<p><br />
Haven't looked into what opens these *.db files.&nbsp; It may be Microsoft Access, my next project is to check if I could delete only the particular files I want refreshed.</p>

            <p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>Turns out access does not read the db files, so they can't be updated this way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOWEVER</p>
<p>See Patos's post below: <a href="http://experts.windows.com/frms/windows_entertainment_and_connected_home/f/114/t/89863.aspx?PageIndex=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.&nbsp; It's an obscure way to refresh the db in such a way that settings seem to be preserved while making the necessary updates.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I shut down WMC, ran the relevant task, then&nbsp;ended the task 10 mins later.&nbsp; When I restarted WMC I got a one time info message and everything was updated while preserving previous settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good enough for me... thanks Patos!</p>
