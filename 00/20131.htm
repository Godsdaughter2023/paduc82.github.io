</p><p>Hi Robyn</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was a cumulative Windows Update that was released for the Windows 10 Preview Build 10074 back on April 29, 2015.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything in that update is already in the current builds and that update no longer applies to the current builds of the Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>

                    After upgrading to Outlook 2011 14.1.3, many of my users are commonly getting the following error logged:<br />

<h2>            Office 365 Outlook - Dumping triplicate emails</h2>
                    <p>Why does Office 365 Outlook send three of the same emails. &nbsp;I keep this inbox clean and delete frequently. &nbsp;Today it dump three emails of everyone received all the way back to June 1st. &nbsp;I had six emails I saved to read later today. &nbsp;Came back in to read
 them and there were 636 emails. &nbsp;This is getting old real fast. &nbsp;I got rid of my personal email on my iPad and my iPhone because of this earlier in the year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I miss a fix for this or do I have a settings issue I may have missed?</p>

    <title>Microsoft account blocked - unable to verify the account. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft account blocked - unable to verify the account.</h2>
                    So, my account has been blocked. I can't receive the security code as its sent to the email account that's blocked... (logic.) And i cannot unblock it through the questionnaire as i can't provide enough details or information.
<div>Account that has been blocked - *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I CAN NOT UNBLOCK IT. DON'T 'HELP' BY SAYING RESET YOUR PASSWORD. As i can't, as I've said. I cant use the security code, i cant fill out the questionnaire. I haven't even been told as to why my account has been blocked and personally find it ridiculous
 as its my second account to get blocked.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This account is linked to my xbox live, and due to Microsoft new security proof on xbox live meaning you have to sign in to your Microsoft account before you can connect to xbox live, i can no longer use my xbox live profile. Which i am seriously annoyed
 about! All my game profiles, GAME ADD ON'S WORTH OVER £100 IN CONTENT, £40 worth of membership!, rep, achievements etc. etc. So i refuse to just let this go, and allow it to be blocked for no apparent reason.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, dear the person to answer this or 'help' me. Please explain to me as to why my account was blocked, and then unblock it. Otherwise, Microsoft can pay the £140 or so that I've spent on that xbox live profile.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Again, that account blocked it *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cheers.&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            Do you have a cell phone number or a security question for your Microsoft account? If not, there is not much you can do at this point.
<div>
<div><br />
<div>Quote from Microsoft: "<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">To help protect your&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Microsoft account</span><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">&nbsp;from fraud or abuse, we temporarily&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">block</span><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">&nbsp;it
 when we detect spam or other fraudulent activity.</span>" Even if it is not what they think, if they suspect it, they will block your account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>"<b>Other reasons why your account might be blocked</b></div>
<div>There might be an issue on our end. You haven't lost any email, but we'll need to get your account info to resolve the problem."</div>
<div><br />
<div>--</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>This may help</b>:</div>
<div>Click the link below, once there ignore where it has in bold "<b>Unblock your account online</b>," you are going to ignore this because you have already tried this method or knew this method would not work and you explained why it will not work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now, read where it has below in bold "<b>Contact support to unblock your account</b>." From there, click the "<b><u>contact support</u></b>" link where it reads underneath "<b>Contact support to unblock your account</b>," "<b>If you can't verify your account
 online, <u>contact support</u></b>" then, on the next page read the instructions, what it wants you to do is contact a support representative. You will need another email address to contact the support representative, make sure it is not an email address provided
 by Microsoft, since you have already been blocked from two Microsoft accounts already.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You will have to provide information for the support representative, I do not think it will ask for information exactly like the questionnaire you could not do, that you needed to recover your Microsoft account on your own. I think it just wants your real
 name and email address instead, for the support representative to contact you.</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/account-temporarily-blocked" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/account-temporarily-blocked</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Now, if this does not help you, then I can only recommend you this. When you create your next Microsoft account, if you choose to do so. Use a proper email address for Microsoft account recovery; make sure it is not an email address from Microsoft or only
 being used on a Microsoft account, because it may be blocked and you would not be able to use it for Microsoft account recovery like what happened here; use a security question, and use a cell phone number. It is important you use a cell phone number and I
 will explain why below.</div>
<div><br />
<div>--</div>
<div><br />
<div>Additional Tip for the Future:</div>
<div>If someone hacks your Microsoft account and you do not have a cell phone number. They can add their own cell phone number and have permanent control over your Microsoft account if they get in; this is because once a cell phone number is added to a Microsoft
 account, it is used to unlock the recover settings for everything. To clarify more, a person could hack another's Microsoft account and add their own cell phone number and then even if you did have the password, you never be able to change the recover settings,
 because you would not have the cell phone. The hacker could eventually change the password and the security information as they please, when they please and you once again lose your Microsoft account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>--</div>
<div><br />
<div>I wanted to try to help, even though I felt there was not much you could do. I apologize if I was of no help.</div>

<h2>            Token Weights for Fuzzy Lookup Add-In for Excel</h2>
                    Problem – my company has an in house database for monitoring clients. We often refer to outside databases to gather additional information on these clients, but our naming conventions aren’t the same. Therefore only about a third of our names are an exact
 match.<br />
I can’t change the name in our or the outside database to match up exactly, so instead I’m going to add (as an additional field) to our database the name as it appears in the outside database for future reference.<br />
<br />
Goal – Identify and pair up partial matches across two large data sets.<br />
<br />
Info – Data has several values including full name and full address.<br />
<br />
Previously tried –<br />
I have downloaded and been using an extension for excel called Fuzzy look up which helps me find partial duplicate strings. It can be found here.

<br />
I think this could be the answer to my problem, but I don’t think I’m using it completely correctly. I’ve built my two tables and run the application to compare them with a 50% similarity minimum threshold. Sometimes the results that it spits out are spot on,
 sometimes they are close and other times they are way off. They are way off despite still being over the 50% similarity.<br />
One way I know that I can improve the results is to have it search and filter first by state and then by name, but I'm unable to figure out how to tell it to look at the states first, and then the names. In other words have fuzzy look at the states in table
 A and match them up with the states in table B. Of the states that match up then match the names from table A with table B, then repeat for every state. Every result should have the same state. If there is no match within 50% similarity in the same state,
 then leave it blank, don't try another state. In the fuzzy lookup documentation it says that this sort of search is possible through a token weighing procedure, but I can not figure out how to configure that. If I wanted to I supposed I could filter Tables
 A and B by state then make new "state tables" and do fuzzy lookups by each state table, but I don't relish doing that fifty times.<br />
<br />
Once I get comfortable with this solution I'd like to extend it to other fuzzy analyses like matching one e-mail up against another, but comparing the ending of the e-mail (everything after the @ sign), and then looking at the first part of the e-mail.<br />
<br />
This is the file format (although I have plenty of flexibility to move it around)<br />
Name (Database A) State (A) Name (Database B) State (B)<br />
<br />
PS I'm all ears for a different solution for this. In the past I've used the fuzzy lookup macro found here -

Fuzzy Matching - new version plus explanation</a> - but it was PAINFULLY slow and seemed to have the same functionality as this add in, but was just used for pre office 2010 versions.

            <p>I would first decide the common "key fields" in each table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, although the name formats are different, I know the last name must be matched in two tables, then I take out the last name in each table.</p>
<p>I know the state in the address must be the same, then I take out the state info from the field.</p>
<p>I know the gender must be the same</p>
<p>
</p><p>After extracting the information in each table, use Excel to see if the keys are matched, and then see how many keys are matched, so you get your own percentage of similarity, and you decide manually if they are really the same person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the question is how to extract the data out of the field, try using "Text to columns" function to get the data if the data is separated by something like comma . If you can generalize a rule to extract data, say, to extract the string after the 3rd space,
 then VBA can do the job for you.</p>

<h2>            Office for students</h2>
                    
<p>I have a late 2011 MacBook and have been running an older version of Office (I believe 2010) since I got my computer. Very recently, I learned how to download the latest version of Office as a college student. What I didn't realize, was that when I downloaded
 it, it replaced my older version of office. Since I am in my last year of college, when I am no longer a student, will Office revert back to the older version that I paid for way back when? Or will I lose office completely?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Steffen,</p>
<p>When you are no longer a student, the current Office in your machine will expire, and you will not be able to use some special functions on Office any more. If you’d like to use the older version of Office, you may need to remove the current Office from
 your machine completely and re-install the older version of Office, then use a product key or a user account to re-activate the Office.</p>
<p>If you are using a product key to activate the older version of Office, about any questions you meet during the activation process, it’s recommended you post the question on TechNet forum for dedicated support and right audience to solve it.<br />
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?category=officeitpro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?category=officeitpro</a></p>
<p>If you are still using Click-to-Run version of Office, you can post the questions or issues on our forum for support, and we’ll try out best to help you solve them.</p>
<p>If anything is unclear or misunderstood, please post back and we’ll further help you.</p>

            In my experience, PPT only returns to the last-used folder during the current session.
<div><br />
<div>Quit, restart and it returns to whatever folder MS has decided we should all store our pictures in. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>And even for the current session, if you accidentally get it set to some other folder, you'd only need to insert an other image and browse back to whatever folder you want; that'll reset it for the current session.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Why muck about with the registry.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you want it to stay put from session to session, I have an inexpensive ($20) add-in that inserts pictures, remembers the last-used folder and file-type automatically and even sets the picture name = the original filename so it appears as Whatever.JPG
 instead of Picture 42 in the animation pane.</div>

            Hi, prajwalkn.<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
You may try to perform a phone soft reset on your Lumia 535. This method will not remove anything at all from your phone, and it is completely safe to attempt in any situation.<br />
<br />
To perform a soft reset follow these steps:<br />
<br />
1. Make sure your phone is turned on.<br />
2. Press and hold the <strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong> </span>

<span><strong>Power</strong> </span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />buttons until your phone vibrates and restarts.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: You should not touch the device screen during the process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears).<br />
<br />
Keep us posted.<br />
<br />
Sincerely.

                    I have this problem on one single site on my machine (Win7 Ultimate, IE9): the secured (https) pages of the site won't load, with a DNS error message. The unsecured (http) pages of the same site display without any problem. On another machine (on the same
 network), which has Vista Ultimate&nbsp;and IE8, the secured pages load normally. Both machines are fully up-to-date as far as Windows Update is concerned, both have the Windows Firewall in default configuration (private profile active), and both have MSE for malware
 protection. Both are connected to the same router by cable, and as far as I can see, there are no differences in the IPv4 or security settings. Both hosts files are the default that came with Windows. All the other secured sites I need to access load normally
 on both machines. Both machines have the French version of Windows installed, and I can't find the IE performance troubleshooter on mine. If it's a certificate problem, I don't have the information needed to select wh

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>What do you mean when you say "can't find the IE performance troubleshooter on mine"?</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may refer to the following article to run the Internet Explorer Performance troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Internet-Explorer-Performance-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Internet-Explorer-Performance-troubleshooter</span></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>You may check the security level settings and reset all the security zones to default.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you configure security settings to be too restrictive, you may prevent Internet Explorer from displaying certain Web sites. To determine whether an issue is caused by overly restrictive security settings, revert to default security settings.
 To do this, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Open <strong>Internet Explorer</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Click <strong>Tools</strong>, and then click <strong>Internet Options</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Click the <strong>Security tab</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Click <strong>reset all zones to default level</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After you do this, test Internet Explorer to verify that it works correctly.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Step 3:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also try the following steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Open an Internet Explorer window. Click "<strong>Tools</strong>," then choose "<strong>Internet Options</strong>."
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Click the "<strong>Content" tab</strong> in the Internet Options window.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Click the "<strong>Certificates</strong>" button on the Content options page.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Click the "<strong>Untrusted Publishers</strong>" tab in the Certificates window. It may be necessary to scroll horizontally to see the tab.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. Click to <strong>highlight the security certificate</strong> that you want to trust, then click the "<strong>Remove</strong>" button. This will open a confirmation window. Click the "Yes" button in the confirmation window to complete the process.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Sura,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What were you trying to download and from where (name of the program and URL of the website)?&nbsp; Knowing this might help me determine if that might be the cause or at least what program we are dealing with.&nbsp; BTW, did you install this software or just download
 the installation file? When downloading, did you click to save as or did you click to run? If you installed the program, did you request the program to run after installation as well?&nbsp; Do you know the names of the viruses that were found or anything else that
 was said about them?&nbsp; What version of Windows are you using?&nbsp; Many of the following suggestions&nbsp;will be general troubleshooting procedures because we lack the above information which would help us target more accurately.&nbsp; Some may not apply depending on what
 actually occurred (such as whether or not the software was installed).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you did install the program (or let it run which amounts to the same thing), please download the free Revo:
<a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html</a>&nbsp;and after installing it, please use it in Advanced Mode to uninstall the other program you installed and any remnants it left behind.&nbsp; Then reboot and see if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, let's see if there's a simple fix to this.&nbsp; Let's try a System Restore to before you&nbsp;downloaded the free software (it's critical that we get in front of when this problem began for this to work).&nbsp;
<span>If using Windows 7, see</span><span><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/700-system-restore.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/700-system-restore.html</span></a></span><span>. If using Vista, see</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a></span><span>.
 If using XP, see</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306084</span></a></span><span>. Sometimes this simple process does the trick and sometimes it doesn't help - but it's easy and
 worth a shot if it started recently.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work (and probably even if it does), then it sounds like your system has become infected (most likely by whatever you downloaded or from wherever you downloaded it from) or some files have become corrupted - perhaps due to the installation
 or possibly the infection&nbsp;(or that somehow perhaps some files were identified as threats and removed but were instead false positives - caused perhaps by the download or an infection or a glitch in MSE - very difficult to tell at this point).&nbsp; I assume you
 are using the new Beta MSE since that's where you posted - please confirm which version of MSE you are using.&nbsp; To do that, open MSE and click on the arrow next to the Help&nbsp;link at the top and then click on About Security Essentials and tell me the number following
 Security Essentials Version (for me, using the Beta, it says 4.0.1111.0 -&nbsp;but if not using the beta yours may say 2.1.1116.0 or 2.0.256.0).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let's try a simple experiment to see if this is being caused by some type of program conflict.&nbsp;
<span>Try a clean boot (Vista and W7) <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>. If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem. Follow the procedures in the article. Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it. Once done be sure to
 reset your system back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work. If using XP, see
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a> and
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434</a>.&nbsp; Even if this works, please proceed to verify that your system is clear of infections as follows.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't help (or even if it does), then we should proceed to ensure that your system is completely clear of any infections so we can rule that out as the cause or a possible risk to return later.&nbsp; This may either resolve the problems
 or it may get your system to the point&nbsp;where conventional restoration methods may work if the infections caused any damage (but we'll get to that in a subsequent post if necessary after this is done).&nbsp; I would normally address the issue of the service-related
 problem, but with all the other problems you are having it seems like that's more a symptom of the overall issue and not the specific cause of all of them.&nbsp; If that continues after the system is cleaned, we will address it then (but chances are excellent that
 the people in Support will cover that&nbsp;and I suggest you just jump ahead to the bold part below and seek their assistance first - but if you want to try on your own first, proceed on)</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a>
 and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a> and then run a full ESET online scan:
<a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. &nbsp; If necessary, try this in Safe Mode with Networking if unable to do so in Normal Mode.&nbsp; This may or may not remove the infections, but will probably
 not repair any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected or the problem goes away, you shouldn't completely trust them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up
 to you if you want to try them first or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore
 the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please follow these recommendations compliments of Stephen Boots - MVP:</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 frree upgrade licencing on computer upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I have a question based on reading (in part) the below &nbsp;Microsoft article that I would like to have clarified</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>What happens if I change my motherboard?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>This will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous based qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail Windows 10 license.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Am I understanding this correctly, any major change, &nbsp;ie hard drive failure, &nbsp;to the original system Windows 10
<strong>is installed on</strong>, will invalidate Windows 10 and I will need to purchase Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will this also hold true on a system crash were the operating system needs to be reinstalled?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also read a post below&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">, which is another question I have, that I&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;see a answer for&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>I'm still confused by the rules for this "free" upgrade. I have three retail Windows 7 upgrade product keys for my three pc's. Over the years, as I've upgraded or replaced my computers with newer
 models(I build my own), I've removed the copy of Win7 from the old machine and installed it on the new one. But if I claim the "free" Windows 10 upgrade for each of these machines during the one-year grace period, and then sometime after that year I replace
 the machine with a new one, removing my licensed copy of Windows from the old machine, will I still be able to install my Windows 10 copy on the new machine? Keep in mind, I've never had any problem doing this with Windows 7, but the article above gives conflicting
 info. At one point, it mentions that a Win10 retail upgrade license can be transferred to another computer, but it also mentions something about the Win10 upgrade being invalidated if the motherboard is changed. Can someone please clarify how this will work?
 I have a sinking feeling I'm going to have to wind up buying 3 copies of Windows 10 after all, making this "free upgrade!" talk kinda pointless.</em></span></p>

<p>In fact this article does not answer OP's question, which I also have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before, Windows licenses are "license-related". For retail versions of Windows, you can have one license installed on one computer at one time. So, if I like, I can install it across many machines as long as we don't run it simultaneously on two or more
 systems. One license, one system, one time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However what I read on Windows 10, is that your license becomes "computer-specific" once you accepted that offer. It's true that you may reinstall as many times as you want, but the requirement seems to be "the same device". What if I upgrade my device?
 Is that the same device? How do they determine it? </p>
<p>Another question is, can I install Windows 7 on a system, upgrade it to Windows 10 taking advantage of that offer and marking the device "life-long supported by Windows", then remove that software and use it to make another device "life-long supported by
 Windows"? </p>
<p>
</p><p>There's this natural conflict as Microsoft changes Windows licensing to device-specific from one license, one device, one time. Personally I'd prefer the old way and discard the "life-long support for this device". Just mark all my WIndows 7, 8 and 8.1 keys
 "Windows 10 usable" and let me decide the other things.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Full version (Retail):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrade version (Retail):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p>OEM :</p>
<p>
</p><p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Will I get a product key, can I get a product key?</strong></p>
<p>By default, Windows 10 builds are pre-keyed, meaning, you do not have to enter a product key and should not be prompted to enter one even after Windows 10 has completed setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-activate-the-latest-windows-10-build/33f31475-93b3-4d1c-812f-4b21fbd807a7">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-activate-the-latest-windows-10-build/33f31475-93b3-4d1c-812f-4b21fbd807a7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Microsoft tells me that it will be possible to do so. And that a key part of this process is that it will save a product key tied to the previously upgraded PC or device in Windows Store. This is how Windows 10 will later know that the install is allowed:
 It’s “one of the benefits of the new delivery system,” a Microsoft representative told me.</p>

            <p>I understand that OEM installs are tied to the same machine, my questions are in regards to retail versions .</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify &nbsp;what I am reading is , if the original install is retail then it's allowed to be used on another machine
<strong>IF</strong> it's uninstalled from the old machine. Were in, this free upgrade is basically turns the retail version into a oem version tied to that one machine? &nbsp;Is this correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am confused as &nbsp;the Microsoft article says is that motherboard changes etc will invalidate the windows 10 license. In this scenario, the original qualifying product is still installed on the original machine. This differs from the retail version usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about a hard drive change, will that also invalidate Windows 10?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also seen another post that brings up a good point is, what about the Windows 7 Family packs as that what I am running on my &nbsp;machines. Hadn't thought of that. Thanks to that poster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I pose a question , &nbsp;if I reloaded the original qualifying retail system first and then loaded my Windows 10 upgrade ( from a iso) on my repaired machine or a new system I would build, would that allow activation and meet licensing requirements?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no workaround, it appears to me that at some point I will need to buy Windows 10 and it's not really a free upgrade as such, but in fact turns a regular retail version into a oem type version tied to that one machine and hope nothing breaks.

            <p>As OEM licenses are tied to the motherboard that came with your computer, if you change the motherboard you obviously lose the license. As per the article shown above, if you have a retail license it remains a retail versión (you can use it wherever you
 want); an OEM license will still be an OEM license (tied to the hardware).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just keep this in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original license -&gt; Upgraded license
<ul>
<li>Retail -&gt; Retail (can use everywhere)</li><li>OEM -&gt; OEM (tied to the original motherboard)</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>About HDD changes I have no idea, but I think you will be fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>What we all need to keep in mind is that Microsoft has not yet finalized their licensing for Windows 10. &nbsp;They are changing their wording and that is why everyone is confused. &nbsp;"Windows as a service", "Lifetime of the device"... These terms keep popping
 up with only limited explanation. &nbsp;There has been a great deal of speculation as to what all this mean, but we will never really know until the full, legal licensing agreement (EULA or if Windows is going to be a service now, I guess it will require a terms
 of service, or TOS, now) is made available... Hopefully before the RTM release on July 29.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The good news is... If you don't agree with the final EULA or TOS (or whatever it may be called in the end) for Windows 10, you can refuse the free upgrade to and continue to use your existing Win7/Win8/Win8.1 according to the EULA of those products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a good one!</p>

Although this is Hotmail forum, I assume that you are now using outlook.com.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To access your main contact list:</strong></p>
<p><font>Open outlook.com &gt; top left next to the logo Outlook, there is a down arrow &gt; click the arrow &gt; click People &gt;
</font><font>All your contacts are now listed on the left. Scroll down to see each contact.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To Edit your contact list : such as changing a name</strong></p>
<p>Click at the contact's name ( NOT its check box ) &gt; toolbar at top, click Edit.</p>
<p>Note :</p>
<p>1. Edit option will not appear until you have selected a contact.</p>
<p>2. Edit option will not appear if you click at the contact's checkbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To delete a contact from the list :</strong></p>
<p>Just click at the contact &gt; toolbar at top, click Delete.</p>

GET IT RIGHT THE NOKIA 6230 AND 6230I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN COMPATABLE WITH THE NSU AND THE UPDATE PROCCESS ITS JUST THAT NOKIA HAVE YET TO ADD THESE SOFTWARE/FIRMWARE UPDATES..<br />
<br />
I DO KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT ,I DO HAVE MANY PROPER NON INSANE SOURCES INCLUDING TWO EXTREMELY HIGH PLACED NOKIA ENGINEERS AS PERSONNAL FRIENDS TO WHOME I HAVE KNOWN FOR OVER SEVEN YEARS..<br />
<br />
THEY TOO ARE UNHAPPY ABOUT THE TREATMENT THAT MANY NOKIA USERS HAVE HAD FROM THE NSU AND HAVE TOLD ME THAT THEY BELIEVE THE 6230I SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE FIRST DAY OF THE NSU LAUNCH..<br />
<br />
THEY SHOULD KNOW THEY WORK FOR NOKIA AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS...<br />
<br />
SO GET IT RIGHT IF YOUR NOKIA IS ABLE TO BE CONNECTED TO YOUR PC USING DATA CABLE THEN IT HAS A 95% CHANCE OF BEING COMPATABLE WITH NSU THAT WILL DEFINATELY PUT MY 6230I IN THE 95% BRACKET AS COMMUNICATION WITH MOBILES OVER DATA-CABLE HAS BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS
 NOW SO GET IT RIGHT.....

            It may be possible that they can connect to the NSU, but I believe there was another phone withdrawn from the NSU as it kept killing the handsets. If there is issues with the NSU and the handsets being damaged then it is not wrth them putting them onto
 the NSU.<br />
<br />
You have been shouting about this for a long time now, how come you have not been to a cnsp?

                    My device: iPaq 111 brand new. I have added a 4 gb SD card to store music so that none is occupying memory in my device. My problem is that the storage card does not appear under my library, rather and only my device. How could I get&nbsp; my device to recognize

</blockquote>
<br />
ImAPCVirus,<br />
<br />
Although WM6 supports SDHC the physical implementation in a phone requires a hardware upgrade. SDHC cards share the same physical and electrical form factor as older (SD 1.x) cards, allowing SDHC-devices to support both newer SDHC cards and older SD-cards.
 To increase addressable storage, SDHC uses sector addressing instead of byte addressing in the previous SD standard. However, SDHC cards will not work in devices designed to the older SD 1.x specification.

<p>Check out the SendObject method in VBA help. This will allow you to generate an e-mail. The generated e-mail can then be opened before sending to make additional changes.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can use Office Automation to create an Outlook message but this requires more complex VBA.</p>

<p>You can use vba to loop through your table to build an e-mail by e-mail address.</p>
<p>As for using a template, do you mean an Outlook template or you have an Text/HTML document you wish to setup and use as a tmeplate, or something else?</p>
<p>If you wish to use a Text/HTML document as a template then the approach depends on the format...</p>
<p>The easiest method for sending e-mails from access is using the SendObject method (DoCmd.SendObject) but it is very limited and does not accept external files as attachments.&nbsp; So if your message is simply text then use it.&nbsp; You can read in a template file
 as your body text and then have it open so you can edit it before sending it off.</p>
<p>If on the other hand you need to include attachments or wish to use HTML formatting... then you'd need to work with Outlook Automation (<a href="http://www.devhut.net/2010/09/03/vba-outlook-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.devhut.net/2010/09/03/vba-outlook-automation/</a>&nbsp;and/or<a href="http://www.devhut.net/2010/09/03/vba-html-outlook-automation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.devhut.net/2010/09/03/vba-html-outlook-automation/</a>)&nbsp;or
 CDO,...&nbsp; Once again you can easily read in a template file and then have the e-mail show so you can edit it before sending it off.</p>
<p>It all depends on your needs,&nbsp; explain a little more and we will be able to guide you better.</p>

    <title>Can not open PDF Attachments - Microsoft Lumia 640XL - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can not open PDF Attachments - Microsoft Lumia 640XL</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received a PDF attachment with my mail on my 640XL but I can't read it. If I tap it, a window pops up stating "You need to install an app for this task. Would you like to search for one in the Store?". I can't understand why this is as I already have Adobe
 Acrobat Reader installed. If I press the attachment and choose the save option, it comes back with "Chhose an App" giving 3 choices :<br />
1. This Device<br />
2. SD Card<br />
3. One Drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>If then try to save the fime in my SD card all it does is show me all the foldres in the SD drive. If I choose the Documents folder then it says it it empty. If then I go on to the next stage it shows the file name and if I then save it and go back to the
 documents folder, it is not there.<br />
<br />
Appreciate some help as to how to overcome this issue.<br />
Thanks... </p>

    <title>Why doesn&#39;t Excel automatically detect data type for text &#47; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jc5757  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t Excel automatically detect data type for text &#47; CSV imports anymore&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently did an Office update and found that things have changed a bit when I import data from a CSV. One annoying thing I noticed is that, instead of automatically recognizing data as either text or numbers, all columns are formatted as text. This means
 that once you've created your spreadsheet, you can't format or filter data as numbers unless you individually convert that column from text to numbers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured out that when you're importing the data from the CSV, you can go to the transform tab and click "detect data type," which solves the problem, but why isn't that the default? The majority of spreadsheets have text and numbers, so it seems ridiculous
 to format all numbers as text unless you specifically tell Excel to do otherwise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
