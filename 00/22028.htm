<h2>            Desktops Kept After Restart</h2>
                    Hello, I'm really liking the virtual desktops feature. &nbsp; I've used desktops in the linux world and I'm so glad that Windows has it out of the box now &nbsp;It would be nice if we could set the number of desktops in settings and not have to create the desktops
 every time. &nbsp;Anyone know a reg hack way to accomplish this? &nbsp; Also, I use the keyboard combination CTRL-WIN+{Left Arrow: Right Arrow} to switch between desktops and it would be real nice if the desktop would flash a number similar to when you identify monitors
 in a multi monitor situation so you'd know what desktop you're switching to. &nbsp;Thanks. &nbsp;

<h2>            Ovi suite and Calendar</h2>
                    
<p>a simple question to NOKIA and/or the community here:</p>
<p>Will OVIsuite ever have a calendar edit support like pc suite had it once upon the time?</p>
<p>Will we get back the support for multi-calendars, as we had it already in OVIsuite 2.xxx.</p>
<p>If they are unable to integrated the calendar function in OVI,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;why they do not support multi calendar sync to Google and/or outlook then we don't need this function in OVI-suite.</p>
<p>Can anyone out there shed some light on this subject?</p>

<p>sorry, not at all.</p>
<p>This is the option selecting the calendar in &nbsp;outlook, but not for the mobile, it syncs to the standard calendar in N8. May be you are not aware that the N8 supports various calendars. I was so happy about this feature, as I have many many business dates,
 which I simply do not want to mix up with the private dates. And also my business calendar is shared with coworkers, I don't want them to see my private calendar.</p>

<p>How do I find my calendar in OVI suit ? I'm sure it is there because I have been able to set it to sychronise, however I can't see it.&nbsp;&nbsp; View - go to should find it but that gives all of the other options apart from Calendar. There is no calendar on the

    <title>Math equation symbols - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cchriss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Math equation symbols</h2>
                    I use Word's math autocorrect to enter equations, but there are two symbols I can't find that I need.
<br />
<br />
I need a squiggly line over a character, similar to the " \bar " math autocorrect, but squiggly instead of straight.<br />
<br />
Also, is there some way to do a diagonal arrow (like a " \nearrow ") over a term in an equation and have a number (usually zero) at the tip of the point?&nbsp; (This is sometimes used to strike through a term in an equation and show that it equals zero and can be
 ignored.)<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            The squiggly line is known as a 'tilde', and you can enter it through math autocorrect as \tilde. If you type, for example, x\tilde and then press the spacebar twice, you'll get the tilde over the x. (The tilde is also available on the Accents gallery
 in the math ribbon.)<br />
<br />
I think you can construct your own arrow with a superscript zero (^0) after it, select the two characters, and create a new math autocorrect from them. I don't know how you'll get it to overstrike a part of an equation, though.<br />

    <title>Excel 2013 VBA Web Query - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulharr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2013 VBA Web Query</h2>
                    I have several legacy macro programs which ran as .xls files in older versions of Excel.&nbsp; Surprisingly, they still run on Excel 2013 (as .xlsm files).&nbsp; In previous versions of Excel, I was able to combine these with newer features of Excel, such as Web
 Queries.&nbsp; Using VBA modules, I set up a trigger cells on about 300 worksheets so when the macros put a number in the target cell, the Web Query would be refreshed.&nbsp; However, that method has quit working with Excel 2013.<br />
<br />
The VBA code still refreshes the Web Query manually (without a macro program), but it works differently now.&nbsp; Previously, entering a number in the target cell (F1) launched the Web Refresh.&nbsp; Now, after converting the files to Excel 2013, I can't enter a number
 there.&nbsp; Moving the mouse over the target cell and clicking on it causes the web query to refresh automatically, without entering anything.&nbsp; Also, the click does not relocate the cursor to the target cell; instead, the cursor jumps to the first cell of the
 web query table (A3).&nbsp; I am totally unable to directly place the cursor in the target cell of the worksheets at all.<br />
<br />
However, the old macro programs are able to access the target cell and enter a number there, but then nothing happens; the web query is not activated by entering a number there.&nbsp; Does running the old macro programs prevent VBA execution?&nbsp; And why is the VBA
 module not doing what it used to do?&nbsp; Must it be changed to operate with Excel 2013?&nbsp; The VBA Code in use:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If Target.Address = "$F$1" Then<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 'Ensuring target is a number before action<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If IsNumeric(Target) Then<br />

            Sorry it's taken this long to reply, but I've been trying lots of things -- reloading the files, trying it in Compatibility Mode without conversion, and even trying it on the System 7 virtual machine.&nbsp; Nothing worked anywhere.&nbsp; I had already tried using
 "Worksheet_Change" as you suggested in place of "Worksheet_SelectionChange", but it made no difference.&nbsp; Now I know why.&nbsp; Operator ignorance.<br />
<br />
To be sure the macro code and the VBA module (listed above) was the same as before, I went back to my old computer (still running Windows XP and Excel 2003) where I found the code to be exactly the same, but I made an important discovery in the process.&nbsp; It
 didn't work there either, at least not in the "Step Into" mode of macro execution which I had been trying in the new environment.&nbsp; But clicking on the "Run" button of the macro selection dialog box, made it run on the old system as intended.<br />
<br />
So, back to the new system.&nbsp; After setting up some "test" lines of macro code and excuting the macro in "Run" mode, everything works as intended on the newly converted files too.&nbsp; Lesson learned:&nbsp; What happens in "Step Into" mode of a macro is not the same
 as what happens in "Run" mode of a macro.&nbsp; I didn't realize different things occurred when debugging a macro versus running a macro.<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
You can't step into a procedure that takes arguments.<br />
The SelectionChange and Change event procedures are parsed a object (Target) that is a range object of the range that has been selected or changed.</p>
<p>You could test these event procedure like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub TestWsSelChng()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim rngTargTest As Range<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set rngTargTest = Me.Range("A1")&nbsp; '&lt;&lt;simulating selecting cell A1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call Worksheet_SelectionChange(rngTargTest)<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private Sub Worksheet_SelectionChange(ByVal Target As Range)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debug.Print Target.Address<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you step through the TestWsSelChng procedure it will run into the Worksheet_SelectionChange, in this case simulating cell A1 being selected.</p>
<p>Cheers<br />

Do update us with the result once you have installed the latest update for your device. You can also try unpinning and re-pinning the Excel 2016 from the taskbar and check if it will make a difference.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Please let us know the model of your PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver needs to be installed before the device can start properly working.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Determine which among your PCI devices is causing the problem. Click "Start." Type "device" in the search box provided and hit Enter. Select "Device Manager" under the "Control Panel" group.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the arrow beside "Other devices" and right-click "PCI Simple Communications Controller." Select "Properties" and click the "Details" tab.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Take note of the entry in the "Details" tab. The entry should be something like "PCI\VEN_1093&amp;DEV_70B8." This indicates the vendor (VEN) and device ID (DEV) of the PCI device. Take note of these values because you will need them to search for the driver
 that the computer needs.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Open a Web browser and navigate to PCIdatabase.com to match the vendor and device details, and find out which PCI device is malfunctioning in your computer. Once you know which device is malfunctioning, use the installation disc that comes with the device
 to install the driver to the computer. If you do not have a copy of the PCI device driver, search for the driver online (see Resources).</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Let us know if you have any issues installing the PCI drivers. We are happy to help!</p>

                    <p>I have data from another Excel file inserted based on product codes I manually entered into column B.</p>
<p>The rest of the data is populated from an external excel file, which I cannot alter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The product number codes have to be entered as text. The product codes cant be changed to "number formatted cells" (Long Story)</p>
<p>I want to be able to total the values in Column H only if they have a product code in the range of 8000000 - 8900000 (numbers as text format)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not a regular user of Excel but my first stab is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMIFS(H3:H101,B3:B101,"&gt;1")</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because you have a text string in B4 that cannot be coerced into a number I don't know of any way to get SUMPRODUCT to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The apostrophe in front of the 800.... is making it a text value so IMO the simplest way to do what you want is a user defined function and they're easy. Do this:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALT+F11 to open VB editor and you should see 'Project Explorer' on the left side of the editor. If you can't see it hold down the CTRL key and tap R. On the left you will see
<strong>VBAProject(Book1)</strong> where Book1 is your workbook name. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Below that right click 'ThisWorkbook' and insert a module and paste the code below in on the right. Close VB editor, we're finished in there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back on the worksheet we call this with a formula the same as you would any native excel function. Put this in a cell:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>=MySum(B3:B100,6)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So B1:B100 is the range with your (text) numbers in a we sum the column offset by 6 rows from this which is Col H. You can change the range and the offset to anything you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last thing is you must now save your workbook as a macro enabled workbook with the .XLSM extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Function MySum(Rng1 As Range, oset As Long) As Double<br />
Dim c As Range<br />
On Error Resume Next<br />
For Each c In Rng1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Val(c.Value) &gt;= 8000000 And Val(c.Value) &lt;= 8900000 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MySum = MySum + c.Offset(, oset).Value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
Next<br />
On Error GoTo 0<br />
End Function</p>

            <p>Hey! If you want to back up your contacts, you need to do it using an account attached to your phone such as a Microsoft Account! No need to set anything up, all your contacts are synced with most accounts on your phone&nbsp;if you set your phone up with any.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For example, if you set up your Lumia 920 with the email 
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;at the beginning of your phone setup, you don't need to do anything! All your contacts, emails, text messages, pictures, documents, calendar, and more are synced automatically. Cool huh? This means that if you even factory reset
 your phone and setup again with that same Microsoft Account you'll get all those stuff backed up restored!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can also view your synced data such as Email, Calendar, and SkyDrive at <a href="http://www.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.outlook.com</a>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm&nbsp;not sure that your Windows Phone syncs <strong>everything</strong> to your Gmail accounts if you linked any, compared to a Microsoft Account as Google has been changing their syncing protocols recently. Your best bet and full Windows Phone experience
 depends on a Microsoft Account!</p>

<div>So I built in user error conditions today by setting option button 1 default to true instead of both buttons being false by default. &nbsp;If the second button is chosen it changes to false.</div>

            <p>Hi Clio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why PowerPoint is not responding, hangs, or freezes is if you have not installed the latest updates or if the previously installed add-in interfered with PowerPoint.</p>

<h2>            Outlook for Mac version 16.26 calendar event editing</h2>
                    <p>I have always been able to edit the "subject" and "location" information in calendar events I receive from others. So, I receive a calendar event invitation ... I accept the invitation ... Then I have the ability to change the subject/location and can see
 that change on my calendar (without sharing it with the sender/others.) This is no longer the case. I have no editing capability on any calendar event I receive from another user. I can assign a category, but that's it. Advice appreciated.</p>

    <title>Difference in date format affecting vlookup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jw aldridge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Difference in date format affecting vlookup</h2>
                    <p>I import a timesheet and I am trying to do a vlookup on it and it is not working because of the formating of the date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The table array has dates in column A, times in column B. Using a date that is typed in, I am looking up the date and want to return the time.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked out the table array and the date (6/23/2013) is stored as 41448.77639</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, my lookup value reads (6/23/2013) 41448.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This makes my vlookup not find a match and return my time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The exact formula I'm using is =VLOOKUP(I8,TIME_IMPORT,2,FALSE)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've never run into this before... Any ideas?</p>

            You need to remove the fractional part of the date-time column. &nbsp;Even thought the formnat is date, the actual value is date-time. &nbsp;Say the dates are in column J from J2 thru J100.

                    <p>Hello we recently started using Yammer at my company but we have an issue with the profile pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several of our users don't have a profile picture on Yammer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to my understanding Yammer syncs profile pictures from the O365 profile and the O365 profile syncs them from the Azure AD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The users without pictures in Yammer has pictures in Azure AD and O365 but not in Yammer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the issue and how can it be resolved?</p>

</p><p>I would request you kindly login to Yammer network as a verified admin -&gt; Settings -&gt; Network admin -&gt; Security settings -&gt; check enforce office 365 identity is enabled in your network or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now navigate to Network migration -&gt; Click next in step 1 of 3 and check there are multiple Yammer networks&nbsp;or not.</p>
<p>

<h2>            How to use the MSI-based Visio 2013 Professional edition parallel to the the CTR-based Office 365 University edition without running into various problems&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I bought Office 365 University a while ago as it contains most of the stuff I need for my studies. As I'm studying something with IT, I additionally need Visio for various tasks. So I also got a Visio 2013 Professional license.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/de-de/office/forum/office_365hp-office_storage/wiederkehrende-cache-probleme-des-microsoft-office/34b82ab1-910c-4762-b941-887b65ba7230">When I was still running Windows 7 I experienced different problems
 with OneDrive and Office after I installed the MSI-based Visio version ontop of my Office 365 installation.</a>&nbsp;(The linked thread is in German. Automatic translation works to some extent.)&nbsp;At first I had no clue what these problems were caused by. Fortunately
 the problems did not appear very often - I was therefore able to work with both installations to some extent. However, on my new Windows 8.1 installation the problems got way worse (presumably because OneDrive is integrated into the OS way deeper) - so I finally
 had to identify the reason for the problems I experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after the last time I experienced the problems in the linked thread, I applied as many Windows Updates as there were available, installed the Visio 2013 SP1, tried to update my Office 365 installation from within an Office application (using the "Account"
 menu page) and performed an automatic online repair of my Office installatino via the Programs and Features function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing that, the next time I opened a Word document from OneDrive a message box with the following text popped up: "Sorry, we can't perform this action. Incompatible Office products are installed on your machine. If you have an administrator, please
 contact them for help."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found out that this message box was introduced in the February 10, 2015 update for Office 2013 (KB2920798). It says there:</p>
<p>
</p><p>[QUOTE]</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This update provides you an informative message when you cannot open an Office document on a computer that has both Office 2013 Click-to-Run edition and Microsoft Installer (.msi)-based edition installed.
 The informative message may resembles following:</span></p>

<div>
<div>Sorry, we can't perform this action. Incompatible Office products are installed on your machine. If you have an administrator, please contact them for help.</div>

</div>
</div>
</li></ul>
<p>[/QUOTE]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very informative indeed! ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>---</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in a nutshell: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2753630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
I do know now that the Microsoft-Installer-/MSI-based editions of Office applications are not compatible with Click-to-Run-/CTR-based editions.</a> But how can I then manage to run my Office 365 University installation parallel to the Visio 2013 edition that
 I both have a license for?</p>

            <p>Hi Nayana S M,<span> </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick response. The method mentioned above, using dual boot was a work-around that enables both click-to-run and msi to be used on the same PC, but not at same time on the same operating system. Since from doing some independent researching
 on-line, I've learnt about deployment techniques and discovered 2 ways to resolve it, depending on whether the version required is 32-bit or 64-bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled Office completely using the Microsoft uninstall fix it tool as recommended in order to remove any conflicts remaining from having had both click to run and msi installed on the same PC., as from your link above&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501</span></a>,
 as it had created a conflict, that the latest Office updates are designed to notify on in order to resolve them and have a fully working Office installation. I then reinstalled Office 365 clcik-to-run, then via method described below installed Visio Pro click-to-run,
 that is of course compatible with Office 365 click to run. I have tested it and all works well, including with OneDrive, that enables full cloud sync, downloading and updating. It shows off the great achievement of Office 365 and Visio being fully integrated
 too, very impressive when it's all working as designed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like using Office 365 and wanted to continue to use Office Visio too, which is expensive but it is a very useful programme, and one I had paid for, but afford to pay for the same program twice, so wanted a solution. The following includes a set of instructions
 that may be helpful to others who want to be able to use click-to-run, that is going to be the standardised deployment for Office. I am also trying out on second PC Windows 10 and Office 2016 Preview</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://products.office.com/en-GB/office-2016-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://products.office.com/en-GB/office-2016-preview</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://community.office365.com/en-us/office_2016_preview/f/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://community.office365.com/en-us/office_2016_preview/f/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure there aren't any issues I am not testing Visio 2016 preview on my main PC, shall either continue to use Visio 2013 or upgrade when to the official release upgrade to 2016, if i can afford it when is available, but either way need click to run
 to match Office 365 which will upgrade to Office 2016 when it is released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The following solution applies to a setup using Office 365 click-to-run and Visio Professional 2013 that originally was MSI installation. By searching online it is possible to convert the click to run Office 365 to MSI, but I wanted to keep Office 365 as
 click to run, as that is the preferred installation type of Office from 2013 onwards, with all the benefits of instant updates and being able to continue to use Office. For some advanced users they may prefer converting it to MSI as there are additional optional
 installation setups available, but most people want the complete setup with default installation, but if the extra ones are required, it is possible to convert Office 365 click to run to msi to match Visio msi installation. This option isn't discussed here
 as it has been covered many times elsewhere. But I wanted to keep Office 365 click to run and get Visio Pro to also be click to run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On searching online there are lot more solutions discussed<span>&nbsp; </span>to getting click to run programmes installed as msi for professionals, but there wasnâ€™t a single cohesive instruction to get an msi installation as click to run. So this puts together
 from several sources, mostly Microsoft community ones, assisted by doing thorough research into any enhanced instructions. The answers are often provided technically, but not fully explained, so this instruction is meant to simplify and clarify steps required
 to get it working for this specific scenario. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to be able to use Office Visio Pro 2013 with Office 365 both need to use the same Office installation type. All the following need to match. If using 32 or 64 bit, they both have to be the same format. Although the latest installation type click
 to run is designed to allow side-by-side in early installation setups, Microsoft stressed it always meant to be temporary as Microsoft donâ€™t advise continuing to run side-by-side and it can create problems and conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Office updates from 2015 a warning message appeared if had both running on a PC at same time, which also prevented opening up files directly from OneDrive, viewing or downloading, also it meant uploading directly from the open document was prevented,
 which affected syncing on any Office file working on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One workaround mentioned was to install a click to run Office suite (e.g. any of the options including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and OneNote and others such as Publisher if available, on one main PC partition and set-up a separate partition with a
 dual boot ,which worked whilst testing new version of Windows 10, but couldn't use both at the same time and this meat it reduced the options to work seamlessly with Visio on OneNote at the same time as any program from Office 365 desktop main suite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The instructions below are to get a click-to- run installation of Office 365 along with additional specialised Office programs, such as Visio and Visio Pro, to run on the same computer at the same time, both fully compatible as as click-to-run, even if one
 or more components were originally msi. It is possible and it works. It is of course essential that full genuine Microsoft Office product licences are already owned as the original product licences are required<span>&nbsp;
</span>for either 32 or 64 bit options to enable changing from msi to click-to-run installation, registration and activation purposes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Instructions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>For matching additional Office specialist programs such as Visio with a main Office 365 installation, need to install the additional components as click to run to match the Office 365 click to run installation. Need to ensure if its 32 bit to obtain
 also 32 bit, if 64 bit need to install as 64 bit.</span></li><li><span>If two conflicting versions of Office were originally installed on the same PC operating system, then the Microsoft&nbsp; uninstall tool
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501
</a>needs to be run to completely uninstall Office before installing all Office programs as clcik-to-run.
</span></li><li><span>Option to install as</span><span style="font-weight: bold"> 32 bit</span><span> is simple as itâ€™s the default format and an easy option is available. The Microsoft Community links have official information on doing this and these include obtaining
 and installing 32 bit versions of click-to-run Visio etc. to match Office 365. There is a Microsoft page that lets a user enter a msi product key to download and install clcik-to-run. The default setting is 32-bit, but there is not an option to change to 64-bit.
 However if a 32-bit version is required then it enables a straightforward installation via following&nbsp;<a href="https://officesetup.getmicrosoftkey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://officesetup.getmicrosoftkey.com/</a></span>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>For </span><span style="font-weight: bold">64 bit</span><span> the procedure requires a more advanced setup type that is via professional deployment techniques, using the Microsoft Deployment toolkit. There are quite<span>
</span>a few official Microsoft links that go into detail on selecting various functions for running with
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Microsoft Deployment toolkit</span><span> for click-to-run, and include different types of professional set-ups.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>&nbsp;</span>The following instructions are for a </span><span style="font-weight: bold">standard desktop setup using standard default switches</span><span> to enable full integration and automatic updates, so Visio or whatever specialist Office component
 is compatible and works in the same way, i.e. click-to-run, as Office 365. </span>
</li><li><span>Download and run Microsoft Deployment Toolkit for Click-to-run from <strong>

</p><p style="margin-left: 0.375in">To download and install click-to-run version, the Microsoft Windows Command prompt has to be used by entering first a download switch then a configure switch. In this case, to download and install Visio, the following command lines
 have to be added using&nbsp; Command Prompt (Admin), with locations in square brackets being the ones where the files are located on the PC. The switches correspond to locations selected in the xml file above. There are alternative switches, with detailed instructions
 via Microsoft Technet help pages for other options, but the following works for a standard single PC installations. In this case copied the file was saved and run from C Drive, but may run from another drive.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 0.375in">When downloaded, the following files will be located where specified in switches in the xml file run with deployment tool exe file. In this case its the 64 bit version as specified. This method can also be used to install the 32
 bit version, but both Office 365 and Visio need to be the same format, either 32 bit or 64 bit:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.375in">

 as long a subscribe to Office 365 plans or pay for an upgrade to 2016 Visio Standard, Pro or 365. But even if only upgrade for instance Office 365, Visio 2013 as long as click-to-run should be compatible, especially as all Office 2016 formats are going to

    <title>Sorting cells by color after conditional highlighting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> staceyglow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sorting cells by color after conditional highlighting</h2>
                    
<p>I used conditional formatting to highlight several cells in a portion of a column.&nbsp;Depending on the&nbsp;section, I used different criteria to highlight. &nbsp;I also used the simple fill function using the same color in other sections of the column.&nbsp; Now I want to
 sort the cells by color, but it is not working.&nbsp; It looks like the "rules" stay in the static cell and don't follow the data that is being sorted.</p>
<p>Is there any way I can make the highlighting "stick" to the original data?&nbsp; I tried copying the cell, then doing a "paste special" for formats, and that didn't seem to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I don't have an answer, but I'd love to know how you sorted on color (fill) the first time?&nbsp; I need to filter several ways, and being able to sort on the format would make life much easier.

            I would start by deleting the XP partnership on the device. To do that, open Activesync in Start - Programs and click Menu &gt; Options. Select the XP PC and click Delete from the Menu. Restart your device and connect to to sync again.

            And as long as you are removing the partnership for the XP computer from your device, open Activesync on the XP computer and remove the partnership for the device as well.&nbsp; Reboot the XP machine, reattach your device and it should sync.
