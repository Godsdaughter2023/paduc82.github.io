    <title>Cannot Print over WiFi Connection - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot Print over WiFi Connection</h2>
                    I am on an SP3 i7 256. &nbsp;I am usually connected to a Targus USB 3.0 Dual Video Docking Station at the office and WiFi at home. &nbsp;I noticed two days ago that I am not able to print over the wireless connections at either location. &nbsp;Once I plug into the docking
 station my queued print jobs go through immediately. &nbsp;Nothing has changed. &nbsp;The printer is on the same network, the WiFi at the office is the same network as the wire but I can print on wire but not the Wifi. &nbsp;The same problem is occurring at home. &nbsp;Other
 computers on the same networks do not have this issue. &nbsp;Have tried re-installing the print driver with no change. &nbsp; It is like something updated and changed the wifi connectivity. &nbsp;All updates are current and installed. &nbsp;Any thoughts?

</p><p>I checked that, it was not the issue, but I did find a "fix."</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I re-installed I did so while connected to the wire. &nbsp;I removed the devices and re-installed over WiFi - I can now print over WiFi and wire. &nbsp;Still do not know what caused the issue but found how to get things back. &nbsp;- That of course is part of the
 "fun" of computing.</p>

            <p>Yea, I found that issue by accident when installing two HP printers.&nbsp; The first one installed worked and then didn't.&nbsp; The network sharing center reset itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I did install both without the cable.</p>

<p>I realize I am very VERY late in responding to this.. but its only because I'm desperately looking for a fix for this same problem. I'm level 37, 60 hours in (I spent a lot of time leveling crafting stuff, sidequesting and overall ADD of the main quest),
 and I finally decided to continue the main quest. </p>
<p>THE PROBLEM FOR ALL OF YOU IS: You visited Riften before finishing the Diplomatic Immunity quest. For some reason, when you pick up the quest to become a full member of the Thieves guild, which u pretty much get automatically from entering Riften, it bugs
 the turnin for Diplomatic Immunity. Because, I believe the first person you need to talk to (Brynjolf) once you start "A Cornered Rat", which is the quest after Diplo, is the same guy who you have to talk to to frame some guy for having stolen some other guys
 necklace.</p>
<p>Now.. I have no clue.. but I'm going to try it because I've been trying to find a fix and I can't.. and don't want to wait for a patch. I saw on this post
</p>

<p>a guy said he completed the entire thieves guild questline before he even started the main story and had no problems...</p>
<p>So I loaded back to a save before turning in the quest to delphine, and I'm going to try to go become a member of the thieves guild and complete the entire questline. THEN I plan to go back and turn in the quest to Delphine and see if it works. I hope this
 works for those of you who got screwed with the same thing I did.</p>

<p>I have visited Riften multiple times before finishing the main quest "Diplomatic Immunity" and I never got this bug that breaks the quest.&nbsp; Since this a main quest, I would imagine it would be among the first quest bugs to be fixed.&nbsp; The good news is that
 Bethseda will be rolling out patches in January to fix broken quests. &nbsp;The bad news is that you will have to wait a few more weeks. &nbsp;Patch 1.4 is already being worked, but it was not stated what will be fixed in it. &nbsp;It could fix more general bugs or it could
 be the first quest fixing patch.&nbsp; We'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>This is the exact problem i've been experiencing. I didn't even realise until after I purposfully went looking for the main quest line. Delphine just goes over a load of rubbish again and again, while Brynyolf just says he's to busy, i hope this gets fixed
 because otherwise i will end up trading in the game because i can't be bothered to put in another 60+ hours of gameplay to get to where i already was.</p>

<p>I don't know if it helps because I didn't have the same issue but I never got the information from Brynyolf. I went past him and into the sewers as soon as I arrived, a pub/bar in the sewers pointed me in the right direction.</p>

<p>Ok so how do we let Bethesda know of this problem!?!? I am 135 hours in level 45 (almost 46) and I just started back on the main quest. I have finished all of the thieves guild, the dark brotherhood, the champions, the hard college, and the college in winterhold.
 I'm going to be LIVID if this doesnt get fixed! I have reloaded and done the quest diplomatic immunity evey different way I can and Delphine won't give me the cornered rat quest! &nbsp;I know where this guy is because of searching through the rat way before,...but
 that doesn't work either &gt;:O</p>

<p>So, I just got here, too and I can't go farther. I talked to Delphine and she said go find Esbern but the next quest did not appear. I've been to Riften many times, I own a house there but I am a fine upstanding citizen and have not talked to Byrnjolf though
 I did talk to maul about the gems. I looked at the guide and it says you can skip all that and just go get Esbern but since I don't have the official quest marker he won't talk to me. If I went to Byrnjolf I'm sure he would only want to induct me into his
 den of iniquity by setting up those two poor fools just trying to make a living. Since it seems to happen a lot and I would have thought it addressed before now I guess I'll wait for the patch. I went back to an earlier save when I hadn't left the dungeon
 yet to see if that would solve it but I kept getting Malborn killed (I didn't the first time) and kept reloading and then when I gave up and opened the trapdoor the reload screen froze. I think I'm not supposed to do this anymore. BTW I'm level 43 with 180
 hours in this character (I piddle around a lot) but I wanted to finish the main quest so I could take a break and get on with some real life stuff that's beginning to pile up.</p>

<p>I am now officially bummed. The main quest is broken for me. I went back to before I escaped the embassy and it still didn't continue. Nothing was right in Riften and the old man still wouldn't talk to me (I hate the Ratway). I did Meridia's quest tonight
 (that is a really long dungeon) and that's about all I wanted to do other than the main quest. i finished the mages except for the Arniel Gane. I'm not quite up to level for the master quests. Speaking of which, I bought the best fire and ice (other than master)
 spells, made myself a superpowered necklace to reduce the cost so i could cast them and while my destruct is still only 66 because archery is so much more effective they still should have been better at taking out one miserable fire mage and assassin both
 of whom ambushed me separately. I can still get even elder dragons with my old spells though my archery is getting good enough to hurt them also. I miss Oblivion's charge in with fireballs blasting. I guess I wait to see if the patch works and just go walkabout
 again. This is the first quest that broke for me and I'm discouraged.</p>

<h2>            pc settings window not opening on windows 10</h2>
                    After upgrading to windows 10 from windows 8, I cannot open the Settings function from the main Start menu (or anywhere else). The window appears to open then closes itself. I have restarted several times, and I have also tried to update Windows 10 but
 it appears to no longer have a manual update feature - does it now automatically update itself? Anyway appreciate help on getting the Settings menu to load properly - thanks.

<p><span><span>Hello foxtrait,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Torrent is a small file (around few kilobytes), which contains all the information needed to download a file the torrent was made for. That means
 it contains file names, their sizes, where to download from and so on. You can get torrents for almost anything on lots of web sites and torrent search engines.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Torrent is the most popular way of downloading large files, including movies and games (remember legality of downloading).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you ask me if it is safe, it would depend on the source it is coming from. All the torrents come from different sources.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You will need a torrent client to use the torrents. I suggest that you use your favorite search engine and look for clients if you would like to
 install it. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>You need to&nbsp;discuss this with your e-mail provider and/or your ISP.&nbsp; They are the ones who can access these things on your account and close it (though I'm not sure they can
 stop the emails from being sent in your name even if the account is closed because the source probably isn't the e-mail provider or ISP but some unknown place in a foreign country).&nbsp; But you do need to notify them immediately so they can take the proper action
 (and be sure to discuss how you will get access to your files if they close your account - you may need to keep it open long enough to move the information elsewhere).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You should also report this to the authorities (the police) so they can try to track down these criminals who may cause even more harm before all is said and done.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also report this to the internet crime complaint center if necessary</span></span></p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Runs Hot, Fan Always On, Battery Drains Fast</h2>
                    <p>I've tried a bunch of the fixes online for this common problem - my SP 4 gets super hot super fast, the fan is always on, and the battery drains super fast.&nbsp; I've turned off Microsoft Hello and I seem to have all updates installed - although I am not expert
 in that - and none of this has helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the current suggestion/solution for this common problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UPDATE</p>
<p>
</p><p>Called Microsoft.&nbsp; They accessed my SP4 remotely, removed 1,000+ temp files and reset my SP4.&nbsp; Problem solved.&nbsp; (Although am missing a few bits and bobs after the reset, but there is a 'night and day' difference to the heat, fan noise and battery life.)</p>

<div>&gt;&gt;Mostly, the reason why your device is overheating because of the apps and software all running at the same time. There were apps that consume a lot of power.

            Erm ... no.&nbsp; Google the subject and you'll find countless SP4 owners all tearing their hair out over this issue ... many complaining about battery drain during sleep mode etc.&nbsp; If you have the issue on your SP4, turn it on and open nothing, even in sleep
 mode, within a few minutes it will be hot enough to fry an egg, the fan will be whirrying away madly and the battery will drain like a kitchen sink.

<h2>            Is there a CPU Meter app for Windows 10 similar to the CPU Meter gadget for Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I know that gadgets have been discontinued because of security reasons, but there is one gadget I sorely miss - the CPU Meter. I've searched around the app store to no avail and I'm wondering if it even exists. I know Task Manager does this but I don't want
 to have to rely on Ctrl+Alt+Delete every time I want to do a quick check on how much Ram is being used.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>An application that's similar to the <strong>CPU Meter</strong> gadget offered in Windows 7 is helpful in quick checking your CPU usage. As of the moment, the only way you can monitor your CPU usage is by utilizing the Task Manager. Task manager reports
 broad information about processes and memory of your running applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We encourage you to share your suggestions with us by sending a feedback. You can do so by typing
<strong>Windows Feedback</strong> in <strong>Cortana</strong>, the search box on the task bar. You can also check if somebody else has already offered the same suggestion. You can vote for it or leave a comment.<br />

<h2>            Windows found driver but unable to install - for my printer</h2>
                    My printer wasn't showing up when I tried to print, so I went to settings and it said that the driver was unavailable. After downloading drivers off of the HP website&nbsp;5,000 times and it still not working, I went into device manager and tried to update
 my drivers from there, but I got the error message that the drivers were found but unable to install. I already ran a hardware and devices troubleshooter that didn't find any issues.&nbsp;

            <p>Thank you, Ryan. Unfortunately, this did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge redirects www.nextdoor.com to my local newsfeed (https://paramountsubdivision.nextdoor.com/news_feed/), where the warning appears. Continuing on leads to a 404 Not Found page with the certificate error notice on the address bar. Clicking on that icon
 produces a "Website problem" dropdown box. I do not see any additional options to view or install certificates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reiterate, this problem isn't browser-specific, it happens on them all (although the warnings vary) and ONLY on the one device (laptop) and ONLY on this one site. My desktop and other devices are not affected.</p>
<p>

            <p>You are definitely right, it is not a browser specific issue. The reason for us trying to install the Security Certificate to your computer is for your browser to identify the secured website that you are trying access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are not getting a prompt on your browser to install the security certificate, please follow these steps on how to Manage Trusted Root Certificates in Windows:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Run </strong>box by pressing<strong> Windows icon + R</strong> then type
<strong>mmc</strong> and hit enter.</li><li>Click <strong>File </strong>and select<strong> Add/Remove Snap-in.</strong></li><li>Under<strong> Snap-in</strong>, select <strong>Certificates</strong> then click

            <p>Thank you, Ryan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made it as far as #7 in the first section. At that point the Certificate Import Wizard then opens a dialogue box asking for the file name of the certificate I wish to import. (There is a browse option that simply opens to my Documents folder.) There didn't
 seem to be an obvious place to look and I didn't know what file name to enter.</p>

            <p>My apologies, Doug. We went straight to deep troubleshooting without checking the basic steps, if none of these steps works we will continue checking the website certificate. Please follow these steps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Run </strong>box by pressing<strong> Windows icon + R</strong> then type
<strong>inetcpl.cpl</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Security tab</strong>, select <strong>Trusted sites</strong>, then click
<strong>Sites </strong>button.</li><li>Type https://nextdoor.com on the first box then click <strong>Add</strong>.</li><li>Hit <strong>Close</strong>, then click <strong>Apply </strong>and <strong>OK.</strong></li><li>Restart browser and access the website.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You can also check your Network Connection to make sure that there is no proxy server. At the bottom right side of the screen, left click on
<strong>Network icon</strong> then select<strong> Network Settings</strong>. Choose
<strong>Proxy </strong>and set <strong>Use a proxy server</strong> to <strong>Off</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please use Firefox to see if you will get the same issue.</p>
<p>

            I just uninstalled my antivirus (Avira) and disabled the Windows firewall, but there was no change. It's still just the one site, on one device, on all browsers, that won't load.

There may be a&nbsp;few reasons for your Error.<br />
<br />
Booting from Network could be set as what to Boot from 1st in the Boot Order.<br />
<br />
Your Hard Drive may have failed.<br />
<br />
Hard Drive Connectors could be loose.<br />

    <title>Network Suddenly Requesting Username &#38; Password to Access &#40;New - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rspc_construction  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network Suddenly Requesting Username &#38; Password to Access &#40;New Wireless Router&#41;</h2>
                    After needing to replace an ADSL wireless router with a D-Link DSL-2750U, the network we have been using is suddenly requesting username &amp; password access for certain machines.<br />
<br />
The crazy thing is, some of these can access one way, (but not the other) and one machine is accessible by all but 2 computers, without the need for signing in.<br />
<br />
The network consists of both XP Pro and W7 OS; 7 computers in total and all can access the internet.<br />
<br />
File sharing is active on all, as is printer sharing and the workgroup matches on all machines.<br />
<br />
Am I going to have to set up Guest Accounts on all machines with a password or is there another explanation for this suddenly happening that will help? The group I work with isn't particularly computer savvy, and needing to log in every time they want to access
 a shared computer is going to drive them crazy!<br />
<br />
Open to suggestions - I've tried everything I can think of, and looked at similar on tech forums, but the answers are still not bringing forth a result.<br />
<br />

            <p>I am assuming that your XP Pro machines have "Simple File Sharing" disabled.</p>
<p>When you attempt to access another machine for File Sharing, Authentication proceeds close to the following sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the same username and password exists on both computers, then the connection is silently authenticated
</li><li>If the same username exists on both machines but the passwords don't match, then the connection is disallowed.
</li><li>If the same usernames don't exist on both machines, then it attempts to authenticate as "Guest" user&nbsp;with a null password.
</li><li>If it can't authenticate as "Guest" (either because Guest user was not active or the Guest user had a password), then the client machine will put up a window asking for a Username and Password for authentication.</li></ol>
<p>... so if you're falling all the way down to #4, then you need to fix it so that one of the other conditions are met.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If "Simple File Sharing" is enabled, then all users are forced to authenticate as "Guest" user.&nbsp; To determine if SFS is&nbsp;enabled, double-click any folder, then Tools -&gt; Folder Options -&gt; View (tab) -&gt; Use Simple File Sharing (last in list)</p>
<p>Sorry, but I have not experimented much with Windows 7 yet. </p>
<p>HTH,<br />

            I turned off simple file sharing and gave 2 (XP) machines a Guest account with a simple password - that didn't work when I tried to access each from the other; removed the password on the Guest account and again, still no joy.<br />
<br />
None of the accounts have passwords, regardless of the OS. The crazy thing is, before the original router stopped working, this didn't occur on *any* PC - XP or W7, only started once the new router was installed.<br />
<br />
I had the ISP visit and check the connection today - all ok.<br />
<br />
It was suggested that I give each PC a Static IP address, but when I tested on my XP laptop, it couldn't access the group any more, so I'm loathe to try with the others.<br />
<br />
It's got me totally stumped and is causing a rather huge headache with printing and file sharing. Currently all but 1 of the 8 PCs can access one XP machine, allowing (almost) everyone to print - hence all printers are accessed through it, but if that goes
 down, we are going to be fully out of action.<br />

            <p>Your apparent symptom-connection to the new router is baffling since routers do not do very much on the LAN-LAN side in terms of firewalling.&nbsp; However, I did come up with one possibility that can be router-connected.&nbsp; The DHCP service&nbsp;on the router usually
 sets IP address, Gateway, and DNS Server.&nbsp; However, it also has the potential to set the Node-Type on a Windows machine.&nbsp; If the Node-Type were to be set to "Peer-to-Peer" (P-P), Then that machine would stop listening to broadcasts and effectively remove itself
 from the Windows Networking (NetBT) network.&nbsp; This can be confirmed by bringing up a command prompt window (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "cmd") and entering the command:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; ipconfig /all</p>
<p>and note the "Node Type" line.&nbsp; Normally, without a WINS server on the network the type should be "Broadcast" but anything except P-P (P-node)&nbsp;will work.&nbsp; If this is your problem, the solution is here:</p>
<p>"You cannot view other workgroup computers on the network on a Windows XP-based computer"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903267</a>&nbsp;&gt;</p>
<p>In terms of troubleshooting, I find that error messages are much more revealing in the command-prompt environment.&nbsp; Try connecting to another machine "manually" by bringing up the command-prompt window (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "cmd") and enter the command:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; net&nbsp; use&nbsp; *&nbsp; \\192.168.1.100\sharename</p>
<p>or, to authenticate as a particular user, try:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; net&nbsp; use&nbsp; *&nbsp; \\192.168.1.100\sharename&nbsp; /user:joe</p>
<p>Where you replace 192.168.1.100 with the target machine's actual IP address and replace "sharename" with the name of the network share&nbsp; folder on that machine.&nbsp; Using the IP address bypasses "Browse Master" problems.&nbsp; If it works with the IP address, then
 disconnect and try reconnecting using the computer name instead of the IP address as in:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; net&nbsp; use&nbsp; *&nbsp; \\computer1\sharename</p>
<p>Errors that you get using the command-prompt approach are much more helpful than the GUI.</p>

            I tried your first suggestion - checking&nbsp; the "Node Type": Unknown<br />
I also tried connecting via the IP address, but I kept getting the following message:<br />
<br />
System Error53 has occurred.<br />
The network path was not found.<br />
<br />
I can however, (currently) see the machine via "View workgroup computers" and connect without the need for a password/username.<br />
<br />
Also had a look at the FixIt page, and that does appear to be in the ballpark, as far as what is actually happening, so I'll give it a go on my own personal XP machine, before trying it out on the others.<br />
<br />
I'm obviously doing something wrong via the terminal commands, but not sure what exactly.<br />

            <p>I didn't mean to leave you hanging, but life came at me pretty fast for a few days...&nbsp; Let's pick a point of attack.&nbsp; Find an XP machine that you can not connect to and attempt to connect to it from another machine using the "net use"&nbsp;command line examples
 I gave before.&nbsp; You can copy the line above&nbsp;from your browser, paste it in Notepad or other editor, change the parameters that need to be changed, copy it back into the clipboard and paste it in a command window. (Note Ctrl-V does not work to paste... you
 must right-click in the window and select "Paste").&nbsp; If you type it by hand, make sure you get your forward and back-slashes correct.&nbsp; If you still get the Network Path error, then try doing the equivalent of a NetBT "ping" by entering the following command:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nbtstat&nbsp; -A&nbsp; 192.168.1.100&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (note upper case "-A")<br />
or<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nbtstat -a&nbsp; computername&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (note lower cast "-a")</p>
<p>Where you substitute the correct IP address or computername of the target computer after the -a.&nbsp; The above command should result in a short status list.</p>
<p>HTH,<br />

            Quite ok - I've been crazy also. :)<br />
<br />
Won't have a chance to check your latest suggestion until Saturday - interrupting workflow not such a good idea, but they can print so still ok for them to wait.<br />
<br />
(Just as a quick addendum, the machines do (randomly) connect at times, but just as quickly change back to requiring a password - can't judge which machine, when or for how long, it just happens and then switches back on a whim.)<br />

            Ok, I selected one machine (wireless) that I cannot access and tried connecting via "net use" command and get the following message:<br />
<br />
Drive W: is now connected to \\192.168.1.10\SharedDocs<br />
The command completed successfully.<br />
<br />
As suggested, I then tried the NetBT command and get the following status report:<br />

<br />
<br />
I'm hoping you can make more sense of these than I can.<br />
<br />
<br />
Next I tried a LAN connected machine, with the "net use" command which gave the following results:<br />
<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\RSPC_NR&gt; net use * \\192.168.1.9\scan<br />
System error 53 has occurred.<br />
<br />
The network path was not found.<br />
<br />
Now comes the crazy part - this machine is actually using *my* IP address (RSPC)&nbsp; and yesterday, it was using the modem's IP address. (My machine doesn't have a shared *scan* folder, so that would be why the error 53 appears.) My machine is also wireless.<br />
<br />
If I run the ntstat command the following status report appears:<br />
<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\RSPC_NR&gt; nbtstat -a 192.168.1.9<br />
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAC Address = 00-22-43-39-06-4B<br />
<br />
As I typed this up - it acquired another IP address which now connects with the following message:<br />
<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\RSPC_NR&gt; net use * \\192.168.1.2\scan<br />
Drive V: is now connected to \\192.168.1.2\scan.<br />
<br />
The command completed successfully.<br />
<br />
And the nbtstat status report reads as follows:<br />
<br />
C:\Documents and Settings\RSPC_NR&gt; nbtstat -A 192.168.1.2<br />
<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MAC Address = 44-87-FC-74-FF-4D<br />
<br />
<br />
What I find interesting is that it seems to be indicating a Wireless Network connection (with the RSPC machine's IP address), yet it is connected via LAN, or am I reading that information incorrectly?<br />
<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>You have a lot of good information in your post.&nbsp; When you tried to connect to your "ASSARASZ27SP" machine (which you had previous problems connecting) the "net use" command successfully connected that share to the "W:" drive.&nbsp; ... and when you connected
 to the "SOM" machine, it too connected successfully to the V: drive.</p>
<p>The way you read the output from the "nbtstat" command is briefly as follows...&nbsp; "Local Area Connection" refers to the hard-wired ethernet on the machine you typed the nbtstat connection on.&nbsp; The "0.0.0.0" that follows indicates that you have nothing connected
 to that hardwire connection.&nbsp; "Wireless Network Connection 2" is a wireless port on the machine that you typed the nbtstat command on and the "192.168.1.9" is the IP address on that [local] wireless port.&nbsp; The results that follow come from the target machine
 and you either get a [successful] output like you received or you get an error message.&nbsp; All this indicates that there are no connectivity problems with your machines and file sharing seems to be working properly.</p>
<p>My guess as to where your problem originates is that your computers seem to be playing "musical chairs" with IP addresses.&nbsp; I downloaded the manual for your router from:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; 
ftp://support.dlink.co.in/broadband/DSL-2750U/manual/DSL-2750U_C1_Manual_IN_1.00.pdf&nbsp;&gt;</p>
<p>Not a very good manual as they go, but if you look at the settings on page 47 and assume that they are default, you will notice that the "Lease Time" is set to 24 hours.&nbsp; That means that if one of your servers goes idle and "sleeps" for more than half that
 time&nbsp;(12+ hours), it is possible that&nbsp;the IP address will be returned to the pool and when it wakes it will could get a new/different IP address.&nbsp; You would like your "server" machines to maintain a&nbsp;consistent IP address.&nbsp; Here are some things you can do to
 encourage that to happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect to your router by bringing up a web browser and entering <a href="http://192.168.1.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://192.168.1.1</a> in the Address window.&nbsp; In your Router Settings (in manual above, page 47), Change the "Leased time" setting to something in the 2 week range (350 hours or so)</li><li>In your Router Settings, assign a "Static IP" lease to your server machines.&nbsp; On page 47, click the "Add Entries" button.&nbsp; Then you will need to associate an Ethernet (MAC) address with an IP address.&nbsp; From your "nbtstat" output, you see that "SOM" Machine's
 Ethernet address is 44-87-FC-74-FF-4D.&nbsp; Associate that E-net address with a fixed&nbsp;local address such as 192.168.1.200.&nbsp; Make the next machine ".201" and so forth.&nbsp; Your router can apparently accept up to 32 of these fixed associations.&nbsp; Don't forget to click
 the "Apply/Save" button after making the changes.</li><li>Keep your machines from going to Standby.&nbsp; On each machine, go to the Control Panel -&gt; Power Options and configure your file server&nbsp;machines never to go into sleep/standby.</li><li>Keep your network cards from powering down to save power.&nbsp; Bring up the device manager (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "devmgmt"), double-click on your wireless network adapter, look for a "Power Management" tab at the top, and uncheck the box "Allow the computer to turn
 off this device to save power". (On Windows 7,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start -&gt; Right click "Computer" -&gt; Manage -&gt; Device Manager)</li></ol>
<p>After doing 1 and 2 above, you will need to restart every affected&nbsp;machine on your network to assure they receive the updated settings.</p>
<p>I hope this helps,<br />
Good Luck,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; JW</p>

            <p>Im not sure exactly what you are saying, but first as a simple test I would delete any existing connections on the computers
</p>
<p>Eg. if you have a wirelss connection to a ssid called Hello go to the wireless connections and delete hello.
</p>
<p>then reconnect find the ssid eg hello and then reconnect using password that you have set up for that router.
</p>
<p>I find after adding new wireless router you need to do this.</p>

</p><p>I'm running windows 10 , I am having a problem with the screen saver/lock screen . I can change the setting using the up down arrows but it has no effect and comes on after 1 minute. When I open the setting again It has changed the setting to 1 minute. Any
 ideas how I overcome this ?</p>

            Hi Paul.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Lock Screen &gt; Screen Saver Settings and set to None.  
<br />
<br />Next right click Start button to open Power Options, then choose Additional Power Options, then choose Balanced Plan (unless you're a gamer choose High Performance), then Change Plan Settings, on next panel at bottom choose Reset Plan to Defaults, Save and Exit.
<br />
<br />There is a bug in some Themes that may set the Screen Saver to Bubbles or Blank at one minute, so if you use the spectacular Themes make sure to check this each time you change one.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Where did you get WIndows 10 from?  Which media was used to install it?  
<br />
<br />What is the Edition and Activation status showing at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Activation?
<br />
<br />If you do not have Pro or Enterprise versions which have Group Policy Management by a System Administrator then that is an error which should be covered by one of these fixes:

<h2>            Resetting Windows 7 to factory settings.</h2>
                    I have a laptop, Dell Inspiron 1750. Was originally purchased at Aarons rental. Been paid for a few months now, so I decided I would reset windows to factory settings. Pretty much to just wipe it clean. Well it appears there are two admin accounts already on here. Aarons and the other is called HomeUserGroups$. Well I have no passwords for either. I have called Aarons, went to the store where I purchased, emailed customer service (1 business day response, i gave them 3 days then called back), even had the district manager call me, anyway they all told me i was crazy. Hmm, I told them my name isnt Aaron, or homeusergroup, nor is anyone in my family named that, so im thinking someone else created this account. After they told me they dont use passwords on there systems, they gave me a list of 9 passwords to try. More wasted time. Well after 2 weeks of this I gave them 3 options. Either supply me the password, give me a copy of widows 7 or a laptop without this **** on it. Just completely fru

            <p>Yes..</p>
<p>Try pressing CTRL + F11 directly after pressing the power button.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try pressing 0 (zero) directly after pressing the power button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technically, the machine should boot to options, one of which should be a full restore..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, there is always a possibility that there is no recovery parttition, in which case you will have to slug it out with the vendor..

<p>The Guide refers to Vista not Windows 7. Were you provided with DVD when you made your purchase? If yes is there any reference to Windows 7 on the DVD? Using the restore may cause the computer to restore to Vista.
</p>
<p>Is this the business you made your purchase from:<br />

<p>If yes I would hold fire on restoring to factory settings as you may want to contact Microsoft to confirm you have a genuine copy of Windows 7. Dell may also be another line of enquiry.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to completely uninstall the old driver then install the latest driver you want to in compatibility mode and check if it helps.
</span><span>Also ensure you install all the pending Windows update and the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>

            Those were all the first steps that I took. &nbsp;First, I installed the new graphic card. Then I installed the latest driver. 3rd I uninstalled the old driver. 4th did a driver update. 5th did a windows update for version 7. nothing changed the Windows 10
 compatibility check.

<h2>            Update error 0x80070070-0x20004</h2>
                    <p>I was impatient and I didn't want to wait to get automatic update so I downloaded "MediaCreationToolx64".</p>
<p>I started it and got to the end process (I think) and it stopped at 9% with the error code and message: "The installation failed in the safe_os phase with an error during install_recovery_environment operation".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to update 2 times and both of them came with the same result.<br />

Can anyone tell me how can i fix this?<br />
Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft community forum. Let me assist you with your concern.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The white cloud which you are referring is OneDrive icon. This icon is enabled by default when you use Microsoft account to login to Windows 8.1.
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>To remove this icon you need to uninstall the OneDrive and it is not possible to remove the OneDrive from Windows 8.1 computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And the Mail app, blue side panel which you are referring is default by design. It will show your inbox folders, favorites and flagged mails. This cannot be removed.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

<p>I want to stop my son from being able to delete his browser history on Microsoft edge. Under history you can simply click the cross next to any site you visited and remove it. Is there anyway to stop it??</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>Hi Nadia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Disabling the ability to delete the browser history is not available on Microsoft Edge. However, you might want to set up family features for your son, which is the child account. Child account will let you

set the right limits for your child</a>. You can also visit these links for more information about

<h2>            UK Xbox Live Points Card - will it work in the US&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi! It's my best friend's birthday today and he's in the US, while I'm in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to get him some Live points but apparently you can't do that online if I'm in the UK and he's in the US, we both have to be in the US for that to work.</p>
<p>So my next question is, if I buy a UK points card and give him the code, will he be able to redeem it?</p>
<p>Thanks :)</p>

            <p>Sorry, MS Points codes are region specific. &nbsp;It's a nice idea to give your friend points for his birthday. &nbsp;Why not send him the money via transfer and he can buy them on his end.</p>
