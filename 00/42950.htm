    <title>camera app for windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            camera app for windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just bought a Logitech c922 webcam that requires a 3rd party camera app. I cannot find anything for Windows 7, a Google search just keeps taking me to drivers for Windows 10. Please help, I need a camera app for Windows 7 that'll work with other programmes
 such as XSplit as this is what I will use to make my recordings/edit. Every time I open Xsplit it says there is not camera connected but records audio fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>It would be extremely unlikely that any hardware would require 3rd party applications to work. If your video editing application cannot see the camera as a direct video source then it is more likely you are lacking drivers. Can you use the camera at all
 such as for live display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can then the editing program itself cannot take video directly and you would have to use utilities provided with the camera to record the video then import it into your editing program.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks HairyFool. The driver page for the camera says "a third party app is required such as Windows camera app". Which is why I was trying to find one. I downloaded an app called mycam, one of the "cons" listed is "Supports very few formats". I could see
 the feed from the camera with the above app but the editing programme still says no camera connected. I was wondering whether there was a windows camera app as that's what Logitech seem to suggest. Thanks.</p>

</p><p>If you've done all that and XSplit is still not recognizing the C922, you should probably look to XSplit support for help:&nbsp;

            Hello Neil, I see that you are having some trouble deleting the old files in your windowsapps folder. In this case, first go into your settings, then head to Apps &amp; Features, then look for the app. If the old apps are still there, click on it, then hit uninstall. If the apps don't show up there, don't worry. You can manually delete the files from the File explorer. 
<br />Navigate to your windowsapps folder which contains the apps that you wish to remove. Now right click, and hit Properties. Click on the Security tab, then under Group, click  Edit on your User name. Now, check the Full control option under permission for authenticated users. Remember to hit Apply, then OK. Now you are able to delete the files in the windowsapps folder.
<br />Hope this helps, and let me know if you have further questions! :-)

</p><p>Started back in Oct 2018 after a windows update. I shut the PC down as usual and there were no w-updates shown on the shut down button.</p>
<p>Noticed that the same 8 updates were to be installed every few hours.</p>
<p>Tried so many things, it seemed that everything I wanted to use came up with a new error code, e.g. 8007042, 0x800ccc0f, 0xE800001C, 0X81000203 are all I have a record of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>An fan on an external drive began to make a lot of noise so I took everything loose and rebuilt the PC. That was OK. The Pc was taking a long time to load and I had blue screens, American Megatrends 3 times and repair on start up 3 times. The PC has improved
 since I disconnected an external drive and turned on all the 'services' that had somehow been disabled.</p>
<p>I am typing this on the said PC. Any help/advice would be much appreciated.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Laurence</p>

<p>There is little doubt in my mind that you need to replace your hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The life expectancy of a disk drive in a desktop computer is about 8 years or so.&nbsp; Yours is likely failing right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strongly recommend you backup your data on an external hard drive.&nbsp; You are about to lose it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Replacing the hard drive in a desktop computer is actually quite easy.&nbsp; Likely will take you 10 minutes or less.&nbsp; A&nbsp; new hard drive can be purchase for about $70 for a 500 Gig drive which is much larger than the total of the two drives you now have.&nbsp; An
 example:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-500GB-Performance-Desktop-Drive/dp/B008968L6M/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1547675538&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=internal+3.5+hard+drive+western+digital+black+500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/Black-500GB-Performance-Desktop-Drive/dp/B008968L6M/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1547675538&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=internal+3.5+hard+drive+western+digital+black+500</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I will now give you a very detailed step by step to do this.&nbsp; However I recommend you first read this discussion to decide how you will handle Windows Update after you complete the initial install of Windows 7 on the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-update/windows-7-updating-in-2018/291a9582-17a7-4942-8145-8d9f68265189?messageId=2f46cef5-da27-431d-8c6f-b5e7b2b89246">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-update/windows-7-updating-in-2018/291a9582-17a7-4942-8145-8d9f68265189?messageId=2f46cef5-da27-431d-8c6f-b5e7b2b89246</a></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
The hard drive&nbsp;has failed.&nbsp; You will have to replace it.&nbsp; Replace with a 500 G or more rotating 7200rpm drive.&nbsp; 500G drives can be found for around $70.&nbsp; Typically quite easy to replace.&nbsp; Now you will need a complete Windows 7 install.</li><li>
I do this all the time.&nbsp; I have done hundreds.&nbsp; This is likely to take an elapsed time of around 12 hours.</li><li>
First go to your computer’s OEM support site and find and download the drivers for your computer and store them on a USB stick.</li><li>
From this point onward, I am providing you with the process to install Windows 7.</li><li>
You&nbsp;<strong>may&nbsp;</strong>be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the failing&nbsp;hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC,
 copy the data off.&nbsp; You may need a friend to do this part for you, but the rest is not really very technical or difficult for most people.</li><li>
Install the new hard drive.</li><li>
Do not do any formatting or partitioning.</li><li>
If you made a set of disks for recovery or an image copy&nbsp;at the time your computer was new.&nbsp; This is the time you need them.</li><li>
Start your computer on the first of the disks as instructed and in an hour or so, your computer will look exactly as it did then.</li><li>
If you do not have that set of disks. You will need a legal reusable&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Product&nbsp;Key.&nbsp; You will need a Windows 7 install disk. The win7 disk must match the edition of your product key, and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows
 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.&nbsp; Hopefully, the disk you use will be labeled SP1 (Service Pack 1), because that will save you an additional 4 hours or so.</li><li>
Place the Windows 7 install disk in the disk reader and start your computer.</li><li>
Once the install process is started, choose CUSTOM.&nbsp; Ignore the check box about drivers, unless you can not proceed further.</li><li>
If this is not a brand new hard drive, when you get to the place where it asks you where to put the installation, click Advanced and delete all partitions.</li><li>
When the installer asks about Windows update, choose Ask me later</li><li>
Reset Windows Update setting to Never….</li><li>
<strong>Do NOT install any program</strong></li><li>
Hopefully, you started with a Win7 install disk that was SP1 (Service Pack 1). If not, run Windows Update until you get to the point that SP1 has installed itself as part of this procedure.&nbsp; It entails multiple Windows Update passes and restarts&nbsp;which you keep
 updating until you get there.</li><li>
Once Windows 7 SP1 is installed, install the following:</li><li>
<strong>KB3020369</strong>&nbsp;Win-7 32 &nbsp;<a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/C/0/8/C0823F43-BFE9-4147-9B0A-35769CBBE6B0/Windows6.1-KB3020369-x86.msu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://download.microsoft.com/download/C/0/8/C0823F43-BFE9-4147-9B0A-35769CBBE6B0/Windows6.1-KB3020369-x86.msu</a></li><li>

Open Windows Update, change Windows Update setting to Never check for updates</li><li>
<strong>Do not install anything else at this point – NOTHING.&nbsp; Not even an antivirus program</strong></li><li>
Start&nbsp;the update process.&nbsp; It is likely to include about 200. It will take some time.</li><li>
Install all offered security updates.&nbsp; Install .net, but do not install any updates that do not come pre-checked.&nbsp; Do not install any “Optional” updates.</li><li>
Once you have a list of updates, you need to prevent certain specific updates from being installed to prevent Windows 10 from taking over.</li><li>
Click once on each Windows Update that is NOT labeled SECURITY and check the date of issue on the right.&nbsp; If that date is after January 1, 2015, Right-click on it and hide.</li><li>
Click install updates and wait for it to finish.&nbsp; Restart when asked to do so.</li><li>
After re-start is complete and you see a desktop, start Task manager – Right-click on task bar. Look at the % at the bottom.&nbsp; Do NOT attempt to use the computer for any purpose until you see that % fall to and stay at 10% or less.&nbsp; Windows Update is still working
 and has a lot of work to do.</li><li>
Keep running Windows Update again and again till it offers no new ones.</li><li>
Start Internet Explorer, click the gear (upper right)&nbsp;in IE11 and select Compatibility settings and enter&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft.com</strong>&nbsp;in the list</li><li>
Reset Windows Update to Never….</li><li>
Start Windows Update and click the link to include updates for other Microsoft software.</li><li>
Run Windows Update again and again until you are satisfied you have all the updates you want.</li><li>
After the install is complete, check Device Manager. Type&nbsp;<strong>device</strong>&nbsp;in the text box above the start globe when you click it and choose Device manager
 from the list&nbsp;to find out if Win7 was able to supply the drivers you need.&nbsp; You should get drivers only from the maker of your computer or Intel.&nbsp; Its best to get all the drivers at this point.&nbsp; Win7 install may have installed all of them or nearly. Do NOT
 use any of those driver download sites.&nbsp; They are all bogus, have bad drivers, and install malware.</li><li>
Install your Microsoft Office software and then run Windows Update again and again till no more are proposed.</li><li>
Defragment your drive.&nbsp; Type&nbsp;<strong>defragment</strong>&nbsp;in the text box above the start globe when you click it once.&nbsp; Choose the Defragmentation link.&nbsp; Wait till
 it completes all passes..</li></ol>

 and a Happy New Year.

<h2>            Win 10 can not see Canon printer</h2>
                    <p>Computer and printer have worked fine for months. &nbsp; &nbsp;Then computer said printer off line when it was not. &nbsp; &nbsp;I would send test page and then everything in queue would print. &nbsp; Had this problem too much in last two weeks so uninstalled printer. &nbsp;Win 10 cannot
 find it to reinstall. &nbsp; Have tried every scan.</p>
<p>both on same router. Printer has solid blue wifi light. &nbsp; &nbsp; I down loaded the canon mg6100 series to the computer and send test pages but ofcourse they come up with error. &nbsp; &nbsp;No error on win 10 side just does not list the printer.</p>

            Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps, Connect your Printer to the computer and Switch it ON. In case of Wireless printer, Switch it ON and connect it to the Wifi network.
<br />

<br />
<br />2. Update Printer Driver
<br />Download printer driver from printer manufacturer's website and reinstall.

<p>I had done all of these steps except the download driver. &nbsp; I have done all the steps,again and downloaded the drivers from Canon. &nbsp; Turned the printer back on and the wifi light shows solid. I went to system and devices and asked it to fine wifi which it
 did. Now it is not accepting the passphase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I did the spooler it said there were no files to delete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>at this point the lap top does not see a printer in the house. &nbsp; I need to get the printer to recognize the passphase. &nbsp; &nbsp;I appreciate the help very much</p>

    <title>Preparing to configure Windows, please do not turn off your computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> whiwo65  say:</h3>
<h2>            Preparing to configure Windows, please do not turn off your computer HELL&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have now lost 2 days of productivity now going on three. Ever since the latest update, which I assume is the Intel security issue from Microsoft, my computer was stuck in limbo after rebooting. In the past 2+ years that I've had Windows 10 installed on
 my computer, this has never happened though I see it's a common occurrence for other users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After leaving it alone overnight, the message was still there in the morning. I tried restoring my computer to no avail. I tried fixing startup issues to no avail. Finally, I gave up and reset my computer which took three attempts before finally working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I spent half a day reinstalling all of my software. By the next morning, I received a message that my 500GB SSD drive was full. The most I've ever used is about a quarter of the space as all of my work is backed up to three separate 2TB hard drives
 nightly. I removed the windows.old but that only freed up 25GB of space. In short, I could not run anything on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebooted again only to be stuck in another perpetual&nbsp;cycle of Windows update. Finally, I called Microsoft support just now only to encounter a real snot tech support assistant. As someone that is a manager in a call center environment, let me say that
 this individual not only needs to check the attitude at the door but should be fired. Especially when it's clear they know absolutely nothing about PCs nor Windows operating system and rely on canned responses like "did you check to see if Windows 10 is compatible
 with your computer." Seriously?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I built this computer myself with an Intel i7 3.5 GHz processor and 32GB of memory. I've been running Windows 10 on it since it was in preview and this jerk is asking me to check on something when I can't access the internet and suggests I use my cell phone?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now at the point that I have to perform a clean install of the operating system which means I lose another day of work. I'm right in the middle of moving my website over to a new platform and this is the garbage I have to deal with. Microsoft, you CAN
 do better. Hire me if you need to get your workers inline. You can start by firing that **** I just got off the phone with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;<span>this has never happened though I see it's a common occurrence for other users. &lt;&lt;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This should suggest that I have searched for a solution online. Your link to Kate's response even suggested this is a known issue. When you perform a search for the exact wording, a ton of similar questions pop up going
 back to Windows 7 and not one has a satisfactory solution; including Kate's. Much like the official Microsoft solution, it's a never-ending rabbit hole that's as convoluted as the day is long.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I did, in fact, perform a disk cleanup after resetting my computer because it indicated that my entire drive was full. It freed up 25 GB of space which mainly consisted of the windows.old installation. Still, I could
 not run any programs on my computer and had to reboot only to be stuck in the update process for hours once again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As I previously stated, this is the very first time I've ever encountered this issue with any of the Windows operating systems going back to 98. I have now performed a clean installation but now Bing no longer works
 (at all) and clicking on any link within the email (such as replying to your comment) does not work. Everything freezes up. Thankfully, I didn't waste my time reinstalling all of my software but have no other choice but to go back and once again perform a&nbsp;fresh
 install and hope for the best.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have now lost a full 3 days of productivity and thousands of dollars. I understand that anytime there is an important update or patch, Microsoft has to prioritize the downloads and installations to prevent bottlenecks
 in their network but 12+ hours is ridiculous.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>While I did not pay for Windows 10, I have paid thousands of dollars for every single Windows operating system since 98 (Including the failed ME and 8) as well as various iterations of Office. I fully expect
 that I will be paying for the next major release of Windows likely sometime this year or next. Whether or not I had paid for this particular operating system, I still count as a paying customer but I have no expectation that the support provided and the solutions
 offered would have been any better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I suggest that they better train their support representatives, provide more knowledge than canned responses, ask probing questions to determine the level of knowledge the customer calling in has, inquire about the steps already taken to resolve the
 issue to prevent redundant&nbsp;suggestions and for Pete's sake show an ounce of empathy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's new motto should be "We can do better by our customers."</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Don't bother responding. I'll be too busy reinstalling the operating system&nbsp;and my software so I can get back in business. I've expended enough time on this as it is.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Crash - No BSOD - Filter Manager</h2>
                    <p>I've been experiencing system crashes where no matter what I'm doing, idling, on internet, in a game, etc. The crash makes both my monitors go black and the audio cuts out as well. It hangs here and I have to do a hard reset. If I go to check dump logs &nbsp;there
 aren't any and I've made sure to check that crash logs are enabled and they are going to the correct directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll also check the system logs and 9/10 times it crashes it's right after Filter Manager event ID 6 with process 'npsvctrig'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried deleting all old drivers and downloaded all the newest ones but the issue still persists. I've looked around online and have seen a few cases with the same issue with no resolutions and am hoping that someone has had the same issues as me and
 found the solution.</p>

<h3> guerrero siempre  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Skype to connect to a number &#40;Viva network&#41; Dominican Republic.  I&#39;ve been having an issue for about a month.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Approx a week ago I started getting an error of "invalid phone number" or "phone network error." I have been using Skype to dial this number for the previous 4 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to this, I could only get a dial connection after numerous attempts of getting a handshake before the number was dialed.&nbsp; Once connected, we could only talk for about 1 minute.&nbsp; After this, all I could hear the first minute of of what they were discussing
 being repeated over and over.&nbsp; I had 400 minutes he month and could only use about 45 minutes before the subscription that month expired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone out there who knows what is going on?</p>

                    <p>I have already unallocated all of my D: drive memory and wish to move it to my C: drive.
</p>
<p>When it I right click&nbsp;on it the&nbsp;C:&nbsp;&nbsp;drive, the&nbsp;Extend Volume option is greyed out. I know it is greyed out because it is not right next to my unallocated memory. So how can I move my D: unallocated memory that is in Disk 1 over to Disk 0 which has the C:
 Drive in it?</p>

            You cannot move free space between different physical disks. The only way to increase the free space on C: is to move some of your files elsewhere; to D: perhaps.

<p>Well, with no screenshot, I would hypothesis two situations of partition location on your Disk 0. The first situation, you have other unallocated space or partitions (except for c drive) on the Disk 0. Then you can just enlarge &nbsp;C drive with the redundant
 space of these partitions. But like you said, the option <em>Extend Volume </em>
is grayed out, then you can try third party software to complete this task. I recommend AOMEI Partition Assistant Standard free edition. There is a
<em>Merge Partitions</em> function in it. You can merge those unallocated space or partitions to C drive whether they are adjacent to C drive or not. The interface of that software is neat and ease-to-use, so don't worry if you have little knowledge of computer.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>The second situation, you don't have redundant space on your Disk 0 while Disk 1 hold lots of space. Then you may try cloning C drive on Disk 0 to Disk 1 with AOMEI Backupper (<em>System Clone
</em>feature) without re-installing Windows . And you can use Disk 0 as the secondary storage. Here is a tutorial passage on

<p>So I tried this out. And it worked. But, I am using Laplink Pc mover to move all my data from&nbsp; my old computer to this computer. It will only move the data to my C:\ drive. So in the end. I need all of my unallocated space on disk 2&nbsp;&nbsp; to be on disk&nbsp;1 C:\.</p>

    <title>Cluster Chunk - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elitenoobforce  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cluster Chunk</h2>
                    
<p><b>Credits</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>We did not come up with the basic idea of Cluster Chunk since it was originally created for the PC. However, we added many mechanics to improve the game. The two primary creators of the map are Melonnade and EliteNoobForce. Other people who helped create
 the map were Impulsive Dream, Ha1oReach4ever, and VICCEN509. There is an extensive list of people who have test-played the map, but it would be too long to name here. The primary people to test the map, though, are the five people already mentioned. This map
 has been worked on since October 2012 when the creative mode update was released. It is constantly being updated and improved as Minecraft 360 is being updated.</p>

<p><a href="http://i1275.photobucket.com/albums/y454/NathanCat24/phpJdw455AM_zps165373fe.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here is an overview of red's side of the map.</a></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Basics</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our version of Cluster Chunk takes place within a gigantic, lava-filled arena. There are two teams: one red and the other blue. Each team starts out with one bed which every person on the team needs to sleep in. That way they will spawn inside the arena
 instead of the outside. The goal of each team is to collect the necessary materials to defeat the enemy team. In order to defeat an enemy player, their bed must be destroyed, and then the enemy player must be killed. When an enemy player spawns outside of
 the arena, they are out of the game. However, if someone dies and spawns inside the arena because their bed is not destroyed, they are still in the game. In other words, you can die an infinite number of times, but you are not out unless your bed is destroyed
 when you die.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><i>Home Diamonds</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The entire arena is divided in half by a cactus wall (the nature of the cactus wall will be discusses later). On one side is red team and on the other is blue. Home diamonds are where you first start the game and where your bed is first located. Each home
 diamond is made out of every block in the game (before the enchanting/brewing update). The home diamond is where your team will collect most of the materials for the game. The red and blue home diamonds are 93 blocks apart from one another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Satellites</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Surrounding the home diamonds are three smaller satellites. In order to reach these satellites, you need to build a bridge to them. Each satellite contains a chest with useful materials in it. Satellites are 30 blocks away from home diamonds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Lapis Lazuli Satellite (Armory)</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This satellite contains TNT, Bows, and Arrows. In each side of the satellite there are also melons which can be used for food. However, the lapis lazuli satellite is filled with spider webs. In order to get inside of it, you will need to destroy the webs
 with a sword. If you want, you can turn the string you collect from the webs into wool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Redstone Satellite (Alchemy)</i></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>This satellite contains potions and bottles o’ enchanting. However, the redstone satellite is also filled with leaves. In order to get inside of it, you will need to destroy them. You can do this by punching the leaves with your fist or burning them. If
 you want, you can collect the leaves with shears and use them for building material.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Obsidian Satellite (Engineering)</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This satellite contains wool, bricks, wood, and bookshelves. Since this satellite is made out of obsidian, you will need a diamond pickaxe to get inside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Drops</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three different types of drops that occur throughout the game. All three of these drops take place in the home diamonds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Wool Drop</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first drop is called a wool drop. Every few seconds, a single piece of wool will fall into the home diamond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Supply Drop</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second drop is called a supply drop. Every few minutes a chest will drop inside of the home diamond containing useful materials. In general, the drops get better as the game progresses. For example, the first drop contains food, shears, and coal while
 the last supply drop contains an ender pearl. Ender pearls are extremely useful in this game because they allow you to teleport to the enemy base safely and without alerting the enemy team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Diamond/Iron Drop</i></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>The third and last drop is called a diamond/iron drop. Every time a supply drop falls, diamonds and iron will fall with it. The amount of iron and diamonds that fall increases as the number of players in the game increases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Buying Items at the Shop</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Located above the obsidian satellite there is a shop that operates using sand as currency. The shop contains six useful items (prices in parentheses): ender pearl (90), enchanted bow (60), enchanted sword (60), block of diamond (30), 3x bottles o’ enchanting
 (1), and web (1). Prices at the shop are steep so you will need to save up sand and spend it wisely if you want to buy an item like an ender pearl. The following list contains places where you can obtain sand:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. There are four pieces of sand in each supply drop. There are ten supply drops for a total of 40 pieces of sand if you collect them from every supply drop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. At the back of the shop there are 20 free pieces of sand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. At the bottom of the lapis satellite there are 26 pieces of sand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. There are 17 pieces of sand in each mob cage. There are two mob cages for a total of 34 pieces of sand if you collect them from both cages. Mob cages are simple structures: one contains zombies, and the other contains skeletons. Fight the hostile mobs
 to earn the reward inside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s a grand total of 120 pieces of sand to collect. Make sure you spend sand strategically!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Other Important Structures</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://i1275.photobucket.com/albums/y454/NathanCat24/php83z0qFAM_zpsd7edcf7b.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><i>Cactus Wall</i></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, there is a cactus wall that divides the entire glass dome in half. It functions as a grace period indicator. Neither team can cross it until it falls. The wall is connected to a timer that will automatically destroy it after a certain
 amount of time. In other words, the grace period is over after the cactus wall falls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>End Stone Tunnels</i></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>The last important structures are the end stone tunnels. They are a quick and stealthy way to reach the enemy team. End stone tunnels can be found at the back of both the lapis lazuli satellite and the redstone satellite. In order to enter the tunnel, you
 need to spend 20 pieces of sand. After spending 20 pieces of sand, the door will only open temporarily. If you want to use the tunnels twice, then it will cost you 40 pieces of sand or 60 pieces if you use it three times…etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Secret Buttons</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Not only is the obsidian satellite useful because it contains building materials, but it also contains three secret buttons in the back. Two of the buttons set off a huge wall of fire charges to burn down any bridge the enemy team is making. The third button
 sets of an extra supply drop—for the enemy team. Basically, you don’t want to press this button. You have to stop the enemy team from pressing it. However, you should press the enemy team’s extra supply drop button. In order to do this, you will need to either
 sneak in or fight your way inside the enemy’s obsidian satellite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Tips</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Prevent Falling</i></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>It is very easy to fall off the edge and into the pit of lava at the bottom of the arena. To prevent this from happening, you need to be very careful. For example, make bridges two blocks wide instead of one. Crouching helps when trying to collect blocks
 in the home diamond. However, collecting blocks in the home diamond will create a lot of holes that are easy to fall through. When collecting blocks on the bottom half of the home diamond, it is recommended that you replace them with building material like
 wool. Furthermore, don’t carry armor and weapons on you unless you have to. If you die with important materials, there is a good chance you won’t be able to get them back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Enchanting</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The redstone and lapis lazuli satellites are not only useful because they contain chests. They can also be mined to collect experience. Experience can then be used to enchant armor and weapons. Of course, you will need to make an enchantment table to do
 this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Bed</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make multiple beds and move them wherever you want in the arena. For example, you can put a bed inside the obsidian diamond so it is harder for the enemy team to reach and destroy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Cactus Wall</i></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>Always check the cactus wall every once in a while to see if has fallen. If you don’t pay attention, the other team may attack without you being prepared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Enemy Mobs</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because the game is played on easy mode, enemy mobs can spawn in the arena. Be especially careful for creepers so that they don’t blow up your home diamond and bridges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>TNT</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your home diamond is made out of a couple of TNT blocks. It may be wise to collect those TNT blocks so that the enemy team does not bring a flint and steel/redstone torches and blow them up.</p>

            <p>So : </p>
<p>* make sure you have the correct drivers (from the maker's website, not from MS Update). This probably won't fix anything as it sounds lioke a harware issue.</p>
<p>* if that doesn't work then&nbsp;buy some powered speakers.</p>

<h3> terryuofm  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB flash drive &#40;G&#58;&#92;&#41; write protected, mounted, and causes many software updates to fail.</h2>
                    <p><span>Drive G Issue - absolutely crazy.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Months ago, somehow one of my USB Flash Drive (G:) became write protected and a mounted drive, and since then, this has been block many software updates.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The blocking occurs regardless of the account I am using, and whether or not this USB is plugged into my Windows 7 Dell system. Somehow, this USB G:\ has become mapped into my file structure in the registry (dozens of entries for G: …).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have looked at and tried many suggestions (noted below), and all have failed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This USB is 1GB, NTFS, has a MBR, and was made in China circa 2014. The label on it is STC for Science and Technology Corporation.<span>&nbsp; Nothing on the internet about STC flash drives.
</span>I have checked for a USB “protect” switch several times, even with mag glass, and found none.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As an example, with the USB G: plugged in, updating the QuickTime (QT) Plug-in for Firefox yields “Unable to write to the specified folder: G:…”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Did a fairly painstaking search of the register and saw no connection of QT to G:. Then searched the register for the G: and found a couple dozen entries pointing to the USB G: directories.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Next, I ejected the USB, rebooted the computer, then tried to update QT again.<span>&nbsp;
</span>QuickTime reports “Invalid Drive: G:\”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I can’t ignore this issue anymore because my system is behind for several updates.<span>&nbsp; Luckily,&nbsp;

            <p>Worked! QuickTime was able to update in FireFox.&nbsp; I thought I tried this, but for sure I removed all USB flash drives and I got the G: Invalid drive error message and the QT update aborted. Tried this in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I did not respond earlier, but I been trying to find/wait, for the other updates to happen.&nbsp; So far, none have popped up.&nbsp; Hopefully this cured the problem and there will be no future aborts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking the register, I saw a reference to the newly inserted flash as G:\.&nbsp; But I also saw the original references to the problematic (mounted?) flash.&nbsp; One group of register entries are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>...ShareFolders&nbsp; Folders100 REG_SZ G:\Manual BU ..... Pictures</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Folders104 REG_SZ G:\Manual BU .... Pictures</p>
<p>
</p><p>and this repeats throughout the register for each flash drive directory and file, and for other links into the flash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure would like to remove these register entries, but satisfied that I don't have to dive further into changing the register, or other more drastic actions.</p>

            <p>UPDATE to implementation of Frederik's suggestion.&nbsp; This seems to be working.&nbsp; I had one auto update while in standard account that completed since my last comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So replacing the G:\Manual ... USB with another USB worked for the Firefox updates (in admin account updates initiated by me) and one auto update (think it was adobe) in standard account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the Register still has many links (possible something like mounts) to the G:\Manual.. USB.&nbsp; I was looking for a way to remove those references, but am perfectly satisfied to let them remain in the Register, get rid of the G:\Manual ... USB that
 was made in china, and leave connected a different USB (no installed USB has caused update failures), and move on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Frederik.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Updates seemed to be completing, but after a while when I checked a next USB thumb drive that I inserted to replace the "problem" one, the new one now had the same directory and files that the one one had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only assume that W7 reinstalled the directories because they are still listed in the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I successfully deleted a single file in one of the sub-directories of the new USB, but was very reluctant to delete all the new directories.</p>

</p><p>It appears that W7 is treating this USB G: as some kind of special mass storage device and the solution seem to be rooted in removing it from the register.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Check the new USB I had inserted in place of the "problem" USB and even though it was plugged into the computer, Explorer did not see it.&nbsp; Pulled the USB out and plugged it back in and it appeared as the infamous G:.</p>
<p>

            <p>FINALLY what appears to be the solution!!<span>&nbsp; </span>SHARED files on the G: USB drive was the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Circa 2014, more than likely, a backup program that I was using/testing created a SHARED directory on a USB that was plugged into my computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The directory was G:\Manual Backup and had several sub-directors and files within those directories.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When I searched the register, these were listed MANY times throughout the register.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The USB also had other files that I had saved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first issue was that the USB probably died and became WRITE PROTECTED.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I could not remove the WRITE PROTECTION and of course, could not delete files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This in turn caused several updating programs (like iTunes, Adobe) to abort giving errors such as illegal drive.<span>&nbsp; S</span>ometimes the updates worked, and sometimes they aborted.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Over the months, more and more programs aborted to include OFFICE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The info in this overall question more or less details what I did, and without success.<span>&nbsp;
</span>What worked were the following steps for Windows 7:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click START-&gt;Rt Click COMPUTER-&gt;Click SHARED FOLDERS-&gt;Click SHARES-&gt;Click one of the USB G:
<span>&nbsp;</span>Share Names-&gt;Ck ACTION-&gt;Ck STOP SHARING in the drop down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I repeated for each SHARE that was on the G: drive.<span>&nbsp; </span>I then executed Explorer and deleted all remaining files and directories and for good measure, did a full format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SO FAR, the USB drive, still labeled as G, has not been automatically repopulated, as before, with the G:\Manual Backup directories and files, and searching the register does not turn up any G: files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully this is QED, but if these return, back to research.</p>

How off is this calculation?<br />

60 million x 7 % = 4.2 million<br />
<br />
How many of those 60 million windows 8 computers aren't allowed to access the windows store?<br />

I think you misread the linked article or my question<br />
<br />
60 million windows 8 + RT licenses sold<br />
<br />
link says ~7% of all windows 8/RT users of windows store are surface RT<br />
<br />
therefore, how off is the estimate that 4.2 million surfaces are sold? Well, it would be WAY off, if many million windows 8 users have never accessed the store.&nbsp; Like installed on 1000 business computers that have not yet been used... or their administrator
 settings at work don't allow them to access the windows store... because then you couldn't use 60 million.<br />

            <p>The graphs contain no figures merely ratios and the methodology has the potential to leave out so many systems as to be valueless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It contains only those systems with AdDuplex SDK for a start, how is that reperesentative?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the only thing useful it really demonstrates is despite Microsoft trying to encourage other makers into the RT market the fact is over 80% are Surface. With those manufacturers bringing full Windows 8 devices to market at the same time unlike Microsoft
 I suspect&nbsp;their&nbsp;customers are looking at the RT then the 8 based systems and many are going for the latter. With Microsoft for the last 3 months we have had not had that choice. How many threads have there been with with disenchanted RT users wanting to upgrade
 the software, looking for a trade in option or just a refund.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start drawing conclusion beyond what is actually there with this data collection is dangerous. Microsoft themselves made extraordinary claims over the sales figures for Vista and 7 never ever bourn out by other analysis methods. According to one Vista
 has never exceeded 7% of the user base and 7 only exceeded XP last March soon after the pre-release versions of 8 were available. Wonder why?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that same analysis all other operating systems counted together as a single digit value, try getting the Apple brigade to believe that.</p>

            well, I think we can safely estimate that Microsoft hasn't yet sold more than 4 million surfaces... but I hope that changes soon! &nbsp;I'm looking for an excuse to buy microsoft stock when everyone is doubting the surface...

            <p>I just bought a Surface 2 with Cyan Type Cover yesterday. I know I am just one person, but I have been an exclusively Apple user&nbsp;for ten years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a second hand Nokia Lumia 820, running 8.1 update a few weeks ago, just to check it out. I now have a Surface to go with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me to use any Microsoft software after ten years using Apple, means they're getting something right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like the Surface. It's different to my iPad, but in some respects better, in others not so good, but as a stand alone product, I think this little&nbsp;tablet has been much maligned. Maybe its better that I have no legacy 'junk' to transfer or carry over and
 I see Windows RT as the future for Windows, so Microsoft partners had better get their heads in gear and accept a more controlled deployment of software, allowing better security for end users is why people are buying iPad etc. Microsoft appear to see that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a bit of a learning curve, but I haven't found any issues or hindrances at all with the Surface 2, much to my and many other people's surprise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy so far</p>

<br />
Keyboard only seems to hang coming out of sleep; mouse normally works at least temporarily thereafter. After a few minutes every key press and mouse click from the hang happens in quick succession, and the computer is fine thereafter.<br />

            a) Yes; did that before commenting<br />
b) Genius keyboard and A4tech mouse - they're the old PS2 pair I've been using under XP for years problem free.<br />
c) Yes; no apparent changes.<br />
<br />
By obsevation the incidence of hangs has reduced with both of the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning a screensaver on and <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Changing to max performance power settings rather than balanced;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NB: Recurrence didn't increase when I turned CPU throttling back on.<br />
<br />
Both the keyboard and mouse are already set to wake the computer; the computer wakes, and then after a second or so the keyboard freezes; mouse clicks also fail but movement does not. After a few more seconds mouse movement fails, and after a minute or two
 the computer becomes responsive again.<br />
<br />
By observation of cpu fan noise, task manager and process lasso, there aren't any processes eating CPU at the relevant times.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<p>Presuming you purchased a wireless router for home use you will need to setup the proper network security, ie. network SSID, encryption type (WPA2 for example) and encryption key/password/passphrase. See these for help...</p>

            There was no answer, Windows 10 does run on SURFACE II. The keyboard,( on tablet and snapon keyboard ). Does not work all the time. Either one will work sometimes, then stop. Automatic updates is turned on as MS may solve the problem anyway. If anyone
 has a fix let me know.

            <p>Hi Tamal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community and being a part of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern about installing the DirectX version 12 on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that DirectX version 12 is not available to all the computers. It depends up on the system configuration you are using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, once the updated version of DirectX is available for your system you will get it through the Windows Updates soon or later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Get back to us for further assistance on Windows Operating System, we will be happy to help you further.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 - Pin to Taskbar</h2>
                    
<p>In Windows XP you have the QuickLauch bar to which various shortcuts can be attached. You can also attach multiple shortcuts for the same thing. For instance two shortcuts to Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>In Windows 7 I believe the QuickLauch has been done away with and you can now pin things directly to the taskbar. However, it doesn't seem to allow more than one shortcut to any given application to be attached.</p>
<p>Is there any way to have more than one shortcut to something on the taskbar?</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>The easiest way to solve this&nbsp;issue is to simply add the familiar QuickLaunch&nbsp;toolbar to the Taskbar, which is still available in Windows 7. See the following link for the step by step instructions.</p>

            I'm getting the same error in Win 10 and windows will not allow me to change the "Change User Account Control Setting" without giving me the same error sound. My first thought was to do a system restore but with Win 10 you lose ALL your self installed
 applications. It would take me days to reinstall just what I use all the time. Then what if that doesn't fix the problem? I'm stuck. No malware or viri has been found by Stopzilla or&nbsp;Norton. I've never had this error on any version of Windows all the way back
 to Win 95. What is causing this? Help!

            So I did a little internet searching and it turns out, for some dumb reason, the system sounds are tied to system functions like running and installing certain programs. If you changed your system sounds from the default change it back and hopefully everything
 will fix itself. Worked for me. Good luck!<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro - .dll is either not designed to run on windows or it contains an error</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Just updated to Windows 10 Pro from Windows 8.1 Pro. I tied installing some softwares like ANSYS , MATLAB etc. which already existed but I was also unable too uninstall them so I tried reinstalling so that every important file required for uninstalling can
 be replaced but neither I am able to install or uninstall any of the softwares. When looking on microsoft answers I found few measures to solve the issue but they were also a failure. I have attached screenshots so that you can analyse the situation better.
 Kindly have look.</p>

            <p>If the software refuses to uninstall, use Revouninstaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find Revo Uninstaller at <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.revouninstaller.com</a> &nbsp;(freeware). Here’s a quick look at how to use Revo uninstaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Launch Revo uninstaller after installing, select the program you want to uninstall or search for it using the built in search tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Click the Uninstall button on the toolbar</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will start the uninstallation wizard for the particular program you selected. Revo uninstaller will go through a series of steps which include creating a system restore point, creating a backup of your Windows registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then analyze the program and run its default uninstaller, click Yes when you see the above dialog. After the uninstall is completed, you have a choice of scanning modes to select from. What this will do is let you scan for any left over files, folders and
 registry items from that particular program. Safe looks in the usual places, moderate in more advanced locations while Advanced does a thorough search throughout the entire computer. After selecting your choice, (I went with Advanced), click Scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the scan is complete, you will see a list of registry entries left behind by the program, select them then click Finish to thoroughly remove the program from your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default uninstaller should work for most persons, but for those troublesome programs, the Force Uninstall feature and advanced scanning options will give you more control.
