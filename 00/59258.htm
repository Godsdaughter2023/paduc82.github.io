            Hi,<br />
I've the same problem, but&nbsp;before it was ok.<br />
I've found a solution:<br />
In the configuration panel move to audio and material/ajust mobility parameters.<br />
That open the windows mobility center with six box, one of these is about wifi, activate it and after that the FN and F2 keys activate or disactivate the wifi again.<br />
I hope this can help you.&nbsp;<br />
Sorry for my translation because I use a french version of windows 7 because I'm from belgium.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Is the Surface Pen compatible with other touchscreen based PCs&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron 11 3148 that is touchscreen and I enjoy doing digital art, normal touchscreen pens with the squishy rubber do not work on my touchscreen unless I push down hard but even then its not consistent. My PC states that it has "Touch support
 with 10 Touch points" in the "Pen and Touch support:". Would the Surface pen (any model) be compatible with my laptop? I definite answer will help my pull the trigger on a purchase.

    <title>Clearing out Driverstore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aliasalpha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Clearing out Driverstore</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a bit of a drive space problem that I need help sorting out. I'm running Win7 on a 60GB SSD and have been running catastrophically low on space recently, this morning I identified that the primary culprit was the extremely sloppy software practices
 of NVidia who seem to assume that everyone has infinite storage and would have no problem keeping a year or more worth of their drivers just in case they're in a retro mood and want to roll back to a driver from late 2013. I managed to reclaim a good 7GB of
 space deleting those (<em>as an aside, if anyone has an NVidia card &amp; drive space issues, clear out program files\NVidia corporation\installer2, it's just backups</em>) but then when I was examining my drive for any more stuff I could delete to reclaim space,
 I stumble across the driverstore. It's taking up 7.5GB of space, 6.5GB of which is those damned NVidia drivers again!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driverstore is an excellent idea but the execution needs work, much like NVidia it seems built on the assumption of infinite storage which is simply unrealistic in the age of SSDs (and I really hope it changes in Win10, 2 backups is plenty). I need to
 get rid of these&nbsp;drivers but nothing I&nbsp;do seems to work, I can't&nbsp;seem to take ownership&nbsp;or set permissions on the folder, possibly because the files are write protected but I can't change that setting either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've added my administrator level account to the list of users for the folder and given it full control but it still won't let me take ownership of either the driverstore folder or subfolders within, I'm tempted to try at the individual file level but I'm
 terrified that it might actually <em>work </em>and I'll have to spend a week manually changing permissions on 6.5GB worth of files one by one. I DO have the option to deny the system user access to the files but I've never tried that before and over the course
 of 3 tertiary IT qualifications, I never encountered anything advising that so my instincts are flashing a great big neon "Don't be an idiot" sign about that idea. This is dramatically higher level system admin stuff than I ever got into, I'm a network engineer
 more than anything else so I'm hoping someone around here might have an idea that I've not tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking hard about burning a bootable Linux disc and just wiping them manually with that but I'd sooner find a windows based solution just so I can learn how to do it rather than bypass it. It's getting close to the point where I need to just bite the
 bullet and do a full format anyway but I need to stretch things out for about a month or so before that's practical to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help me MicrosoftAnswers-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope...</p>

<p>
</p><p>- Nvidia is not alone in keeping the setup files for drivers. AMD does the same, but while
</p>
<p>I've never paid much attention to the DriverStore -</p>
<p>I see only 1.7GB in mine, atm and none are for Nvidia (btw my Win7 install goes back to Jan 2010).</p>
<p>Most are for AMD64. Hmm, curious...&nbsp; it's been almost a year since I changed from an AMD to Nvidia gpu,
</p>
<p>but by the look of it, a good deal of them are for my AMD chipset. </p>
<p>Some may be from the machine this Win7 install was on first, but I don't recall atm if it has</p>
<p>an AMD chipset.&nbsp; It's always had an Nvidia gpu though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not already aware of it, you will also find that both gpu mfg's unpack the files
</p>
<p>to a folder in C:\&nbsp; .</p>
<p>You can delete these files after installing the drivers, and recoup 100's of MB per driver</p>
<p>(512MB for Nvidia version 344.65). </p>
<p>If you have a lot of drivers unpacked here you could regain some GB's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- System Restore can suck up a lot of GB's too, depending on how you have it set-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- 'In this age of SSD's' you still also need a decent capacity HDD, or at very least a 120 GB SSD.</p>
<p>Unless of course, you enjoy frequently managing/moving files from the SSD to some other</p>
<p>storage device. Or maybe you use Cloud storage as default ?</p>
<p>- It is also advised to keep at least 10% free space, but some suggest as much a 20% on an SSD to</p>
<p>allow for dead/dying memory cells (I don't recall if TRIM requires free space as does defragmenting). Although dying memory cells may not be a big an issues as has been predicted since the advent of SSD's (according to a recent study, it's looking like the
 SSD's (maybe not the early one's) will handle heaps more writes than the predicted, maybe more than an HDD).</p>

<p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error can occur if there is a driver attempting to be installed on the system that was not signed by Microsoft digitally. Driver digital signatures help verify the integrity of the driver packages. To avoid this error, you need to disable the driver
 signature enforcement. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press and hold the <strong>Shift</strong> key then click <strong>Restart</strong> button.</li><li>Choose <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>, then select <strong>Advanced options. </strong>
</li><li>Select <strong>Startup Settings</strong> and click <strong>Restart. </strong>
</li><li>Once the computer restarts, you'll see a list of options. Press <strong>F7</strong> to select
<strong>Disable driver signature.</strong></li><li>Computer will now restart. Once done, check if the same error will occur. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome so we can provide further assistance. </p>

<p>laptop overheating.......CPU thermal paste may need a new application and and machine servicing will be needed. You may need a ask a friend or family member experienced enough....then for the "Hanging".....as vague as that was .....applications hang.....lag
 due to system errors, rootkits, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your cheapest bet is too find someone to handle it all on site at your home, or bring it to a local pc repair...that will be costly. They wont bother manually handling your software....they will upsell you a license for a new version of windows then another

<p>Check the vents for dust, hair, etc&nbsp;and do not use a Laptop when it is resting&nbsp;on material surfaces: bedspreads, blankets,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem persists, as it is a Laptop, take it to a local and reliable Computer Repair Shop and get them to open it up and clean the dust from inside it..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an interesting discussion about the varied reasons for your problem:</p>

<p>N.B&gt; However 9 out of 10 cases of overheating are caused by an airflow blockage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>_______________________________________________________</p>

            Hi Paperdoll350, <br />
<br />
Thanks for posting. When exactly does this happen? Are you trying to install or uninstall the application? It appears that the application you are having issues with is Word Point from Galtech. After researching I did not see a site for the company but I did
 see many places to download the application. Have you attempted to reinstall the applciation from another one of these sites?
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!

    <title>Windows 10 start menu tiles not saving changes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joel_jmi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 start menu tiles not saving changes</h2>
                    <p>First I will say the following, this is not a screen resolution issue so i will not be taking that as the solution to this problem, i have seen many MS "Experts" try to wash this off their backs by saying this is a PICNIC issue with the users resolution.
 I assure you this is not the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Laptop is a dell inspiron with <strong>Windows 10 Home</strong> installed, after the recent windows 10 update this laptop will now not remember the tiles set on the start menu after a restart. unfortunatly as this is a windows home machine i cannot try
 the group policy changes outlined by others online and I have already given this solution a go&nbsp;https://www.kapilarya.com/re-register-start-menu-windows-10.&nbsp; So now open to suggestions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rant: On a personal note I am getting very frustrated with windows 10 even though i am a windows 7 hold out, every time MS do an update I always i get inundated by colleagues, friends and family because something has broken after one of the updates. Microsoft
 has tried to make windows 10 idiot proof but in doing so they are causing the pros to go insane! - please tell me it's not just me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft if you're reading this, for the love of god, look back at Windows 7 , add some security updates and add linux support and just do that for your next os !&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player crossfading not working since upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Was no problem before but now, even with crossfade set to the max of 10 seconds it makes absolutely no difference: it gets to the end of a track, I get a high pitched little sound, and about a second later the next track will start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is highly annoying (especially for parties) and applies to all music stored on my hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone advise as to what's going on? Windows 10 bug?</p>

            Best way to do is through any file renamer utility. Microsoft Store has many free file renaming utilities. Just launch Microsoft Store and type rename and you get many options.

    <title>slower download speed onmy laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lakota peter  say:</h3>
<h2>            slower download speed onmy laptop</h2>
                    New (two weeks) to spectrum internet service.&nbsp; Desktop (W10) getting 200mbps on 2G wireless network. Toshiba laptop (W10) getting 30mbps on same network and closer to router.&nbsp; On Ethernet network laptop getting 90mbps. The HP desktop does not see the Ethernet
 network so I can't provide that comparison. Ethernet connection is modem to router to d-link switch all on cat 5 cable.&nbsp; I will test Ethernet speed directly connected to the router and to modem and update my post as I am now on the laptop and might lose connection
 to carry out that test before posting this.

            Hi Lakota
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type: 
<br />
<br />netsh int ip reset
<br />
<br />Hit Enter 
<br />Exit the prompt then restart
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down
<br />Click Network adapters
<br />Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />If that does not work
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network Adapters 
<br />Select the Network card listed,
<br />Select Update Driver
<br />This should give you a choice of drivers - select the oldest one 
<br />Wait a few minutes while it installs the old driver
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network adapters
<br />Right click your adapter
<br />Click Uninstall
<br />
<br />
<br />Exit Device Manager, restart. Windows 10 should detect the network adapter then reinstall it. Check if you can connect and browse.
<br />
<br />also try:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Status
<br />
<br />
<br />Scroll to the bottom then click Network reset.
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Wi-Fi &gt; Manage known networks &gt; select the wireless network
<br />Click Forget
<br />
<br />Restart
<br />
<br />Click the Network icon in the Taskbar
<br />Try connecting again.
<br />
<br />Disable Energy Efficient Ethernet in "Client for Microsoft Networks"
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager, expand Network Adapters, right-click the adapter &gt; Properties &gt; Power Management, and then clear the Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power check box.
<br />
<br />If you don't have that option, see other ways to disable it:

<br />
<br />If the network connection is slow or lagging, check if Windows 10 is downloading Windows Update or the Microsoft Store is downloading updates. These can sometimes affect the performance your network connection.
<br />
<br />If you have a VPN enabled, disable it.
<br />
<br />Disable the Windows Firewall then try connecting.
<br />

<p>I tried every recommendation made by Andre Da Costa with no change in th internet speed except that at the end of these the download speed had dropped by 10mbps.&nbsp; I did not try the DNS change as that seemed a bit extreme and not understanding all the consequences
 I elected to not make that change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks Andre for trying to help me.</p>

    <title>Orange Tinted Photos - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> claudiajhall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Orange Tinted Photos</h2>
                    <p>Hi, Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll start with the basics. I've had my Asus S300CA since June 2013. My Windows Photo Viewer has always had an orange tint, but I didn't use it much so I didn't think much of it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I haven't experienced any real problems until now.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A month and a half ago, I started a subscription to Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom. I am a photographer and was very excited to learn how to use these programs finally! But unfortunately, there was a very obvious tint difference once photos were imported.
 That meant that I couldn't effectively edit my photos. I searched endlessly for a solution, but no forum helped. I even tried what they said and saw no difference. I resorted to only using Lightroom to convert my RAW files to JPEG and then proceed to edit
 my photos on my old editor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*at this point it was only Adobe programs and my Windows Photo Viewer that had this problem*</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I finally updated to Windows 8.1. I guess Windows had had it with my rejection and updated on its own. I'd heard a lot of mixed things about it, so I didn't manually update. After the update, Adobe was working perfectly, no tint problems. I was
 so happy! But a few hours later, I went to Photoshop something and I noticed that the orange tint was back. Sigh. And when I went to Facebook, my photos had the same orange tint. I soon realized that every photo that was displayed, ANYWHERE on my computer,
 had an orange tint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't figure out for the life of me what is wrong (because 1. I don't understand computer language, and 2. I haven't found a thread that matches my problem)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me! As a photographer, I can't edit photos correctly if they aren't displayed correctly.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 email is stuck on &#34;sweeping or moving messages&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> quest32  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 email is stuck on &#34;sweeping or moving messages&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I am creating a new thread because I have already performed all of the other suggestions on other threads and they did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a month ago, I tried to save an email in a folder. &nbsp;Since that time, I keep getting an error message across the top of my email screen: &nbsp;"We're having trouble connecting to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. &nbsp;Sweeping or moving messages might take a while."
 &nbsp;I have to keep closing this error window because it obliterates any selections at the top of the page for responding to any mail that I receive. &nbsp;This error message is somehow tied to my junk mail folder. &nbsp;I always move unwanted emails to be deleted in the
 trash and cannot access my junk mail folder. &nbsp;It just buffers and spins -- forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have "removed" both of my Gmail accounts and finally my Hotmail account and started importing them all over again. &nbsp;That seemed to make things worse because Microsoft would not recognize my login so I had to create a temporary login and password,
 which really messed things up. &nbsp;I finally got my former login/password back and got rid of the temp login info, but I still keep getting the "sweeping" message over and over again. &nbsp;And I don't even know what "sweeping" is. &nbsp;It is not something I have chosen
 to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This situation reminds me of the Microsoft calendar situation about a year ago where it would not sync with my Hotmail account. &nbsp;This went on for about 10 months. &nbsp;The techs were apparently too busy with the final launch of Windows 10 and couldn't be bothered
 that none of us could get alerts for anything on our calendars. &nbsp;After putting up with that nonsense for two months, I just switched all of my calendar info to Google calendar. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read other threads and it doesn't seem like others have had any luck with eradicating this "sweeping" message. &nbsp;I don't know whether or not it will go away by itself, but it's already been over a month already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't "find a resolution." &nbsp;Microsoft finally corrected this issue about three months after it started. &nbsp;One day it just disappeared. &nbsp;I wonder why it is acting up again. &nbsp;Another temporary fix by Microsoft? &nbsp;I am not experiencing the problem right now,
 but I will definitely watch for it because it is very annoying and intrusive. &nbsp;Unless and until Microsoft fixes it, it is probably here to stay. &nbsp;Just keep complaining to Microsoft.</p>

<p>You will need 64-bit drivers for all your hardware. </p>
<p>Those drivərs may not all be available, especially if some of your hardware is a few years old.
</p>
<p>So it's possible that you might also have to replace things like your printer, scanner, etc.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, installing 64-bit Windows instead of 32-bit Windows makes you able to buy 64-bit software as it becomes available, instəad of the older 32-bit versions.
</p>
<p>That məans that installing 64-bit Windows--even though it may do very little for you at present--puts you into a better position for the future.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One additional point: the 64-bit version lets you use more than the approximately 3.1GB of RAM that the 32-bit version can use.
</p>
<p>Very fəw people need or can make effective use of more than 3.1GB, but if you are one of those who can, that's something else to consider.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you look around, you may be able to find an "Upgrade Advisor", or compatibility information, to help you in your decision.

    <title>Questions about the Advanced Exchange - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jlthestonewall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Questions about the Advanced Exchange</h2>
                    
<p>Because no-one answers question in any of the other sections. :P</p>

<p>The reason that I've made this thread is, despite some of my own comments on it, the fan noise my Xbox One makes is starting to gnaw at me a little bit (despite the fact that the noise does absolutely nothing to harm the console). It may even have gotten
 louder, but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>To put things in perspective, the average temperature of my house is +90 degrees Fahrenheit due to a broken air conditioner. The Xbox One manual says that the Xbox One operating temperature is from +41 degrees Fahrenheit to +95 degrees Fahrenheit. It could
 just be that the temperature of my house is taxing the Xbox One&nbsp;cooling system a little bit more.</p>
<p>Now, before you think of saying anything about dust, I clean my Xbox One before and after each use, and then put a dust cover on it when I'm not using it. Also, I know someone who, as far as I am aware, has not bothered to clean their Xbox One once; it runs
 whisper-quiet. This video is a good example of a similar noise difference: &nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY2CmUGIWv8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY2CmUGIWv8</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/dY2CmUGIWv8?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/dY2CmUGIWv8?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>1: I've heard mostly good things about the Advanced Exchange program. There is only one incident where the replacement console had the same issue as the original that I know of, and is found in this video.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1H1W4AXS0c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1H1W4AXS0c</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/e1H1W4AXS0c?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/e1H1W4AXS0c?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>I certainly wouldn't want to bother getting my Xbox One replaced if I end up with an equally annoying model. What do I do if that happens? Send the replacement back for yet another replacement?</p>
<p>2: Is there any chance that Microsoft could receive my original Xbox One after I send it in, wait for the remainder of 14 days to run out, and then claim they never received it, just to charge me $400? How would I know if they were lying about it? And even
 if I did, what could I do about it?</p>
<p>3: This is more of a point about hesitation than a question. If I got my Xbox One replaced, I would have to re-download all of the updates and all of my games. This part is a huge bummer, particularly because I own The Master Chief Collection, which took
 me six hours to originally download; and&nbsp;that doesn't even include ODST. This by itself almost outweighs any benefit of a quieter console, at least for me.</p>

<p>I think that's about it. Any replies are greatly appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>OP, I have had 3 consoles (X1) replaced on the Advanced Exchange program. It is a great service! Yes, you will have to start fresh with the new console, but a couple hours/overnight of downloads vs a dud console is an easy decision. &nbsp;2 day turn around....
 &nbsp;great service by MS! Just make sure you follow the rules.... &nbsp;don't mess around sending your dud console back.... &nbsp;you have equal responsibility in this process..... and make sure all disc's are removed form the console before you ship t back... LOL.... (memories)....</p>

<p>Thanks. That reinforces the mostly good feedback I've heard on it. My console functions fine, I couldn't really call it a dud, it's just rather noisy.

<p>@kingvas78: On second thought, your comment is somewhat of a double-edged sword. If you had to get three consoles replaced via the advanced exchange, then it sounds as if Microsoft was sending you dodgy consoles. Did they all develop problems?

<p>Not quite sure myself JL, but I'll try to answer. </p>
<p>1. Yeah, probably till they give you a good one! </p>
<p>2. That would be pretty dooshy of them, I don't think they would. </p>
<p>3. Yeah, you have to re-download everything! </p>
<p>I also had one small question. Is the advanced exchange something you do when your warranty runs out or can you do it anytime when your Xbox is messing up? I'll have 2 years left on my warranty next month.

<p>Get the exchange, for sending in your console for repair can take some time (Weeks even) and if Xbox repair centers are anything like they were back in 2002.
</p>
<p>You're likely to get back a console with more problems than it left with. </p>
<p>And they don't extend your warranty by those day's/weeks that your system was out for repair. So your actually loosing warranted time by sending in for repairs as well.
</p>
<p>So the best way to go is via the exchange services IMO. </p>

<p>If you have a Microsoft store in your area, bring it there and you will walk out the door with a working console. That's what I did a year ago, mine had a bad disc drive. I also purchased a extended warranty that covers the Kinect and controller. (also purchased
 a game when I was there LOL) It was a easy process. They hooked up mine and it was making a grinding noise and the worker said that's good enough for me. I'll get you a new one. About an hour later from when I first walked in I was driving home with my new
 (to me) Xbox One. &nbsp;Easy Breezy. </p>
<p>Good luck. </p>

<p>I don't believe I have a Microsoft store in my area, although I can check. I don't intend to get it serviced, either, too many horror stories.
</p>
<p>I've investigated the noise further, and I have reason it may not actually be just the fan, but a combination of the fan and the HDD. My console is whisper quiet when I'm not playing games. It's whisper quiet even when I'm simply updating a game, or running
 an app, but the fan area does get somewhat noisy whenever I actually play a game. Furthermore, the noise is different depending on what game I'm playing. So it could be the HDD.. but I really have no way of telling.
</p>
<p>Let me reiterate, however, that I have experienced no functionality or gameplay issues. Well, other than what is the norm for the Xbox One's occasionally glitchy OS. This is consistent with Microsoft's statement a while back that such noises as I am describing
 don't cause the console any harm. </p>

<p>@GhostRider2k2: I purchased my Xbox One almost a year ago, and it was not from a Microsoft Store. I have about two months left on my Warranty, and after reading through the conditions required for you to exchange or return &nbsp;a device at the Microsoft Store,
 it doesn't sound like I'm eligible. Did you get your original Xbox One from a Microsoft Store?

<h2>            Can I swap Windows 7 product keys &#40;license&#41; between desktop and laptop&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have two win7 ultimate licenses A and B.&nbsp;B has more restriction than A.&nbsp;Days ago I&nbsp;use&nbsp;license A to&nbsp;upgrade and activate one of my desktops Desktop_A. But now I would like to use license A on&nbsp;a Macbook; and use license B on Desktop_A. Is it possible to
 swap the product keys between two machines? <br />
<br />
Or do i have to uninstall win7 on Desktop_A in order to "unlock" license A? If so, how to uninstall (Win7 OS is on C: partition of the hard disk)? Format the C: drive?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

            Shouldn't be a problem, just click Start, right click Computer, click Properties &gt; scroll down, under Windows Activation, click&nbsp; the Change Product key link, and enter your key for the Windows 7 Ultimate B license, then proceed with installing license
 A on the Macbook. Please note, you will have to reactivate both using the automated phone system because they were already in use:<br />
<br />
Activate Windows 7 manually:<br />
1. Click Start, and in the Search box type :&nbsp; slui.exe 4<br />
<br />
2. Press ENTER on your Keyboard<br />
<br />
3. Select your Country.<br />
4. Select the Phone Activation option, and hold on for a real person. <br />

<h2>            RE Visual C&#43;&#43; 2010 - Missing MSVCP100.dll and MSVCR100.dll after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>I followed the instructions from Joanna 777 Jan 31/2017 to Gilbert_11 but found only Visual C++2012 on the Microsoft link (not 2010 I was looking for).</p>
<p>According to her instructions I would download "Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Update 3" being the latest free update?</p>
<p>I bought a new laptop a year ago and it has 2005, 2008 and 2010 on it.</p>
<p>I uninstalled 2010 and reinstalled the 2010 with the security update (which I found on the Microsoft website after digging) and my problem of the missing .dll is now basically fixed.</p>
<p>But in light of the malware attacks on the weekend I am wondering if I should update to 2015?
</p>
<p>Do I stick with 2010 as this was the latest version I have/had on my laptop?</p>

<p>Hello Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x64) as you recommended.&nbsp; It installed successfully, but the three errors remained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I installed the 32 bit version, Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package (x86).&nbsp; It installed successfully.&nbsp; This, 32 bit version of the update, did fix all of the errors and I am now able to run all of the Adobe CS6 Master Collection
 programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your quick response and resolution to fix the problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

    <title>Icons of some running programs are pixellated in the taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lokonji  say:</h3>
<h2>            Icons of some running programs are pixellated in the taskbar</h2>
                    <p>I just reset my Surface Pro and spent a bit of time messing about with the DPI settings before deciding to keep them at default.</p>
<p>However, a problem has developed which wasn't there before I started changing the settings, nor before I reset it.</p>
<p>I've only noticed this with chrome and spotify. When they are running, their icons are very pixelated, as if a low quality graphic has been stretched to 200%.</p>
<p>When pinned, the icons look fine, but even the pinned programs become pixelated when opened.</p>
<p>I've tried google. Any idea how to get smooth icons back?</p>

            <p>Hi Lokonji,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the DPI scale feature for the display settings have changed on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the issue specific to Spotify and Google Chrome? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to change the DPI scale level under Personalize settings and check if it fixes the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps listed below to do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right Click on the desktop screen and select <strong>Personalize</strong>. </li><li>Click on Display. Check the box that says “<strong>Let me choose one scaling level for all my displays</strong>”. Choose the
<strong>default </strong>DPI scale as per your screen size. </li><li><strong>Sign-out </strong>and sign-in again to the user account. </li></ul>
<p>Check if it fixes the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, see if changing the screen resolution resolves the issue. Refer to the link to do so:</p>

            <p>Hi Pinaki,</p>
<p>I'm afraid those steps are not quite relevant. I should have provided more detail in the first post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had spotify and chrome installed, and at this point the display settings were default and the icons looked fine.</p>
<p>I then changed to 100% DPI just to see what it was like. Obviously everything became smaller, but the icons looked fine.</p>
<p>I decided against 100% DPI and switched back to default settings. At this point, the icons started appearing pixellated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i switch back to 100% DPI the icons look fine again, but everything's way too small. I also don't want to lower the resolution of the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently on all default settings and I'm getting the pixelation. But initially, before I changed any settings, they looked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spotify and Chrome are the only applications I've noticed having this error.</p>

            <p>Hi Lokonji,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall both the applications and check if it fixes the issue. Follow the steps to do so:</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Make suer that you have the setup file for the applications before following the steps.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows+X </strong>keys and select <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.
</li><li>Locate Google Chrome and right click on it. Select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li><li>Follow the onscreen instructions. Follow the same steps to uninstall Spotify.
</li><li>Locate the folder that has the setup file for Google Chrome and double click on the setup. Follow the onscreen instructions. Do the same for Spotify.</li></ul>
<p>Check if reinstalling the applications fixes the issue. </p>

            <p>I have a similar issue with an application that I developed. The icon for my application makes use of the alpha channel to smooth jaggies around the edges. As best as I can determine the taskbar is sometimes not correctly rendering the alpha channel. After
 a reboot the icon in the taskbar is good, but it eventually always ends up choppy looking.</p>

<h2>            How do I restore to a previous date when I go to assessories and system tool and restore is not there&#63;</h2>
                    I downloaded "System Tweeker" and I hit a button about restore and now I have lost a lot of stuff. Don't download it.

            <p>I understand you do not see System Restore under System Tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try what has been mentioned, and if you are still not able to access system restore, try navigating to this location:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS\system32\Restore</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply highlight the entire line above, copy and paste it into the Address Bar of
</p>
<p>"My Computer" </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should see "rstrui.exe" in the window. May&nbsp;need to scroll to see it.&nbsp;Click it and you should be able to use System Restore.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For future easy access to it,&nbsp;make a shortcut to it and put it at "C:\Documents and Settings\XXXX\Start Menu\Programs\Accessories\System Tools" - where XXXX is replaced with your username. ie login name "melody" means username is melody.</p>
