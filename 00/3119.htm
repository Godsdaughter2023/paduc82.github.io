<h2>            Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8, cannot receive Skype calls</h2>
                    <p>I just got a Kindle Fire HD 8. &nbsp;I know they're supposed to be shipping with Skype but oddly mine did not, I guess I got slightly old stock or something. &nbsp;Anyway, installed Skype from the Amazon Ap store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My contacts have accepted, I've accepted them, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the Kindle Fire, I can:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Send IMs</p>
<p>Receive IMs</p>
<p>Send audio calls</p>
<p>Send video calls</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot receive either audio or video calls. &nbsp;It doesn't even notify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Skype settings are "receive IMs from contacts only", and "receive calls from contacts only". &nbsp;Though I have tried changing this to "everyone" with no effect. &nbsp;Skype notifications are on. &nbsp;I notice when I tap "test push notifications" I do get an error
 stating my device cannot receive push notifications at this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... to the Android OS settings...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype Ap notifications are turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Android OS settings for notifications, Skype is set to priority.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Android OS manage notification listeners... there... aren't any listeners and no option to add them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and re-installed 4 times over about 5 days...</p>
<p>
</p><p>............... aaaaand I'm out of ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be very greatly appreciated. &nbsp;Thank you!</p>

I have exactly the same problem, followed the same steps described by JustNave and am out of options. This is very frustrating. Please share your instructions with me. Thanks.

<p>Soon as I do the chat I'll be happy to. &nbsp;Am in the middle of working on something right now, probably won't get to the chat until tomorrow unfortunately, but I'll keep you posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep thinking it's either:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The contacts have not been given permission to use cam ON THIS SPECIFIC DEVICE (although for the life of me I cannot find an option in the contacts that allows this... I've looked several times)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Something to do with the fact that TEST PUSH NOTIFICATIONS fails... which would... I guess mean there's no push notification hook from Skype into the operating system... which would be a Skype problem... unless you're supposed to download some kind of
 a notification listener to go with it and link it in in some fashion... if this is the case it might explain why the tablets that ship with Skype pre-installed would (I presume???) work... they'd have done that already... somehow...</p>

            Karen, please let all of us know about the resolution of this problem - Skype 7.36 not working any longer on Amazon Fire tablets. &nbsp;Has the problem been determined? &nbsp;Is Microsoft working on a solution?

<p>Hi Karen_[01],</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to set it up on 2 Fires and having the same problem as JustNave. Both are running latest OS 5.4.0.1</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>New 2017 Kindle Fire HD 8, 7th&nbsp;generation (did not come with Skype on it)</li><li>Kindle Fire 7, 5th generation</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Cannot receive calls on either. With each Fire it seemed to be making the call, but neither could receive it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also did a test&nbsp;from&nbsp;the Fire 7 to Skype on iPhone. Had no problem <em>sending</em> the call to iPhone — it came through on the iPhone and the video/audio worked on both. But would not work the other way — sending a call
<em>from </em>the iPhone to the Fire resulted in "Call Failed." Consistently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have done all the usual troubleshooting, uninstall, reinstall, reboot, etc. Spent 2 hrs on phone with 3 techs at Amazon support. They tried their best, but all said it was a Skype issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>So... I promised I'd get back with a resolution...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the live chat support page was down. &nbsp;Maybe due to holiday. &nbsp;In any event... this is kind of mission critical to me, I need this working... unfortunately like... now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloaded Vsee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to be free...</p>
<p>
</p><p>No issues so far. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see this as more of a temporary solution, it's much... less... feature rich but it just works so far. &nbsp;Hopefully this can be resolved at some point and we can all go back to being happy Skype users...</p>
<p>
</p><p>But just telling you, if you need something RIGHT NOW... like I unfortunately do...</p>
<p>
</p><p>No problems with it at present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will say this about it, the notification ring sound is very poor, can't find a way to change that. &nbsp;You can crank the volume with the physical buttons at the top of your Fire HD but it's still pretty poor. &nbsp;Unless you have it right on you, you likely won't
 hear it. &nbsp;I'm also not sure how long in sleep mode before it signs you out. &nbsp;Experimenting with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it's on the Amazon store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figure I'll put it in service with this and swap over to Skype when it works. &nbsp;It's that or drop $250 on a Samsung and that's not my favorite option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I'm only dealing with one contact... so... if you have many this... is going to be painful...</p>
<p>

<h2>            Excel do not calculate same results in Goal Seek</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem, when calculating in Excel. I have an assignment at my university I need to make, and my groupmembers calculated the same thing, and everyone gets the same results when using Solver, however, I don not get anything close to their results.
 We checked that everything was excatly the same and also controlled the settings, which is the same. But I still couldn't get the same results as my group. I was hoping to get some help with this problem, because I need to use it often in my study, and it
 would be nice to get the correct answers, when taking my exam. I uploaded a screenshot of my groupmates results (right) and my results (left) and the difference marked with red.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used the What-If analysis -&gt; goal seek, given cell is both the formula, we want it to have a value of 0 and the cell that should change is the q.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi MichelleAndersen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the screenshot you provided, I find that the numbers are only a little bit different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I check the data in your table and I find that the data in some columns has different decimal places.</p>
<p>For example, "Ci", "C*", "Kt", "left", "right", "q" and "formula".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try to change the deciml places the same as your group members' to see the result:</p>
<p>Select the cell&gt; Right click&gt; Format Cells...&gt; Number&gt; Change decimal places.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, please capture a screenshot of your Office product name and version refer to this article:

<p>Hi Gloria</p>
<p>
</p><p>I check with the decimals and everything. And I found out that, one of my classmates also calculates the same results as I do. We are both Danish students, and my groupmembers are all chinese students. I think that may have an influence somehow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Michelle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I would like to suggest you update your Office applications to the latest version to get bug fixes and new features released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I need to confirm if you have changed the decimal places.</p>
<p>Different regions will affect writing number in Excel, so the different numbers will affect the calculation result in Solver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Gloria</p>

<p>Hi Gloria</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I tried with the decimal places, and checked if the update was the newest one, but I still got a different result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to delete the office package and reinstall it again, but I still had the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The different results can be due to the different regions? - Our proffesor also got the results my chinese students got, and I think he got his computer in Denmark, but his systems is set to english. I tried to set my Office to english, but I don't know
 how to change it. I tried to change the language in the setting to english, but I continues to stay on danish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Michelle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to my test, the file which has the correct result is using O36 as Objective cell and I36 as Variable Cells and when I test with O4/O5 and I4/I5, it shows #DIV/0! error. It seems that if there is a negative number in "column I" (the value of q),
 it will show #DIV/0! error after solving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to confirm how you solve the FWS_BOD table (you mark as red). If the solver affects the value of "q" (your column J), then we need to focus on this column next.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tested to change your value of q the same as the one in the correct table and it seems that the result is the same after change the decimal places.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/999ad290-4fbd-45b0-a547-d879dfdcbca9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/999ad290-4fbd-45b0-a547-d879dfdcbca9?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>So the point I need to confirm now is how you get the value of "q".</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Gloria</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first set q as 1, to have a value, then I used solver to 'isolate/change' the value of q, to get the formula as close to zero as possible, because the equation used is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c-c*) / (ci-c*) = 1 / (1+k / Pq)^P</p>
<p>I have all values exepct the q. I set the formula to left side minus the right, as these two should be equal to zero, because they should be the same. To get the q we used solver and set objective to the formula O4/O5, the value to 0 by changing the cell
 with q.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

<p>Hi Dana</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what you mean that you asked about this equation twice.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But I you are asking what the equation used I used the equation:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>(c-c*) / (ci-c*) = 1 / (1+k / Pq)^P</span></p>
<p><span>where&nbsp;</span><span>(c-c*) / (ci-c*) correspond to the left and&nbsp;</span><span>1 / (1+k / Pq)^P correspond to the right, the formula is left - right, which
 should be as close to zero as possible. I started by using a q value of 1, just to have on so that I could calculate the right side without errors. Then using the solver, so that it could calculate the q for me.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Hope this makes sense, but the thing you sent me:</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debug.Print FindQ(15, 29.33684, 442.1052632, 233.5114, 1)<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Function FindQ(c, cs, ci, k, p)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim t<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t = ((c - cs) / (ci - cs)) ^ p<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t = 1 / (1 - t) - 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FindQ = k * t / p<br />
End Function</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Returns:</p>

    <title>64bit Excel 2010 appcrash vbe7.dll - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clutch125  say:</h3>
<h2>            64bit Excel 2010 appcrash vbe7.dll</h2>
                    <p>Sorry for the long post but this issue has me at wits end.</p>
<p>I have a rather large (600mb) Excel spreadsheet in MyDocuments which first started crashing about a week ago. The workbook is made up of five main sheets, each sheet is named after a year going back to 2007 and these sheets each contain approx 450,000 rows
 and maybe 20 columns of data. There are also 4 pivot tables each with a couple of fields and a few small misc sheets (one sheet hidden not password protected), a single small form and maybe a half dozen vba modules several of which are approx between 100-200k.
 Problem first manifested when I imported some new data, closed the form, saved the workbook, copied the workbook off to an external hd (as a backup) and then renamed the source file. When subsequently trying to open the renamed file I received the appcrash
 on vbe7.dll. Continued attempts to open the file and/ or repair the file upon opening fail.&nbsp; My only choice is to then delete the file and restore a backup copy of the file -- this known good backup will open. I have tried all sorts of suggestions but none
 seem to work for very long, inevitably the appcrash rears its head.</p>
<p>I thought I was onto something last night when I had the file in the unusable state where it would not open without crashing. I then uninstalled SP1 for Office 2010 and uninstalled update kb 2553385 which pertains to vbe7.dll.&nbsp; After the uninstallation of
 those items the file could be opened without issue. I spent several hours working with the file extensively last night, saving and re-opening without any issue whatsoever. Then this morning I copied the file off as a backup satisfied that I finally had another
 known good backup.&nbsp; I renamed the source file and tried to open it, again appcrash on vbe7.dll!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Any ideas?&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously something about uninstalling SP1 temporarily 'fixed' things but only temporarily.&nbsp; Does this point to some type of registry issue? Like maybe a portion of the registry is cleaned out or reset and then some series of actions with this
 large file causes some 'bad' registry entries? </p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Mike</p>

            <p>I know that not everyone has this option, but I use Windows 7/Excel 2010 on a virtual machine so that I can use the full 4Gb of memory on the machine not the 2Gb that XP limited me to. I still have access to WinXP too though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have about 20 workbooks saved on a network drive each of which are opened, refreshed and closed by a 'Master' workbook,&nbsp;residing on the virtual machine,&nbsp;overnight. Most of those 'Child' workbooks are simple xlsx ones but a few have their own macros for
 self serving a limited&nbsp;amount of data retrieved from the database should anyone not have been running on Win 7 at the time those macros were created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, after 2 years of running in this scenario&nbsp;I suddenly started (May 2014) getting the dreaded AppCrash error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It only affected the xlsm extension files, not the xlsx. It also affected them in different ways.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some would crash upon&nbsp;opening and others would crash after their update but whilst saving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The VBA in the master workbook could not pick up any error code in order to debug when this AppCrash happened either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily I still had Excel 2007 running on WinXP so all I had to do to resolve the situation was open the file on the WinXP box, save it as another file, rename it to the original and open again in Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I don't allow automatic updates of Windows, I know that there were no updates that had introduced this problem for me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever the cause, once the file had been opened and saved within XP the AppCrash event&nbsp;stopped. What this tells me is that there is something going on within these files, not within Excel itself. I can prove this, as by saving the crashing files in their
 'untouched by WinXP' state, I can re-create the AppCrash issue simply by opening those files back up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried running Excel&nbsp;in compatibility mode (Vista SP2, Vista SP1 and Vista) and opening the 'crashing' files but they crash the same as if in Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone may find this info useful and find a way to help people who encounter this and who don'y have XP running!</p>

            <p>Can you find the Search app in your Start Page? That magnifying glass like Sherlock Holmes used to cart around? Click that and type Internet Explorer then right click that (You'll probably only have to type the first three letters) and click "Pin to Start."
 That should solve it. </p>

</p><p>This second symptom is unclear IMO.&nbsp; E.g. if "IE app" means "Desktop IE" it should certainly have a Taskbar button which would represent it, although it would not have to be a pinned item and therefore would only appear there as appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>In any case, provided iexplore.exe is available to be run you don't need to have any shortcuts about it to do that.&nbsp; Just go into your Start menu and start typing iexplore.exe&nbsp;&nbsp;or press Win-R&nbsp; to get into the Run... dialog and do the same thing, although
 in that case you would need to type the whole thing to get a match unless you have previously entered that string there, in which case using that option&nbsp;could be even faster.</p>

<p><em>WELCOME! @</em><strong><em>Siddarth DM :</em></strong>&nbsp;Try this&nbsp;solution. You can't find the [IE-icon on the START-Tiles page]. So you say that&nbsp;open the IE-From the desktop..I guess you mean from the (<em><strong>Taskbar</strong></em>-Located on the

<h2>            Searching for templates in different languages</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
I'm using Word 365 with the Russian localization. Sometimes I need templates specific for certain languages, for example CV (there is a Russian analog, but it has weird structure and text styles).<br />
The question is, how could I extend the search, so the results related to different languages were included?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.

            <p>I wasn't able to find a solution for template searches within Word. It seems to only respond with results from your installed language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you search for Microsoft templates on their web site, the browser address bar can be modified to give you results from other languages. Here is the English URL:&nbsp;<strong>https://templates.office.com/<em>en-us</em>/templates-for-Word</strong>. Note how
 the address includes an IETF language code. With many Microsoft pages, you can get the same information in a different language by just replacing that code with a different one. Here is the URL for French templates:&nbsp;https://templates.office.com/<strong>fr-FR</strong>/templates-for-Word</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Microsoft page has all the language codes they use: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee825488%28v=cs.20%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Table of Language Culture Names, Codes, and ISO Values</a>. Just look up the code for the language you want and paste it into the URL. If you get a
<em>404 Page Not Found</em> error, they don't have a page for that language.</p>

<h2>            Phone sees all other WLAN &#40;WIFI&#41; AP from neighbors but not mine although SSID is shown &#40;pc, iphone have access&#41;, since last update</h2>
                    Manuf: HTC 7 Trophy, mobile op.:swisscom, WP: 7.10 (7740), Zune: 4.8.2345.0, PC: Win7 Enterpr. SP1.

<div>Phone sees all other WLAN (WIFI) AP (access points) from neighbors, hotels etc. but no longer mine although SSID is visible (not hidden), WPA2-PSK, AES, 802b+g, since last update (all other PC incl. iPhone can connect).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When choosing advanced the SSID appeared there as a known network, but the phone could not connect also when it got ticked. Then I trashed that one, so I could re-add the WLAN, but the SSID does still not appear in the list and manual adding leads to a
 connection failure.</div>
<div>I then further removed the security (unsecured) and changed the name of the SSID but the phone still did not list that AP.</div>

            <p>If the last update was a HTC firmware update that enabled WiFi Internet Tethering then you could be having an issue with the MAC address changing upon reboot, this is a known bug.</p>
<p>I would also reset your network wifi router/modem as well.</p>
<p>Check your MAC address before rebooting and again after it has rebooted and see if the MAC addresses are different.</p>
<p>If the changing MAC address is causing your problem you can either rollback the update and wait for HTC to issue a fix or if you have MAC address filtering turned on in your router/modem turn if off.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

            <p>Many kind thanks for the very usefull hints!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed the MAC address of the phone has changed after reboot, which is a little bit unusual...</p>
<p>However I had no MAC address filtering in place and the new MAC address did not conflict with exsiting devices on the network so far.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have rebooted the AP and the router several times, so it had a chance to reassociate the mac addresses to IP addresses. Further I managed to connect to another AP without any problem. but my orignal AP is still not recognized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It unfortunately seems that the phone does not recognize the SSID it once knew and hence does not offer (entering field for access key) or try to establish any connection to the AP. In some way, a method would have to found to fully delete the orignal AP
 in the phone and then set it up again. Any ideas on that one?</p>
<p>Rolling back is a pain, so I try to avoid it for now.</p>

            <p>Already done&nbsp;that, it no longer appears in any of the lists. But it also or still does not appear in the WiFi (WLAN) list where it allows for a connection to be set up, like the AP does not exist. On the iPhone and on Win7 PCs it appears and can be selected

            <p>I rolled back after all as there was no other obvious way of resolving the problem apart from buying a new AP or a new phone.<br />
The phone then had its orignal MAC address starting with 7c-61-93... and recognized my AP imediately.</p>
<p>So I then deleted my AP from the rolled back version to make it ready to connect to any AP available.</p>
<p>Then I (re-)updated the phone. It again changed to a MAC address starting with 00:18:41... (not in the vendor list below)<br />
Now I checked whether the AP was now visible and connectable.<br />
But no success, I had to roll back again.</p>
<p>HTC MAC address vendor codes as listed on the internet:</p>
<p>00:09:2D<br />
00:23:76<br />

<p>Thank you bitslave for mentioning the MAC address problem. That is most certainly a bug from HTC. However I am surprised that it would cause such problem as not seeing the old AP it once connected to before wtihout any problems and no MAC filtering in place
 what so ever.</p>
<p>It would be kind of nice if HTC could post here, when it has fixed these problems. THe update should be held back until then.</p>

            <p>One last thing&nbsp;you could&nbsp;try would be changing the AP channel id and see if that makes a difference.</p>
<p>If you have an 'auto' channel selection option try that if not then just try another channel.</p>

            <p>Hi bitslave: CONGRATULATIONS - That is excellent thinking - THANKS!</p>
<p>My AP was on channel 13. So I changed it to a channel below 12. And YES, it now can connect to the AP again :-))</p>
<p>It is also mentioned&nbsp;(just saw it tonight) in a slightly different form in a German forum on
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/de-de/winphone/forum/wp7-sync/findet-mein-wlan-nach-update-nicht-mehr/a91b8518-c124-4972-800f-ae2de063097a?tab=MoreHelp">
http://answers.microsoft.com/de-de/winphone/forum/wp7-sync/findet-mein-wlan-nach-update-nicht-mehr/a91b8518-c124-4972-800f-ae2de063097a?tab=MoreHelp</a>&nbsp;as more people have this problem since the update.</p>
<p>As it looks, HTC may have permanently reserved channels for tethering and is hence blind on these channels to recognize any other APs, even if tethering is turned off (which it was in my case).</p>
<p>But even if this works for the time beeing, this would mean that the phone cannot i.e. recognize any APs on channels 12+13 (e.g. Hotels, Airports, Stations) - I travel quite frequently, so this new HTC "blind spot feature" is pretty useless and causes odd
 situations.</p>
<p>So it MUST be fixed from the HTC vendor side VERY SOON or I need another phone with a different OS (Operating System).</p>
<p>This exercise was quite a WASTE of valuable TIME. I would have rather missed out on the tethering option if it is that difficult to implement and test it well. Besides this, it does not help to spread WP7 either, although I really think that it is a very
 good, well thought through concept with a pretty intuitive user interface.</p>

            <p>Good to see you now have it working again, </p>
<p>Regarding channels 12 and 13, the IEEE 802.11 workgroup recommends&nbsp;that countries outside the U.S.&nbsp;use&nbsp;802.11g channels 1,5,9 and 13, however channel 5 and 11 still seem to be often used channels.</p>

<h2>            Nokia X2 Android&#58; MicroSD card 32GB not visible on computer</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Had a problem with my 32GB MicroSD so formatted it and stuck it back in the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After this I can no longer see it on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone seems to see it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...and the computer used to see it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sticking the MicroSD card in a card reader every time you want to download something is annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have some suggestions on how to make the card visible to the computer while it's in the phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1) Clicked the MTP option (was set to camera option) under USB settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Turned the USB diagnostics on (under developer settings)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the card appeared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Probably the MTP option that did the trick... as the computer was stuck trying to find the MTP driver.</p>

<h2>            Lost photos from OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just realized that all my photos taken prior to May 2014 are missing . Though they were saved under OneDrive . I haven't deleted nor moved them. They are not in the trash bin , where I found some photos previously deleted , but not the ones I am looking
 for. Where did they go ? These are pictures full of memories I care immensely.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I restore lost pictures that were saved in OneDrive ?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance .<br />

</p><p>I understand that you referring to OneDrive on your pc? if that is the case I would suggest you to get in touch with OneDrive Support directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you saved those photos on any other device? for example on a Windows Phone?, in which case you should be able to re-sync them via Microsoft Account, or transfer them manually to pc and from there upload it&nbsp;to OneDrive.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Messy font issue continues.</h2>
                    <p>Just got pack to Win 7, cause this scruffy font problem&nbsp;is simple&nbsp;too disturbing,&nbsp;almost get&nbsp;the eyes strained. Got tired trying changing settings,</p>
<p>cause didn't any help.&nbsp;After changing Win 7, my eyes&nbsp;can rest again, now can I see a huge difference. Win 7 fonts&nbsp;looks razor sharp, even&nbsp;the font isn't so dark and&nbsp;IMMEDIATELY without changing any settings,&nbsp;straight from the old installing DVD (first vers.
 bought 2009, without SP1).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have question or request&nbsp;to Microsoft engineers,&nbsp;since you must have be aware of that problem from 8.1 (I've heard). Can I trust, that this scruffy&nbsp;font issue&nbsp;will be fixed at least for the final version if not for the commercial preview? I'm not technical
 person, but why don't&nbsp;copy win 7 font settings,&nbsp;rendering etc.&nbsp;straight&nbsp;to win 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until that I'm sticking with Win 7, which is quite shame, cause otherwise 10 worked quite well in my PC in&nbsp;one week experience,
</p>
<p>like&nbsp;fast booting (mostly) and fast and easy OneDrive access. </p>

            <p>No! Having been asked that graphics card-issue over and over again, tried all basic-stuff&nbsp;from card drivers (GF 8800&nbsp;GT/win 10 general drivers) to settings (DPI etc.), so please don't ask that drivers-thing anymore. :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Coming conclusion, could also be the browser like&nbsp;IE 11, cause when using now Win 7, I&nbsp;upgraded it from the old IE 8 (in original Win 7 installation DVD) over again, text became a little more unsharp like in Win 10.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I am using my work computer, and I cannot get to make IFS to work.</p>
<p>I have Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016 on my computer, but we also have Office365 account&nbsp;as well.&nbsp; We have access to office365.ourworkdomain&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>It's very&nbsp;long, but to simplify, I'm trying to enter IFS formula in B2 to say&nbsp;</p>
<p>If A1 is blank, EB2 would be "Apple or Carrot"&nbsp;, if A1 is "Monkey", B1 would be "Apple", If A1 is "Horse", B1 would be "Carrot". IF A1 is none of these, "Apple or Carrot".&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Angela,
<br />
<br />I think the tricky part is that for the "else" clause you need to put true there - 
<br />
<br />so back to your question - 
<br />
<br />can you please try:
<br />
<br />B2 = IFS(ISBLANK(A1), "Apple or Carrot", A1="Monkey", "Apple", A1="Horse", "Carrot", True, "Apple or Carrot")
<br />
<br />Does this help with your question?

            Hi Angela
<br />
<br />The first thing to understand about Excel is you cannot set the value of another cell using a formula . . .
<br />
<br />The Formula must be in the cell you want the value displayed in
<br />
<br />So, if you want the result to be in B1, this formula must be in B1, if you want the result in B2, this formula must be in B2 . . 
<br />
<br />=IF(A1="Monkey","Apple",IF(A1="Horse","Carrot","Apple or Carrot"))
<br />
<br />Since you are running Excel 2016, you cannot get the IFS formula, because it is not in that version
<br />
<br />To build up a complex IF statement is easy anyway, you just keep replacing the false parameter with another IF statement
<br />
<br />=IF(A1="Monkey","Apple", FALSE)
<br />
<br />=IF(A1="Monkey","Apple",IF(A1="Horse","Carrot","Apple or Carrot"))

<p>Thank you so much.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't know why I couldn't think of the last part. It helped :)</p>
<p>Is there any way for me to add 4 or 5 conditions to that if formula? (if a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, c=5, else = "1~10") is there a maximum number I can add?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you elaborate more on, "<span>Since you are running Excel 2016, you cannot get the IFS formula, because it is not in that version"?</span></p>
<p><span>Is there any way I can get a version with IFS function? which version would that be?</span></p>

<p>One more random question. When I log into this forum, I could not get back to this post. I took me forever to dig into my inbox to find an email with your reply to find this post. Is there an easy way for me to find my post? (When I click on top right corner,
 there are only "view account" and "my profile" options...)</p>

<h2>            windows 10 feb 2018 preview build 17093, 1000 will not boot from the hard drive</h2>
                    <p>The build installs seems to work okay. I can reboot the pc with no problem. When I shutdown the pc and restart it later all I get is the ASUS computer screen with the F2 option to enter the bios. The screen goes blank, the pc turns off, a few seconds later
 it turns back on again. It's an on and off loop. I can boot the OS from my windows 10 USB stick only.</p>

<p>I got good news! And a little bad news but not so bad. I, with some help from on online tech talked me through the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After being able to boot through the DVD, he talked me through having to install windows 10 all over again with the 16299 iso. Al my files and folders were intact.</p>
<p>The bad news is that I tried to get on the slow ring and 17074 was waiting. However it wouldn't install so I went back to the fast ring and there was 17093 waiting. I felt like a lamb going to the slaughterhouse as some of the older generation would say.
 I ended up reinstalling it. Had a bit of a rough time recovering stuff though but I got them all back. I took your advice and unchecked the fast start up button.</p>
<p>Today, 17093 is up and running, little or no issues, except the yellow exclamation mark over windows security center. Ran malawarebytes and did a quick virus scan. Came back negative. For the most part I'm up and running. The mouse acts a little weird though.
 We'll see what happens but I'm gonna try to make an iso for 17093 should in case; Godforbid something like this should happen again. But at least I'll have a better idea of what to do.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your patience and help guys even though I was a bit of a pain in the butt.</p>

    <title>Cannot Edit Powerpoint - Saved Slides as Pictures - Tried Saving as - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heatherdrey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Edit Powerpoint - Saved Slides as Pictures - Tried Saving as ppt and pptx NEED HELP PLEASE</h2>
                    I just worked for weeks on a powerpoint presentation to defend my dissertation that is due in a day or two and I saved multiple versions of it just to be sure I had several copies (i.e., Powerpoint 97-2003 Presentation, Microsoft Powerpoint Presentation,
 tried selecting the make it compatible button to see what that did). Now, I have a super old version that is editable but has one-third of what I need and it is saved as a Powerpoint 97-2003 Presentation. My almost complete presentation is saved as the same
 type of file but when I try to select the text a warning pops up asking what I want to do with the picture?! Every slide is a picture I cannot edit! This seemed to happen when I added a picture to one of the slides where I had a picture and half text on the
 slide or it may not be related at all but I didn't have the problem before adding a picture to a slide. Can someone please help. It is not saved as a show either. Thank you.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order for us to assist you with your concern, may we ask what&nbsp; version of PowerPoint are you using to open or edit the pictures that you saved? You may refer to the article below on how you can check what version of PowerPoint you are using.</p>

<p>PowerPoint has an option to save a presentation as what it calls a Picture Presentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you choose this option, it saves each slide as a *picture* of a slide, so it's no longer editable.&nbsp; Is it possible that you've done this by mistake?</p>

<p>As Steve says you have probably mistakenly saved as a Picture Presentation (confusingly also a pptx)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bad news is you cannot get back to an editable presentation from a Picture Presentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Better news is it should have prevented you from saving over the original presentation (though I have seen this go wrong) You might want to search for a copy of the original.</p>

            I read online somewhere else that saving as a pptx was just a newer version of the ppt. Unfortunately, you are right in that it was saved as an uneditable picture presentation. The original was overwritten and i had to redo everything i lost. Thank you

<p>Sorry you have to go through the whole reconstruction exercise.&nbsp; What a bummer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A PPTX is indeed the newer version of the PowerPoint file format (since 2007, so not THAT new any longer).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For future reference, it's not saving as PPTX that's the problem, it's saving in the specific PowerPoint Picture Presentation that converts all the slides to pictures.&nbsp; Doing a normal save as PPTX won't make things uneditable.</p>

 There was one in Quarantine a short tim ago. I removed it. However my computer has been acting very poorly since. I suspect a virus is within my system. How can I find out the suspected malicious software and remove it?

<h2>            Recovery Froze</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I get the latest insider builds fast, </p>
<p>to cut it short, </p>
<p>On Thursday I had to roll back a build as&nbsp;something wasn't right, my computer froze, so I tried to recover windows 10,</p>
<p>all was going well until it came to "Let Cortana Get to know you" it Froze I tried to skip that step but I could do nothing? so had to restart again, and go the same thing.</p>
<p>kept trying but nothing? </p>
<p>I'm so gutted as I had to Reinstall windows 7 then came back and reinstalled windows 10 preview,&nbsp;Gutted&nbsp;is an understatement now my windows 10 is only a preview copy. where as before because I had been with insider since&nbsp;the start&nbsp;my windows 10&nbsp;was&nbsp;a full
 legal copy (free)&nbsp;&nbsp;will it go back to the Full copy does anyone know?</p>

            You didn't need to go back to Windows 7. You could have installed Windows 10 from a DVD you burned from the iso you downloaded from Microsoft. And your computer is what is tied to your activated Windows 10 serial. All you need to do is click skip when
 Windows 10 asks you for your serial, finish the install, then login with your Microsoft account.

<p>I agree.&nbsp; One could also use an USB.&nbsp; I believe this PC was actually functioning so was not a totally dead PC, but a PC that was stuck on an Insider build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC should already be activated for W10.&nbsp; However, coming over from W7, as this PC was doing,&nbsp; and then using an Insider build as an ISO, it indeed may not be activated.&nbsp; It indeed may not have even offered up the "Skip" of a Product Key.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have seen
 installs where the "Skip" is not an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The correct fix was indeed the Media Creation Tool taking the PC to public build.&nbsp; However, we are where we are.&nbsp; If this was my PC, I would take to public build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for the record, I recently took a W8.1 Pro that had never exercised the free upgrade.&nbsp; I used the Media Creation Tool.&nbsp; I did not get the option of a "Skip".&nbsp; I had a generic W10 Product Key lying around and used that.&nbsp; I thought this would have been
 used just to pull Pro from the ISO.&nbsp; However, the PC went full W10 activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>W7 often has the Product Key attached to it.&nbsp; A laptop usually had the Key on a sticker under the battery.&nbsp; W8 started to embed the Key in Bios.&nbsp; Since you now have an non-activated W10, you might try to go to Settings/Update/Activation and try to the option
 to the change the Product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do have options to try.&nbsp; The best is likely to take the PC to public build using the Media Creation Tool.&nbsp; If you have no option to "skip" the Product key here, then you have to a get a Product Key into the system.&nbsp; I do believe the old W7 key still
 has function for activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never saw a W10 I could not activate.</p>

<p>Something is strange here.&nbsp; Media Creation Tool is a download of public build.&nbsp; Insiders offers ISOs of Insider builds.&nbsp; Not the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You seem to have an issue with Cortana.&nbsp; The question is whether it is a Cortana issue resident in the public build or within an Insider build.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fry my W10 Insider often, to the point where it is a paper weight.&nbsp; It is just Media Creation Tool to latest public build and then a return to Fast Lane when I feel the coast is clean</p>

<p>If you used the Media Creation tool you should have wound up with the latest Public Build like images below. If you installed the same version you had before like
Pro </span>It should have Activated as the full Windows 10.:)</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I have installed current version 16.23 of outlook for Mac.</p>
<p>&nbsp; When I'm connected to company network there is a problem when I try to send an email with 1MB or bigger attachment. Then I receive 998 errror and the message is not sent. There is no problem when no attachment or a small one is sent.</p>
<p>&nbsp; If I change network - for example to hotspot from my mobile - the same message is sent out without any notice..</p>
<p>&nbsp; The problem exists only on my Macbook, the message sent from iPad goes smoothly&nbsp; .</p>
<p>&nbsp; Are there any settings I should take care of?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Instead of install IE11 through Windows Update, have you tried downloading and installing from the IE site at Microsoft.com? Try this link:&nbsp;

<p>Hope that helps, keep me posted.</p>

<h2>            Nokia 6300  uploading message folders and messages to a pc or sim card  How to do this</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to copy my message folders off Nokia 6300 to either a pc or a memory card, as well as backing these up to a pc? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been able to place the memory card in a data "sleeve" to upload my pictures to my pc. &nbsp;Can the same process be done for messages and message folders? &nbsp;If not, I would appreciate any input to achieve this as there are &nbsp;a lot of messages I need to preserve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a great day! &nbsp;</p>
