            Have you tried using Internet Explorer rather than default Microsoft Edge to go to Facebook or when at Facebook in Edge use option open with Internet Explorer. &nbsp;The first core build of Windows 10, I also was having problems&nbsp; with Edge and Facebook game.
 I am now have Second core build and Edge is working much better.&nbsp; Another possibility might be Flash Player and needing the latest Version of Flash Player.

            Windows 10 is being installed in 3 major stages to public with 2nd major stage scheduled for November 10. Many issues should be resolved hopefully including your Facebook Games problem. As an insider I have a preview build which is something like the 2nd
 release but not entirely. Many things seemed to work better. Including Facebook games. I do not&nbsp;use firefox or chrome or even google. I use only Edge and MSN as my homepage and Bing as my search engine. Microsoft 100%. It works for me. The Windows 10 defaults.

<p>it could be your connection to xbox live. unplug your router and wait 30 seconds, then plug it back in. Try recovering again. If this problem still occurs, &nbsp;click " exit sign up" and try signing into xbox live on that account, in some cases the downloading
 hasnt complete, but you can still sign into xbox live.</p>

<p>Also try to delete your profile entirely from the console first. Delete the profile only (not items!), clear system cache, restart console, and try to recover again.

<p>Try these ports on the forwarding.</p>

<p>I mean i see so many users having issues with connection and still they are not doing a thing about it?</p>

<p>Hey mate, the ports would have to be forwarded on each router individually. Were you able to open those without issue on the second router, because it looks like you ran into some trouble with your first one. If that's a router provided/recommended by your
 ISP, I suggest giving them a call back to see if they can walk you through that process of opening the ports.

<p>Hello again.</p>
<p>After a couple of days venturing with my xbox on the road and trying it on a friend that has the same ISP as me and he is playing xbox live in his house we came up with the reason of the problem.</p>
<p>So it wasnt the ports that was blocking the connection with marketplace but my own profile.</p>
<p>We recovered my friend's gamertag on my xbox and everything was working perfectly &nbsp;but with my profile i cant download any demo games or purchase gold membership.</p>
<p>So any ideas on whats creating that problem? Do i need to link my msn account with xbox live somehow?</p>
<p>All i did when i bought the xbox was to retrieve a gamertag. As gamertag i used my msn email.</p>
<p>Was that the mistake that did it?</p>

<p>I don't think the issue would be the email address associated with the account. If you can't play on LIVE or purcahse a new membership, I think you may want to give phone support a call about the issue.</p>

<p>My ISP told me he cant open port 80 for my ZTE router (ISP's default router) becuase they are using that port for the web interface of the router .when i try to forward that port on my router i get an error something about a default ip on the dhcp table
</p>
<p>Then i tried my other router the Thomson one and i forwarded xbox live ports properly but still no sucess whatsoever.</p>
<p>So at first i thought it was the ports but now im not so sure since i've tried 2 different routers. I will try doing this at my friends house see if its a connection problem or xbox's fault.</p>
<p>give ur xbox a static ip then u can open port 80 this worked for me</p>
<p>I also have everything open and game and music marketplace freeze the xbox360 for me</p>
<p>Needed to send to xbox but i waited with it so maybe it was a update problem .</p>
<p>But it wasn't still having this problem so its gonna be a repair i guess</p>

<p>I want to be able to read data of a USB stick from Windows, but I have some problems with that and I think it comes from Windows (and not from the VirtualBox or linux, but I'm not sure). Indeed from the VirtualBox, I am able to
 select the USB sitck from the devices menu. However, the USB stick doesn't appear on my Computer (where you see the local disk and CD drive).</p>
<p>Under “Device and Printers”, there is a yellow triangular sign with an exclamation mark next to “Mass Storage Device”. I launched the troubleshoot who gave the following information “There is a problem with the driver for USB Mass
 Stoage Device. Reinstalling the driver might fix this problem”. I click on the “Apply this fix” button, but it doesn't solve the problem as the next message I get is “Troubleshooting was unable to automatically fix all of the issues found. You can find more
 details below: USB Mass Storage Device has a driver problem. Not fixed”</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Next thing I tried is that under the “USB Mass Storage Device Properties” window I clicked on “Update Driver”, I then get “Search automotically for updated driver software” and finally when the search has finished I get “The best
 driver software for your device is already installed. Windows has determined the driver software for your device is up to date” (this is obviously not the case... grrrhh).</p>
<p>Under the same “USB Mass Storage Device Properties” window I also clicked on the “Uninstall” button, took out the USB stick and put it back again and get messages “Installing device software” and then “Device driver software was
 not successfully installed”.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I really don't know what to do anymore (I also made all the updates for Windows 7 and restart it to see if it makes any difference, but no it doesn't). I also tried with another USB stick and my external hard drive, but get the
 same problem. Anyone has a clue?</p>
<p>Any help, ideas or suggestion would be much appreciated!
</p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
As I understand you are trying to install Samsung kies 2.3.3 on you r Windows Xp computer and after the installation, you received a prompt to install .Net framework 3.5 /4.0 accordingly, Once you install the .Net framework and tried to launch the Kies software
 you receive a error message stating, "Kies has encountered a problem and needs to close, send error report...... " , and you face the same error message after two repeated tries of uninstalling and installing the software, Am I correct?</div>
<div><br />
Lets Start troubleshooting by checking if the .Net framework installed on the computer correctly.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>How to determine which versions and service pack levels of the Microsoft .NET Framework are installed</strong></div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/318785</a></div>
<div><br />
Once the latest version of .Net framework installation is determined then you may continue to
<strong>Method 1</strong>, if not then follow the steps to uninstall and reinstall .Net framework from the link below
<div><br />
Repair and reinstall .net framework on our computer</div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1</strong></div>
<div><br />
Since you already tried to uninstall and reinstall Kies on your computer, I would suggest you to check your security program for a possible block on the Kies software.</div>
<div><br />
Try adding a exception if possible or disable your security software and check.</div>
<div>Important Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div><br />
If you still face any issues then try installing the program in Clean boot to avoid conflicts with third party software and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2</strong></div>

<strong>How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state </strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note: Please follow the instructions under ' Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state', to start the computer in normal mode once the necessary troubleshooting is complete.</div>
<div>For further assistance on the Samsung Kies Issues please contact Samsung support for further assistance.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Is the issue specific to 'Kies'?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to set the computer to clean boot state to check for software conflicts.

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</span></a><span>

<p><b><span>NOTE:</span></b><span> </span><span>After using the clean boot to resolve your problem, you may follow the ‘<b>Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state’
</b>to configure Windows XP to start normally.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the program does not work in clean boot state, check event viewer logs for detailed error message. Refer the following article which explains how to view event logs:</p>

            <p>thank you for the reply Mahesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I typo'd at the top of my post, i should have typed up "8.1" - Both RT and PC are fully updated with 8.1 and every software update released up to a few hours ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logged out of my account and logged in with Admin account on main PC, SSD activity still ~100%(disk) (when it was occurring), with task manager reporting System.exe as 'Red' for disk usage. Note: Disk space on SSD has decreased by a number of (~6)GB's since
 yesterday - nothing installed, no settings changed. System.exe still periodically running at 100%(disk) for extended time every now and then (don't know what causes it, probably something in the background)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bad for RT given its small internal drive space, who's drive is also getting filled with 'something'. NOTE: available space on RT was below 3GB. after removing files and making space the drive stopped running at 100%(disk). This was brought on by the Onedrive
 warning on RT that the system was below 3GB (i use ondrive on BOTH win8 versions for easy file access) - However, this is no fix, RT still running at 100% disk activity, BUT, not for hours and hours like it did before removing files. A rough guesstimate would
 put it at ~10-30 mins...which isn't any better tbh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System.exe is the issue (as far as task manager is reporting) on both my PC and RT device. The process is shown in red in task manager under "disk".</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: On main PC, Win8 + Chrome are the only installs on C drive. Everything else is getting installed to a partition folder from a separate HDD in the system (the drives with 0% activity in the picture i provided).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As chrome is NOT available on RT i can only presume it must be a OS issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>EDIT: i should probably clarify, i imagine App's would install to their default location which is probably still C:Drive</em></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for replying.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may check if the issue persists in safe mode. </span>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that&nbsp; starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The word
<span>Safe Mode</span> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you're using.</p>
<p>If an existing problem doesn't reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers as possible causes.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Wireless Keyboard Stops Working When Not in Use &#43; Other - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> memorylili  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Keyboard Stops Working When Not in Use &#43; Other</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">I had to get myself a new keyboard on February 5th, and I got a Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop Keyboard
 and Mouse. I haven't had any problems with it until today, and it's two things:</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">1) The main problem is that my keyboard will stop responding if I do not use it for a short period of time; I'm
 unable to type or use any other keyboard functions. The problem first occurred while I was playing a game, and after sitting through a lengthy dialogue period with another character, I was unable to move my character around with the keys or use any of the
 keyboard shortcuts (i.e. pulling up menus, using certain items or abilities, etc). I exited the game, pulled up Notepad and found I was unable to type in anything.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">Initially I thought it may have been the batteries and when I switched the spots of the two batteries (AAA) inside,
 the keyboard started working again. I thought, "Oh it just needs new batteries then. I'll just get some new batteries after work." But when I placed some new batteries in later, the problem kept coming back.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">As I'm typing this, I'm not having any issues with the keyboard. But if I don't use it for a short period of time
 (like maybe about 30 seconds to a minute), it stops working. The only way to get it back is if I switch the batteries around (not replace them, just switch the spots of the in-use batteries). Sometimes when I do this, the mouse scroll stops working.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">2) Another issue I'm having is this: the keyboard comes with an Fn On/Off switch at the upper-right hand corner
 and if I switch it off, the keyboard will suddenly start spamming the current date and time non-stop on things like Notepad, Word, chat/text boxes, etc. If I have nothing opened up, the desktop icons flicker in and out rapidly. This doesn't happen if I switch
 it back on, which is unfortunate because I have to have it off when I play certain games (i.e., when I'm in a party and I have to switch between characters through the F1 - F4 commands).</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">I have no idea why this is happening suddenly, it was working perfectly fine and I have not done anything to the
 keyboard/mouse before the problems occurred. I tried switch the USB stick to different ports, but it made no difference, neither did restarting the computerr.</span>

 a little hard to explain; basically the keyboard is broken up into two parts and the number keys that are on the right-hand side of a regular keyboard is its own separate keyboard.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-ca/products/keyboards/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop/l5v-00002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(52, 133, 189, 1)">This

                    <p>what gives with all the "background" pictures that pop up asking If I like them???&nbsp; Getting real tired of going through 2 or 3 every time I want to use my computer!!&nbsp; Some are fantastic pictures (and I wish they said where they were taken), but seriously,
 I have better things to do with my time.&nbsp; Is this Microsofts' sneaky way of seeing how often I am using my computer???</p>

            <p>I am installing my 4th Windows 10 installation. The 2 PC (Win 8.1 PRO) and a laptop (Win 7 PRO) I ugraded using the USB media, due to repetitive failures of Windows 10 updates. These 3 computers upgraded flawlessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fourth is an ASUS laptop under Windows 7. For this one I downloaded the ISO media Home version (not sure if flash USB could be used for future recovery in this laptop). The Installation was doing well until it stuck at 32% with 6% features and drivers,
 as many have posted in the Internet. It has now about four hours in that point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something I noted is that the updates check of the installation was much shorter than the other 3 computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What puzzles me is that your answer seems valid but is different from other professionals from Microsoft for the same inquiry. But you mention a link to go for the ISO download which is the one I am using, downloaded yesterday night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am concerned because there is information in that laptop and I would like to avoid a clean installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I´ll wait a few more hours and if there is no progress I will do as you suggest</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. I could restart my system in the midst of a botched upgrade without ill effect despite the dire warnings on the screen. It reverted to Win 7 and has worked fine since then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I will follow my original plan and wait a bit longer to expose myself to a new OS.</p>
<p>

    <title>Making a monitor a primary Display whilst keeping the other one. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Making a monitor a primary Display whilst keeping the other one.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am having a small issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I have a laptop with a external monitor, I can connect it fine and it works and I set it up so that the monitor is my primary</p>
<p>display, however I want to use my laptop screen too, I can extend the display (But&nbsp;my monitor is to the left of the laptop meaning that to access the&nbsp;laptop monitor&nbsp;I have to drag the mouse to the left side instead of ideally the right side which is confusing)&nbsp;but
 I want the laptop to be the extension, not the monitor. I can get it showing only on my monitor which is what I currently use but I want to be able to move the mouse to the right of the screen and be able to access my laptop screen too. I have tried different
 things and I don't know why it is so hard. I have an old mac which can easily switch screens and make them left to right etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So overall, ideally:</p>
<p>I want the laptop to be the extension screen to my external monitor, I don't want to regularly&nbsp;extend or duplicate the displays I just want the extension option to be essentially reversed which is an option I cannot seem to find anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or solutions would be great, cheers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>James.</p>

            <p>That's the same setup I've got right now.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It sounds like you just need to reverse the display postions and then set the external as the primary.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Go to <span style="font-weight: bold">settings / System / Display</span>, and under
Extend these displays</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then in the monitor configuration box at the top, drag and drop monitor 2 so that it's to the left of monitor 1 and highlighted, then go down and check the box that says
Apply</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Now your external monitor (2) on the left should be your primary display, your laptop screen (1) the right should be your extended display, and your mouse orientation (right to left) should be correct when sliding between the two.</p>

<p>To further assist you, are you using a touch screen device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, move your mouse pointer into the top-left corner of your screen, then move down the edge slightly. You'll see recent apps you had open (if any), and the tip will disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to gpedit.msc not recognized, which version of Windows are you using?
</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>It is a split so I can use it as a laptop or tablet. It is a touch laptop. I prefer to use a mouse and not touch. Either way, that comes up. Right now, it is gone.
</p>
<p>At your suggestion, I placed my mouse cursor at the top right corner but nothing showing any recent apps opened.</p>
<p>However, if I go to the apps mode and work there, when I go back to the laptop mode, it shows up.</p>
<p>As for the gpedit, I know I don't have the proper version of Win 8 for that. Just following a suggestion from a previous post. Never know.</p>
<p>Sure would like to know what to do if that comes up again, which I'm sure it will.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>What are you backing up your files and folders to? Whatever it is that you are backing up to&nbsp;must be getting full if the backup is asking for the 'next device' to backup the files and folders to. So whether its another hard disk, or tape, or DVD / CD that
 the computer is backing up to, when the first is full, it searches for the next device to backup to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to whether it can be done, the answer is dependent on whether or not you have an alternative media to back up to. Such as a second partition on a hard drive, an external hard drive, or a USB flash drive. If you don't have one of those, it defaults to
 removable media.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, say you had partitioned your hard drive into a C:\ and D:\ drive, and told Windows Backup to backup your files and folders to the D:\Drive. And further assume that you had only allocated 30 GB to this second partition, of which you were using
 15 GB, which you could backup to use 10 GB (with compression). You do one backup and then want to do a second; you've just used 15 GB&nbsp;(original data)+10 GB (1st backup) = 5 GB is all you have left.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever backup strategy you follow, you soon use up that remaining 5 GB of space. And once that hard drive is full,&nbsp;the backup program&nbsp;makes the assumption that you want to back up to removable media to finish the job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this answers your question. Let me know if this take care of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

<h2>            Error code 80004005 on KB 2729094 update</h2>
                    The recent update of Win7 X64 for KB 2729094 has failed repeatedly with Error Code 80004005.&nbsp; I recently had a partial hard drive failure in my system drive (C:).&nbsp; The system became unstable so I installed a new hard drive and did a sector by sector copy
 of my hard drive to the new hard drive.&nbsp; The OS seems to work fine and other updates were subsequently installed without issue. &nbsp; I don't know if the disk failure is related but thought I should mention it.<br />
<br />
The 094 update installed without error on 8/15 but was downloaded again on 10/10 and did not install.&nbsp; It has installed properly on several of my other machines but not on this one.&nbsp; I would appreciate any guidance on how to get this update installed or to
 repair the installation of the Segoe font that is addressed.&nbsp; Note that the manual download and install failed also.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />

            <p>No luck. Still failing. Here's what I did: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Date/time/time zone are correct<br />
2. temp files/history, cache deleted<br />
3. Ran Disk Cleanup and deleted the files<br />
4. Even though I did the steps above, I also downloaded and ran the ccleaner. Did not use any Advanced options or the Registry cleanup.<br />
5. Rebooted<br />
6. Uninstalled Anti-malware program<br />
7. Uninstalled AVG virus scanning program<br />
8. Disabled Windows Firewall for Domain profile, private profile, and public profile<br />
9. Manually downloaded KB2729084&nbsp;from: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30601" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30601</a><br />
&nbsp;- The link you provided required me to validate my copy of windows. I went to the validation page, clicked Continue, clicked Run, and got a message that "The version of the Windows Genuine Advantage validation tool is no longer supported. Please download the
 newest version and ensure that your system clock is accurate." I spent 15 minutes trying to find a "newer" version for Windows 7 but gave up and found the link that I provided that did not take me to the validation page.<br />
10. Disconnected all USB devices.<br />
11. Disabled the internet from my wireless radio toggle<br />
12. Checked the task manager and closed just about everything except<br />
&nbsp;- Desktop Window Manager<br />
&nbsp;- Windows Explorer<br />
&nbsp;- VESMgrSub<br />
&nbsp;- taskmgr<br />
&nbsp;- winlogon<br />
&nbsp;- taskhost<br />
&nbsp;- csrss<br />
&nbsp;-&nbsp;atieclxx<br />

13. Opened the .msu file for KB2729094, clicked Yes to Install, update failed. The message said that the update was not installed.<br />

<h2>            Inoperable Hardware Devices</h2>
                    <p>HI Friend,</p>
<p>I have a FX6840-03 Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit</p>
<p>I counted about 23 Inoperable Hardware Devices. Also My PS/2 Mouse Device Status Device is not present, Not Working Properly, or of...(whatever that means)</p>
<p>Plug and Play ID: ACPI/PNP0F03/4&amp;DAE4155&amp;0</p>
<p>My Info came from Norton 360 6.0 Diagnostic Report.</p>
<p>(Question)</p>
<p>It seems to me since all Hardware Devices (Driver Version 6.1.7601.17514) Are all the same number.&nbsp;Could this&nbsp;Be The same Software? I've gone though every Device&nbsp; in the Manager box When Norton ask FIX IT BUT it takes me to the Device Manager Help. What
 do you think I should do I've tried update But it give me the same answer,(No&nbsp;Device installed or not working&nbsp;Properly.</p>
<p>Should I just unstalled all them, Try to find the Hardware Devices or ignore I hate to see Fix it on my Norton Diagnostic Report It does give me all the names of the Programs. i even written all the bad ones&nbsp;down and scan it to my computer</p>
<p>I Hope this info Helps</p>

            <p>&nbsp;According to my Google search, the FX6840-03 is a Gateway computer.&nbsp; I would make a list of all the Devices in Device Manager having either ? or ! beside them, then go to Gateway's web site and download the proper driver.&nbsp; I'd rely on the Windows Device
 Manager, not Norton's tools for making the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To get to Device Manager, click Start then right-click Computer and click Properties.&nbsp; Then click Device Manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

<h3> aidannorton101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfer Upgraded Win 10 to new build&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, Recently I have built a new PC as my old PC is starting to die out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously my old PC ran windows 7 pro and when I received my pre-built pc all them years ago I got a driver disk and a product key along with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I finally upgraded from Win7 pro to the new windows 10 and now I wish to move this newly upgraded windows 10 to my new rig as I intend to sell the old one and carry on with the operating system I got with the old PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was unable to move my windows 7 pro onto my new rig as it would bluescreen and state that my key was already in use so I assumed I needed to transfer it. Also the fact that I was told that my new CPU (I7 8700K) can only run 8.1 or higher so I upgraded
 before transfer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to know if that was possible and If its safe to do so? I already had a look online but I have seen lots of things saying "you can transfer" but then others where they state I can't forums alike.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I needed some form of confirmation and method on how exactly I can deactivate my upgraded win10 and move it to the new one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi  aidannorton101
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.
<br />
<br />	If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	If its the free upgrade from a OEM preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is NOT transferable to a new computer or motherboard.
<br />
<br />	Learn more about transferring your license: 
<br /><a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/transfer-windows-10-license-new-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/transfer-window...</a>
<br />
<br />If its a retail license, learn how to reactivate:
<br /><a href="http://www.groovypost.com/howto/activate-windows-10-license-microsoft-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.groovypost.com/howto/activate-window...</a>
<br />
<br />You could try chatting with support agent and explain the situation in detail and they might be able to activate it. We were able to confirm with Microsoft under some circumstances, OEM licenses can be reactivated even under the free upgrade offer. Its not guaranteed every support agent will do it though, but you can try your luck.
<br />
<br />Microsoft's view is, as long as you are not abusing the license, you should get a pass. 
<br />
<br />Reactivate Your Windows 10 License using the Windows 7 Professional product key via Microsoft Chat Support

<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on an OEM Windows 7 licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail Windows 7 licence (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new Motherboard or PC, if it is OEM it will not . .. 
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 based on a retail copy of Windows 7?
<br />
<br />Also, how long ago did you upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10, because, the free upgrade period ended 3 years ago . . .

<h2>            Problem with Outlook toast notifications in Windows 10 version 1709</h2>
                    <p>Hello, Microsoft Team. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help with a problematic situation here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a workstation with Windows 10 version 1709. I'm working with Office 2013 Standard.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the thing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Everything is working fine until Outlook's toast notifications from new incoming messages stop working. Just like that. Sometimes restarting the computer enable alerts again but after a while the problem happens again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the following points (no luck):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Downloaded the latest updates from Windows and Office. Even I upgraded to Win 10 ver 1803.</p>
<p>- Reimaged PC and installing Windows 10 ver 1703. </p>
<p>- Repaired and reinstalled Office 2013. </p>
<p>- Created a new rule to enforce New Desktop Alert (appears the same notifications twice and then stops working too).</p>
<p>- Checked settings from Action Center in Windows (Quiet hours is Off, notifications options as it should be. select default program by Mail)</p>
<p>- I haven't the same issue with Windows 10 ver 1703 or previous (for some technical reason, I can't change to this version)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was searching on Internet and I found the Windows 10 ver 1709 and further has some problems with these notifications with every Outlook version (2007, 2010, 2013, 2016). Some people recommend to change location of Office's shortcuts to get back notifications.
 But alerts are not working no matter what.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you be able to help me with this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in Advance,</p>
<p>Luis</p>

            Hi!<br /><br />The following are some tricks from another users:<br /><br />“Anyhow what happened to me was....on Windows 10, there is an option called QUIET HOURS and it was ON for some reason.  Once I turned it off, volia, new email notification came back on like it used to be. Go to Action Center, double check if the Quiet Hours is on, make sure it's off in order to receive a new email notification.”<br /><br /><br />“I got the same issue and repair office application in control panel resolved it! It troubled me for a long time”<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_win10-mso_2016/outlook-2016-notification-not-working/4016e15e-cfd2-4296-a530-01414f5fb5c1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/fo...</a>

<p>Hi, Juan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I tried both tricks before and it worked for a while but later notifications crashed again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said before, I searched on Internet and it says that it's a problem with Win 10 ver 1709 and further because something changed in the location of Office's shortcuts. Even I had a second workstation with the same Windows image and it happened the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Do you have another ideas?</p>

<h2>            Offline Playing&#58; Games trying to connect to XboxLive</h2>
                    
<p>Ok so i got an xbox and updated from store. took it home and played offline compatible games galore. Then all of a sudden, it would give me an error code, or error to be using an xbox dvd, etc. on one or two of the games.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Took xbox to work and updated it, updated all of the games, and now its home and it will always ask to connect to xbox live. I shut off network (since my wi fi at home isnt connected to the internet. I use a router in my house but theres no internet)&nbsp;</p>
<p>it never gives me the option to "Play Offline" like it used to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am really starting to dispise microsoft and xbox and im so close to buying PS4 instead</p>
<p>this is rediculous that I pick the games that say internet is not required.</p>

    <title>Getting Error message &#34; the system cannot contact a domain - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jfo11  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting Error message &#34; the system cannot contact a domain controller&#34; when loggin in</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Two Windows 8 computers in home network do not retain credentials for accessing each other
</p>
<p>They have both the same Microsoft user, and each computer has some shared folders and drives for the other computers in the network to access.
<br />
Every time I boot one computer, to access the other home systems' mapped drives and shared folders, I have to enter the user name (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) and the password. This is not a real big issue, but it's certainly a pain in the a****.<br />
<br />
OS version on both is Windows 8 Pro, language Spanish. Error message when asked for the manual login is something like "the system cannot contact a domain controller" (which is normal, since I run a home network without domain controller).<br />
<br />
Funnily, two other computers in the same network with Windows 7 can connect to the Windows 8 computers files and folders, without being prompted every time for user name and password!<br />
<br />
Hints and ansers will be welcome!<br />

            Thanks, but I didn't find the answer in the provided links. What did you mean? The question is simple: if I open 10 videos at once in Film &amp; TV (like I've done for 10+ years in M.P.) to have them play one after another, how do I advance to the next video?
 There are no buttons for next and previous....
