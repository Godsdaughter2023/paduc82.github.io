<h2>            Problems with downloading Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm having a problem with my laptop trying to upgrade to Windows 8.1. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It came with Windows 8 and then upgraded to 8.1 just fine a while back, but then it got into problems and I had to do a factory reset which changed it back to 8. Now it attempts to download 8.1 again but runs into problems. It has been doing this every three
 days for almost 6 months now and still keeps having problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if there is a way to fix this, or to just bypass it all together and go straight to windows 10?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
                </div>

            <p>Hey Ben! </p><p><br /></p><p>If you're unable to play NBA2K online it's because 2K has an age-gate on their games and you have to be 18 or older to access them.&nbsp;It is not possible to manually promote a child account to an adult account. The only way that an account can be transitioned to an adult account is by reaching the 18th birthday according to the date placed on the account at creation. </p><p><br /></p><p>Apologies for any frustrations this may cause!</p><p>

    <title>500 Server Error when Accessing Wireless Router Settings&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeremyh699  say:</h3>
<h2>            500 Server Error when Accessing Wireless Router Settings&#63;</h2>
                    I am using Windows 7 on a wireless connection through a Belkin G router. For the past week or so now, whenever I try to get into my wireless router's settings, I get a 500 Server Error message. This is a problem since I am unable to change any settings
 and improve my connection because of it. I have tried the usual resetting the router, power cycling it, using troubleshooters..basically anything I can think of. Nothing has worked so far. It's getting to the point where I'm considering purchasing a new router,
 but I just want to make sure there isn't something I'm missing first. I heard somewhere else that there's something I can do through Command Prompt to fix it, but they were on a completely different OS so I couldn't test it myself. Any ideas?

<p>SimCity 4 has worked properly on my computer for approximately four years now, without a single problem. However, a few days ago, without changing anything in the program, it will not open any longer. The disc spins inside my computer, but nothing appears
 with the exception of the message attached as a photo file above. I have tried running as the administrator, restarting my laptop multiple times, changing the security settings, running in Windows XP compatibility mode, cleaning the disc twice, uninstalling
 and reinstalling thrice, once reinstalling it into the "Program Files" instead of the "Program Files (x86)". I am at a loss as to what I should do next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I examined the disc, and there are no visible scratches or marks. I am reasonably experienced with computers, particularly Windows 7, yet I was still unable to find a solution independently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop was purchased 26 December 2011, and is an Acer Aspire with an Intel Core. It runs Windows 7 Home Edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that my problems occurred due to a Windows update. Note that I have not attempted to use SimCity 4 since August 2015, so therefore there may have been multiple updates since that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, this is apparently one of the many games that Monopoly$oft has broken with it's DRM blocking,
</p>
<p>which was introduced with Win10. You can verify this by 'opening' the disk and looking for a file titled</p>
<p>SECDRV.sys.</p>
<p><br />
MS reckon these old DRM are a security threat, and to that end you are not allowed to&nbsp; risk the<br />
dubious potential threat imposed by them. Big Brother Win10 does not allow you to disable DRM blocking.</p>
<p>It's bad enough that legitimate buyers of these games were the one's who suffered most from some of<br />
these DRM, but now MS want's them to pay again.<br />
imo - DRM blocking of older disk based game is nothing more than an extortion racket aimed at getting
</p>
<p>people to buy a download version which has had the DRM removed.<br />
<br />
- Win7/8/8.1 users are not immune to this Monopoly$oft&nbsp; malware.<br />
Monopoly$oft are also foisting DRM blocking subversivly on Win7 users via the 'Security Update'
</p>
<p>- KB3086255 &amp; 2919355.<br />
<br />
- At least Win7 users can uninstall, or be aware of this update and not install it.<br />
- There is also an&nbsp; option to disable DRM blocking (but not in Win10). See article below -</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3086255" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MS15-097: Description of the security update for the graphics component in Windows: September 8, 2015</a>
<br />
<br />
- Win8/8.1 are not so lucky as they will not receive future Security updates if they don't install this DRM blocking<br />
malware. Extortion. Plain and simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Of course these DRM never worked anyway, and using a noCD fix/hack has always been more handy than</p>
<p>having to stuff around with the disk.</p>

            <p>Hi, Ramesh<br />
<br />
Thank you for your reply.<br />
<br />
Actually, I´m not having any issues installing Windows 10. At this moment I´m running Windows 10 Enterprise Evaluation, 64 bits, on an UEFI system (without BIOS boot support) with a GPT partition. I installed it from an USB with a GPT partition scheme. I downloaded
 the ISO from Microsoft´s web site and made a GPT bootable USB disk, using my own flash drive.<br />
<br />
My question comes from Microsoft´s Windows 10 USB Flash Drive - please see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Windows-Home-Flash-Drive/dp/B01019T6O0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Windows 10 Home | USB Flash Drive</a>. Which partition scheme has this flash drive: GPT or MBR?<br />
<br />
My hope is that it is GPT, but I think it is MBR for compatibility reasons.<br />
<br />

    <title>Xbox One Controller Battery Status - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shadow g36  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Controller Battery Status</h2>
                    
<p>Is it just me, or does someone else find it annoying that the Xbox One doesn't tell you how charged your controller batteries are? Its infuriating to be on an awesome kill streak in Battlefield 4 just to have my controller randomly die and not turn&nbsp;back
 on. Like what happened to the Battery Status Bar from the 360? That little notification bar was super handy for me. Would it kill Microsoft to add that little feature onto the Xbox One?</p>

<p>I am suprised they left alot of things out that are just plain common sense to add at launch. There was a youtuber I was watching on YouTube, he was complaining about putting his one controller on charge while the console is off and it was turning on the
 system. The little things can be the most annoying I suppose.</p>

Its unfortunate, but the&nbsp;console is plagued with problems and people complaining.<br />

<p>Also, I'm using a Plug and Play Kit, and I'm used to checking for that last bar of battery life before I reach for my charge cable. I rotate two charge packs as needed, charging one as I use the other, and its become a hit or miss without the charge level
 meter. It doesn't entirely bother me that's its gone, but it would be nice to have back. :/</p>

<p>[quote user="DADDY BENNY"]</p>
<p>[quote user="Shadow G36"] Is it just me, or does someone else find it annoying that the Xbox One doesn't tell you how charged your controller batteries are? Its infuriating to be on an awesome kill streak in Battlefield 4 just to have my controller randomly
 die and not turn&nbsp;back on. Like what happened to the Battery Status Bar from the 360? That little notification bar was super handy for me. Would it kill Microsoft to add that little feature onto the Xbox One? [/quote]</p>
<p>Please use the correct forum for Xbox One issues.<br />
<br />
Its unfortunate, but the&nbsp;console is plagued with problems and people complaining.<br />
<br />
So&nbsp;for all us 360 players, it seems our 360 forum area is overrun about Xbox One issues.<br />
<br />
But there is a dedicated forum for you guys as well. Here - <strong><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/general_discussion/f/3817.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">XBOX ONE FORUM</a></strong><br />
<br />
Hope you get your problem sorted dude. Have fun. :-)</p>
<p>[/quote]Well, its not technically an issue, because my xbox works just fine. I'd figured it should fall under general discussion because that's all it was. general discussion.</p>
<p>[/quote]On another note, I see your point. I clearly missed the Xbox One General Discussion page beneath the earlier link. I will do better next time when making a new post. Please forgive my ignorance. :)</p>

    <title>Freezing Windows 10 during hardware scan - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the builder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Freezing Windows 10 during hardware scan</h2>
                    &nbsp;When ever I go to the control panel/ hardware and sound/ device manager and select "scan for hardware changes" my entire system freezes. Due to this fact it has also prevented me from installing my R9 390X because when its drivers from AMD go to check
 my installed hardware it causes the freeze then too.

            Hi The.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />After installing the hardware, go to the manufacturer's Support Downloads web page to download and install the new hardware driver software, skipping the Device Manager which is never the best way to install drivers. 
<br />
<br />If you need to disable another hardware device do so by physically disconnecting it or in the UEFI setup.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Windows Live Mail can not copy hyperlinks from one e-mail to another. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lukeblackwell_88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live Mail can not copy hyperlinks from one e-mail to another.</h2>
                    Hey all.<br />
<br />
Long story short, I am writing this for my mother who current runs a dog boarding business as well as various other e-mail accounts, ranging from fan clubs to personal ones. She has a
<b>draft e-mail</b> saved which contains information and links she would <b>COPY </b>
and <b>PASTE</b> into e-mails prior to sending them. Essentially, these are signatures. No matter which signature she copies and pastes, each one has at least one weblink.<br />
<br />
As of yesterday, when copying and pasting that information, the link does not copy with the text. Instead of pasting the text as a hyperlink, like she has been able to, it simply shows the text without any clickable option.<br />
<br />
I have double checked the options, <b>Read all messages in plain text</b> is unticked, as well as the
<b>Mail Sending Format</b> and <b>News Sending Formation</b> both being set to HTML.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help please?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

            <p>@ LukeBlackwell_88,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know if this will help or not - but - after pasting the link, type a space immediately after it.
</p>
<p>If this works, also try to copy the link&nbsp;with the following space prior to pasting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No guarantees, but I would be interested to know how this works for her.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem.&nbsp; That is, when I copy the signature with the URL embedded in it from an email, I cannot paste it into another email.&nbsp; However, I can paste it successfully&nbsp;into a document.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, I can copy the hyperlink itself&nbsp;out of the document and paste it into the email.&nbsp; But I cannot copy a text associated with an underlying hyperlink.&nbsp; That is, the text can be copied but the underlying hyperlink is lost.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So the Clipboard function capability works from email to document, and works if you only copy a URL from a document to an email, but it does not work when you copy a text with an underlying URL from a document to an email.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>

<br />
I attempted what you suggested Tom, but it did not work. I will try pasting it into another document next time I have access to the laptop. Like I said, this was very sudden.<br />
<br />
I read somewhere that having Firefox set as a default browser may affect it, but I'm unsure how it would cause such a problem. Any other thoughts?<br />

            <p>Hello Luke,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interesting enough I also have a saved draft in which I have saved URLs. I can copy and paste with no problem (I just now tried this). Clicking on the URLs does not work, neither in the draft nor in the new email - but - hovering over any of the URLs it
 says "CTRL + click to follow link:" and this works just fine. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I now&nbsp;realize this is not your issue, and I do not know enough about links, hyperlinks, and URLs to help. I will do some experimenting and investigating on my own to see what I can learn, and I will be monitoring this thread as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully someone will have a solution for you&nbsp;- good luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tom</p>
<p>Update: I just created and inserted a hyperlink, copied and pasted successfully, and "CTRL + click to follow link:" worked just fine. I am beginning to suspect some setting or settings may be causing your issue. More investigating coming up!</p>

            <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Windows Live Mail support forum. I apologize that it took us more time than usual to reply to your question. I understand that hyperlinks are not working. To isolate the issue, make sure that you are using the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/essentials-other#essentials=overviewother" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>latest version of Windows Live Mail</strong></a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've checked it on our end and it is working. I was able to copy and paste the link from Windows Live Mail to another email. I was also able to click the links after saving them to Drafts and after sending a test email to my account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To sort this out, we would need some information from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the issue occur on a specific link or to all links?</li><li>Has anything changed on your system?</li><li>Did you make any Windows Updates?</li><li>Do you have firewall or anti-virus installed?</li><li>Does the issue occur after sending the email with the links or when composing?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I upgraded to Essentials 2012 and I still have the problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let me be very specific as to what happens for me.&nbsp; I include an example below:&nbsp;I have an email (see below) that I forward and in that newly created&nbsp;email,&nbsp;I then copy the content and I paste the content into the same email at the top.&nbsp; So what you see below
 has no links at the top but does have links in the forwarded email.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The problem is on all links.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I use Microsoft anti-virus and their firewall.&nbsp; I have Updates done automatically.&nbsp; I will post what updates have recently been installed since for me this problem is just the past week or 2 or 3 - not sure exactly how long.</p>

            <p>Hi Larry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome and thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I would suggest you to install all the latest updates released by Microsoft from Windows Updates and check if that helps or not. And to update your drivers, please follow the steps and let us know if it helps fixing the issue or not:</p>
<p>Open <strong>Device Manager</strong> by pressing <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, click on
<strong>Control Panel</strong>; select <strong>System and Maintenance</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>In <strong>Device Manager</strong>, locate&nbsp;<strong>Touch Screen</strong>&nbsp;and double-click to check if it’s working properly.</li><li>Go to <strong>Driver</strong> tab, then click on <strong>Update Driver</strong>. And follow the instructions.</li></ol>
<p>If there are other drivers showing with exclamation mark, update them using the same steps from above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know if this fixes your issue or not, we will be happy to help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I went to the touch screen controller selection under Device Manager and it said the device was working correctly (but that is not correct) and I also checked the driver status and it said I have the latest driver.&nbsp; When I go to the
 event log it shows the following sequence during my upgrade to Windows 10):</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>8/6/2015 7:43:36 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Device migrated</li><li>8/6/2015 7:43:36 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Device configured (input.inf)</li><li>8/6/2015 7:43:36 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Device started (Hid Usb)</li><li>8/6/2015 8:26:54 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Device configured (oem 102.inf)</li><li>8/6/2015 8:26:54 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Device started (xtouch)</li><li>8/6/2015 8:26:54 AM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Device installed (xtouch.inf)</li></ol>
<p>The information box for the last step says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver Management concluded the process to install driver xtouch.inf_amd64_a36b01bfe8e902a7\xtouch.inf for Device Instance ID USB\VID_0EEF&amp;PID_C04D\6&amp;355609F4&amp;0&amp;7 with the following status: 0x0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So ... if I am understanding everything correctly, the systems thinks it installed the touch screen driver correctly but it still does not work (and it was working when Windows 8.1 was installed).&nbsp; Any other ideas?</p>
<p>

<p>Do a clean boot <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>&nbsp;and see if Delivery Manager is restored. and the problem is resolved&nbsp; If so, it's just a matter of finding the culptrit causing the problem.&nbsp; Follow
 the procedures in the article until you find the problem and then delete, remove, disable, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Don't foreget to return your PC to normal status as described in the article when you are done.</p>
<p>The problem may be a program running at startup.&nbsp; Download Autoruns <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a>&nbsp;and click the Everything Tab.&nbsp; Find the problem program and remove the checkmark so it will no longer start at startup.&nbsp; While you're at it you might want to take the time&nbsp; to clean up&nbsp; the other
 entries on the list - most aren't really needed at startup and they take up valuable resources running in the background for no reason.&nbsp; When i did this on my system, I removed over 90% of the items from startup and it showed a notiiceable improvement in startup,
 working on the ysstem during the day, and at shutdown.</p>
<p>If clean boot and cleaning the startup entries doesn't resolve the problem, try booting into safe mode (by repeatedly clicking the F8 button during bootup until the menu appears) and see if Delivery Manager functions there and the problem no longer occurs.</p>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work (it works a bit different than the above instructions but if you follow the prompts on the disks and know the above information you should be able
 to restore with no problems).</span></p>
<p><span>I hope one of these solutions resolves your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with&nbsp; results of how each procedure worked or didn't work and we'll try to find some
 other options to try.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>As I understand you are facing issue with Black Screen of Death. I would like to know more information, so that I could help you better.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you get any error code or error message?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When exactly you get the black screen?</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it while using any specific program or application?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Stop errors (also sometimes called blue screen or black screen errors) can occur if a serious problem causes Windows 7 to shut down or restart unexpectedly. You might see a message that says, "Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer."
</span></p>
<p><span>These errors can be caused by both hardware and software issues, and it can be difficult to troubleshoot the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us try the following methods; I am sure these methods will help you resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Boot to safe mode and check if the issue persists, if the issue does not persist then the issue may be due any third party application. To determine which third party application is causing this issue.</p>

            Hello J baker1210, <br />
<br />
Go to the event viewer and see if there are any error message around the time that the computer is going to a black screen. This will help to try and pinpoint the issue that is occurring.
<br />
<br />
<span>Open Event Viewer by clicking the <span>Start</span> button
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%2520Vista%2fmain%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33_47.png" />, clicking
<span>Control Panel</span>, clicking <span>System and Maintenance</span>, clicking
<span>Administrative Tools</span>, and then double-clicking <span>
Event Viewer</span>.</span>‌ <span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%2520Vista%2fmain%2f18abb370-ac1e-4b6b-b663-e028a75bf05b_41.png" />
 If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
Check the System event viewer and the application event viewer for errors. <br />
<br />
Please reply back and let us know what you find in the logs. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
<br />

<p>You should understand that shutting down Windows using the ON button is a risky behaviour.&nbsp; When you do that, you prevent Windows from doing a proper shutdown.&nbsp; There is a chance that this will cause corruption on the hard drive.&nbsp; Each time you do this,
 you increase the probability that this will happen.&nbsp; Eventually leading to a system that will have to be re-installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are getting system shutdowns, that means there is something wrong that you will need to get fixed urgently.&nbsp; It is likely a hardware problem and the most common cause is over-heating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yours is a laptop, make certain you do not use it when it is on a soft surface.&nbsp; A laptop breathes by pulling fresh air into the tiny vents on the bottom of your computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yours is a desktop design, you need to properly shut down, remove power and check the fans.&nbsp; They may be clogged with dust and you will need to carefully blow that out, or one or more of those fans may have or is in the process of failing.</p>

<h2>            applying detail categories to multiple folders</h2>
                    I have a bunch of folders that Windows thinks are music folders. When I switch to detail view I get the default "name, Artists, Album, #, Genre, Rating" categories.
<br />
<br />
For one folder I can tediously change the categories to "Name, Title, Album, Length, Size". But I would much prefer a way to apply these settings to multiple folders. Is there a way to do this?<br />
<br />

 Default behaviour is to select the template based on the first type of file placed in the folder (it has to choose something).&nbsp; Vista sets the Explorer window view settings and

 type template</span></span></strong></a><span> according to what folder types are in the window. This will show you how to reset the
<strong>Windows Explorer folder view settings (part of what you want to do)</strong>, turn off
<strong>Automatic Folder Type Discovery (which is I think the other part of what you want)</strong>, and increase the
<strong>folder view cache</strong> to have Vista remember the view settings, folder type template, size, or position of a specific window for when it was last closed at the specific path location.<br />
<br />
This does not work with the sub <strong>Save As</strong>, <strong>Open With</strong>,

            Lorien, the 108665 article is a step in the right direction, the tip at the bottom allows me to change the settings for all the folders that windows categorizes as music (of the 6 possible types of data for which Microsoft created templates.).
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately not all my audio files are best served with the same categories. I would have preferred to have the option to apply these changes to my group of 70 folders rather than to the entire "music folders" template. I would prefer if the template change
 would be less global.<br />
<br />
If any Microsoft developers are reading, it would by nice to copy and paste folder settings. Also the folder should be able to detect what attributes are available to display, then make an attempt to pick the most relevant ones. For example, don't hide "file
 size" from me in order to replace it with an empty "tags" column.

I'm not sure, but I think between them they will get you to where you want to be going (if I understand you&nbsp;correctly).<br />
<br />
If these don't do the trick, then I'm afraid that perhaps this is something to add to the wish list for whatever OS comes after Windows7 because it probably isn't possible within Vista (but still maybe someone else will reply with a solution I was not aware
 of - so there's still hope).<br />

I sincerely hope this helps and resolves your question.<br />

P.S.&nbsp; I VERY much doubt Microsoft Developers are reading these forums though they may have one or two people assigned to do so for all of them to look for good ideas but with so many posts it would be very unlikely they'd pick this particular thread to review,
 decide the issue was worth pursuing, and make it happen in an update or in the next OS.&nbsp; But we can always dream.

Your reply was helpful, but not an answer.<br />
<br />
It looks like there is no way to apply settings to a batch of folders without modifying the entire template.<br />
<br />
It won't even keep my settings If I set up a folder as desired, then copy it.<br />
<br />
As a work around, I was did modify the entire template for folders containing music files. While slightly better for me than the default settings, this is still not a good way to do it.<br />

Unfortunately, there is no answer that will resolve your question as you wish the answer to be.&nbsp; It just isn't possible with Vista (and I think the same holds true for Windows7).&nbsp; What I provided
 That's the best we can do given the limitations of Vista - it would be good if it could do what you want (and it's something you should suggest to them for their next OS or perhaps for an update to their current OS systems) - I'd love to be able to do that
 myself.&nbsp; I'm glad you see it as helpful and sorry you don't see it as an answer.&nbsp; It's the only answer possible (even if it doesn't solve your problem).<br />
<br />
What you said is true - there is no way to apply settings to a batch of folders without modifying the entire template and it won't keep your settings if you set up a folder as desired and copy it (because it reverts to the template).&nbsp; I've looked, and there
 is no 3rd party application which can do this either (I checked Bing, Google, <a href="http://www.tucows.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.tucows.com</a>, <a href="http://www.download.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.download.com</a>) - it just isn't possible.&nbsp; I don't remember if XP had this capability or not (I think it did) - some good functions in XP were lost when they went to Vista and Windows7 (unfortunately).<br />
<br />
I'm glad what I provided was helpful and I'm sorry Vista or any 3rd party applications can't accomplish what you desire - that's just the way it is.<br />
<br />
Now that you know where we are, feel free to post back anytime with any further questions or problems and we'll do our best to help you answer them (or advise you if it is possible with Vista).<br />
<br />
Thank you for the feedback.<br />
<br />
Good luck!

            No. It's a temporary folder but try disk cleanup first and see if that helps. If you haven't already ran it then you could still have backup files from your previous system. You need to run a scan first then select system files and let it run again and
 select what to remove.

<h2>            Reboot and select proper boot device</h2>
                    So, I started receiving this message about 7 months ago when I would first turn on my pc. I looked it up to see what the possible solutions were for it and the first one I came across was making sure the boot order was correct.&nbsp; So, I figured I would try
 that and pressed control, alt, delete to restart the pc to get to the bios settings, only to be surprised that it was booting up normally now.&nbsp; I went on with the issue occurring every now and then but never actually checking the bios settings.&nbsp; Now, about
 6 months later, the problem occurs every time I turn the pc on.&nbsp; It no longer moves past the black screen and I struggle to get the pc to the windows login screen.&nbsp; Since the issue hasn't gone away, I've tried the several methods that are supposed to fix it.&nbsp;
 These include changing the bios order, making sure the disk partitions are correct, and even doing a fresh install of windows 10.&nbsp; I've noticed that in the bios menu, nothing shows up in the hdd

            Hi Matt.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year WIndows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />For a UEFI install - which you can check in Start menu&gt;All Apps&gt;WIndows Admin Tools&gt;System Information under BIOS mode - it's only correct to have the WIndows Boot Manager set first to boot, CSM or Legacy BIOS disabled unless you have another hard drive with an older MBR install that also boots, Secure Boot and Fast Boot enabled.  Sometimes there are problems with that latter two so you can try disabling them to compare startup.
<br />
<br />I would run a few Startup Repairs to check over the boot files:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/startup-repair-faq#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/star...</a>
<br />
<br />You said you reinstalled but did you clear the hard drive of all partitions down to Unallocated Space which is the only Clean install?  If not I'd do it over and this time follow the gold standard Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, and has zero reported problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />In this case because strray boot code could be a cause I would first access the Command Prompt to clean the hard drive of code with Diskpart Clean Command:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/52129-disk-clean-clean-all-diskpart-command.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/52129-disk...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to try to repair what you have and the above don't help then to continue please post back a screenshot of Disk Management which we read like doctors read Xrays:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/post-a-screenshot-of-disk-mgmt/04a8ef8c-c882-404e-a26b-89867c4ddf55?tm=1441932228382">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/foru...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />Sounds like a hardware issue, especially since you re-installed Windows and it was still consistent. Unfortunately, software cannot fix hardware.
<br />
<br />Check the hard drive cabling (data and power).
<br />
<br />After that check the hard drive with the maker's diagnostic tool.
<br />Run the appropriate one of these and/or the trial versions below.
<br />
<br />If using an SSD check with its maker's support.
<br />

            I've tried doing most of what was suggested here.&nbsp; The bios reset and checking the cables didn't do anything.&nbsp; I've tried running the smart data for the hdd and everything shows up fine as does the hdd under device manager which should mean the hdd isn't
 failing.

            Did you run the maker's diagnostics? 
<br />
<br />If so and there is no cable issue then it is either in the hard drive's firmware or on the motherboard such as the drive controller.
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />You can try these, however, I have little faith it is anything on the drive's platters however it is worth a shot.
<br />
<br />How to make a Windows 10 Installation/Repair DVD or USB driver in last section below.
<br />
<br />Boot with a Installation or Repair disc or USB drive - issue these from the Command 
<br />
<br />Prompt and hit ENTER after each.
<br />
<br />C:
<br />
<br />bootrec /fixmbr
<br />
<br />bootrec /fixboot
<br />
<br />bootrec /scanos
<br />
<br />bootrec /rebuildbcd
<br />
<br />After the above you may need to run StartUp Repair (even 2 or 3 times)

<br />
<br /> ---------------------
<br />
<br />Using EasyBCD often works when other methods do not. &lt;-- if Bootrec did not help use this.
<br />
<br />Translate the Windows 8/8.1 methods to Windows 10.

            just a quick question:&nbsp; I went and looked at the disk partitions again.&nbsp; On my actual computer, it says that my c:, where windows is installed, is set to disk 0.&nbsp; When I go under the command prompt to change the ordering, it shows the c: as being under
 disk 1.&nbsp; Is there a reason these are changed?

            could it still be the hard drive even though it shows up on the computer and seems to be working fine?
