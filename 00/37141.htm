    <title>How do I get to Safe Mode in Windows 10 before starting&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dan_367  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get to Safe Mode in Windows 10 before starting&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In Windows 7 it was simple. All I had to do was tap the F8 key repeatedly every 1 second. Will that work with Windows 10 also? &nbsp; &nbsp;the reason I'm asking is will it pass that other picture screen that comes on with normal startup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>I hate to sound totally not grateful, but is there no simple way to go to Safe Mode with one key like with Windows 7, when you turn on the computer and just before it starts? Why would Microsoft make something so simple, so difficult?</p>
<p>Maybe I'm missing the point. &nbsp; For instance with my Windows 7 computer (desktop) if the electricity goes off and the computer shuts down, which of course it will. When I turn it back on after electricity is restored, I will automatically get and option from
 the Safe Mode as to how to start Windows. &nbsp;There is a little countdown timer, about 20 seconds which will start the computer normally if I do nothing or I can go to Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking. From there it will let me test the memory or do a Restore
 to a previous date if there was a problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens with Windows 10 when you lose electricity?</p>

            <p>With the advent of SSD drives and fast boot the option to F8 into safe mode was eliminated because it could not be done quickly enough to register.&nbsp; Literally the place in the boot where you would have to hit the key is over before the monitor even it lit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has nothing to do with the countdown timer but rather when the inital key needs to be pushed</p>
<p>

            I don't know how it could be much quicker than &nbsp;hitting F8 5 or 6 times... &nbsp;Just hope I never need Safe Mode with Windows 10.

<p>Thank you for replying back with the status of this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Replacing the CPU will leads to activation issues in windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<div>The only hardware changes that can negatively impact activation status once you upgrade to free version are the changes to the:<br />
1.CPU <br />
2.TPM <br />
3.Motherboard replacement</div>
<div>
<p>The following changes are examples of hardware changes that will NOT impact the activation status:<br />
1.HDD/SSD <br />
2.Video card <br />
3.Adding extra memory</p>

<br />
There are dozens of undelete tools you can find with a search engine but your chances of recovering your data after formatting the hard disk and re-installing Windows are slim. You might have to treat this unfortunate incident as a harsh reminder that all important/irreplaceable
 files must be backed up regularly (e.g. weekly) to an external storage medium. No exceptions.<br />

</p>
<p>Microsoft does not provide any applications that can recover data. Hence, I would suggest you to browse the Internet using your favorite search engine and look for other applications that can recover data after a format of the hard drive.<br />

    <title>Slow LAN Transfers Between Win7-64 bit and NAS box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> madmax1412  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow LAN Transfers Between Win7-64 bit and NAS box</h2>
                    Hi Guys,<br />
<br />
I have a Win 7 65-bit computer and a Thecus N2200 NAS Box which has just 1 x 1TB disk (ie not raided or anything - JBOD)<br />
<br />
On my Win7 computer I have created mapped drives to the 2 directories on the NAS box where I transfer shows I've recorded on my TV Card. These directories are "Movies" and "Shows".<br />
<br />
I have noticed that most of the time, once I've trimmed up my shows, that I can right-click and drag them to these networked drives (eg Y for \\N2200\Shows and Z for \\N2200\Movies) and select "Move" and the detailed dialogue box can show them transferring
 anywhere from 2 to 6 MB/Sec.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, on occasions, when I do this, the transfer speed will be something like 26kb/sec with an estimated completion time of say 10 hours. Yet I can click on the Y or Z drive and immediately see the existing files on the NAS box, plus I can double-click
 on one of the video files and play it back on the Win7 computer. Furthermore, playing/browsing these media files from either one of my 2 Network Media Players (Zensonic machines) isn't an issue.<br />
<br />
There have been times when transfer speeds are slow, ie 26kb/sec so I stop the transfer and try the following:<br />
1 - Reboot Win 7 box (actually do a power off) - No improvement<br />
2 - Reboot NAS box as well - No improvement<br />
3 - Checked drivers are latest drivers - no improvement<br />
4 - Disabled IP6 - no improvement<br />
<br />
Lastly, on occasions when the transfer speed has been slow, I've left the computer alone and gone to work only to remote access it later from work (using LogMeIn) and tried the transfer again (Explorer window still open from previous failed attempt) and now
 the transfer happens at 3MB/Sec. Nothing was changed, no cables touched, no boxes/switches/routers turned off or anything and yet my transfer speed has magically re-appeared.<br />
<br />
During these slow LAN transfers, I can still download large files from the internet very quickly.<br />
<br />
I've checked various posts about slow LAN transfer speeds with Win7 and have tried the recommended solutions (latest drivers, changing from auto detect to 100Mbs Full Duplex, disable IPv6, etc) but nothing works. There's no rhyme or reason why it suddenly slows
 or comes back. Most of the threads regarding slow LAN speeds seem to be for people who's speed is always slow, not intermittent like mine.<br />
<br />
I suspect it might be some Windows service that stops (or hangs) but don't know which one to look at.<br />
<br />
It's annoying at the moment, so when it does happen, I just leave my TV shows on the WIN7 computer until the next time the transfers happen again at 2MB/sec+.<br />
<br />
This leads onto one other problem I'm having which I'll raise a different thread.&nbsp; I wouldn't be so upset about not being able to put my shows on the N2200 NAS box so I can watch them on my Zensonic Media Players if I could get Win7 to share drives.<br />
<br />
Back to the slow network transfer issues, I've seen on another forum that someone found the free AVG anti-virus was the cause for their problem.&nbsp; This sounded reasonable, as perhaps it was trying to scan files before/whilst transferring them, but I totally
 uninstalled AVG 9 and it didn't make a difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Is there any logs that I can provide that might give a clue such as what it's trying to do when it making the transfers?<br />
2) Is there any services that should be (or should not be) running which may impact performance.<br />
<br />
I have mapped my drives as follows:<br />
<br />
\\N2200\Shows<br />
\\192.169.1.10\Shows<br />
<br />
I've also:<br />
<br />
1) gone and expanded the Network section of Explorer and tried dragging the files to that rather than a mapped drive but still no luck.<br />
2) unchecked IPv6 in the network adapter settings<br />
<br />
Surely there must be some logging that is either happening or can be turned on to find out what the problem is. I can click on one of the network drives to the NAS and it usually displays the contents immediately (sometimes there's a lag of a second or so).
 The NAS box must be working ok as the wife and I can both be watching different shows from it at the same time with no issues (we have 2 network media players).<br />
<br />
I'm using the standard built in Windows Firewall. Is there something there that can be set to say anything in an IP range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.10 is trusted both ways and not to block anything (this might also fix the Shared folder issue perhaps)????<br />
<br />
This is very frustrating. As mentioned in my post, sometimes the high transfer speed will come back of it's own accord, either after restarting or even being left alone without a restart, but I've now got TV shows from the 15th Feb that I still haven't been
 able to transfer given the fact I try at least once or twice a day and it still wouldn't transfer up to the 21st Feb.<br />
<br />
On the 22nd Feb, I booted up the computer and once again tried to transfer one file and this time it started transferring at around 4MB/sec. So I then grabbed the 10 or so other TV shows that I haven't been able to transfer since the 15th Feb and dragged them
 to the mapped drive and within a couple of hours, they had all transferred.<br />
<br />
Mind you, this is how it goes. Randomly, and sometimes without even restarting the computer, my transfer speeds either go from Great (3-5MB/sec) down to pathethic speeds (26kb/s) or vise versa.<br />
<br />
That's why I suspect it might be some service that needs to be running for good network transfer speeds (or perhaps not running, if the service is putting too much overhead on the system).<br />
<br />
That's why I'm hoping there's some logging that I can examine and compare a good transfer speed to when I have lousy speed.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p><strong>Hi, As mentioned earlier, I totally uninstall the AVG 9 Free Anti-virus software and that did not make a difference.

</span></p>
<p><strong>I've turned Flow Control off and the network adapter reset. I then tried to do a transfer of a 5.47GB file (a movie I taped last night) and as you can see from this screenshot (
<a href="http://i989.photobucket.com/albums/af12/Mad_Max_1412/Slow_Network_Transfers.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Click Here</a> ), the speed is down to 634kb/sec. It did start around 900kb/sec and went up a little before dropping down. I have seen it get down around 26kb/sec and if I leave it and come back, it claims it's lost the connection to the network drive.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
EDIT - I have done a re-boot and currently the file transfer rate is good - minimum 5MB/sec.&nbsp; Because I've had random times after a re-boot where transfer speed has been good, I won't be convinced until I've checked it over a few days.<br />
<br />
I will keep an eye on it over the next few days and see how it goes, but here's hoping it's ok now.<br />

            Hi Guys,<br />
<br />
Well, I knew I shouldn't have got excited about the high transfer speed being back.&nbsp; This morning (ie the day after my previous update) I turned on the computer and tried a transfer of another file and the transfer rate was about 161kb/sec. See screenshot

            Hi Guys,<br />
<br />
Is there anything else you would like me to try?<br />
<br />
It's annoying that I've got programs on this Win7 computer that I can't watch on my network media player (see another thread about directory sharing) and I can't move these files to the NAS box easily.&nbsp; Basically I just have to wait for that random time when
 transfers between this Win7 computer and the NAS box is fast enough and then do a transfer.

<p>Hi MadMax,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you ever find the solution to your problem? I have nearly the same situation, except my slow access is limited to my 802.11 (both g and n) accessing my NAS. Wireless internet is very fast and robust, my signal is good, and a cabled network access to
 the NAS is fine as well. Over the last year, I've had problems browsing my network, finding files, opening/moving/copying files, etc.</p>
I've been trying to get this Dell Studio 15 to work since August 2009, and I'm at my wits end. If I can't find the solution within the next three days, I'm off to the Apple store for a Macbook pro and this thing goes on eBay.
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tom</p>

<p>Tom,</p>

<p>It appears as though one of my switch boxes may have been starting to fail.&nbsp; It was a 10/100 4 port unit.&nbsp; I ended up buying a Gigabyte version and transfers are now flying.&nbsp; I used the 10/100 in the loungeroom shortly after as I only one LAN socket but
 had purchased a Blu-Ray unit which meant I now had 2 devices (network media player and Blu-ray) and performance was spotty.&nbsp; Sometimes the Blu-ray would be able to connect to the internet to get firmware updates, other times it would fail.&nbsp; Bought another
 cheap switch and replaced the 10/100 unit and haven't had a problem since.</p>

    <title>Recurring Teredo Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> generalwillis44  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recurring Teredo Problems</h2>
                    <p>A few days back I bought Forza Horizon 4 to play with some friends, only to have my first encounter with Teredo. At the time, the error on the Network tab of my Xbox app's settings said Teredo unable to qualify. 2 hours of troubleshooting via google later,
 my computer was finally able to make a Teredo connection.</p>
<p>The next day, I encountered the same problem, as if nothing had ever been fixed. That time it took about 1 hour to fix via the same methods as before, repeated ad nauseum.</p>
<p>The next day I encountered the same problem, and it took around 30 minutes to fix, out of sheer luck.</p>
<p>Today I have been entirely unable to fix my connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a list of things I have done:</p>
<p>- Updated Windows to the most current version, despite its reportedly file-deleting tendencies</p>
<p>- Uninstalled my old antivirus and enabled Windows Defender and Windows Firewall on the default settings</p>
<p>- Set date and time automatically</p>
<p>- Checked services.msc for any incorrect settings</p>
<p>- Port forwarding ad ridiculum</p>
<p>- Tweaked Registry entries until golden brown</p>
<p>- Disabled and reenabled Teredo with different combinations of types and servers.</p>
<p>There may be fixes that I have tried and forgotten about, I've spent so much time dealing with this.<br />
</p>
<p>Help.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/953aa641-9c8d-4061-b0e0-42e9cc0c57c0" title="DuaneClark">
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's bizarre that this is happening whenever you sign into the Skype application. Normally, Skype will automatically turn your status to
<strong>Active </strong>whenever you sign into the Skype application. But since you're getting this experience, let's look for possible ways to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are signed in to Skype on multiple devices, please sign out from the Skype applications on all of your devices except the one on your Android device. After, please monitor if the issue will persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please consider the following troubleshooting steps and let me know what happens:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to your Android device's settings and look for Applications or Application Manager.</span></li><li><span>Look for Skype, and then select <strong>Force Stop</strong> &gt; <strong>Clear cache</strong> &gt;
<strong>Clear Data</strong> &gt; <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</span></li><li><span>After uninstalling, kindly reboot your device.</span></li><li><span>Once it is up, please install Skype using Google Play Store.</span></li><li><span>After installing Skype, please restart your device again&nbsp;before signing in.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking forward to your response.</p>

            Hi Katydid#1 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that you’ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.

            <p>Geraldvan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know this post is a few weeks old, but did you have any success?&nbsp; I have a version of Bicycle Card Games that dates back to 2001 and Bicycle Board Games that states "New for 2004" on the outside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what worked for me:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Bicycle Card Games, I installed from the CD as usual.&nbsp; When it completed, there&nbsp;was a screen that asked if&nbsp;I wanted to run the game, view the readme, etc.&nbsp; Close out of that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Browse to the folder&nbsp;where the game is installed&nbsp;(mine is C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Bicycle Card Games) and open the application (mine is BicycleCard.exe).&nbsp; Accept the EULA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, nothing happened and the screen reverted to my desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right click on BicycleCard.exe.&nbsp; Under the compatibility tab, select run this game under Windows 95 and select run in 640x480 screen resolution.&nbsp; The game runs for me with this combination, albeit the card motions are not smooth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the newer Bicycle Board Games, I installed it from the CD as usual.&nbsp; When it completed,&nbsp;it also presented a screen that asked me if&nbsp;I wanted to run the game, view the readme, etc.&nbsp; Again, close this out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Browse to the folder where the game is installed.&nbsp; I right clicked on the application (BBoard2.exe) and made sure to unselect<em>
</em>the box to run in compatibility mode.&nbsp; Do select to run in reduced color mode (I chose 16-bit color).&nbsp; Run the game and accept the EULA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The slightly newer Board Games runs smoother than the Card Games.&nbsp; If these combinations don't work for you, keep playing around with the options on the&nbsp;compatibility tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, also make certain to run older games from icons&nbsp;on the desktop.&nbsp; Many of my older applications will not run properly from the Start Screen, but will run when launched from the desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for the delay in replying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand thaat you want to set up a time limit in one of the user account. As, it is not possible on windows by design and no such feature exists within.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also,&nbsp; you can post you query in the techNet forum as well to get the resolution:</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There is a possibility that this is due to the changes in <strong>Power Options</strong>. For us to properly isolate the issue, kindly verify the queries below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What steps have you taken to restart your PC?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done to fix the issue?</li><li>Have you changed any settings from the <strong>Power Options</strong>?</li></ul>
<p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I restart my PC the same way by clicking the windows logo, clicking the power logo and selecting restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The troubleshooting I've done is only searching in the internet with the same issue but I cant find one. Only windows 7 with the same issue and windows 10 restarts after selecting shutdown is only available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. In power &amp; sleep options, I changed the setting when the screen turns off to never.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I was able to fix already this issue. What I only did is update my motherboard's BIOS version. After updating, my pc restarts normally again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for responding.</p>
