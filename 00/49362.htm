<h2>            Need to make change to User Account Control Settings but can&#39;t access &#40;windows 7Prof.-64bit&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Laptop with Windows 7 Professional,&nbsp; 64-bit&nbsp; </p>
<p>I am the "Standard User" and only user of my laptop.&nbsp; I don't know if I have an Administrator Account.&nbsp; I may have had&nbsp;it or something&nbsp;with similar name&nbsp;when first setting up laptop and loading Windows program (few years ago).&nbsp; But I recall that it caused
 Windows to always show the two&nbsp;accounts and choose one to log-in to.&nbsp; I didn't want any choices since I'm only user of laptop, so I figured how to rid of the other account (Admin.?) and kept the Standard User because the "Help" instructions indicated it best
 to use that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are so many programs I cannot open because the User Account Control box displays "Do you want to allow the following program to make changes....?"&nbsp;&nbsp; The "Yes" choice is&nbsp;NEVER highlighted or&nbsp;available-- only the "No" choice can be clicked. &nbsp;And the
 same dialogue box also asks&nbsp;but there isn't a place to type "Administrator Password".&nbsp; I don't even have an Admin. Password, or a password for the Standard User account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I'm referring to all kinds of programs that cannot open up, like&nbsp; "Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool" that I downloaded from Microsoft website.&nbsp; Or&nbsp;I went into Control Panel to "User Account", but trying to&nbsp; click "Change User Account Control settings"
 brings the same&nbsp;display, "Do you want to allow the following program to make changes to computer?"&nbsp; Or&nbsp;when&nbsp;at the Computer System page, I cannot&nbsp;access&nbsp;"Advanced System Settings" because of same dialogue box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to fix this?&nbsp; I prefer not to have choices of accounts when Windows opens up.&nbsp; I've looked through other similar threads here (only Windows 7 related), and some instruct to make changes to Registry.&nbsp; That is very intimidating to me.&nbsp; I am not an IT person
 at all, but fairly savvy with the computer.&nbsp; This problem has me stuck.&nbsp; Another&nbsp;advice on a thread says to use "Fix It".&nbsp; That program isn't available anymore (we are now 2016). &nbsp;I've also been living with the problem for all this time but am quite frustrated
 again and wanted to try post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I re-load the Windows program and do something different?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can provide some less intimidating process than touching Registry to correct this.&nbsp; I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Massachusetts</p>

            <p><em>I may have had&nbsp;it or something&nbsp;with similar name&nbsp;when first setting up laptop and loading Windows program (few years ago).</em></p>
<p>-&gt; Yes, you did.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I figured how to rid of the other account (Admin.?) and kept the Standard User because the "Help" instructions indicated it best to use that.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; This was a bad decision. It was equivalent to throwing away the master key to your safe. There is a far better method to avoid the choice between several accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I don't even have an Admin. Password, or a password for the Standard User account.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; You had an admin password when your first set up Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I prefer not to have choices of accounts when Windows opens up.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; It takes 30 seconds to eliminate this choice, without loss of the admin account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Some instruct to make changes to Registry.</em></p>
<p>-&gt; Hacking the registry will not restore your admin account. "Fix It" will not fix it either.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Should I re-load the Windows program and do something different?</em></p>
<p>-&gt; Your first step must be to determine what accounts you have and if they are active. It's done like so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mark the first code line below with your mouse, then press Ctrl+C to copy it.</li><li>Click the Start button, press Ctrl+V to paste the code into the Run box, then press Enter.</li><li>Mark the second code line below with your mouse, then press Ctrl+C to copy it.</li><li>Click the Start button, press Ctrl+V to paste the code into the Run box, then press Enter.</li><li>Open the desktop file Accounts.txt, then copy &amp; paste its contents into your reply.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>cmd.exe &nbsp;/c &nbsp;net &nbsp;users &gt;&gt; "%userprofile%\Desktop\Accounts.txt"</p>
<p>cmd.exe &nbsp;/c &nbsp;net &nbsp;localgroup administrators &gt;&gt; "%userprofile%\Desktop\Accounts.txt"</p>

    <title>Gaomon Pen Tablet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colin5xb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gaomon Pen Tablet</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased a Gaomon Pen Tablet for using in Paintshop Pro. It works perfectly with Microsoft Paint but this doesn't have all the features that Paintshop Pro (PSP) has and is just basic software. The Pen tablet is not working properly in PSP it works
 with some tools but not others and doesn't work at all in Particle Shop. I have been advised on the Corel Forum to uninstall it and disable Anti-Virus, shut down the internet and go into the device manager and remove all pen and Tablet drivers including the
 Digitizer Driver. Now this is were it gets tricky I have no idea what I'm looking for in the device manager and am I going to compromise my computer by messing about with things I don't understand. Could anyone help with this or do I just forget about the
 device manager and not use the tablet in PSP.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS There is a pathway from the Gaomon Driver to PSP so it is meant to be run in that program.</p>

            In Device Manager it will probably be under 2 places.
<br />Go to 'Human Interface Devices' look for Gaomon or pen device
<br />Go to 'Mice and Other pointing devices' look for Gaomon or pen device
<br />and right click and select to delete.
<br />
<br />Just make sure you have the make and model of your machine before doing this.  That way if you accidentally delete something you can go the vendor site and download the drivers for your machine.
<br />You can even do that ahead of time just in case.

<ul>
<li>I use Windows 7 x64 Home Premium. I routinely backup my files and create a system image, each on a separate drive from my primary drive with the OS on it. I defrag my primary drive on a daily basis. Recently I needed to restore some files from the backup
 drive. All of the data restored successfully, sort of. Some of my documents and music were restored intact, but the information in the Folders was out of sequence. For example, although the entire music Album/CD was restored, it was restored in two pieces
 with 5 songs on one piece and the other five on another in an identical folder name. I wound up with two identical folders and album artwork for Patti Smith instead of one. I never de-fragged the backups. But after this, I am asking if I should start?

<p>Not sure what would cause that, probably some sort of corruption. Run Checkdisk on that drive.<br />
Defragging would not solve the issue in any way and might make it worse.<br />

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I will certainly help you with the issue that you are facing. This issue usually arises due to outdated or incompatible drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you mentioned that the drivers are not available for Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 for your computer, I would recommend you to install the driver in compatibility mode for Windows 7 and check if it
 works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Install in compatibility mode</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may also try to install it compatibility mode. After downloading the setup file from the support website of Samsung, try the following steps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a. <strong>Right click</strong> on the setup file of the driver and select
<strong>Properties</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Select <strong>Compatibility Tab</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Place a check mark next to Run this program in Compatibility mode and select the operating system accordingly from the drop down list.</span></span></p>
<p><span>d. Let the driver to install and then check the functionality</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Hope this information was helpful. Let us know the results once you have tried installing the driver in compatibility mode.</span></p>

            <p>Hello and thanks Sahil for your welcome and quick help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the long text, but I have been trying more than your proposed actions. Sad news, nothing helped. Let's start with your solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed the settings as you suggested:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6162ed20-aa3c-41de-9231-4595a47f753d" /></p>
<p>Sorry for the German, but thanks to language-independent GUI and language analogy "Kompatibilität" &lt;-&gt; "compatibility" this should be understandable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I now start the setup, the program compatibility assistant still reports of compatibility issues and let's me search the online help or just close it.<br />
</p>
<p>The online help just refers to the Broadcom website to find a solution or download an updated version.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I just closed the online help and the compatibility issue and then started the setup by right-clicking on it and choosing "Treat compatibility issues" (translation should be something like that):</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17a118f0-8bdf-4151-aa05-ab0386e6c407" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>A window (titled like "Trouble shooting for program incompatibility") appears and gives me two choices:</p>
<ul>
<li>recommended settings</li><li>Troubleshoot program (translation sounded so weird that I googled how the window looks like)</li></ul>
<p>The recommended settings suggest the compatibility mode for "Windows Vista (Service Pack 2)" and asks for testing the program. The test, after asking for privileged rights, also ends with the&nbsp;program compatibility assistant showing up and, same procedure
 as above, the online help refers to the Broadcom website.</p>
<p>I have been a little confused, why it suggested Win Vista, so I checked the download links of files on the Samsung support website. They also link to a driver version especially for Windows Vista, but it is a minor version (6.0.1.6300). As you can see the
 screenshot above, the version for Win 7 is 6.2.1.0100. So I got the right file, but something must be wrong with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I tried the other option and started the troubleshoot program. I checked the 1st entry, that the program has been running on older versions of Windows (loosely translated), and the 3rd, because it asks for privileged rights. Now the suggested settings
 are "Windows 7" and additional "run as administrator", but same things -&gt; program compatibility assistant -&gt; online help -&gt; Broadcom website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I went through all options I got and still there is no other bluetooth driver installed. I am still thankful for every help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>There was some recent discussion about this.&nbsp; FWIW I only have the Bluetooth switch in Bluetooth Settings in the Devices Settings.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a convoluted path from where you are starting:&nbsp; click on View connection settings, go back to PC Settings, click
 on PC and Devices, see Bluetooth in the menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as long as Bluetooth remains enabled we can have Bluetooth in our Navigation Area.&nbsp; So that's what I use mostly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively you can try Win-w blu Enter, which is probably the most direct path to it now.</p>

            <p>Tank you, Robert, for you answer. You mention a "convoluted path", but not its starting point. I think you start with opening the charm bar (e.g. [Win]+[c]), selecting "Settings" and then the network icon in the 2x3 icons grid at the bottom (= the upper
 left icon). There the top line is "View connection settings" and the rest of your path is applicable.</p>
<p>I went another way: [Win]+[c] in the bottom line "Change PC settings" and then I can select "PC and Devices" already, which should be the same as your destination, since "Bluetooth" is provided only in this menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that is not my problem. I figured out, that there should be a toggle in this bluetooth screen. However it is not there:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e3fc06f-2ae7-49f5-985a-cb766143ad78" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>It shows only to look for bluetooth devices and keeps looking forever, without giving me the possibility to turn my bluetooth off. Since I cannot turn it off via keyboard (function keys) shortcut or via Windows Mobility Center, there is no way to turn it
 off to let bluetooth devices disconnect themself after some timeout or to save power of the notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also I have some trouble to understand, what you meant with the link, but I went to the "Help with Bluetooth Toggle and other issues"-thread and also followed &nbsp;your link to the "<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-hardware/bluetooth-troubles-in-win-81-64bit/b7c8fbe1-1a90-4b00-8972-4f2db10275e9#LastReply">Bluetooth

<p>
</p><p>Though your promise that everything of this will become easier with Windows 10 (I am really, really looking forward to it, but I also fear that my old notebook will not run it without problems), I really need to turn my bluetooth off and on right now. &nbsp;So
 I am still appreciating any help. Hoper there is someone left! ;)</p>

<p>OK.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I would still use the Search Settings method instead:&nbsp;&nbsp; Win-w&nbsp; blu&nbsp; Enter.&nbsp;&nbsp; First hit in Search Settings is MUF Bluetooth Settings and that opens Manage Bluetooth Devices.&nbsp; The second hit is the Desktop Bluetooth Properties dialog which is what

            <p>Thank you for your patience and persistence.<br />
<br />
How did you get those multiple quotes. I can only quote your post as a whole, but not insert text (with white background) in between. I do not find any instruction to do so, instead I will use indents:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">That's where you implied you were looking but didn't say how you got there. &nbsp; Actually I was assuming that you had probably started from the Taskbar's Networking icon. &nbsp;Also, do you have a Bluetooth icon in the Taskbar?</p>
<p>Oh, yes Taskbar's Networking icon is a nice short-cut. I always forget what will open the Charm Bar and what will open desktop windows.<br />
So we both did not know, how the other one got there. Now everything should be clear. :)<br />
<br />
Yes, I have a bluetooth icon in the taskbar:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d2ee9f4d-236c-499b-9b32-064ad42d4154" /></p>
<p>It gives the usual options:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Add a Device"</li><li>greyed-out "Allow a Device to Connect"</li><li>"Show Bluetooth Devices"</li><li>"Join a Personal Area Network"</li><li>"Open Settings" (opens the "Desktop Bluetooth Properties dialog" you mentioned later)</li><li>"Remove Icon"</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">OK. &nbsp; But I would still use the Search Settings method instead: &nbsp; Win-w &nbsp;blu &nbsp;Enter. &nbsp; First hit in Search Settings is MUF Bluetooth Settings and that opens Manage Bluetooth Devices. &nbsp;The second hit is the Desktop Bluetooth Properties
 dialog which is what can be opened from the Taskbar icon. &nbsp;I can't tell if there is equivalent functionality in there but there is a checkbox which says "Allow Bluetooth devices to find this PC" (which I leave off) and there is also a Restore Defaults button.
 I don't know what effect trying either would have on your symptom. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are right. The [Win]+[w] shortcut is much more comfortable! Thanks for the repeated tip. Actually I tried it yesterday too, but it did not open the search Charm.. Perhaps to tiered to hit the right keys. ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the Desktop Bluetooth Properties dialog does not provide any possibility to turn the built-in Bluetooth device off.</p>
<p>Also the "Restore Defaults"-button does not change anything. My settings are the same like yours.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">BTW does &nbsp;Bluetooth Geräte Gewalten translate to "Manage Bluetooth Devices"? &nbsp;If not that might be a clue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it translates to "Manage Bluetooth Devices". The screenshot in my last post should look like this one, I found on http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/7-ways-improve-battery-life-windows-8-tablets-laptops/</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3911283f-663f-48d7-9df5-eff8588584ea" /></p>
<p>The article of the source explains with this screenshot, how to disable bluetooth, like I want to do. But as you can see in my screenshot of the last post, my computer does not provide this toggle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I was linking you to two other threads which are discussing the same symptom. &nbsp;I gave diagnostic suggestions in both but so far neither poster seems to have tried anything on that tack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read the linked thread, also the (2nd) linked thread in the (1st) linked thread. Now I have done every instruction of the 2nd thread:</p>
<ul>
<li>airplane mode is off (since I am online via WiFi)</li><li>open the troubleshooter -&gt; "System Maintenance" and -&gt; "Hardware and Devices"</li><li>rebooted with clean boot</li><li>and I set&nbsp;set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1 and uninstalled every greyed out entry in Device Manager, then uninstalled everything under Bluetooth and let it delete driver files. After the reboot my Bluetooth device was automatically installed and every
 Bluetooth Device I have uninstalled (not greyed out under Bluetooth) is back again.</li></ul>
<p>In no step, I got a bluetooth toggle showing up as in the screenshot above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In command promt as Administrator I get:</p>

<p>Because it is useful to know in that 2nd thread, I run this command logged in with my only Admin user account. But I have a 2nd account without admin rights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not done the tip of the 1st thread (ProcMon), because I think I do not know ProcMon and do not know how to use it, I think it is not installed yet (because I cannot start it).</p>
<p>

<p>How did you get those multiple quotes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Select the whole thing and Copy and Paste.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ctrl-a, Ctrl-c, Ctrl-End, Ctrl-v.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do Ctrl-v for as many chunks that you want to extract.&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually it helps to have started typing something first so that you have something separating the quotes.&nbsp; So, my procedure,
 from force of habit, is (after Reply with quote):&nbsp; Ctrl-End, Type: aaa&nbsp;(e.g. as a reminder for how many Pastes I want and then the above sequence.&nbsp; However, it turns out that this habit is no longer actually required.&nbsp; E.g. notice that there is usually a blank
 line above the quote where you could insert some opening remarks.&nbsp; Then, in that case, you can just select enough to capture anything that is in that line, the quoted section and something that is non-quoted below it.&nbsp; Then Paste that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you just Edit
 the quote leaving only parts that you want to reference.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you could use an HTML editor and make sure that the parts you wanted to be quoted were tagged by&nbsp; &lt;blockquote&gt;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then view as displayed HTML and Copy and Paste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately the Desktop Bluetooth Properties dialog does not provide any possibility to turn the built-in Bluetooth device off..</p>

<p><br />
It may at least provide the equivalent functionality if you use the Disable buttons.&nbsp; In fact,&nbsp;I suspect&nbsp;it would be sufficient to just Disable the Radio Adapter.&nbsp; I can try checking in the Events tab to see if that is in fact what happens.&nbsp; TBD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hmm... in Driver File Details for that one bthport.sys&nbsp; BTHUSB.SYS and fsquirt.exe are listed so I guess more than one thing might change, whatever we try as a workaround.</p>

It's available from TechNet as one of the tools in the SysInternalsSuite.&nbsp; Really worthwhile taking the time getting used to using it if you are at all interested in finding out how stuff works.</p>

<p>
</p><p>i wish the microsoft HELP STAFF would read all the questions properly and give relevant advice to each problem... namely that the bluetooth switch is GREYED OUT in the airplane mode dialogue box and CANNOT be switched ON or sometimes it can be switched ON
 but reverts back to OFF by itself</p>

            <p>i read one of the threads you suggested and while it didnt provide a solution it did give me an idea to try something else...</p>
<p>
</p><p>i went to device manager to check on hidden devices and noticed that a usb device had a "down arrow icon" next to it, which meant it was DISABLED</p>
<p>
</p><p>i right-clicked and ENABLED it and the bluetooth icon appeared on the task-bar and my bluetooth mouse was WORKING</p>
<p>
</p><p>it seems that switching AIRPLANE MODE from off to on only switches ON the WiFi and NOT bluetooth, with my particular hardware</p>

                    Do applications make use of different local ports for concurrent connections or is it the same port number that is being used for the second new connection?<br />
&nbsp;For example if i open My Firefox Browser (on port 57615) and i want to open another Firefox application (i.e. 2 concurrent applications running now).<br />
Will Both applictaions run on Port 57615 (example port) or will the second Firefox application be assigned a different local port (e.g 5766)?<br />
<br />
(i.e I opened Firefox Application and I opened another Firefox Application)<br />
<br />
Using the command below shows it's using the same port Number for both Concurrent Applications BUT I would Like to be VERY SURE!!!<br />
<br />
#netstat -ano |find /&nbsp; "firefox.exe"<br />
#netstat -ano |find / "process id"<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

            @GTS-NJ, Thank you for your email, Appreciate your Response. I will download the software. I am currentlu using Netstat command which i think is also useful.<br />
<br />
<span>Imagine opening Firefox Application on your Laptop (check the port Number) and Opening ANOTHER Firefox Application (and checking the port Number)..<br />
<br />
.I think its making use of the same Port Number..BUT i need to be sure am on the right track before proceedin</span>g.<br />

<h2>            WMP Playlist Restricted to 10,000</h2>
                    I am wondering if anyone has come across this oddity. I have a large collection of audio files, over 32,000, and I like load them all into a playlist and shuffle that playlist and them start listening. I've been able to do this for years with previous
 versions of Windows and WMP, but now, with WIndows 8.1 and WMP 12, after I go away from the playlist to do something else (another playlist, video or whatever,) when I come back to the playlist, it has only 10,000 files in it, almost as if the playlist file
 type is restricted to hold only 10,000 entries. Anyone have a solution?

<p><span>Just a follow up on my OP. They came through yesterday. I received a PM from XBOX and they were in my 'ready to download list'. Last year, they came through the day after the conference, which is why I posted originally

<p>I read that if we watched on MIXER we would receive rewards like last year. I haven't had anything through yet. What gives? Am I mistaken?</p>

<p>Hi, make sure to check the MixPot FAQ to make sure you were qualified to receive the MixPot (e.g. your Mixer account and Microsoft account are linked, etc.).&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/xbox-mixpot-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/xbox-mixpot-faq</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The rewards can also take a week from the date of the stream to be distributed, and should show up in your purchase history upon distribution. &nbsp;Follow the steps in the guide for help if it’s been over a week since the event and you still haven’t received
 the items. But make sure to do it within two weeks of the event. &nbsp;Hope this helps!</p>

 for reaching out to us in the forums for this question about the MixPot for people who watched the Xbox E3 Briefing on Mixer. Typically, you would receive an Xbox message confirming one or more of the items that were being given away were being added to your
 account. This usually happens about a week or less from the end of the streaming event.</div>

<h2>            Windows Designer Bluetooth Keyboard  detected by computer but cannot pair</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I have a windows designer keytboard and mouse set. The mouse works fine and is connected successfully. But when I try to
 pair the keyboard, it will not pair. This is despite the fact that I have previously used the keyboard before on the same operating system and windows actually recognised the keyboard. I thought the batteries had died so I replaced them yet it still does not
 work.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">When I got into settings &gt; manager bluetooth devices, it recognises the keyboard and gives me the option to click 'pair'. However,
 when i click 'pair' it asks me to enter a six digit code on the keyboard. When i try to, nothing happens as i cannot type, since my computer doesn't recognise that I am typing on my keyboard. I have previously paired the keyboard by typing in the number required
 ( a few months ago) so I have no idea what has happened here.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Any ideas?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Thanks guys!</span><br />

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is custom built. I have an intel I-7 4790k processor, Z97 MX gigabyte gaming 5 motherboard (socket 1150), 32gb ram (1833mhz), Nvidia GTX970 graphics card, 750 watt PSU and windows 10 professional, 64 bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows designer keyboard and mouse set:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-gb/products/keyboards/designer-bluetooth-desktop/7n9-00006&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed the troubleshooting option and it does not detect the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also followed the two forums you posted above and have looked at device manger which does not recognise the keyboard though it finds and pairs the mouse from the same set. Device manager, under bluetooth, recognises several other devices but not the
 keyboard. When I click on keyboards, it only recognises my old keyboard which I am using until I resolve the problem. TRhe keyboard flashes a white light when I am trying to pair it, so it has power and can be recognised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers for the bluetooth device (which is an Asus USB BT-400) and it does not make a difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It recognised the keyboard in bluetooth options under settings and says 'Designer Keyboard, ready to pair'. It is just that when i click 'pair' I cannot type in the 6 digit number it asks me to type. AS said, I have previously paired the keyboard a few months
 ago and it worked fine for six months or so. I really don't understand what has changed. I have not changed anything and the only thing I can think of is that I recently bought a bluetooth speaker which may have interfered with the connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas? It may be that the keyboard is broken?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p><br />
Andrew</p>

            Another strange thing worth mentioning is that when I click 'pair' whilst I cannot type the numbers it requests, if I press enter, it gives me a new code. Therefore my computer recognises that I press enter, just not when I type numbers. Strange!&nbsp;

            <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I can pair other bluetooth devices, including the mouse and a portable speaker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to connect it to my PS4 and it cannot pair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming therefore that the keyboard is faulty?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is strange because my PC recognises its signal, and I can press the enter button to get a new pairing code, bu I cannot actually type numbers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have got a replacement keyboard and I am still finding the same issue. Therefore it wasn't that the keyboard was faulty.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How to delete a file that I can&#39;t see - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> liuzerus87  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to delete a file that I can&#39;t see</h2>
                    I seem to have a file ("folder.jpg") that exists but that I can't delete.<br />
<br />
The only way I can see that it still exists is that when I try to create or rename something to "folder.jpg", it claims that a file with that name already exists. However, I can't actually find it to delete it. In Windows Explorer (with "Show hidden files,
 folders, and drives" on), it does not appear. In the command prompt, attempting to run "DEL folder.jpg" returns "Could not find" etc.<br />
<br />
So far, the only solution to this that I've found is installing Linux on a virtual machine and then deleting it from within the virtual machine.<br />

<h3> evertjanm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy-Paste does not work correctly. Bug&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I want to copy part of the text from an old e-mail into a new one, the linefeed characters are not copied. So sentences which where seperated by a blank line are now pasted without a blank line in between, for example:</p>
<p>... old ...</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My name</p>
<p>... old ...</p>
<p>becomes</p>
<p>... new ...</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>My name</p>
<p>... new ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this a bug in the text-editor? It used te work correct&nbsp;in earlier versions.</p>

            <p>This is an FAQ. The problem is that different HTML editors have different ways of converting line breaks into HTML, i.e. what code is generated when you press the
<em>Enter </em>or <em>Return </em>key. Some of the possibilities are:</p>
<ol>
<li>A line break code &lt;br&gt; or &lt;br /&gt; </li><li>A paragraph code &lt;/p&gt; ... &lt;p&gt; </li><li>A divider code &lt;/div&gt; ... &lt;div&gt; </li></ol>
<p><br />
These all have different effects on the way HTML will be displayed in the viewer. There may be different styles pre-defined for the different elements, and some of those styles may not be available in another HTML editor, which has then to find a workaround
 to try and reproduce the text in a manner as close as possible to the original. For example, the style definition for &lt;p&gt; in the original editor may include padding to produce white space before or after a paragraph, while the &lt;div&gt; doesn't.
<br />
<br />
Windows Live Mail has a simple HTML editor with limited formatting capability. To keep thins simple, when you paste HTML markup from another application, all &lt;p&gt; and &lt;div&gt; tags are reproduced as &lt;div&gt; and assume the default style as specified at Options &gt; Compose.
 Empty &lt;div&gt;s may be removed or replaced by &lt;div&gt;s containing a single non-breaking space.<br />
<br />
The way WLMail handles line breaks changed with the introduction of WLMail 2011 two years ago. This is why you're seeing undesirable results now.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
WLMail uses Internet Explorer as its viewer. This means that changes in IE may affect the way that messages are displayed in WLMail.
<br />
<br />
In order to have some control over how a prepared text will appear when included in a mail message, it's best to use only those formatting options available in WLMail (i.e. font face, size, colour, bold etc., lists) and to use newline (usually
<em>Shift-Enter</em>) instead of paragraph (<em>Enter</em>) to begin new lines.<br />
<br />
If you're using MS Word, then it's quick and easy to use <em>Find/Replace </em>(Ctrl-H) to change paragraphs (^p) to newlines (^l) in your prepared texts. Note that all 'paragraphs' will then assume the paragraph formatting of their predecessor. If you want
 to change this, e.g. to apply indents, then use paragraph (<em>Enter</em>) to start each new one with different paragraph formatting.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I can follow your explanation, but the problem is slightly different. I&nbsp;did&nbsp;the following test:</p>
<p>I typed e-mail number 1 in WLM:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Start of e-mail</p>
<p>This is a test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a test.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; End of e-mail</p>
<p>I sent the e-mail to myself. The e-mail appears in 'Sent items'.</p>
<p>I double-click the e-mail in 'Sent items', select all text and copy it to the clipboard.</p>
<p>I create a new e-mail and paste the text. This is what happens:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; Start of e-mail</p>
<p>This is a test.</p>
<p>This is a test.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; End of e-mail</p>
<p>I used WLM to create the first e-mail and the second e-mail. But the empty line disappears! When this would be a complex e-mail, carefully&nbsp;made,&nbsp;with many empty lines, it is frustrating.</p>

            <p>Sorry, I can't reproduce this. I just tried your experiment both using <em>Enter
</em>alone (to introduce &lt;DIV&gt; tags for each new line) and <em>Shift-Enter </em>(to introduce &lt;BR&gt; tags for each new line), and in each case the line spacing survived copying and pasting both from the saved sent messages and from the received ones. I also varied
 the content transfer encoding between QP and B64, with no apparent difference.<br />
<br />
I don't know if this has changed with the latest versions of WLMail and Internet Explorer. I'm currently using WLMail 16.4.3505.0912 and IE10RP 10.0.9200.16438 on W7 Pro 64-bit.</p>

<h2>            Error code 0x80070570</h2>
                    Gday, <br />
Happy new year, Can someone please help? Ive tried so many forums, but nothing as yet. When i try to copy files from my music folder to an sd card (and copy normal word files anywhere), i get the error message 0x80070570.... I understand that trying the "startup
 repair option" should fix this, but when i turn of the laptop, and turn it back on pressing F8, it does not give me the advanced options to activate the startup repair option. ? And when i purchased the laptop, i did not get a startup vista disk with it, so
 i cant use that option either. <br />
<br />
I have also formatted the SD Card, so i know there is nothing wrong with that (however, everytime i put the sd card in, it does as me to scan it, and fix errors, even after formatting it).....could the sd card be trashed?<br />
<br />
Please help, as all i wanna do is put music on an sd card to put it into my GPS to listen to my music on the go.....<br />
<br />
HELP.....<br />
Regards<br />
Mark

            I got the same error message while in the middle of copying files onto a memory stick. Windows offered to do a scan and fix and deleted a number of corrupted files. Susequently Windows advised me that there were still problems with the disc and a further
 scan produced an error report suggesting that I run CHKDSK/F to fix the problem. When I tried to do this I was told that I needed elevated clearance to perform that function! Does anyone know how I get that?

            @kia zi tang - M8, all i do is the normal way you remove an sd card from the laptop, go down to the bar at the bottom, right click, remove sd card.
<br />
<br />
@malcatglos - Gday m8, thanx for the reply/info. I start to copy the files from my music to the sd card, which it start to do fine, then half way thru it give me the error code, then stops. I have run CHKDSK on my sd card, and it states there isnt a problem
 with the sd card...... can i ask, can you send me a link to the place where you got windows to do a scan and fix the problems? I think it is to do with a corrupt registry key, but no one seems to know how to help. I dont have the option to run a restore/fix
 from the F8 on startup either. Bizarre. <br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You will need to run the command prompt with elevated permission such as Administrator rights to perform the task.<br />
<br />
1.) Right click the "cmd.exe" to open the context menu<br />
2.) Click on "Run As"<br />
3.) Type your administrator username and password<br />
4.) Click "Ok"<br />
<br />
The command prompt will open with administrator rights. Have a read on the link below if you have doubts.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
What is the format of the SD Card? FAT / FAT32 / NTFS<br />
<br />
Please try to format the SD Card to either FAT32 for Windows, MAC and Linux usage or NTFS for Windows only.<br />
<br />
<br />
Steps to Format the SD Card to FAT32<br />
1.) Plug in the SD Card and allow the system to assign a drive letter. (Eg. E:)<br />
2.) Open the command prompt<br />
3.) Type the command stated below to format the SD Card to FAT32<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; format E: /FS:FAT32 /Q<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.

<br />
Yeah i thought at first i had a problem with the SD card, so i formatted it, so it is on FAT32, but it hasnt sorted the problem. I still get the error message when copying files....I heard from another forum that its possibly a problem with a corrupt registry
 key...but im not sure... is there a way of checking to see if the registry is ok, and running how it should?<br />

            I have used so many different "so called" registry fixes, and all claim to fix your registry, but they are a scam and a con, so i refuse to pay anymore money out.
<br />
<br />
Is there any free registry fixes out there (software). <br />

    <title>Intermittent 3 red lights - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theglpdragoon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intermittent 3 red lights</h2>
                    
<p>I have an original 360 that's started having issues today. First, mid-game it went to a blue screen and had to be turned off. When I tried turning it back on the 3 red lights appeared. Out of curiosity I tried it again without the HDD and it worked fine.
 Putting the HDD back in and it worked.</p>
<p>Started to play a game again and this time the screen went black before having to turn it off. Trying to turn it back on caused the screen to freeze. Rebooting caused 3 red lights. [Note: it had 3 red lights without the HDD too.]</p>
<p>I've since tried the same techniques as before and it's up and running again. I haven't tried to play a game thinking it will probably just freeze.</p>
<p>Is there something other than a console repair that will help fix this issue? Or am I out of luck and need to send it in for repairs?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Possibly, but three red lights suggest either a complete hardware failure or an issue with your power converter. Have you tried using a different power block and seeing if thats the issue?</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Charger stopped working after a system configuration - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shoaibbarry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Charger stopped working after a system configuration Kernel-PnP</h2>
                    <p>I have two MS Surface Pro 3s at home and both are not able to charge using the their old original as well as a new surface charger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife's Surface Pro 3 developed the issue first and thinking that the old charger had died we ordered a new one which also didn't work so we thought the tablet's port had an issue. Continuously trying to push the charger plug into the port cause the bottom
 plastic under the pins to break off and this unexpectedly allowed for her surface to be able to charge again (consistently) without issues although the charger LED would no longer light up. She's now been using the Surface Pro for a good 6 months. The old
 charger that has chipped its plastic from just beneath the pins allows the plug to slide up and down a bit while plugged in and a sweet spot allows the battery to charge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface developed <strong>exactly the same symptoms last week</strong> i.e. it stopped charging using its charger or the original spare I had from my wife's tablet issue above. Using my wife's chipped charger my surface would charge just fine (no LED
 indication but screen shows charging).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has made me come to the conclusion that either both of our charging ports have gone bad (highly unlikely) or some software driver configuration has caused this to happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On investigating further thinking that a system configuration might be the issue I checked the Microsoft Surface ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery's event logs under device manager and see events on the device while I was not using the tablet (suspended).
 On the day the issue happened I can see six event logs by <strong>User: System</strong> starting off with&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event 1:&nbsp;3/16/2018 3:41:46 PM&nbsp;</p>
<p>Device ACPI\PNP0C0A\0 was configured.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I didnt use the tablet until later that night around 10PM when I discovered the issue and followed a few tips online to remdedy which included removing and reinstalling the drivers which are also visible in the event log executed under
<strong>user: my account</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event 1:&nbsp;3/16/2018 11:09:47 PM&nbsp;</p>
<p>Device ACPI\PNP0C0A\0 was deleted.<br />

<p>
</p><p>...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This leads me to believe that a system level change has occured and has disabled the surface's ability to charge using the intended charger.&nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>I have the event logs saved and would appreciated if someone could help.</p>

    <title>Emulation problem with windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hunter_f7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Emulation problem with windows 10</h2>
                    As of yesterday, I, among the other millions, upgraded to windows 10, and all in all I'm enjoying the results. With that being said, I'm having a hard time emulating some games (EX. Final fantasy 12) as it says when I load the disc that "PCSX2 has stopped
 working, windows will let you know when the problem is fixed." Does anyone have any recommendations to fix this problem?? Or should I just wait until the newer versions are released? Also, all the games ran fine on windows 8.1, and I never experienced any
 trouble, I also tried troubleshooting methods, but to no avail.

            Thank you so much for the reply! I did all that, and found out it was a simple emulation problem, I just had to update the settings in the emulator! Everything runs fine now! Thanks again for your help.

            Is it just the audio? After updating, I just had to download a different emulator, and then it worked fine.

    <title>A proper way to create non-interactive accounts&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrey_t04  say:</h3>
<h2>            A proper way to create non-interactive accounts&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In order to use password-protected file sharing in a basic home network I want to create a number of non-interactive user accounts on a Windows 8 Pro machine in addition to the existing set of interactive accounts. The users that correspond to those extra
 accounts will not use this machine interactively, so I don't want their accounts to be available for logon and I don't want their names to appear on welcome screen.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In older versions of Windows Pro (up to Windows 7) I did this by first creating the accounts as members of "Users" group, and then including them into "Deny logon locally" list in Local Security Policy settings. This always had the desired effect. However
 now I wonder whether this is the right/best way to do it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The reason I'm asking is that even though this method works in Windows 8 Pro as well, it has one little quirk: interactive users from "User" group are still able to see these extra user names when they go to the Metro screen and hit their own user name in
 the top-right corner (i.e. open "Sign out/Lock" menu). The command list that drops out contains "Sign out" and "Lock" commands as well as the names of other users (for "switch user" functionality). For some reason that list includes the extra users from "Deny
 logon locally" list. It is interesting to note that this happens when the current user belongs to "Users" group, but it does not happen when the current user is from "Administrators".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For example, let's say I have three accounts on the machine: "Administrator" (from "Administrators", can logon locally), "A" (from "Users", can logon locally), "B" (from "Users", denied logon locally). When "Administrator" is logged in, he can only see user
 "A" listed in his Metro "Sign out/Lock" menu, i.e. all works as it should. But when user "A" is logged in, he can see both "Administrator"&nbsp;<em>and user "B"</em>&nbsp;in his "Sign out/Lock" menu. This is wrong.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Expectedly, in the above example trying to switch from user "A" to user "B" by hitting "B" in the menu does not work: Windows jumps to welcome screen that lists only "Administrator" and "A".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anyway, on the surface this appears to be an interface-level bug in Windows 8. However, I'm wondering if going through "Deny logon locally" setting is the right way to do it in Windows 8. Is there any other way to create a hidden non-interactive user account?</p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As the Bytecc USB portable diskette drive works on ‘plug and play basis’, you do not need any additional software to use this device. You need to plug
 in the USB cable which came attached to the device to the 1.1 or 2.0 interface USB port so that it starts to function. You do not need any external power to run this device as this device is USB-powered. The USB drivers are preinstalled on the PC along with
 Windows. When you plug in the device using the USB cable, it would first install the drivers and then you will see a message that the ‘device is ready to use’.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if you got the help you needed by clicking ‘Yes’ or ‘No’.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I do have the same problem as the previous person. The problem is that when I go to Device Manager I see that the Floppy Disk is fully recognized. The problem is that The USB Floppy I have is from a different company that is indicated in the Universal
 Serial Bus Controllers.&nbsp; In my case the is called TEAC USB Floppy. Actually the one that I have installed in my computer USB port is a a BYTECC USB Portable Diskette Drive BT-144. So Windows 10 installed me a driver that do nolt belong to the manufacturer
 of the Floppy Disk Drive I have. When I went to the Company that manufacture the Disk Drive which is BYTECC Windows Security System,&nbsp; Kaspersky Internet Security and Malwarebytes indicated that the dirver from BYTECC is infected and, of course, I did not installed
 it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I uninstalled the driver, I installed a new driver recommended by Windows 10 but the prtoblem persist because the device is recognized as a product from TEAC and not from BYTECC. Therefore, my suggestion would be that Windows 10 contact BYTECC and make
 sure that their drives are not infected or, perhaps, Windows can include in its program the recognition of the manufacturer of the Floppy USB drive from BYTECC.
</p>
<p>This will solve the problem. Can Windows send me a driver from BYTECC?. Thanks.

<p><span>Hi Josep Lluis Perez de Arce,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the reply. Appreciate your efforts to work on this issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The USB portable diskette drive uses the built-in USB drivers from Windows.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Windows installs the basic USB drivers required for a device to run. To get specific and updated drivers for a device, the manufacturer has to release it. You may want to contact the Device manufacturer’s support for assistance to check
 if there is any updated driver available.</span></p>
<p><span>Further, to isolate the issue, you may also want to temporarily disable the security or firewall software on the PC to check if that helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Ensure to enable the security software after the troubleshooting is done to keep the PC safe and secure.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know how it goes.</span></p>

</span></p>

<p>Hi Srimadhwa, </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you form your prompt reply. Unfortunately I was not able to reply because I was away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had follow your recommendations but it did not work out. Even that my Microsoft has been updated my OS to the latest version it seems to me that the issue has not been resolved. This is what I have done so far:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) I put a 1.44 IBM formatted disk and after a few seconds appeared a text saying:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A:\ is not accessible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The request is not supported. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) I put a different floppy disk from BASF 2HD Dos Formatted and after a few seconds a text appeared saying:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A:\ is not accessible. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The disk media is not recognized. It may not be formatted. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After receiving this message I choose to format the disk. Therefore I click OK and after that I requested to format it. A message appeared reading this:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capacity: 3.5", 1.44 MB, 512 bytes/sector</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; File system: FAT (Default)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allocation Unit size: 512 bytes</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restore Device defaults </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Volume label:&nbsp; (I did not write anything there in the blank space bellow)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Format options: ( I put a v bellow where it read Quick Format)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After I click on "Start", in a few seconds appeared the following message:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Format Floppy Disk Drive(A): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Windows was not able to complete the format. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) I put a different Floppy and this time is from Maxell.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is what it came out:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A:\ is not accessible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The disk media is not recognized. It may not be formatted.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, I try to format the disk.&nbsp; After the usual warning I got the answer and results as the same as in option 2).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, your recommendations did not work. May I have other suggestions?.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for your interest. </p>

<h2>            Used Storage Space on Apps and Games Keeps Growing- Without Installing Anything</h2>
                    <p>My laptop has been telling me that I'm low on storage.&nbsp; When I went to check it out, I found that it said I had 79 GB of Games and Apps stored.&nbsp; When I went into the details and counted up the storage used by each program, I counted about 20 GB being used.&nbsp;
 (The largest file was 11.7 GBs, but everything else was less than 1 GB.) After restarting, I went back less than an hour later to check again, and I found that now it said I had 80 GB of Games and Apps being stored.&nbsp; I've checked, and there's no previous version
 of Windows stored on my laptop.&nbsp; Its been on Windows 10 since I bought it new at the end of June.</p>
<p>How can I fix this false storage problem?</p>

            Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage &gt; This PC
<br />Click Other and Temporary files to see where the storage might be used.
<br />
<br />Also use TreeSize to find out if there any hidden files or logs that might be using up your disk space:
