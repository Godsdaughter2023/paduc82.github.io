<h2>            nothing happens when clicking-on  My Favorites</h2>
                    <p><em>Original title:&nbsp; Favorites Toolbar</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I screwed up and hit&nbsp;"Delete temporary&nbsp;files, history, cookies, saved passwords, and web form information" in Windows 7, Internet Explorer 11, Internet Options. Now on my "Favorites Toolbar" and "My Favorites", the click-on doesn't work. &nbsp;When the cursor
 is on an item it shows the URL but nothing happens when I click-on it. &nbsp;An help will be appreciated. TIA, Roger. &nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response, but after my computer "searches for online packs" "Internet Explorer Performance Troubleshooter" does not appear.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 Ultimate (Service Pack 1) 64bit.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried resetting IE 11, uninstalling/reinstalling IE 11,&nbsp;deleting all of my favorites and re-adding them manually, and also have checked and made sure that they were listed at: C:/Users/--user name--/favorites.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, as a strange quirk, IE 11 loads webpages up from my "history".</p>

<p>Is it possible to Create a Drop-Down menu, click it, and it display the list of items (say.. John, Mark and Sarah) and have Mark highlighted as another color. That way, Mark stands out over the other two.

            Hi JackL10, this is a big issue at the moment a lot of Outlook users are affected, a lot of users are reporting they can access their Email from their Mobile phone, but not their PC/Laptop . . .
<br />
<br />Latest &gt;&gt;
<br />Microsoft are seeing a few isolated incidents on a small portion of infrastructure that has received the fix and that did not work. They are analysing diagnostic data and service log files to identify why the fix was ineffective for some of their customers.
<br />

            1. This might be an issue with latest Skype which is v8. 
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers - Open v8 skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Help &amp; feedback &gt; Give feedback 
<br />
<br />Feedback can also be given through Uservoice where you can find the feedback of others and status would be visible to you - <a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype-ideas/filters/my_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype...</a>
<br />
<br />2. As a work-around, You can download Classic Skype and use that. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a> 
<br />
<br />Good news is that Classic Skype is not going to be retired. Its last date in service was 1-Sep-18 and it has been decided not stop the services to Classic Skype for some more time. It would nag you for updating to latest version which is v8 which you will have to ignore and tolerate.

            Heya UGYENTENZIN<br />I'm sorry for the issues that are happening and I don't have many ideas on how to fix it if there are no errors. I guess you could try downloading the file using the Skype classic version? Just open this link and select Get classic Skype.<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a><br />Let me know if that works.

            Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

    <title>I receive emails both for my Inbox and alias account. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I receive emails both for my Inbox and alias account.</h2>
                    <div>Hello.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I use my live email account as my primary account. Just now, I added an outlook alias to it for my business purposes. However, I'm having a few problems.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>First off, I'm using the windows live mail client. Receiving messages on my new alias is no problem, I already tested that. However, the problem is, that even though I set my alias as my "default from address", it's always suggesting to reply to mails
 via my live account. Even worse, my alias doesn't even show up as an option to send from in the drop-down menu.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Furthermore, when creating my alias, I told outlook to create a new folder for my alias. The folder immediately appeared in my windows live client. However, emails I receive to my alias, appear in the general inbox of my live account, and the alias folder
 stays empty.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone tell me how to fix these things?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm receiving a lot of emails, it's important that my inbox stays tidy.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Linking Data Across Multiple Worksheets in the same Workbook</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am building a workbook to track personnel and equipment hours that will feed an invoice. I need to grab data from various cells in multiple sheets within the workbook to build the invoice. What is the best method for doing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I have a job number that should be entered once and feed across three sheets.&nbsp; What function can I use to facilitate the data population across the other sheets once I enter the invoice number the first time on sheet one?</p>

<h2>            XDA Exec&#47;HTC Universal</h2>
                    
<p>I have a question relating to my XDA exec, rather an accessory issue. I have been thinking about getting a USB cable one which incorporates a mini USB connector and a standard 'female' connector, with which to attach
 a memory stick, to read file from&nbsp;on my XDA.&nbsp;Is this possible? And has anyone had any success&nbsp;doing this. Any replies welcome as I have not made the purchase of the cable yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not exactly; this one cable will have both a USB mini connector and a USB 'female' connector. What I am looking for is the possibility to&nbsp;read from&nbsp;a memory stick (not card) attached via this cable to my XDA. Again
 questioning the viability of such an instance. "USB Adapter A Female to Mini 5 Pin Male" is&nbsp; the correct description.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.microsoft.com%2fWindowsMobile%2fWebResource.axd%3fd%3dNySzF1eivP_rMoc50GQJzcvS4MHMOEKwYrCIgDtzuzlw7GsNki3H_INlfYaLgkxFOX39ZFI8XNZiDDKfDYy_fta7XCkPJNXWwjtkgo-F6nc1%26amp%3bt%3d633263991144971555" /><br />

<h3> naharlow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Publisher disappeared&#63;</h2>
                    I have been using Publisher on several computers over the last couple of years, but in the last two months all of them have ceased running the program. The shortcuts have disappeared, and although I have found the original program link it still cannot
 be accessed, failing even to open. Using the diagnostic tool has given me the answer that the program is "incompatible", but I do not understand why this should suddenly have become the case. Has there been an update which would have affected this, and how
 can I get up and running again?

            <p>What version of Publisher are you using and what operating system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><span>It sounds like you need to reassociate your *.pub files with Publisher.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>
<p><span><span>First you need to enable <span>hidden files and show file extensions: Go to Control Panel &gt; Appearance and Personalization &gt; Folder Options &gt; View tab &gt; Advanced settings &gt; check Show hidden files and folders and uncheck Hide extensions for known
 file types &gt; OK. Now you should be able to identify your .pub files by the extension.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>R<span>ight click&nbsp;a .pub file &gt; Open with and this will bring you to the Open With dialog. If Publisher is not listed as 'recommended' or 'other' programs then you need to click the browse button and drill down to where the
<strong>mspub.exe</strong> file is located on your computer. It will vary with your installation and version of Publisher&nbsp;but you can look:</span></span></span></p>
<div><span>C:/program files (x86)/microsoftoffice/office14/mspub.exe</span></div>
<div><span>or</span></div>
<div><span>C:/Program Files/Microsoft Office 2010/Office14/mspub.exe</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>If you are using Publisher 2007 you might find the file under Office12.
</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Be sure to check 'always open with this program'. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>And if those instructions are not clear then here are some references:</span></div>

<div><br />
<div>As far as I'm aware, I'm using Windows 7, and Publisher 2010. I've done as you suggested, but even opening from the program file location that you specified, it fails to open correctly - it asks to open in safe mode, still fails to boot up, and then asks
 to run a diagnostic that then doesn't display.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The shortcut that use to be on the Start bar under Microsoft Office has also disappeared.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My work laptop is running Publisher 2007, which seems to work when opened directly but has disassociated itself from the working files.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope that makes sense</div>

<div>As far as I'm aware, I'm using Windows 7, and Publisher 2010. I've done as you suggested, but even opening from the program file location that you specified, it fails to open correctly - it asks to open in safe mode, still fails to boot up, and then asks
 to run a diagnostic that then doesn't display.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The shortcut that use to be on the Start bar under Microsoft Office has also disappeared.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My work laptop is running Publisher 2007, which seems to work when opened directly but has disassociated itself from the working files.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope that makes sense</div>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
I agree with Palcouk. If you found the MSPUB.exe file (or the MSPUB file if you did not enable file extensions), double clicked it and it fails to open correctly, then you need to do a repair...and do a repair, not a reinstall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Reference: Repair Office 2010 or 2013: </font><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/project-help/repair-or-remove-office-2010-HA010357402.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/project-help/repair-or-remove-office-2010-HA010357402.aspx</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per your laptop then just right click a *.pub file and reassociate those files with Publisher 2007 or drill down to find the mspub.exe file as described above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a MS 'update' recently that did break file associations and it sounds like this is at least the problem with Publisher 2007 and probably 2010. It is an example of a time when MS tries to fix one thing but in the process breaks other things. Kind
 of aggravating...</p>

            .mp4 files are video files. To play media files on Windows Media Player, click CTRL+O while in the app, then navigate to the .mp3 or .mp4 or .wma or whatever file and click OK. Hope this helps.

<p>
</p><p>Have you created a keyboard shortcut or are you just referring to a keyboard shorcut that you used on Internet Explorer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Internet Explorer, by default if you press 'Ctrl' key or '-'(minus) key or 'Ctrl' 'Shift' and '-' keys, it will zoom-in.&nbsp;

Similarly, to zoom-out, press 'Ctrl' 'Shift' and '+'(plus) key combination.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;I simply wish to close ALL my&nbsp;Skype accounts with immediate effect, not wait 60 days.&nbsp;They're my&nbsp;accounts, i have&nbsp;control over this, no-one else.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>I have a client who insists on using&nbsp;</span><span><span>Skype and I wish to register with a new email&nbsp;address and my new business information.&nbsp;However&nbsp;Skype gets confused
 with my name, sign in&nbsp;information and secondary passwords. I appear in search results with several accounts, none of which are the one I wish to use. It is also incapable of sending me a code to my mobile for security, then sends 6 codes at once half an hour
 later. Then lets me sign in and not even see the&nbsp;Skype interface but some stupid microsoft account page of which i have no control over changing or doing anything. And when i finally get through my log in and cancel the account, it still appears for&nbsp;another
 60 days! This is&nbsp;unacceptable.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I do NOT want to ask the community, I do not want Live chat, I want to speak to a SKYPE CUSTOMER SUPPORT OFFICER of which there seems to be absolutely no access to. Every single time I see the microsoft&nbsp;login -
 on anything! i know I am going to have problems, and I do! Without fail.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Can someone please point me in&nbsp;the direction of an email&nbsp;address so I can get help with this diabolical outdated software owned by&nbsp;the most un-user friendly company in existence.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. In response to your questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>I access Outlook through a web browser</li><li>When I try to look into "Hotmail" through the browser, I see Outlook. My Outlook e-mail account appears but not my Hotmail e-mail.</li><li>I do not know.&nbsp;I had both an Outlook and Hotmail account before I upgraded to Windows 10. Whenever I try to log in to Hotmail, it takes me to my Outlook in-box which is not the same.&nbsp; I can still access both e-mail accounts from my Blackberry but I can
 now only access my Outlook e-mail from my computer.&nbsp; I still have many accounts associated with my Hotmail account as well as multiple contacts. I'd like to be able to access the Hotmail account to retrieve both.&nbsp;</li></ul>

</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that all the Hotmail account are migrated to the Outllook.com interface, So when you login to your Hotmail account you will be redirected to Outlook.com. As your account is migrated, it might take some time for all the emails to get migrated
 to the new interface. If you are still not able to find your emails, I suggest you to refer to the Microsoft help article below and check if it helps.</p>

            <p>Thank you. I was able to access all of my Hotmail e-mail and contacts. I&nbsp;did so by using Chrome to access the&nbsp;login to outlook.com and then using my Hotmail user name and password.&nbsp;I continue to get pop-up notes indicating my Hotmail account&nbsp;is out of date
 but I have already updated the account and waited the 30 day period for the security information to be replaced. After a Hotmail account is migrated to Outlook,&nbsp;does the address remain the same (i.e.,&nbsp;@Hotmail.com)?

            <p>It is an issue for sure. If you google the subject you find several people who noticed this problem. Anybody with a Microsoft email account installed can just check status down in right corner and they will notoice that Connection to server goes on and off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now this is not a thread for "stuck emails" but also that situation is special for using Microsoft a</p>
<p>ccounts. I have several times been able to send email with an exchange account (other than Microsoft accounts) but when sending with Hotmail, Live, Outlook servrs has been impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could presume that a Microsoft email account should work good with Outlook 365 - but it does not which is surprising.&nbsp;It is strange that using a microsoft email account seems LESS compatibel with Oulook 365 compared to using any other email account.</p>

            <p>Hi PP,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My&nbsp;Live account&nbsp;account when online using the web says "Outlook.com" in the top left corner in the "blue ribbon". Server is "dub127.mail.live.com"</p>
<p>It works OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My account in Outlook 365 I have added exactly as per the instructions you linked to.</p>
<p>For the moment it works fine. I have my mail account in 3 different PC's using Windows 10 and it works fine in all of them for the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it is not Always so. </p>
<p>Example the past Thursday (May 26) I had HUGE problem with connection to Live.com (Outlook server). It was problem in my 3 PC's and in my wifes 2 PC's. Total 5 Machines.<br />
It was quite impossible that day from around 8 in the morning to around 15 in the afternoon to send any emails out and connection to server was offline almost all the time. (My time zone is European Central Time). I could however send emails out with another
 Exchange account (non Outlook server). The day after the connection was more steady but still went on and off rather much. From May 28 it has however been steady and seems to be connected mostly.</p>
<p>In the history I have experienced several periods with connection problems. They come randomly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes me think that problem is not local in my machine. It is the servers of Outlook that invokes the problem. For the moment it is running OK - Let's hope it continue like that and that Microsoft put some effort into having a good Outlook connection
 to their own server accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the Best</p>

            <p>I too have this problem even after resetting the Outlook (Office Professional Plus 2013) settings per the link above.&nbsp; FWIW, I am always able to get "reconnected" by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clicking on the "Send/Receive" tab</li><li>Clicking on the "Work Offline" button</li><li>Wait a second or 2</li><li>Clicking on the "Work Offline" button again</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I then <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>immediately </em></span>get reconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had this problem for years and on many different PCs.&nbsp; It's annoying but relatively easy to work around--at least in my case since it doesn't happen that frequently.&nbsp; OTOH, I would like to see this fixed.

            <p>Hi Rabilancia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this problem will be solved pretty soon.</p>
<p>Microsoft is rolling out the "new" outlook accounts and they are connected as "Microsoft Exchange" accounts in Outlook 365 e-mail program. It works&nbsp;really good. I know since one of&nbsp;my accounts is already converted to new Outlook account. The other one has
 to wait and if I am correctly informed it is because Microsoft convert the accounts used in Mobil phones (WP8 or WP10) as the last accounts to convert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we just need to be a little more patient and problems will be gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>OneDrive Business folders shared with people outside my organization - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> damazta  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive Business folders shared with people outside my organization by anonymous &#40;read only&#41; link are always empty.</h2>
                    <p>Primary symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Folders I share with people outside my organization via anonymous link are all empty. Verified with multiple different people. We are not syncing folders to other PCs, this is just the Web UI I'm talking about.</li><li>Folders themselves are displayed without any error message from any device that has the link - as expected.</li><li>It used to work just fine. I have no idea when or why exactly this began, only that my clients started complaining a couple of days ago. Obviously, I didn't change anything and/or am not aware of what I may have changed. ;-)</li></ul>
<p>Secondary symptoms (that may or may not relate to the primary issue):</p>
<ul>
<li>Parts of the OneDrive Business website insist on using German, whereas all other O365 sites in my org (and the ODB main page) use English. Some share invitation links are German, some are English.</li><li>Typically, I would use the "More OneDrive sharing options" in the File Explorer context menu to bring up the sharing dialog for that folder. Currently, OneDrive will open in Edge, but the usual sharing dialog will not. No error, just nothing. The URL in
 Edge still ends on:&nbsp;<em>/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?sharingDialogForListItemId=26451</em> for example, so it looks like File Explorer passes correct parameters, but OneDrive won't honor those.</li><li>I can still successfully share single files through ODB and an anonymous link, but not folders. No folder I tried over the last two hours works as expected.</li><li>My OneDrive Business website uses the old "sharing" icon - three little circles arranged in larger circle. The other tenant I used to compare already uses the new sharing icon - an open box with an arrow coming out the top. I am on the preview/prerelease
 of O365, the other tenant is regular release schedule, so I should see the new icon first, right?</li><li>Sometimes, OneDrive business will not show the "OneDrive Admin" option on the bottom left third of the screen. It is just absent, although I am logged in as a global O365 admin and can open the ODB Admin site by pasting the URL directly in to my browser.</li><li>Sharing folders with specific people, requiring then to log in first, works as expected.</li><li>When I open the (broken?) anonymous link to a (broken?) share on my computer, I can see the files as expected.</li><li>I am unable to create an anonymous link to a read-only share from my Windows 10 Mobile device. It fails with an unspecific error, only asking me to retry again later.</li><li>My Windows 10 Mobile device tells me the folder I am using for testing is not shared. When, in fact, the web version of OneDrive says it IS shared via anonymous link.</li><li>I can't tell whether other users are having similar issues - I am the only user in my or

<p>I have another solution which I think will work without needing to reset your phone:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have notebook up on SkyDrive that you would like to open </li><li>On the phone go to IE </li><li>Go to office.live.com </li><li>Find the notebook you would like to open </li><li>Click on it and then it will open the notebook in OneNote Mobile </li><li>Once this is complete in OneNote Mobile under the notebooks pivot you should see this newly opened notebook</li><li>Click on the trash can to close the other notebook which is no longer syncing</li><li>Then in the newly opened notebook find a section you want as your default new note location by pressing and holding and choosing “set as default”</li></ol>
<div><br />
<div>The problem is that OneNote Mobile is trying to connect with that old location and since you deleted it we are stuck. &nbsp;And we don't want to just delete it from the phone since you might have data in there. &nbsp;This should work, and if not please let us know.</div>

<h2>            Windows Defender Error 0x800704ec</h2>
                    <p>Hello, Community Members:</p>
<p>I have this problem on my laptop with Windows Defender. It used to work perfectly beside my commercial antivirus program. It was corrupted and I continue to receive the above error no matter what I do. I have not changed the Group Policy settings for it.
 Therefore, I don't know what the problem is. Of course, I have gone into system settings and run it manually but the dialog box states that the program was terminated by another program before it could run. What is causing this? Thanks everyone.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>BarelyAlive</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Insider Preview 16251.0 rs3 release - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> giacomo38  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Insider Preview 16251.0 rs3 release</h2>
                    <p><strong>Re: Windows Insider Preview 16251.0 rs3 release</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On August 4, the above version of Windows 10 downloaded automatically to my laptop computer, TOSHIBA Satellite C55-C PSCPJU-00R011.&nbsp; I have been using an SSD as my “hard drive” on this computer for some time now. It has always worked perfectly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The update worked smoothly or so I thought. After the update had completed, I powered down the computer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several hours later, when I rebooted the computer. I received a message in very large letters that there was a problem and that Windows 10 was fixing it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer then seemed to boot properly after whatever “fix”. However, in a few seconds, there appeared a small box in center screen indicating an error. I did not have time to copy the message but it was a .dll problem somewhere.&nbsp; I tried rebooting several
 times and the same things repeated themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided it would be best to return the computer to the previous version of the Insider Preview: 16232.rs prerelease 170624-1334. This is what appeared in the lower right corner of the screen. The “return” seemed to work properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I failed to pause the Insider Preview updater and the computer automatically began once again to install what I assume was 16251.0 rs3.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I assumed this would repair whatever went wrong before. This time, however, when I restarted the computer, it failed to boot. It seems to be trying to reboot and I see the Toshiba logo screen which then goes dark for a few seconds and then it happens again
 and again and again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried rebooting with the USB recovery drive which was made when the computer was new. It boots to the various troubleshooting and recovery options, but none of these options work. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I could use another computer
 to download any fix suggested.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Giacomo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just might be a glitch that existed for a while, although not, as far as I am aware in the Release build.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's worth a try. Disable 'Secure Boot' in the BIOS and try:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Too simply boot and see where that takes you.</p>
<p>2) the Install/Repair again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may come down to having to do a real Clean Install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Stephen</p>

<h3> hula_baloo  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do insiders upgrade from 10240&#63;  Very confusing &#58;-&#40;</h2>
                    &nbsp; How about the official Windows 10 released today?&nbsp; I found a link to this MS page for downloading it.
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 .&nbsp; I've downloaded it and run it.&nbsp; That gives you the Media Creation tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; When you run it, it takes you through a no. of options which finally gives you an ISO file which you burn to a DVD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;So then I go to my other desktop where I have the 64 bit Pro version installed that I want to update and insert the DVD.&nbsp; It gyrates for a while then says the KB... update is already installed, but I'll have to reboot to activate it.&nbsp; Then it runs a while
 longer and a window appears saying "<em>Something happened</em>"!???&nbsp; I reboot and see no change in WINVER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;So I boot from the DVD and it asks for a key.&nbsp; I click SKIP because I want to upgrade the 64 bit Pro 10240 installation I've got.&nbsp; Now it's copying files &amp; getting ready for installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Question:&nbsp; Is this what we're supposed to do to go from 10240 to the general released version?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I just wasted 2 hours with that ISO, and when it finished, WINVER still says 10240 and nothing else.&nbsp; It also uninstalled all my programs, removed my data, and gobbled up 13 GB of space.
<br />
<strong>MS&nbsp;&nbsp; R E A L L Y&nbsp;&nbsp; needs to clearly explain what we're supposed to do.&nbsp; They sure haven't done that yet.&nbsp; :-(</strong></p>

            <p>you need to update 1st-- when you download that file and open you are given a choice to upgrade or create a disk--upgrade&nbsp; then create the disk so you&nbsp; can then make a clean install and keep your account updated and not roll back. a clean install does what

            <p>&nbsp;It didn't work that way for me.&nbsp; I didn't do a clean install.&nbsp; As I said in my original post,
</p>
<p>"<em>So I boot from the DVD and it asks for a key.&nbsp; I click SKIP because I want to upgrade the 64 bit Pro 10240 installation I've got.&nbsp; Now it's copying files &amp; getting ready for installation.</em>"&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;After it finished it asked for a key, and I put in the one I'd used to install 10240.&nbsp; It seemed to've taken it, but when I went to Setup, it said I needed to activate.&nbsp; However it wouldn't accept the key I'd used a few minutes earlier.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;That only works when upgrading a 7 or 8.1 version.&nbsp; I asked about upgrading a 10240 version.&nbsp; I'm reinstalling 10240 and will subsequently get all the updates for it.&nbsp; According to Jason with MS that will get me to the same level as what has been released
 today.</p>

            <p>You don't need to.. but you can if you want re-install win10 over itself with an iso&nbsp;simply by double clicking it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Or install it fresh from a bootable dvd or usb, and lose all your installed programs and data.&nbsp;&nbsp; But initially you must install 10240 as
 an upgrade install and have it activated to be licensed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re-Installing gains you nothing other than maybe fixes something with problems.&nbsp; Its the same 10240 and gets the same windows updates as the RTM.&nbsp; Just in a slightly different order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a re-install upgrade with the official iso download after leaving insiders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It went from win10 pro version 10.0.10240.16405 as an insider... to version 10.0.10240.16397 .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in reality all the files are version 10.0.10240.16384 except for the
 few that were updated after the initial release of 10240.</p>

<h2>            Wrapping my head around Exchange Online versus...</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please forgive my bout of ignorance here, but just want to clarify a few things. Let me set up what I currently have:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm a "single" user</li><li>I have a Domain name</li><li>That domain name is part of my GoDaddy (don't judge, I'm trying to change this) account e.g., "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"</li><li>With GoDaddy I have an Office 365 Online Essentials package for the Outlook Exchange server portion (Office Essentials comes with it)</li></ul>
<p>I do not need "any" of the other Office products associated with this GoDaddy Office Essentials package as I also have an Office 365 Home account with full blown app access at "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if I subscribed to Exchange Online "Plan 1" as a single user with "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***," would I then have a true Exchange host/server just like I'm experiencing now on GoDaddy? I'm paying a lot for the Exchange email on GoDaddy and don't need any
 of the Office Essentials since my Outlook.com has all of Office 365 features I need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any clarification would help, Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello TheMsftMan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First I want to let you know that Office 365 Business Essentials plan doesn’t include any Office desktop clients. It includes services like Exchange Online and other services. So you can keep using Office applications via Outlook.com
 account. You can refer to <a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?&amp;activetab=tab%3aprimaryr2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link</a> for reference. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you only subscribe to <a href="https://products.office.com/en-SG/exchange/exchange-online" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Exchange Online Plan 1</a>, you can still use Exchange Online service like you are experiencing now on GoDaddy. Meanwhile, you will lose the ability to use other services like OneDrive, SharePoint and Teams if you don’t need them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Security Essentials real Time Protection</h2>
                    <p>Since returning to Win 7 from Win 10 I have had several problems that I did not have before upgrading to Win 10.</p>
<p>One of them is that MSE had to be re-installed but now switches Real Time Protection off when the PC is shut down. On starting it up the MSE screen comes up in red advising the PC is at Risk as Real Time Protection is off. In addition to that the PC will
 not connect to my Wi-Fi and internet until Real Time Protection is switched on.&nbsp;This happens every time I switch on the PC.</p>
<p>Any solutions to this? I am not a technically minded person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other issues I had were with Word and Outlook 2013, which, thank to assistance from the appropriate forums have been resolved.</p>

            <p>The MSE problem is that Real Time Protection fails to start when you start the PC. All programs shut down when the PC shuts down. Something is preventing MSE from starting properly.</p>
<p>How did you return to Windows 7 from Windows 10?</p>
<p>Is there any other security software present, perhaps a trial version of McAfee, Norton, or other that was provided in the factory image when the PC was new?</p>

            <p>I returned from Win 10 as per the instruction to go in to&nbsp;setting back up and restore then clicking on return to my previous system (Win 7).</p>
<p>I do not have any other security software installed. It is a Dell Latitude E6540 just over one year old.</p>
<p>I am experiencing several problems since going back to Win 7. </p>
<p>Word threw up error message. Fixed with help from the forum.</p>
<p>Outlook 2013 when clicking on a link within an e-mail (to complete an MS questionnaire on my decion to return to Win 7) would not allow me to go to the page. Resolved by the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On return to Win 7 I had to reinstall MSE. Now I have the problem as described.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a problem with back up and restore in Win 7. When trying to set a schedule for System Image back up I get the error message 0x80041321 say it is corrupt or has been tampered with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems returning to Win 7 has created problems that I never had before upgrading to Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make matters worse I am a 72 year old non technical person and some of the fixes are a bit beyond me.</p>

            <p>Hello Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes it does concern the same computer (laptop) as that query for Defender in Win 10. That was resolved by running a Custom scan. However it did not show what it was scanning (C:\ or my USB drive E:\) as Win 7 did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never run McAfee or Norton Removal Tools nor as far as I recall have any of these applications ever been installed.</p>
<p>On Win 7 Security Essentials has on numerous occasions has picked up virus invasive files both on quick and full scans, given appropriate warning and deleted them either on so I am confident that it was working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Taking advice from Stephen Boots response I uninstalled MSE and restarted then reinstalled it.</p>
<p>That has partially resolved things as I no longer get the red warning when starting up that Real Time Protection is off (when in fact it wasn't).
</p>
<p>I ran a quick scan which completed successfully and then ran a full scan to make sure it was working.</p>
<p>It stuck after scanning 2495768 items and just hung there for several hours. The point at which it stopped was:</p>
<p><span>C:\Windows\winsx\Backup\wow64_microsoft-windows-n..-domain-clients-svc_31bf3856ad364e35_6.1.7600.16385_none_aa5813cb3a17070e_polstore.dll_6cd3e56e</span></p>
<p><span>On start up it can take 5 to 10 minutes to connect to the wi fi whereas before it was instantaneous . The router is in my house and I am the only user.</span></p>
<p><span>The issue of setting a Backup schedule is also a problem.</span></p>
<p><span>I get the error message "0x80041321 Task Image is corrupt or has been tampered with"</span></p>
<p><span>When trying to use the Trouble shooter to see if there are any solutions I get the Error 0x80070426 saying it has been prevented from starting.</span></p>
<p><span>Quite a mess because I returned to Win 7</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for your interest in my issues.</span></p>

<p>
</p><div>
<p><em>Microsoft is aware of the problem affecting a number of users running a full scan with MSE.</em></p>
<p><em>Most of the lockups are occurring in two folders:</em></p>
<p><em>\Windows\Winsxs\backup and/or \windows</em></p>
<p><em>Installer\$PatchCache$\Manager\</em></p>
<p><em>At this time, there are two workarounds while we await a solution from Microsoft which will probably come in the form of updated signatures or an update to the scanning engine.</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em><span>Exclude the above folders from being scanned in MSE settings</span></em></li><li><em><span>Change your scheduled scan to a quick scan</span></em></li></ol>
<p><em>As long as real time protection is enabled, a full scan on a frequent basis is usually overkill. A quick scan looks for malware in the most common locations. A full scan has to touch every file. Malware found in a full scan, not in a quick scan is typically
 not active. Personally, I only ever run a full scan if an infection has been detected or if one is suspected. And, if the machine is running MSE, I use a different scanner for the full scan (the malware was missed by MSE when it arrived, so why should I expect
 it to find it on a full scan?)</em></p>

            <p>I have the&nbsp;same problem (MSE apparently gets turned off when the computer is shut down) with my Win7 computer. It started a couple months ago. I've never had any other AV software installed on the computer and never had a virus or any malware that MSE detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I start up from a cold boot, MSE icon in the system tray is Red and real time protection is turned off. I can manually enable it and it runs fine until I shut down. If I put the computer to sleep it stays running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to figure to why this is happening and hopefully MS will have a fix out for this soon.</p>

            <p>Hello n2iph</p>
<p>
</p><p>See the earlier reply from Stephen Boot which suggests uninstalling MSE and download/reinstall&nbsp;&nbsp;it again.
</p>
<p>I did just that. Uninstall - Restart then download and install MSE. I then shut&nbsp;the PC down and started it up again and the problem of the Red Screen had gone. Fingers crossed it does not happen again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per one of my earlier replies, a quick scan worked but the full scan stalled and would&nbsp;not complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A reply from Jssssssss above advises that MS are aware of the full scan not completing and are working on it.</p>

<p><strong>Since I can't send a feedback from IE9 with it bugging my login assistant I thought I'd leave my 2 cents here.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I've always been a huge fan of microsoft software since it went along well with my Windows platform, and that would include IE9 &nbsp;with it's looks blending well into Windows 7 theme, but that alone won't do.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I've read from multiple sources claiming that IE9 is supposedly faster than Chrome. Having downloaded Chrome finally from all the headaches I get from IE, I've realized that's simply not the case.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Buggy IE caused my run/open functions
 to simply stop working, after a complete reinstall of the whole operating system it finally worked, except this time it fails to update the IE9 icon, leaving me with the old IE8 icon. This was fixed strangely after I installed Chrome, but it was annoying enough,
 aside from slow page loads and errors all over the place (google image standard mode not working, choppy page loads, crashing, etc. etc.) To those ready to fire on me with "beta" bullets, these aren't exactly new from the "stable" IE8.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I really don't like Chrome, with it's funky colors and all, but it's SO MUCH faster than IE, fast to install, and easy to remove, providing almost the same functionalities as IE9, and did I mention with not nearly as much crashes and pop ups ? You
 might tout that IE has better this and that, but I doubt I need all the extras that in the end sum up to a slower browsing experience than Chrome. I've installed/uninstalled IE 9 over 50 times hoping to see some errors gone to no avail.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>To sum things up, I was excited, but very very disappointed with IE9 performance. Chrome's an ugly kid down the block, but it does its job well.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please release something that would really rival Chrome instead of get my hopes up. I'll be using Chrome from now on, but will still look forward to something as fast from MS.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Best regards</strong></p>
