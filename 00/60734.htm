<h2>            Always logged on with temporary profile and Can&#39;t access User, Windows and Program Files folder in C&#58; Drive</h2>
                    Hey,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm sorry if this is the wrong forums, i wasn't totally sure what this comes under.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am currently using Windows 8 and i had a program accessing the internet one time even though it said i was connected where the troubleshooters couldn't find anything wrong and restarting didn't fix it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So i decided to do a system restore to see if that would resolve my issue. It said everything went okay but when i restarted my computer was always being logged in to a&nbsp;Temporary&nbsp;profile even after multiple restarts. On my local hard drive with the operating
 system on i found i couldn't access the Users, Windows and Program Files (x86) folders. I have lost all the apps with the only ones remaining are Internet Explorer and Windows Explorer.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't access most programs mainly the ones preinstalled with Windows (e.g. IE10, task manger, parts of control panel, torubleshooting, windows update, etc) with an error every time saying "the side by side configuration is incorrect". I've performed
 multiple disk checks using chkdsk in command prompt in the boot menu which did find many errors mostly in step 4 of 5 but this didn't fix my problem. I also used sfc in command prompt which also found errors but couldn't fix them.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm currently using an administration account. I also have Ubuntu as a dual boot installed from windows which is running fine when i access it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've also created another account on my computer but non of the apps in the start menu are showing and again most of the program aren't working.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please Help,</div>
<div><br />
</div>

<p>Hay James,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since you have performed all the steps to fix the issue, since it didn’t fix the issue you can perform system refresh.</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As far as your query is concerned, It seem that you are having a tough time logging to your default account.</div>
<div>I will surely help you with issue. But I still require certain information to get the right resolution:</div>
<div>May I know whether the default account is an Admin account or a standard user account?</div>
<div>I would recommend you to follow the methods below to resolve the issue:</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>Enable Built Admin account.<br />
<div>a) Press <strong>Windows and x </strong>key together on your desktop screen.<br />
b) Click on Command Prompt (admin).<br />
c) Type: <strong>net user administrator /active: yes</strong></div>
<div>Note: Please follow the same steps and type <strong>net user administrator /active: no</strong> to disable admin account after the troubleshooting is done</div>
<div>After enabling Built-in admin, please try with the steps below:</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>Perform <strong>SFC Scan</strong></div>
<div>Please follow the steps to perform SFC Scan:<br />
<div>a. Press “<strong>Windows Key + Q” </strong>to open Charms Bar.<br />
b. Type “<strong>cmd</strong>” without quotes in the search box.<br />
c. On the left pane, right click on the “cmd” option and select <strong>“Run as Administrator</strong>”.<br />
d. Type <strong>‘sfc /scannow’ </strong>without quotes and hit enter.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>Please perform Microsoft Safety Scanner to scan your computer for infections.</div>
<div><br />
To download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner, follow these steps: </div>
<div>a) Go to the Microsoft Safety Scanner site at: Microsoft Safety Scanner <br />
(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</font></a>)</div>
<div>b) Click Download Now.</div>
<div>c) If prompted, click Run. Follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the Microsoft Safety Scanner. When prompted, add a shortcut to the Microsoft Safety Scanner to your desktop.</div>
<div>d) From your desktop, double click the Microsoft Safety Scanner icon. When the Microsoft Safety Scanner program launches, click Scan Type, then click Full Scan, then click Next.</div>
<div>e) After the scan is complete, remove all detected malware entries<br />
<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.<br />
<br />
For more information refer:</div>
<div><br />
Microsoft resources and guidance for removal of malware and viruses (Microsoft Safety Scanner).</div>

<div><br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong></div>
<div>Please restart your PC and check if you are able to log in to your Default Profile.</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>From Built in administrator account create a new user account and transfer the profile data.</div>
<div>Please follow the steps below to do that:</div>
<div><br />
a) Press <strong>Windows and x</strong> together and select Windows Explorer.</div>
<div>b) Click on <strong>View tab </strong>and Click on <strong>Options</strong> at the top right corner.</div>
<div>c) Click the <strong>View tab</strong>, and then click <strong>Show hidden files, folders, and drives</strong>.</div>
<div>d) Uncheck the box which states <strong>Hide protected operating system files.<br />
</strong>e) Click <strong>Yes </strong>to confirm, and then click <strong>OK. </strong>
<div>f) Locate the <strong>C:\Users\Old_Username folder</strong>, where C is the drive that Windows is installed on, and Old Username is the name of the profile you want to copy files from.</div>
<div>g) Select all of the files and folders in this folder, except the following files:</div>
<div><strong>•Ntuser.dat<br />
•Ntuser.dat.log<br />
•Ntuser.ini</strong></div>
<div>h) Right click and Select <strong>Copy</strong>.</div>
<div>i) Locate the <strong>C:\Users\New_Username folder</strong>, where C is the drive that Windows is installed on, and New Username is the name of the new user profile you created.</div>
<div>j) Right click inside the folder and select <strong>Paste</strong>.</div>
<div>k) Restart your PC and check if you are able to log in to default profile.</div>
<div><br />
Please reply us back if the issue still persists. <br />

    <title>Stutter on multiple monitor setup with different refresh rates. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eddy_tru  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stutter on multiple monitor setup with different refresh rates.</h2>
                    <p>It's been years since Windows 10 released and Microsoft still has not addressed this issue that plagues multiple monitor setups with different refresh rates.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
For those not aware of the issue, Windows 10 forces vsync on all monitors if any application needs hardware acceleration/graphics and also runs on windowed mode/borderless fullscreen. Which means my 144hz monitor will constantly switch to 60hz and show noticeable
 stutter/lag, making it a frustrating experience. Running games on fullscreen seems to be the only way to bypass this issue, but it defeats the purpose of having a multiple monitor setup if I can't seamlessly switch monitors, and alt+tab can make some games
 crash.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will I really have to downgrade to Windows 7/8.1 to get this basic Windows OS feature back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            I was stuck in a continuous bitlocker loop, used a workaround, how do I reapply TPM as normal in RT 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>After researching my continuous loop on startup asking for a bitlocker key on my Surface 2 Windows RT 81, I found this article
</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/18671.bitlocker-troubleshooting-continuous-reboot-loop-with-bitlocker-recovery-on-a-slate-device.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the instructions and this allowed me to boot successfully:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>---cut---</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To terminate this BitLocker recovery loop, you need to suspend BitLocker from within WinRE. To do so, use the following steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Choose the “Skip this drive” link at the bottom of the page where you are asked to enter the recovery key. You should be presented with a menu&nbsp;that will let you get to a command prompt (The sequence is Advanced options -&gt; Troubleshoot -&gt; Advanced options
 -&gt; Command prompt). </li><li>Once you have&nbsp;a command prompt,&nbsp; use the following command to check the BitLocker status of the C: drive:
<ul>
<li><span>manage-bde -status c:</span> </li></ul>
</li><li>If the status is returned as locked, you’ll need to use the following command to&nbsp;unlock it using your recovery password:
<ul>
<li><span>manage-bde -unlock c: -rp &lt;your 48-digit recovery password&gt;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li></ul>
</li><li>Once the drive is unlocked you'll need to use the following command to suspend protection:
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<span>manage-bde -protectors -disable c:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li></ul>
</li><li>Then exit and reboot.&nbsp;The computer should now successfully boot Windows.&nbsp;Once there, use the BitLocker control panel to resume BitLocker protection.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>---cut---</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, how do I now put my c: drive back in the normal protected state as Windows RT does not have a Bitlocker GUI, well, it has, but it can only save the key and I am not sure of the command line actions I need to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current drive status is as follows:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Volume C: [Windows]<br />
[OS Volume]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Size:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 54.50 GB<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BitLocker Version:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conversion Status:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Used Space Only Encrypted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Percentage Encrypted: 100.0%<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Encryption Method:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AES 128<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protection Status:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Protection Off<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lock Status:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlocked<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Identification Field: Unknown<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Key Protectors:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Numerical Password<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TPM</p>
<p>

<p>If it doesn't, try a Startup Repair&nbsp;and / or a&nbsp;System Restore using a Microsoft Vista DVD</p>
<p>Manufacturers Recovery Disks do not normally have Repair Options; thay are normally&nbsp;a reinstall to Factory Settings option&nbsp;only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the guide to using the Repair Options while using a Microsoft Vista DVD.</p>
<p>If a friend or work acquantance of yours&nbsp;has one, you may borrow and use it for Repairs.</p>

<p>If you do not have or can not borrow a Microsoft DVD there is&nbsp;a download of a Vista&nbsp;Startup Repair ISO file available&nbsp;which you can make into a Bootable disk to do the above&nbsp;Startup Repair and&nbsp;that&nbsp;method&nbsp;is recommended by a lot of posters in these Forums.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you have to buy it.</p>
<p>Here is a link to it:</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><em>There are various methods to reinstall Vista</em></strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This&nbsp;may assist you:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/57-windows-vista-direct-download-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/57-windows-vista-direct-download-links</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can contact your&nbsp;Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost.</p>
<p>To reinstall Vista using their Recovery Disk/s, you Boot from the 1st Recovery&nbsp;Disk they supply&nbsp;and follow the Manufacturer's instructions to reinstall:</p>
<p>You will have to change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD Drive 1st in the Boot Order:</p>
<p>How to change the Boot Order in BIOS:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you never received a Recovery Disk when you purchased your Computer there should be a Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall&nbsp;Windows back to how you bought your Computer.</p>
<p>The Recovery process can be started by pressing a particular Key or Keys&nbsp;combination at Boot. (Power On / Startup)</p>
<p>It may be F10, F11, Alt + F10, etc depending on the Manufacturer.</p>
<p>Ask them for the correct Key sequence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some manufacturers no longer have Vista Recovery Disks available.</p>
<p>If that happens, you may have to try this instead:</p>
<p><span>You can also borrow and use&nbsp;a Microsoft Vista DVD, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop case&nbsp;determines which Edition is
 installed. </span></p>
<p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how to do a clean install of Vista, using a Microsoft Vista DVD:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And once the Operating System is installed, go to your Computer Manufacturer's website and obtain the latest Drivers for your particular Model Computer or Laptop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And phone Activation may be required when using the above clean install Method.</span></p>

            Use the Narration track and select the sound file from your computer....&nbsp; the Movie Maker 2012 version has that feature.&nbsp; It uses&nbsp;a different track than the music one and supports using any sound or music file that you can then edit independently of the
 music..

<p><strong>I upgraded my Vista Home to Windows 7. &nbsp;I got through the upgrade OK and about a week later when I startup the computer it displays a black screen with control of my mouse but no desktop or operating system is displayed. &nbsp;I've tried the system checks

            A black screen when you first turn the computer on may occur if there is a problem with the video card drivers and Windows 7. To resolve this problem please follow these steps:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart the computer.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press the F8 key repeatedly when it first turns on before it enters Windows.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the Safe Mode With Networking option in the Advanced Boot Options menu and press Enter.<br />
<br />
NOTE: If Safe Mode does not work please retry the first two steps and select the Enable low-resolution video (640x480) option instead. If this option is selected your desktop will be bigger than usual – this is by design.
<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once in your desktop, click on Start and select the Control Panel.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the Hardware and Sound option and then click on Device Manager under Devices and Printers.<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand the Display adapters list – this should display the video card that is currently installed on your computer. Please note the make and model before proceeding.<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click the video card under Display Adapters and select Disable.<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeat this step if more than one video card is showing under Display Adapters.<br />
9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once all display adapters have been disabled restart the computer in normal mode.<br />
<br />
At this point you should be able to get into your computer without a problem; however, your video card is disabled so you will need to download and install the latest drivers for it. If you had noted the make and model of card when you were in the device manager
 you can search for this on the internet and/or contact the hardware manufacturer for help. Once the drivers are installed correctly on the system you should be able to boot normally without any resolution problems.<br />

            <p>It would depend on what program&nbsp;you are using for e-mail. If you are using an e-mail client like Outlook Express, Windows Live Mail, Thunderbird, etc., all you need to do is create a Windows&nbsp;folder wherever you wand such as My Documents. Open OE and Ctrl+A
 will highlight all the messages. Drag the messages to the Windows folder. They will remain in the e-mail client as well until you delete them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To&nbsp;move all:&nbsp; Highlight one and Ctrl + A will highlight them all. - Move</p>
<p><br />
To&nbsp;move a section: Highlight the first one you want to delete. Scroll down to the last one and click on it while holding the Shift key down. - Move</p>
<p><br />
To&nbsp;move multiple messages that are interspersed: Hold down the Ctrl key while you click on each message to highlight. - Move</p>

<h3> alanfarthing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio pass through</h2>
                    <p>Acer Inspire notebook 160Ghz cpu 2Gb ram 120GB HD. Windows 10&nbsp; Version 1709 build16299.309 Realtek High Def. Audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have installed a Plex NAS, as a test, on the notebook. I connected, from one USB port on the notebook to the USB port on my receiver. The receiver's display says connected i.e. it correctly identifies the notebook's name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when I play some music the sound comes from the notebooks speakers not the hifi's. The same thing happens if I treat the notebook as a straight USB device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that I need to make some changes to the notebook to output the audio to the external device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note - I have, in the past, connected this notebook to a USB DAC which fed the hifi; that worked i.e. sound came from the hifi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice please?</p>

<h2>            Media Player is Corrupted and the fix it from Microsoft won&#39;t correct it at all</h2>
                    I have tried for the last 9 months to get this problem solved ,and I have failed to total sickness. I have reset my Media Player at least 25 times and it still is corrupted,the trouble shooter in Windows 7, can't or wont fix it.  


The Media Player when it is pulled up won't scroll like it supposed to the Media Player won't respond  until it feel's like it ,it tells me at the top it won't respond I have reformatted this PC 4 times in 2 years, 


 first the Media Center Quit working and I had to reformat, then the Device Printer Quit working,and I had to redo it again. The fix it tool is worthless in this problem as well, I have used it at least 30 times on this issue alone. I even changed to a new Hard Drive,  


still this Windows 7 has been a royal pain in the ****, I even tried to run the sfc/scannow and the process wont follow through or finish.I am very dissapointed in Win 7 Ultimate 32 bit , Me and my wife have the same Identical Desktop Pc's with the same operating system and she h

            <p>Whoa, you need some paragraphs in there !</p>
<p>Go for Mac if you like, you' wallet will notice the difference and it can be just as difficult as a Windows PC. As for Linux, good luck, finding drivers for specific software is a real PITA.</p>
<p>So, your problem if I understand it correctly is with WMP.</p>
<p>You should never need to re-install W7 unless you can't start it. Even then shove the DVD in and use the repair function,<u><strong> IF</strong></u> necessary.</p>
<p>WMP hangs or fails to respond, correct ? OK, disable it in Control Panel / Programmes and Functions S Disactivate Windows Functions and un tick the WMP box.</p>
<p>OK, OK, and re-boot.</p>
<p>Then re-activate WMP by doing the above but this time ticking the WMP box.</p>
<p>If it still won't work, then you'll need to re-post giving more precise instructions - like :</p>
<p>* any error message (exact text) ?</p>
<p>* any software changes/installation prior to this happening ?</p>
<p>* any recent hardware changes prior to this happening ?</p>
<p>* make, name and model number of your desktop ?</p>
<p>* what type of file you are trying to play ?</p>
<p>* does it freeze with <u><strong>all</strong></u> types of files or only some - which types ?</p>

            Thanks Jerry, &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The only Error message when the Media Player is loaded ,is when I run the Troubleshooter in the Action Center for&nbsp;resetting&nbsp;the &nbsp;Media Player.
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>At the end of the scan the Troubleshooter tells me it is corrupted then I use the Microsoft Fix it to put it back at default . Then I attempt to redo my Music Library...... As for me maybe going to Apple, I understand that they even have some issues, but
 when you have been patient like I have and have been fighting this issue for over a year.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is only Human to get vast amount's of dissapointment setting up in your behind, so please accept my forgiveness as a gesture of truthfulness . I do appreciate your response and technical suggestions,I have been loyal and faithful to Microsoft. I have
 had 6 desktop's and 2 laptop's in the last 10 years.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;But it seems that Win 7 has more problems than XP,and Vista at least from my experience I have only reformatted Vista 3 time's in 6 years. I will try to follow through to your instruction's to the letter. I wasn't trying to give you any heat or&nbsp;negative&nbsp;mental
 stress, on your part. Just dissapointed in the OS that's all.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; I have put in a new PSU, memory, 1 TB Western Digital Hard Drive new 6200 Nivdia Video Card and added a Fan that pushes the hot air out of the case. The 1TB is partitioned into 3 sections and I have a Data Drive that is 160 gig that has the&nbsp;Developer
 Series on that drive,and&nbsp;&nbsp;since Win 7 Ultimate has Virtual XP it is active on one of the partitions on the 1TB . That is some of the only adjustment's that have been made so far. So, if all of that poses as a problem to use your suggestions on this system
 in using the OS disk to correct the Media Player&nbsp;detailed&nbsp;info would help.........Thanks &nbsp;Jerry, ,...Manbreed AW....</div>

            Jerry you said, go to Control Panel/ Programs and Functions and Disactivate Windows Functions and un tick theWMP box? In my Control Panel there is no Programs and Functions,only Programs and Features but I found the,Turn off or on Windows Features and
 went in and checked the boxes to turn off the Media Player,so I will work on my PC all night and hopefully work this out...... Thanks ,.......Manbreed AW......

            Hey There Jerry;
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;I'm back; &nbsp;I tried to do just what you instructed and, and I even went as far after&nbsp;re clicking&nbsp;into and starting the WMP and the PC and going and, using the Microsoft Fix it to assist cleaning, and resetting the Media Player ,and to no avail it still
 came up after the scan it was corrupted.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The same music is on my Vista 64 bit and even, my&nbsp;Developer&nbsp;Win 8 and the the Virtual XP in my Media Player's are not corrupted so I know it isn't, my Music. It is even on my wife's PC,and there isn't any corrupted file's, or similar problems with my other
 OS system's.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have even gone as far as using Window's 7 Manager, a third party complete Software that is particularly for Windows 7 OS only. &nbsp;To straighten out any files or corrupted&nbsp;registry&nbsp;files or any&nbsp;preexisting&nbsp;problem's in the Win 7 OS in my PC. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So I have turned off the WMP and I am using my Itunes software instead, until somebody can assist me,with the right instructions so I can straighten out this problem,without having to totally reformat my Win 7 since the Itunes doesn't have this problem.
 I wanted to get this straightened out because on my Vista Laptop, I&nbsp;fell-in&nbsp;love with the Window's Media Center, and when I had built these two new Desktop's outta some old Gateway's that I got out of a auction that are Ultra Cases.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Police Dept outta Kansas City Mo. With all new component's that would work with the BIOS ,Intel Pentium(R) 4 CPU 3.00GHz, Number of physical processor's 1/ Number of Logical Processor's 2. &nbsp;775 Motherboard.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, I went with Window's 7 Ultimate 32 bit, because it had the total package for Media Player, and Media Center, and I was looking to the future, because me and my wife plan on running businesses from our home.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>And I do a lot of Media with music , and movies,and my Netflix is&nbsp;awesome&nbsp;with Media Center&nbsp;absolutely&nbsp;fantastic when it works. So,that is why my interest is strong in getting this worked out. That is why I bought the OS, and nothing but issues, and problem's
 especially in this area......... So, I will be waiting for your expertise and insight Jerry, Thank's for trying to assist and help me,guy.........Manbreed AW.........&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Microsoft Office disappeared after installing Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Windows 10 recently automatically installed itself onto my laptop. I am now experiencing numerous problems with how the laptop runs and more worryingly Microsoft Office no longer exists on the laptop. I am a student and desperately need this application
 back. Can someone please help me to retrieve this application?</p>

            <p>Did you accidentally tap the Microsoft symbol on the bottom right side of the computer? or were you visiting some kind of website that had several spyware, malware, viruses and such? the program OS should be a paid version now as July 30, 2016 has already
 passed by and now it needs to be paid for. Did you contact Microsoft support team to fix the error? You could use your original install disk to reinstall windows 7. Eventually Windows 7 will not be supported too much longer, I would give it one to three more
 years and then they will cancel support for the system. Also You could get them to install the Windows 10 again for you after repairing any issues that it has caused your system. They will do it free of charge. So, Upgrade to Windows 10 is a better way to
 go, but make sure that Microsoft support fixes errors for you.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Microsoft took the free version option off your computer...or at least cancelled it after July 30, 2016...call them right away to reinstall Windows 7 if that program is what you desire....</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I don't remember pressing anything on the screen, it just literally seemed to update itself. It was whilst it was advertised as a "free trial" so I haven't paid for anything. I don't have the windows 7 disc - is there any other way I can get office back?
 I am considering taking it to a repair shop where they have said they can revert it back to windows 7,&nbsp;does this mean I will be able to get office back?</p>

            I heard of someone who had this same error that installed windows 10 automatically, Microsoft helped the customer revert back to windows 7. So, all you need to do is contact the Microsoft support team. They will help you...Good Luck!

 to my understanding, this new feature is just so the Photo App can group Pic's that are of the same "Facial Image" as other photos you may have into One Group. I Personally would never use this feature, but never the less, MS thought it could be helpful to
 some.&nbsp;</span></p>

                    I set up remote event log viewing on my network but I am unable to clear the event logs on a remote machine. I get an error that says access denied. I gave administrator privileges to the remote event viewer login but still cannot clear the logs. It is
 possible to do this?

<p>Hi jimagain,</p>
<p>•&nbsp;What is the version of windows installed on the remote computer?<br />
•&nbsp;Is the computer part of domain environment?<br />
•&nbsp;Do you have any security software installed on the computer?</p>
<p>In many cases this may happen due to security software interrupting with the process.<br />
<br />
I would suggest that you disable the security software installed on the computer and check.<br />
<strong>Important</strong>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps!<br />

<h3> duff1  say:</h3>
<h2>            reinstall windows 7 system files</h2>
                    Before Windows 7, it was possible with the installation disk to only reinstall all files associatied with Windows. I'm searching this option in Windows 7 because I was infected by SMART HDD spyware and some Windows files are missing (like snapping tool).<br />
<br />
I don't have a system recovery image.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            You will need either A WIN 7 DVD, or system recovery disk, to run a repair install.<br />

Do you have a recovery partition on the HD?<br />

            I have my Win7 64-bit original CD and a recovery partition for my HP computer but this one is under Win Viste (when I bought my computer).  I don't want a new fresh installation of Windows because I will need to reinstall everything. All I want is the same feature (if it always exist) to simply reinstall the Windows file like in previous version.  And yes, I did not make any recovery image since long time and I know now the lesson because of that **** SMART HDD I don't know how I got it. :-(

            But I don't understand why I cannot simply ask Windows Installer to simply install back system files. I was able to do this in older version, the option was offered to repair Windows.<br />

It had stated that the game must be purchased in the Store, as well as be purchased by March 21.&nbsp;</p><p>(Purchased in the Store on March 8) Yet, when I was checking my Rewards Program dashboard.

However, it would still be too early to see credits pending for that offer. The credits for that offer should be shown as pending about 15 days after the game ships.

    <title>Windows Vista supporting Quad core question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 5n-  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Vista supporting Quad core question</h2>
                    Brief Description:<br />
I recently upgraded from an AMD dual core 6400+ to an AMD quad core 9950 along with the proper mother board and etc. On the hard drive is Windows Vista (32), upgraded from XP (32). Any other time I tried to start up from a hardware change I'd get the usual
 blue screens not allowing me to even get to a log in screen, the repair on the Vista disc constantly gave me cannot repair messages but that didn't happen when I started up this time.<br />
<br />
The Question:***<br />
My system information is reading my processor as an authentic AMD, Quad core 9950, only having 2 cores and 2 logical processors like it was still my dual core. The task manager also only shows 2 windows for processor activity which I would imagine should be
 4 now. ***How do I get Windows Vista to display the correct information and the correct amount of windows to view processor activities? Do I need to run the Repair off the Vista upgrade disc?<br />
<br />
Thank you kindly for any &amp; all help!<br />
<br />
Additional info:<br />
AMD 9950 140W<br />
Asus M3A79<br />
ATI 4850<br />
4GB RAM<br />

    <title>The memory could not be written - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> delandersson  say:</h3>
<h2>            The memory could not be written</h2>
                    Hello. I have two PCs running Poser for 3d stuff. One machine is an i7, one AMD. One has a N-vidia one has ATI graphics. One has 16G ram, the other has 8.<br />
One runs W7 pro the other W7 Home premium. What they have in common is that they both run Posers Firefly renderer, FFR over the network. Either you let Poser render your image or you ask the other machine to do it. Anyway. I have had this program for quite
 some time an everything was running smoothly until a Saturday two weeks ago. Just after the latest batch of updates. Both machine come up with an application error while rendering. "The memory could not be written"<br />
The only system changes done during that time was the updates so i am convinced that something affected something and so on.<br />
It says specifically: "FFRender64.exe - Application Error&nbsp; The instruction at 0x402a9546 referenced memory at 0x000001a0. the memory could not be written. Click on OK to terminate the program"<br />
Could somebody please come up with something? and please remember TWO machines, TWO CPU brands, TWO MB-brands, TWO GPU brands and yet the same problem!<br />

Then paste it in here or Google. Is it the same as what the install said?? <br />

            <p>I had this problem and after careful observation and testing I have found the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I use an extended monitor with a laptop</p>
<p>2. I have the taskbar displayed on both monitors (this is a new feature in Windows 10 and can be switched on/off in the start menu)</p>
<p>3. I used the recommended screen resolution settings - this was different for each monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the problem only exists in windows 10 I thought that the new taskbar feature must be part of the problem. Someone else on this forum mentioned that setting the monitors to have the same resolution would solve the problem. Which it did. But now my
 extended display is not set at the correct resolution. So I also switched off the extended taskbar option and set the extended monitor back to the correct resolution. So far, the icons have not moved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I think perhaps there is a bug that MS can look at which is to do with allowing the taskbar to appear on an extended monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find this setting: go to the taskbar, right click, go to properties, untick 'show taskbar on all displays'.</p>
