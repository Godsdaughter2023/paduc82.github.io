    <title>I do NOT want to see album art. How do I shut it off&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sjdi  say:</h3>
<h2>            I do NOT want to see album art.  How do I shut it off&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Windows 7.&nbsp; Media Player 12 (at least I think it's version 12--I can't find an "about" menu item to see for sure).&nbsp; The Album Art and album title are combined into one column in the overall library view (Artist option).&nbsp; I want to widen the display of the
 album title (It's often a very long name of a classical piece, e.g., "Symphony 41 in C, "Jupiter", K551")&nbsp; However any attempt to widen the column for the album title INSTEAD causes the album art (which is just a generic eighth note icon anyway) to grow.&nbsp;
 I want to see the NAME OF THE ALBUM, not a useless piece of "album art".&nbsp; The album art and album name are connected like siamese twins.&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently someone decided album art was more important than the name of the album!!</p>
<p>I realize that I could switch to "Album" view if I really wanted to but that has its own problems--I find it much less useful to be sorted by the name of an album (particularly when a lot of albums are called "Symphony such and such"), plus the (useless)
 album art takes up huge amounts of real estate in the window.</p>
<p>Returning to the Artist View, attempting to turn off the album art via the "choose columns..." menu shows me a check box for album art that is checked but NOT grayed out, but you can't uncheck it.&nbsp; (Please don't show me a control--and pretend it's usable
 by not graying it out--that you have no intention of letting me use!)&nbsp; The title is also there, checked but grayed out (that makes sense).</p>
<p>I noticed that Version 10 was the same way and was hoping to see this change for Version 12.&nbsp; Surely someone else out there has album titles longer than 20 characters and has griped.</p>

<h3> shlomo rubin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 insider preview key won&#39;t activate after clean install of 29th official build.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, i was in the insider program and read that you have to install the 10240 build as upgrade and only then make a clean install, which i did and even used the build for a few days before making a clean install.</p>
<p>but now windows says that the key is cannot be activated. should i go back to 8 and used the key i have for 8 and "order" a free upgrade ? or is there a way to solve this.<br />

            Microsoft sends you a key through your e-mail.&nbsp; If you haven't deleted it, try searching "Microsoft customer support" or "Thanks for ordering Windows 8".&nbsp; That is the way&nbsp; I found mine (way back in Dec. 2012).

<h2>            Windows 10 problems opening Calendar, Mail, Photo, and who know what else</h2>
                    <p>I have updated&nbsp;TO windows 10&nbsp;FROM windows 7 about a week ago and I was originally able to open apps, like Calendar, Mail, Photo, People, News, Grove, Movies and TV, Alarm, Camera, ETC...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could not save files in anything in my username which create problems so I played with the permissions. Around the same time, windows made an update. After reboot, I could not&nbsp;some apps.&nbsp;Most&nbsp;just gave me a splash screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used both SFC and DISM and tried the usual I seen in forums.&nbsp;Nothing fixed the problem but made it worse as I couldn't open any window apps at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to re-register, removing and re-installing using PowerShell, it didn't fix the problem. I even completely removed my virus protection program. I've done everything I read in all forums related to my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a&nbsp;system restore from back to the date where I first did the reinstall. That didn't work.<br />
<br />
I created another user account to see if they would work and that didn't work. As a matter of fact, even the new user account I created inherited the same issues.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried to revert back to Windows 7 but it said I cannot because the files required to go back have been removed from my hard drive. But I only upgraded less than 2 weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to Reset the PC and when it loaded, it said it encountered an error, so I undid all the changes and reverted back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the world is Microsoft doing? I see the same problem with hundreds people and hundreds of complaint and no one is getting any help with this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone please help, Thank you...&nbsp;</p>

<p>SOLUTION FOUND</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting fed up, I tried the only option left. I downloaded the Windows 10 update ISO Image file and burned it to the DVD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did&nbsp;NOT use the media tool to create the ISO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-installed it, choosing to check for updates before install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose to KEEP both files and apps because I didn't want to lose my files and programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose to use the Microsoft Account (it remembered and welcomed me back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to go into the store and click LIBRARY, and click the down arrows to reinstall all window apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was pretty well the same experience, except this time, everything works, nothing broke.</p>

</p><p>If you re-install and it works, please come back and let me know and click HELPFUL.</p>

            <p>Instead of doing battle with arcane error messages, use the administrator's way of dealing with this recalcitrant folder. It works like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the Windows key and type these letters: &nbsp;<em>cmd</em></li><li>Right-click the Console application window up the top, then left-click "Run as administrator". You will get a black frame.</li><li>Type these 4 commands <strong>exactly</strong> and press Enter after each. They assume that your problem folder is C:\Users\Courtney\My Documents\Bad Folder<br />
<em>cd &nbsp;/d &nbsp;"C:\Users\Courtney\My Documents"</em><br />
<em>takeown &nbsp;/f &nbsp;"Bad Folder" &nbsp;/r</em><br />

            <p>It may help to look at the minidump files from the crashes with a debugger.</p>
<p>In Safe Mode with Networking can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.<br />

 that box is stated; "Do you want to allow the following program to make changes to this computer?"&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time that I click on the "No" tab, this same box comes right back up and&nbsp;continues to not allow me to access any programs or&nbsp;to even shut down my pc from
 the desktop.&nbsp; Within that&nbsp;"User Account Control" box that comes up&nbsp;, it states the "Program Name:" as "Windows Command Processor" and the "Verified Publisher:" as "Microsoft Windows".&nbsp; Clicking on the "Show Details" button within that box; it, then, states

            <p>I agree with your idea that the program is probably malicious, and you should definitely click "No".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have an up-to-date virus scanner (such as you had one, but it is expired and needs a payment), let me suggest that you remove the outdated one and install the free
<a href="http://microsoft.com/security_essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Security Essentials</a> instead. It is free and never requires a subscription to keep you protected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you already have good, updated virus protection, I would continue onward by deleting all your temp files.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcmdrkeene.com%2fanswers%2fwin7.jpg" />+<strong>R</strong> and paste this in:<br />
<strong>C:\users\tomr\appdata\local\temp\low</strong><br />
<br />
</li><li>Delete everything in that folder.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Press <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcmdrkeene.com%2fanswers%2fwin7.jpg" />+<strong>R</strong> again and paste this in:<br />
<strong>cleanmgr</strong><br />
<br />
</li><li>In the Cleanup Manager box that opens, select all items (unless you specifically want to keep a certain item), then click OK to remove them.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Press <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcmdrkeene.com%2fanswers%2fwin7.jpg" />+<strong>R</strong> again and paste this in:<br />
<strong>cleanmgr<br />
<br />
</strong></li><li>This time, click "Clean up system files" and repeat the same step to clean up those files as well.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Press Press <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcmdrkeene.com%2fanswers%2fwin7.jpg" />+<strong>R</strong> again and paste this in:<br />
<strong>msconfig<br />
</strong></li><li>Go to the Startup tab and uncheck anything you don't recognize (or anything you don't specifically want auto-starting), then click OK</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After these cleanups, I would run a full scan with your virus scanner, then restart and see how it runs.</p>

            <p>Hi Shawn;&nbsp; Sincerely appreciate you taking the time to respond to my request for help &amp; advice to my stated pc problem.&nbsp; I did do disk clean up &amp; deleted all of my temporary internet files which looks to have stopped that "User Account Control" box from
 continuously popping up which wouldn't let me open up any folders on my desktop or even click on the&nbsp;shut down button to turn off my pc.&nbsp; But, I have a couple questions with regards to your replied answer &amp; suggestions which I would greatly appreciate your
 feedback on also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First; something else with my pc started happening just last night and maybe it in association or linked to whatever&nbsp;it was that&nbsp;caused&nbsp;the&nbsp;"User Account Control" pop up box issue which has stopped happening.&nbsp; What is&nbsp;happening now&nbsp;and even while I've been
 typing this message to you.&nbsp; My monitor's screen will suddenly become black&nbsp;as though it has been&nbsp;turned off or in screen saver sleep mode&nbsp;and only by&nbsp;moving the mouse will the screen come back up with the internet page that I was on.&nbsp; It's sporadic and will
 happen 3 or 4 times over a 15 second time frame and then, not again for a minute or two later.&nbsp; I suspect that it's must be some kind of virus which is causing this to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to my question(s) and keep in mind that you're talking with a guy who is pretty much overall a clueless person when it come to a computer.&nbsp; That's why I have a big appreciation &amp; respect for guys like you who&nbsp;have taken the time to become knowledgeable
 on&nbsp;the pc.&nbsp; Especially; those such as you who take the time and willingly try to help &amp; educate&nbsp;pc idiots like me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only&nbsp;virus protection that I&nbsp;am using to protect my pc, is the "Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Pro" software program.&nbsp; This is not the free version of software and&nbsp;is the paid for real-time protection software from Malwarebytes.&nbsp; Is this a protection software
 that can &amp; will provide my pc with effective protection from getting a virus and that&nbsp;will almost always be able to detect &amp; remove&nbsp;any virus which my pc may have gotten?&nbsp; Or,&nbsp;should I have additional protection along with the Malwarebytes program, such as
 the Microsoft Security Essentials free version of&nbsp;protection software which you had recommended&nbsp;in your reply to me?&nbsp; On my previous desktop Dell pc; I used to have the free version of Malwarebytes software along with the McAfee protection program which my&nbsp;ISP,
 Cox,&nbsp;offers &amp; gives to their internet subscribers for free.&nbsp; But, I've always heard that McAfee protection software is not very good and the free version of Malwarebytes would find malicious Trojan type files in my&nbsp;previous pc that McAfee wouldn't.&nbsp; That's
 why I paid for &amp; installed the Malwarebytes Pro protection software in my new Dell desktop pc and&nbsp;didn't bother to also install the McAfee software from my Cox ISP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you think, Shawn?&nbsp; I really could use some more of your advice &amp; thoughts&nbsp;on this stuff.&nbsp; I ran the Malwarebytes&nbsp;scan about an hour ago and it came up with no&nbsp;infected files on my pc, but&nbsp;I have continued to have those moments of my screen&nbsp;suddenly
 going black during the entire time of&nbsp;typing this message to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much and sorry for the very long email, but I wanted to make sure that you had a good overall&nbsp;understanding of&nbsp;my pc matters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tom R&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            I'm not sure on the monitor blanking, but I think it sounds like you know more than you think and have researched your antivirus options.&nbsp; Malware Bytes it great tool and protects against malware, but I would recommend combining it with a virus scanner
 as well.&nbsp; My personal recommendation is <a href="http://microsoft.com/securityessentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Security Essentials</a> because it is free (no subscription) and doesn't seem to slow down a system like Norton and McAfee can do.

            <p>Oh this definitely a virus. Trojan Virus. Obupdat.exe it tries to install.&nbsp;trojan.win32.rozena.rpcs he got. Not sure on what type of&nbsp;virus it is for him? Most likely this one? But its a&nbsp;trojan virus.&nbsp;My friend got it&nbsp;actually some how by being on instagram.&nbsp;Gosh
 the weird places you dont even expect it. He had to take a extreme procedure to just get rid of it.&nbsp;He first did a system-restore. One way to get around it is Ctrl-Alt-Delete to even to try to trick it to stop popping up; it will still be there in your face
 but hit NO. It takes a few tries but it works so you can tell your computer to do system restore and do things on your computer. Basically using&nbsp;task-manager to get around it but its still there and it wont close as I&nbsp;said&nbsp;but using the task-manager staying
 open will allow you to do things to do a system restore. After that download Kaspersky 2015 Internet Security (30 day full anti-virus or I recommend the Internet Security software). He apparently got rid of a file named roqni.dll. I just came on here to make
 sure he really got rid of it and to make sure if any else had to do something else to completely get rid of it and to help anyone else out. Make sure you delete the file in your temp folder that will help with the system restore. I believe my friend got rid
 of it but making sure of it was for his sake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This not the same guy...my friend had this happen to him yesterday.</p>

            <p>Hi Shawn;&nbsp; Thanks much for your follow up.&nbsp; The sporadic problem with my monitor's screen suddenly going black hasn't happened; since I turned on my pc about 30 mins ago.&nbsp; Anyway, I did do quite a bit of research last night, after sending you that first
 reply message and your recommendation that I need to have an&nbsp;anti-virus&nbsp;protection program in addition to the Malwarebytes anti-malware software&nbsp;which I've been solely relying on to protect my pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based upon my&nbsp;research on the Bleeping Computer, SANS Institute, and LifeHacker websites about anti-virus / anti-malware protection and the many associated software programs that are available for free or to purchase; the overall&nbsp;indication was that the&nbsp;Avast&nbsp;software
 was&nbsp;of the best anti-virus program which is supposedly free to download and Malwarebytes was the best&nbsp;for anti-malware protection.&nbsp; According to the LifeHacker report; Malwarebytes' priority &amp; main focus is to stay on the forefront of protecting their users
 from the newly created malware, termed "Zero-day" or "Zero-hour" type of malware.&nbsp; Malware that they don't target is usually older types that might not have been seen for a few years and they leave that kind of protection up to the anti-virus software vendors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shawn; are you at all familiar with Avast and/or have heard anything about their anti-virus program from any others who have tried or do use their product?&nbsp; I had never heard of Avast, but the LifeHacker report stated that the user base of their anti-virus
 software is 184 million people worldwide which would indicate to me that their&nbsp;anti-virus product must be pretty good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also read that you shouldn't have or run&nbsp;2 anti-virus software programs in your pc, because they will conflict with each other and diminish their abilities to protect your pc.&nbsp; But generally, there won't be any conflict between&nbsp;2 different mfgs' anti-malware
 software programs that you have installed in your pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However with regards to having &amp; using&nbsp;both an&nbsp;anti-Virus&nbsp;software (MSE or Avast)&nbsp;and&nbsp;an&nbsp;anti-Malware program&nbsp;(Malwarebytes)&nbsp;to protect my pc; I have a question&nbsp;that I couldn't find the answer to from my research on those websites which you&nbsp;very possibly
 could answer for me.&nbsp; With the anti-Virus program running real-time protection; do you think that it is okay and won't cause any conflict between the 2 software programs by also running the&nbsp;Malwarebytes anti-Malware program in real-time or would it be better
 to change the functionality of my "Malwarebytes Pro" program to "on-demand", instead of it's currently set real-time&nbsp;function?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh; I just remembered, Shawn,&nbsp;one other unrelated question that I wanted to ask you which has to do with&nbsp;a computer's "Disk Clean-up" maintenance program.&nbsp; When I do the "Disk Clean Up" maintenance on my pc.&nbsp; One of the listed line items with a box to check,
 is&nbsp;"System Error Memory Dump Files".&nbsp; Should I be checking that box to&nbsp;have those files deleted that&nbsp;are in this "System Error Memory Dump Files" folder or whatever it is?&nbsp; I've only been checking the&nbsp;boxes to delete the files of those in &nbsp;"Temporary Internet",
 "Thumbnails", and a couple others.&nbsp; I have no idea what the "System Error Memory Dump Files" are and if,&nbsp;any of those files&nbsp;may possibly be&nbsp;useful and shouldn't be deleted or what.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so very much&nbsp;for taking the time to talk, help, and share with me your&nbsp;expertise &amp; feedback on my pc issues and questions.&nbsp; Have a great weekend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Tom Reeves</p>
<p>Irvine, Ca&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Good evening Mr. Maverick Hawk 5;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greatly appreciate you taking the time to read &amp; respond with your feedback &amp; recommendations on my sudden pc problem with the screen sporadically going black 2-3 times within just a few seconds and then being fine for a minute or two; only to have it start
 doing this, again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway; I turned on my pc a couple hours ago to get any new emails.&nbsp; Since then; I have&nbsp;sent a reply to Shawn's latest&nbsp;message and now typing this reply back to you and so far;&nbsp;I haven't experienced any of the screen blackout occurrences that were happening
 last night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not 100% sure about this, but your call of&nbsp;my last night's screen blackout problem is likely due to the Trojan Virus,&nbsp;"Obupdat.exe", is right on the money.&nbsp; Because last night, while I was on the&nbsp;computer and the&nbsp;screen blackouts were happening.&nbsp; I recall
 that a Malwarebytes&nbsp;pop-up box had come up, indicating that it had&nbsp;found a Trojan and had quarantined it.&nbsp; A few hours ago, when I got on my pc and before I saw your emailed reply message.&nbsp; The first thing that I did was run a full Malwarebytes scan of my
 pc&nbsp;which came up with 0 infected files and then,&nbsp;went to the Malwarebytes program's quarantine page to permanently delete that Trojan which Malwarebytes had&nbsp;found &amp; quarantined last night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish, now,&nbsp;that I had written the name down the name of&nbsp;that Trojan, before I had&nbsp;permanently deleted it this evening from the&nbsp;Malwarebytes quarantine.&nbsp; But, I do recall and am pretty sure&nbsp;that "Obupdat" was part of that Trojan's name which Malwarebytes&nbsp;showed
 to be quarantined.&nbsp; But, here's my question.&nbsp; If, it were the same Trojan that you mentioned in your message which Malwarebytes had quarantined last night and I continued to get those sporadic screen blackouts even after it had been quarantined.&nbsp; Wouldn't
 those blackouts have stopped happening right then?&nbsp; Oops!&nbsp; Maybe I've spoken to soon and&nbsp;have mentioned all this for no reason.&nbsp; Because&nbsp;just right now, I've experienced 3-4 quick&nbsp;screen blackouts for the first time this evening.&nbsp; Guess, I better try doing
 the system restore process&nbsp;that you suggested to hopefully stop once &amp; for all&nbsp;this blackout&nbsp;bs from continuing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other thoughts, Maverick and again, thanks much.</p>
<p>Tom R.</p>

            <p>Avast is a very popular antivirus program and many users like it. I prefer to use
<a href="http://microsoft.com/securityessentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Security Essentials</a>, but there's no problem if you choose to use Avast instead.&nbsp; Since MalwareBytes is not actually an antivirus, it's OK to run Avast and MalwareBytes together at the same time,
 they can complement each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the Disk Cleanup, it is safe to remove those memory dump files. Those are generated automatically when a failure occurs, and can be used for very intensive troubleshooting when required, but they aren't really useful for normal folks (not even for
 me haha!) and can be cleaned out.</p>

            <p>Hello TRReeves,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been a month-and-a-half since your problems, but they may not be over. When a Trojan puts a virus into your system it can, 1, create the virus application from scratch which it then adds as a service to be unknowingly run by Windows on startup, or 2,
 "inject" the virus into an existing Windows system program, driver, or library routine. If it has "injected" per method #2, then when an anti-virus program "removes" the virus, your Windows system is left damaged -- the anti-virus program has no way to replace
 the code that the virus "injected" and put back the original system code. Either revert to a previous restore point, or perform a system refresh beginning with the original copy of Windows followed by any service packs that have been issued for that version
 of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restore Or Windows Refresh?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restoring is a lot easier and faster than refreshing, plus after a restore, you might only need to reinstall or reconfigure a few recent applications (or not, depending upon what you've done since your last restore point was created), whereas with a refresh
 you run the risk of losing everything (so, back up now!) and having to reinstall everything from scratch. However, if you know how to do the refresh (which partly depends of which version of Windows you are running), it can yield better results than a restore
 because you won't lose anything. In other words, a flubbed refresh could lose everything, or if successful, lose nothing, whereas a restore will always lose something, but it is easy to do and if you remember what you did since your last restore point, it
 is simpler.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why am I telling you this? Because you may find your system is flaky since the anti-virus application "cleaned" your system because of the damage to syste code that was left behind. A "successful" virus doesn't want to cause such damage, so it may take some
 time for you to discover something that doesn't quite work right -- understand?</p>
<p>
</p><p>HTH</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: From what you wrote, I'd guess that the system code that the virus "injected" messed up your video driver. You may have already reinstalled that driver, and if so, you may be done!</p>

<p>Hate those odd number achievements! &nbsp;on Trueachievements.com you can search for all games that have the weird numbers. Say if you wanted 13 to make your GS even, or if you had 660 and you wanted to find an achievement for 6GS it would list them all out.

<h2>            SOLVED&#42; - How to record game &#38; party chat using upload studio</h2>
                    <p>Welcome everyone! Recently I have seen a lot of people on forums everywhere stating Why doesn't the Xbox dvr record game or party chat. Even as i write this now it still hasn't changed or been updated, so I made a tutorial on how you can record both game and party chat as well as&nbsp;live commentary using upload studio and iMovie. I will leave a&nbsp;link to this&nbsp;video&nbsp;below so it can hopefully help those who are still stuck! 👑✌️</p>

            There is no such option available in Windows 10, but you can search third party programs that can keep a digital calendar pinned to your desktop.
<br />
<br />Right now, you best option is to click and view the clock in the Taskbar notification area.

            Hi jlynnsil, you will need a 3rd party app to do that . .. 
<br />
<br />A very good Free option is Outlook on the Desktop:

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can place a link to your Calendar on the desktop, and place a Calendar of your choosing on the desktop too.  
<br />
<br />To create a shortcut right click your preferred Calendar app in All Apps list in Start Menu, choose More, then File Location.  Find the shortcut or program .exe in the file explorer which opens, right click to Send to: Desktop (shortcut).
<br />
<br />To place an actual Calendar on the desktop, install 8 Gadget Pack which works fine in Windows 10 though it needs quick repair after each version update.  <a href="http://8gadgetpack.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://8gadgetpack.net/</a>.  After install right click on right hand dock to remove the dock so the gadgets are free floating.  Right click desktop to open Gadgets to choose your Calendar.  I also like the Window 7 style weather gadget here:  <a href="http://win7gadgets.com/weather/weather.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://win7gadgets.com/weather/weather.html</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>since two days my notebook always stops seconds after start with a BSOD:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Thu 14.07.2016 20:09:13 GMT your computer crashed<br />
crash dump file: C:\Windows\Minidump\071416-7218-01.dmp<br />
This was probably caused by the following module: ntoskrnl.exe (nt+0x142780) <br />
Bugcheck code: 0x3B (0xC0000005, 0xFFFFF8009AF0269F, 0xFFFFD00024CED720, 0x0)<br />
Error: SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION<br />

description: NT Kernel &amp; System<br />
Bug check description: This indicates that an exception happened while executing a routine that transitions from non-privileged code to privileged code.
<br />
This appears to be a typical software driver bug and is not likely to be caused by a hardware problem.
<br />
The crash took place in the Windows kernel. Possibly this problem is caused by another driver that cannot be identified at this time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Thu 14.07.2016 20:09:13 GMT your computer crashed<br />
crash dump file: C:\Windows\memory.dmp<br />
This was probably caused by the following module: ntdll.sys (ntdll!NtOpenKeyEx+0x14)
<br />

Bug check description: This indicates that an exception happened while executing a routine that transitions from non-privileged code to privileged code.
<br />
This appears to be a typical software driver bug and is not likely to be caused by a hardware problem.
<br />
A third party driver was identified as the probable root cause of this system error. It is suggested you look for an update for the following driver: ntdll.sys .
<br />
Google query: ntdll.sys SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed nothing in the system since a long time. Only a windows update was installed the day before the problem started.</p>
<p>Since that, I was only able to start windows in safe mode.</p>
<p>Now, I found out by trying "Clean Startups" with more and services, that the Service "Windows Update" causes the Problem.</p>
<p>It is disabled now. </p>
<p>Fortunately I can use the System now, but without Windows Update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be glad to get an advice what I could do to solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Alex</p>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did everything suggested. But now I have a really big problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After Norton Removal, Windows Defender and Firewall start, the situation was unchanged. With Windows Update Service checked in msconfig Services I have got again the Blue Screen after some seconds. I tried it several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I configured the driver verifier like described, unchecked the Windows Update Service in msconfig Services and restarted the System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop is obviously running, but the screen stays black. </p>
<p>I am not able to get into safe mode or the bios. No reaction.</p>
<p>Now I am locked out completely from the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideas that could help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Alex</p>

            <p>Sorry, I forgot one point above:</p>
<p>After I restarted the System with the verifier, there was immediately a blue screen with the following message:</p>
<p>"Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. You can restart.</p>
<p>If you'd like to know more, you can search online later for this error: DRIVER_VERIFIER DETECTED_VIOLATION (iusb3hcs.sys)</p>

            <p>hi xp rocks, </p>
<p>
</p><p>no, unfortunately the approach was interrupted by a hardware failure. Only the notebook's CPU fan does its work.
</p>
<p>today curiously the system came suddenly again to the BSOD DRIVER_VERIFIER DETECTED_VIOLATION.
</p>
<p>However, now its all black again.<br />
</p>
<p>Maybe, if it can be repaired, I come back to complete the approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

    <title>Resident Evil 5&#58; error code 03-80-00 on Xbox 360 S - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Resident Evil 5&#58; error code 03-80-00 on Xbox 360 S</h2>
                    
<p>Please excuse me if this is already a known and documented issue, but I was unable to find anything by searching the forum, so I'd like to know for sure.</p>
<p>I have found that the disc version of Resident Evil 5 apparently cannot be recognized by the Xbox 360 S model for some reason. I never had any problem with it on the original "fat" Xbox 360 model, but when I try to install or play it on an S model, I get
 an "unrecognized disc" error 03-80-00.</p>
<p>I have tested this on two different Xbox 360s of each model. Both of the original-configuration models are able to read and play the disc without any problems. Both of the S models get the same read error. One of those had no USB or&nbsp;storage units&nbsp;attached
 at the time.</p>
<p>The disc itself is spotless but I have tried running it through a professional-grade CD buffer anyway; no effect. Clearing my Xbox 360's system cache had no effect either.</p>
<p>I have only experienced this problem with this one, single game (Resident Evil 5). My Xbox 360 S reads&nbsp;every one&nbsp;of my other 40 Xbox 360 discs without any problems whatsoever. This leads me to wonder if there is a known issue with this game. Can anyone confirm
 this?</p>

<p>Thanks for replying. As I'd attempted to explain, I already tried those steps. I don't believe it is a problem with my machine because I tested the disc on four different Xbox 360s. The original models are able to read it, but the S models are not.</p>

            I have tried this tool to uninstall but it is not removing the software so I downloaded a utility "REVO UNINSTALL PRO" this was a scary utility, but I did get what appears to be the job done. But / and so, I still cannot get software to work, then I can't
 get it uninstalled without going through the same as mentioned. The crazy part is it was working fine and this MS 8.1 updated and everything relating to my printer/printing went south.<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>What “Andre Da Costa” means is in some cases you will not be able to find a driver compatible with Windows 8.1. You need to download an older version of the device driver and install it in compatibility mode. Compatibility mode

            <p>OK, I solved the problem related to corrupted files and&nbsp;error 0x800f081f. Apparently, the problem is due to the fact I upgraded &nbsp;my Italian win 8.1 directly to English win 10. Somehow, upgrading this way , corrupted files were generated that both scannow
 and Dism weren't able to fix. Instead, when using DISM&nbsp;<span>/</span><span>Online</span><span>/</span><span>Cleanup</span><span>-</span><span>Image</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span>/</span><span>RestoreHealth
 /Source:..etc the procedure didn't work because (obviously) I downloaded the English iso of win10.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I solved the problem by re-installing win 10 in Italian. I downloaded the Italian iso of win10, run the setup and install it. After that, I run a scannow to verify things were all-right, it found some corrupted files but were able to fix them.
 Since then, both scannow and dism/scanhealth return the system is fine!! </span>
</p>
<p><span>Don't know if&nbsp;</span>DISM&nbsp;<span>/</span><span>Online</span><span>/</span><span>Cleanup</span><span>-</span><span>Image</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span>/</span><span>RestoreHealth
 /Source:..etc &nbsp;with the Italian iso of win10 would have worked too.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft does suggest you to first upgrade to win10 in the same language and then to change it... but it is only an advice. Since annoying issues can arise otherwise, maybe this procedure should be made compulsory.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to thank Microsoft for the ridiculous support I have received here so far, where in 4 days no one bothered to answer me after I did what I was told to. &nbsp;If somebody cares, I have still some doubts about my disk usage.</span></p>

<p>If you receive calls from unknown numbers using your Skype Number, it's most likely because these people or their telecommunications service providers are not allowing the caller identification to be shown.&nbsp;This is something Skype cannot control as it can
 be the phone number users who hide their caller identification or&nbsp;their telecommunications providers' discretion.</p>

<p>Hi Jomel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that some TELCO providers are not allowing their number to be shown. But i'm talking about getting unknown numbers on ALL incoming calls. While it might highly be likely that they all have the same TELCO or all have restrictions but if that
 would be the reason then I thank you for your time and your prompt response. Great work!</p>

    <title>Recovery and SysPrep Fatal Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gav0310  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovery and SysPrep Fatal Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent the last hour reading every forum possible about SysPrep and the fatal error message but I can't seem to find a solution or at least find someone who is receiving it in the same means I am.<br />
</p>
<p>I am running Windows 7 on my ASUS laptop (N55S) and I have been having a few performance issues etc. so decided to restore my laptop and do a recovery partition. It seemed to run fine and do its thing and then SysPrep popped up. I kept the default setting
 (OOBE &amp; Reboot) and clicked OK but within seconds it pops up telling me a fatal error has occurred.</p>
<p><br />
I understand this is something to do with the rearm counts and a lot of people have said to edit the unattend.xml file however I can't see unattend.xml anywhere in the SysPrep folder?<br />
I see that on the Microsoft website it says to rebuild the Windows image but to be quite honest I don't entirely know what that means. Does this mean rebooting from a previous version - if that's the case I don't think I have anything previous since I have
 just restored to factory settings...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am about ready to tear out my hair! Any guidance would be hugely appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gav</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This error message is designed to prevent the deployment of a corrupted image. When you run the Sysprep tool, its progress is tracked through each of the phases of Sysprep. Sysprep does not have a way to roll back when it experiences errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to refer this article and check if it helps.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Error message when you use the Sysprep tool on a Windows Vista-based computer: "A fatal error occurred while trying to sysprep the machine"</strong><br />

(Also holds good for Windows 7)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I highly recommend backing up all of your important files and folders onto an external storage device before attempting any type of OS repair, upgrade or reinstallation.</p>
<p>

            It is set at Centre, but it fills the screen and is fuzzy. &nbsp;I try Fit, Fill, and Centre, and it always fills the screen.

            It's set at "1440x900 (Recommended)" &nbsp;I didn't change anything. &nbsp;XP settings were out-of-the-box. &nbsp;I don't know what they were.

            <p>Hello Mike Row Soft, I think there might be some issue with your graphics card. Please update your graphics card driver to the latest one and try the previous method again, though&nbsp;I think your updated&nbsp;graphics card should automatically adjust the resolution.
 Anyway, please let us know if the problem persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps, Mrityunjay</p>

            I updated the graphics card driver, made sure that image is set at Centre in Personalize. &nbsp;The problem is not solved.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would guess that is correct...and different from XP because you probably have a wide Screen Display now? Or is this a new computer with the previous monitor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just tried what you are attempting, and when I set it to Center, it displayed the picture actual size with black around it as you describe...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do know that I installed graphics drivers for my machine, and they claimed my standard monitor was a wide screen...everything worked but the recommended resoultion was way off...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are still using your previous monitor, try setting the resolution at 1280x1084 if it will let you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
