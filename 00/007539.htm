    <title>if formula for cells that are within 5&#37; of a specific number - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            if formula for cells that are within 5&#37; of a specific number</h2>
                    <p>I want to filter a field&nbsp;(column) that will show me results that are within 5% (+ or -) of a given number.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Does anyone know how I can write this out?<span>&nbsp; </span>More specifically, I have a 'Square Ft.' field (column)&nbsp;and I want to see all the records that are within 5% of the number 2,988 (5% above and 5% below).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or instead of an 'if formula' as my solution, should I just use the conditional format option for the cells and highlight the cells that fit in that range green?&nbsp; If so, how
 would I write that formula out?</p>

            <p>Hi Jarmo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Le Boule has provided you with the best suggestions (I'd skip most of it though, and simply just contact Microsoft Support for assistance given the boot problems); however, after reading your post a few times, I'm beginning to suspect your objective is not
 to actually try to clean up the system using MSE or anything else but rather to save your data (given that you can't boot and thus can't run Windows) so that you can then format and do a clean install or restore to factory conditions to almost certainly resolve
 the system and infection problems and then start over with a fresh and presumably clean system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that's the case, here's how I recommend you&nbsp;accomplish saving those files (but be careful what&nbsp;you save as you don't want to save the virus as well in the&nbsp;process).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One option is explained here: <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer/</a>.&nbsp; Do NOT do a full or even partially full backup as suggested in the article, but instead choose ONLY the specific files and folders you want
 to save and copy them ONLY.&nbsp; The article was mostly meant to recover from a dead PC and not an infected one - but the programs and basic steps will work as long as you're careful to avoid everything but the uninfected data files you need.&nbsp; You will need a
 place to store the saved data while considering that the CD/DVD drive will be in use.&nbsp; Then you can do the format and clean install or restore to factory conditions and all the steps that are involved in or need to follow that.&nbsp; If you need help with that,
 post back with your version of Windows as well as the manufacturer, make and model of your PC and I'll try to refer you to the proper sources for help and provide appropriate links.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>**********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're instead trying to do a less radical system repair or recovery of some sort and other than malware-detection and removal&nbsp;(and not what I suspected above), then you should repost starting here:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/system?page=1&amp;tab=all&amp;tm=1318133457591">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/system?page=1&amp;tab=all&amp;tm=1318133457591</a>&nbsp;except near the top where it says Windows Version, click on the dropmenu to select your version of Windows to end up in the forum appropriate for your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>***********************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to try to boot to a USB Drive or CD and bypass Windows to use a malware detection and removal tool to see if that helps (though I recommend contacting Microsoft Support as suggested by Le Boule instead), then while MSE doesn't do this, perhaps
 the following will help.&nbsp; This is almost all we have about it at this time, so if you have troubles or need support, there isn't any at this time and you'll just need to skip this option and go with Microsoft Support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe you're looking for Microsoft System Sweeper (beta). <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/systemsweeper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://connect.microsoft.com/systemsweeper</a>. It is NOT a part of MSE or related to MSE (though they probably use the same definitions database). Here's what little we know:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are system requirements: <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/systemsweeper/content/content.aspx?ContentID=24884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://connect.microsoft.com/systemsweeper/content/content.aspx?ContentID=24884</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There does not yet appear to be official support for this product even through Connect (other than the pages that follow if you didn't notice them and some others I found that may help) - in fact, I can't even find a way to report bugs or make suggestions
 for it (which seems unusual unless I've missed it somehow or only appears in a running program, but theoretically issues with beta products should be reported through Connect and I must be somehow missing the way to do so for this particular beta). We don't
 support it in this Forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the Help and FAQ section for Standalone Sweep Beta in Connect: <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/systemsweeper/content/content.aspx?ContentID=24894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://connect.microsoft.com/systemsweeper/content/content.aspx?ContentID=24894</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's another article on it that essentially provides little more, but there were some tidbits (like the fact that it would format your USB drive so you'd lose everything else on it and that the the USB drive can't be password-protected and it must be bootable
 among others): <a href="http://securitygarden.blogspot.com/2011/06/setting-up-microsoft-standalone-system.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://securitygarden.blogspot.com/2011/06/setting-up-microsoft-standalone-system.html</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although written for Windows 7, the following articles may still be of some help with your issues:<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/news/166407-microsoft-system-sweeper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/news/166407-microsoft-system-sweeper.html</a>
 and <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/166445-microsoft-standalone-system-sweeper.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/166445-microsoft-standalone-system-sweeper.html</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you create the bootable USB drive, if it says it did so successfully, it also provides a link to help in how to use it to run the program - which may send you to places other than those above which may help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, make sure your BIOS are configured to boot to a USB drive (not all systems can be configured to do this, though many and probably most can, but using a bootable CD/DVD - also set as such in BIOS - may be the only option).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this is what you wanted. Remember, if you try it and it doesn't work, there isn't any support at this time and we can't help you further here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Windows Phone is a multi-tasking OS, so you should be able to run multiple apps simultaneously on your device. Have you tried to restart your phone to see if that resolves your issue?</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2013 Reminders Hidden</h2>
                    <p>People have been complaining about this since Outlook 2010 at least, and it's still a problem. Is Microsoft ever going to give us an option to have the meeting reminders pop up in front of other windows? They say this is by design but I'm starting to think

            The point is, I shouldn't have to have a workaround. Enough people have requested this ability that Microsoft should fix their software.

<p>Honnestly, i find it completely crazy that such a stupid obvious point is not fixed by Microsoft team. When Outlook 2016 was delivered, there were a lot of&nbsp;very obvious problems back&nbsp; ==&gt; whatever version, the same situation occurs, as if there was not test,
 or worst, no verifications of the most reported problems in previous versions ... Instead of changing every 6 months things, they should at minimum test what they deliver.&nbsp;And i don't speak about crazy cases, just very obvious things that every user can see
 after the first days of use....</p>
<p>Another point, always requesting to recreate a brand new profile, is not a solution you can constantly propose surely for business people where the issue occurs for thousands of people.</p>
<p>There are points we reports for dozens of years and are always ignored, even if they are really frustrating people.
</p>
<p>Next to that, not every user is a developper, so a solution that request compiling is good for geeks, but not for the poor guys that use the programs, don't develop them.</p>
<p>I read a lot of articles about this as if the big Microsoft company was not able to pop up a simple window for something useful. We are in 2017, 21st century, but fondamentals that are useful for all are not yet an evidence and a priority. What a pitty.</p>

<br />
<br />Do you have an IT department/person that manages your Office 365? It sounds like they need to allow you to have access to OneDrive on your computer, as it is either A) not joined to the domain B) not marked as a supported device. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,

            When I used an ultramobile computer, I installed an application called "GoScreen" on it.&nbsp; When an application display was too large to display on the small ultramobile computer's screen, a scroll bar would appear that allowed me to scroll up and down (to
 the bottom of the application's screen).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
You might want to check out GoScreen to see if that will provide a workable solution to your issue.&nbsp;

                    <p>I would have added my comments to a post on the same topic, but, despite being logged in and having posted on Microsoft Community before on different topics, it won't let me click on Reply. It also won't let me follow any of the links to request features
 so I'm a bit stuck!</p>

</p><p>I too am struggling with the overlaid calendar default which seems to have occurred. I would have to switch back to the non O365 web version every time I wanted to organise a meeting as viewing cacophony of different colours all muddled together with no
 features to distinguish whose calendar they are from (it's bad enough just viewing one additional calendar, but viewing two or three would make the process of identifying space and seeing where different people are, literally impossible).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the spirit of accessibility for people with visual processing or other information processing issues, it doesn't seem very sensitive, supportive or intelligent of Microsoft to simply remove features without first finding out how much they are used and
 more importantly, <em>WHY</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there's a way to say 'view calendars side by side'?!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I need to add my voice to those requesting this feature, how can I do this when it won't let me in in order to post a comment?</p>

<p>It didn't 'start' as such, I just started using the OWA version when my organisation made it available to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I log in via my O365 account which I am able to log into perfectly well (that's how I'm in and replying to your message).</p>
<p>I am not using the application version - the URL looks like this for your info: https://outlook.office.com/owa/?realm= (then of course my organisation's details follow which of course I won't post)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure why you need a screenshot - it's not an 'issue', it's a feature which appears to have been withdrawn, from Outlook. You guys a MS must surely know if the feature is there, can be reinstated, or turned on/off?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already explained as much as I am able to about the logging in issue and provided you with the text that was displayed when I tried to follow the link from the other post on this same subject - as you can see, I can post on here, it was just trying
 to reply to the other post or follow the links in it which didn't work.</p>

<h2>            Onenote Ruler Bug &#40;sometimes does not recognize pen&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Dear MS-Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the problem, that the new ruler function in onenote ist sill a little buggy. Depending on the angle of the ruler, Onenote
<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1); text-decoration-line: underline">sometimes</span> won´t recognize the pen anymore and won´t draw a line. This happens only if the ruler is held in diagonal angles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Problem does <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOT</span> occur when:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The ruler is 90 degrees or 0 degrees.</li><li>The ruler is held with one finger only (which does not feel natural)<br />
</li><li>Other apps like Sketchpad or Ink which already had a ruler since forever never had and still do not have this issue.</li></ul>
<p>I hope you can address this problem and maybe fix it, as this problem does not exist with other apps featuring a ruler.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Will the ruler function also be available for the desktop Onenote in the future? That would make it perfect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Germany</p>

<p>Windows Defender does not scan email, so its not the cause. <br />
<br />
Is it trying to send 65 messages you can see in the outbox? If you can't see the messages, they could be read receipts.

re:&nbsp; never used a macro<br />
<br />
Andreas keeps pretty busy and trying to introduce someone to macros can be frustrating.<br />
I was in the act of creating some VBA code (macro) to copy and paste selections when I saw your post.<br />
<br />
Can you go to the Ribbon... </p>
<p>&nbsp; File | Options | Customize Ribbon... <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and on the right side choose "Main Tabs" from the dropdown (at the top) </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; and add the "Developer Tab" to the ribbon.<br />
<br />
If you can get the above done, post back and I'll have the code and instructions on what to do with it.<br />

re: more info<br />
<br />
At the left side of the Ribbon, after you have selected the Developer tab, is an Icon (button) labeled "Macros"<br />
When clicked it display a list of macros available in your workbook.&nbsp; It probably now displays a blank list.<br />
Give it a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, after using the "Find" utility in Excel, the result looks something like the following image.<br />
And the first item is usually selected.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/beddc3cd-e256-4af1-8c92-02e9d7f4d9cc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/beddc3cd-e256-4af1-8c92-02e9d7f4d9cc?upload=true" height="346" width="466" /></a><br />
The next step is to press the Ctrl button, tap the "A" key once and close the Find/Replace dialog (click the X).<br />
That should leave you with all of the items in the find list selected.&nbsp; Does that work for you?<br />
<br />
Next comes the code to copy and paste the multiple selections.<br />

<h2>            How do I hide  the Retention Policy notification in my message details&#63;</h2>
                    Good Morning,<br />
<br />
We've recently turned on our Retention Policy for Office 365 and have quite a few individiuals who wish to have the message disabled. Is this possible? The biggest complaint I've recieved is in Outlook 2010&nbsp;when the Reading Pane: Bottom view is selected the
 2nd subject line is replaced by the Retention Policy message.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Sean

            What happens if you select the mail and "Mark  as not junk" you might need to do this several times before it works, but it might not work. It seems to be a corrupted rule, that's why creating a new profile solved the problem. You could try to delete junk email rules by using MFCMAPI, but this is an advanced procedure, I think it is better the solution about creating a new profile. Anyway  If you decide to do it here is how:

<h2>            How do I scan QR codes on my Cortana-enabled Nokia Lumia 830&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I live in Malaysia. Before I enabled Cortana (I changed my phone region to the US), I was able to scan QR codes using Bing Vision. Now that Cortana is on, I can't seem to be able to do so. Is there a way to do it without downloading 3rd party apps? Thanks

            If it works the same as the 920, then you need to turn off location so that the Bing page comes up when you press the search button instead of Cortana. The vision icon will be there at the bottom. I've put location in the slide-down options to quickly
 turn it on or off if I need to scan a QR code. Hope this helps!

                    <p>I am new to Access.&nbsp; I have a database in Access where there 20 queries of the database that I have created, and I have to export all 20 of these queries into excel on a weekly basis.&nbsp; I have been doing this by right clicking the query, and exporting to
 excel for each of the 20 queries.&nbsp; My question is the following:&nbsp; Is there a way to export all of the queries at the same time?&nbsp; I am unsure about Macros or how I can set up anything to do this.&nbsp; Maybe there is some sort of thing I need to download to do this?&nbsp;
 Any help would be appreciated!</p>

<p>You could also add a calculated field to&nbsp;the query so as to sort by the criteria that set the 20 different queries apart.</p>

            To automate this you would need to create a macro to call the TransferSpreadsheet action 20 times, or write a VBA procedure which calls the TransferSpreadsheet method 20 times.&nbsp; For details of the macro action see:<br />

<h3> lwrogers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re-connect Outlook 2016&#47;2013 to Outlook.com after upgrade &#40;alias problem and &#34;from&#34; address nonsense&#41;</h2>
                    <p>After receiving an email this morning from the Outlook.com team notifying me that I needed to reconnect my Office 2016 Outlook client to my Outlook.com account I promptly followed the directions and everything reconnected just fine. However, I now have a
 problem. When I send an email the from address now shows up like&nbsp;outlook_123456789ABCDEFGH (at) outlook.com. I have tried more things to fix this&nbsp;than I'm willing to document here including registry hacks to rename folders and rename the accounts but nowhere
 can I figure out how to change the from address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only option when setting up a new account&nbsp;is to use the default Outlook autodiscover option which means&nbsp;you must use an outlook.com, live.com or Hotmail.com address to log in. I used to login with an alias (that I wanted to use as a from address and
 so I could sign my emails with an S/MIME cert) but now that's not an option. So, I enter in my (at)outlook.com account and after authenticating using an App Password (since I have two-step verification turned on which Outlook doesn't support) the username
 gets changed to something like outlook_123456789ABCDEFGH (at) outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I send emails this is what shows up as the from address and the reply address and I can't sign any of my emails with my S/MIME cert as I don't have one for the garbage address that Outlook now uses.</p>
<p>So my thinking was to do a manual server setup instead but the instructions referenced in:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Add-your-Outlook-com-account-in-Outlook-for-Windows-642c1902-bdd9-4dc3-abe7-76d60b148b23?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</p>
<p>
</p><p>say "in the Mail server box, type the name of your server" with instructions on how to get that name if you are an Outlook.com user:</p>
<p>
<strong>Tips:</strong>&nbsp;Need help finding the name of your mail server? If you have an Outlook.com account, for example, sign in, and then on the command bar, choose
<strong>Settings</strong> <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.content.office.net%2fen-us%2fmedia%2f22ecb306-849a-4d04-8885-fe49ec9df8ce.png" />&gt;
<strong>Options</strong>.
</p><p>Under <strong>Mail</strong>, choose <strong>Accounts</strong> &gt; <strong>POP and IMAP</strong>, and take note of the server name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that is listed there is IMAP and SMTP server address. The server address for Outlook.com Exchange is not listed. So, I looked at the Mail app on Windows 10 and it uses eas.outlook.com as the address. However when I use that server address the server
 type in Outlook is described at Exchange Active Sync rather that the autodiscover setup which is described as Microsoft Exchange and has&nbsp;a much different dialog of options for connecting the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the question is how do I fix this? This seems like a huge screw up for the Outlook.com team to have such useless outlook_123456789ABCDEFGH (at) outlook.com address that can't be changed. Is eas.outlook.com the same as using autodiscover or is eas.outlook.com
 the old server that Microsoft wants me to remove? If it is the same as using autodiscover why are the account options so different? This is a mess.</p>

            <p>I had the same issue. Even using an alias with a name @outlook.com.au did not work with autodiscover in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One solution is to manually configure the server name as eas.outlook.com. That worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also added another alias with @outlook.com and autodiscover worked with that. The server name it configured with autodiscover was outlook.office365.com. That address also seems to work for me as an Exchange ActiveSync server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still having severe problems on multiple machines where mail synch does not work correctly. I had been having issues for a while with changes not being synched back to Outlook.com from Outlook. I set up a new profile as instructed in the e-mail, and
 Outlook correctly downloads the contents of my mailbox. However, anything I do in Outlook (reading and deleting messages) is not pushed back to Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a major issue for me. I end up having to re-process my inbox separately on each device, just like in the bad old days of POP servers. This is also affecting other members of my family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did an online chat with a Microsoft support person who just told me that it was a known issue and being worked on. However, no timeframe for a fix, and no good way of monitoring progress on a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like having the capabilities of Outlook, but at the moment the built-in Windows 10 Mail app&nbsp;seems to be&nbsp;the only reliable client for Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am one extremely unhappy customer!</p>

            <p>By spending a good part of a day deleting and re-creating Outlook profiles, I have got it to the point where it seems to be working on two PCs. I can delete a message on one, and it disappears in the Outlook.com web mail view and in Outlook on the other
 PC with only a short delay. However, I am by no means confident that the problem is really resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In both cases where it is working, I configured Outlook to use the @outlook.com.au e-mail address and user name rather than my normal e-mail address in a custom domain. This means you get the "sent on behalf of" header in e-mails you send, and presumably
 the S/MIME issue the original poster had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing that may have helped it to work was to not attempt to do anything in Outlook until it had fully synched down the mailbox contents, including all folders.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am truly amazed at these issues. Outlook has been the premier client application for Exchange for literally decades, and there must be 100s of millions of mailboxes in use. Who would have thought migrating Outlook.com to an Exchange server platform would
 cause problems with Outlook on the desktop?</p>

Known issues after connecting Outlook 2016 or Outlook 2013 to Outlook.com
<p>If you are having issues after reconnecting your Outlook.com account, please see the following links for known issues and workarounds:</p>
<div>Outlook.com email account appears as "outlook_[long series of letters and numbers]@outlook.com" in Outlook for Windows</div>
<div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ISSUE</strong> </p>
<p>After connecting to Outlook for Windows (Outlook 2016, 2013, 2010 versions) to your Outlook.com email account, your may experience the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your email account name shows up as <em>outlook_[long series of letters and numbers]@outlook.com</em> in the Folder Pane and when composing emails using Outlook for Windows.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Recipients will also receive the email from the sender with the <em>outlook_[long series of letters and numbers]@outlook.com</em> format.</p>
</li><li>
<p>When recipients reply to the email, the email bounces and you may receive the message “Undeliverable message when you send Internet mail in Outlook.”</p>
</li></ul>
<p>This issue only impacts customers using Outlook for Windows. Emails sent via Outlook.com on the web works correctly and emails will be sent with the correct email address.</p>
<p><strong>WORKAROUND</strong> </p>
<p>This issue occurs for users with multiple account aliases. We are actively working on a fix. In the meantime, to fix this issue, please do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go to <a href="https://account.live.com/names/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>
<p>Set your Outlook.com email as the primary alias.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Remove any old non-Microsoft account listed as primary alias that you are not using.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In Outlook for Windows, remove and re-add the account. See the steps in this article:

            <p>Thanks lwrogers, yes I have seen that. That information was added to that page after my previous post. Fortunately, I haven't had the issue they mention of mail bouncing when people reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see that they are working on these issues. For example, autodiscover of the server now works if you use an @outlook.com.au e-mail address. However, I suspect the issue with the strange e-mail address is a fairly deep architectural one with Exchange
 that will not be easy to fix, so I'm not holding my breath. Obviously, people using primary e-mail addresses from non-Microsoft domains was not a high priority in their design and testing for the migration from the old Hotmail e-mail system to Office 365.</p>

            <p>This work around does not solve my problem. &nbsp;My goal is to use Outlook 2016 for windows to work with emails that are forwarded to an outlook.com address that has the alias of my work email (POP3). When the outlook.com address is set to the primary alias,
 the from address when I use Outlook for windows will be the outlook.com address. &nbsp;I need the from address to appear as my alias.</p>

            Yup, this workaround no longer works. This is a known bug. I have spent hours debugging this with the Outlook.com team and they have basically given up and said "this is as designed." The fix, they say, is to not use an alias. So the upgraded Outlook.com
 infrastructure is a massive downgrade. +1 for Microsoft.

            Over the past month I have spent hours on the phone, and with them remoting into my machine. The "level 3" tech I was working with was actually very good about calling back when he said he would. In the end, it was cataloged as a known bug that they are
 actively working on. It sounds like the soonest a fix could be expected is April and that it will happen automatically or through a regular Tuesday update. Sucks. I've completely switched over to using the "App" on Windows 10 and a web browser on Windows 7.
 I miss Outlook 2016.

</p><p>Another angry customer with the "alias reply to blocked" issue here. One of the reasons I upgraded to Office 365 earlier this year was to get Outlook, because the Win 10 Mail app doesn't word wrap, which is a pain. Outlook worked fine with my alias via EAS
 until they forced me to 'reconnect' Outlook to Outlook.com. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using this alias e-mail to point to Hotmail/Outlook.com for many years, and it still functions perfectly well as my MS account login, while at the moment their flagship e-mail app won't work with their own web e-mail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only found out I was sending e-mails clients couldn't reply to when one of them phoned me to say they were having a problem. This is obviously a major issue for me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's forced me back to using Win 10 Mail until they sort it out. Absurdly, their free app works fine while the app I pay for, Outlook 2016, is broken with their own web e-mail service. Pathetic.

            <p>Hi ramkumar007, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Community. I understand you're having some issues updating due to the 8018119B error code you receive. There are a couple of pages available for update issues that I can provide for you.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The support article at <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2484484" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2484484</a>&nbsp;contains the most common error codes received. While yours is not listed it does seem to be very similar to one that is, there is also some
 information about what can be done if the error code isn't listed. I'll post that portion for you below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Error not listed here or phone still not working.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you receive an error that is not listed here, visit<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=226241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">our forums at Microsoft Community</a><span><span>&nbsp;</span>for
 more information.</span><br />
<br />
<span>If your Windows Phone still does not respond,&nbsp;try the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Restart your phone, reconnect it to your computer&nbsp;by using the USB cable that was included with the phone,&nbsp;and then&nbsp;try to update your phone again. When you connect your phone to your computer, make sure
 that you do not use a USB hub.</li><li>Try a restart, reset and restore, or roll back of your Windows Phone 7 might help. See the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article to learn more:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2606900" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">2606900</a>&nbsp;Your Windows Phone 7 doesn't work or respond as expected</li></ul>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is also possible that the update may need to be completed on a different computer if you have access to one.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    Why is it that Microsoft is so distant from its customers that it doesn't offer free help to its customers for technical issues with their products.<br />
I feel like I'm being blackmailed by the company to pay someone to help me with a product that periodically malfunctions. (Skype in particular)<br />
One day it works and then the next it doesn't.<br />
Anyone have any tips on how to circumvent Microsoft for a better program than skype to do business?
