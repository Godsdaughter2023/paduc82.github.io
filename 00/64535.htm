<h2>            Devices and Printers blank</h2>
                    <p>Original title:</p>
<p>Tried Andre's advice, still having problems</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a custrom built desktop with AMD 4 core, 3.6 GHz CPU, 16GB RAM, 250GB H/D and Windows 7 Ultimate. &nbsp; &nbsp;Devices and Printers in Control Panel did at one time show all my printers, etc. and allowed me to change settings for them. &nbsp; Now, I get the Devices
 and Printers page, but it is completely blank, even the green loading bar no longer shows. &nbsp; &nbsp;I have tried all the suggestions including repair/recovering O/S, to no avail, &nbsp; &nbsp;I am not a tech but not entirely a newbie either, but I am baffled and I need help,
 if there is someone out there who has had the same problem. &nbsp; &nbsp;I am willing to do just about anything to regain this function.
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            Sorry to have taken so long to get back to you, have been out sick (when you get old, you'll understand)
<div><br />
<div>I am using the Windows 7 Ultimate install disk and for several months after the initial install, I would find Control Panel, Devices &amp; Printers populated with the proper icons, etc. representing the physical printers I am using, along with Microsoft XPS
 Document Writer and Fax. &nbsp; Now, and for a couple of months, all I see is a blank page. &nbsp; &nbsp;No matter what I do, re-installing printer, enabling/disabling Blue Tooth, even re-installing the complete o/s and subsequent re-install of backup files... I still get
 the blank page. &nbsp; &nbsp;Using Administrative Tools, Print Management; I can see all the installed and virtual devices and they work. &nbsp; But, I cannot permanently set preferences such as "fast draft" to conserve ink (I can set everything manually for each item I
 want to print, but what a hassle.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have a custom build desktop compter with ASRock &nbsp;N68C-GS FX m/b, AMD 4100 CPU running at 4.2GHz, 16GB DDR3 PC 12800, 250 GB h/d. &nbsp; For the life of me, I cannot figure this one out and I've looked at forums and more all to no avail. &nbsp; Even the suggestions
 you have given don't do the trick.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any more ideas?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

There are several volunteers here over 70 - so you probably shouldn't just throw that around without knowing the age of the person you are talking to. heh<br />

            I guess that says a lot for those who can "stick it out", huh? &nbsp; &nbsp;It's just that getting up and about ain't as easy as it once was and many times I have wished that the PC could have been around during my childhood... growning up with something makes learning
 it so much easier.
<div><br />
<div>Seriiously, though, I remembered another symptom that might help in finding a solution. &nbsp; The BIOS for the M/B reports the RAM as DDR3 &nbsp;(PC3 10700) when in fact, I have PC 12800. &nbsp; Oh, yes, when I attempt to use the icon in "hidden icons" on the taskbar
 to eject USB drives, etc.; a small message flag pops up Saying "Open Devices &amp; Printers"... weird.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>In reference to Anannya's question about reinstalling O/S; yes, I have completely reinstalled Windows 7 and the same problems are right back again and one would not expect the install disk to change, I say "change" because the initial installation went
 perfectly well and the various sectors I'm having trouble with now, were working fine. &nbsp; &nbsp;Could some sort of "infection" have been imposed upon the hard drive and thus onto one of the files in my "back-up" files thereby causing the same problem to come right
 back after a reinstall?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm about to the point of tossing the whole thing and getting another; except for the cost (lol) &nbsp; Please, if you have suggestions, I'm open to almost any and all.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks so much to all who have taken the time to attempt to help.</div>

<div>Print spooler was started, checked the other items anyway, look to be fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Opened folder options, view and have included a screenshot of the boxes after unchecking etc. &nbsp;I can always go back, I guess and undo if necessary. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I accessed Windows Explorer, selecting C:\window\ system32\spool\printers &nbsp;I found two folders: FP00000.SHD &nbsp; date mod 10/16/2013 &nbsp;type SHD File 4KB and FPppppp.SPL &nbsp; date mod 10/16/2013 &nbsp;type SPL File 118KB &nbsp; I tried but cannot delete either of these.
 &nbsp; From what I see, I've still got the problem of Control Panel, Devices and Printers not loading. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The screenshot of Control panel shows it trying to load Devices and Printers (you'll notice the address bar shows a darker shading from the left hand of the address bar, it will eventually reach all the way across, but never show anything.</div>
<div><br />
<div>here are the links for all the info requeated plus the screenshots:</div>

            I'm going to jump in here with my 2¢ worth and then leave you in Gerry's hands.&nbsp; He's far better than me at deciphering system event logs.<br />
<br />
<b>Almost</b> always, the Devices and Printers window is empty because the Print Spooler isn't running.&nbsp; You seem to have discovered a mode where that window is blank but the Spooler is running.&nbsp; I just checked on a Windows 7 Pro x64 system, and if the Spooler
 is stopped, not only is the Devices and Printers window blank, but so is the "Print Management" screen in Administrative Tools.&nbsp; Thus, it's quite odd that one of those two windows is populated for you but not the other.<br />
<br />
For what it's worth, the most likely reason that you are unable to delete FP00000.SHD and FPppppp.SPL is because the Spooler is running.&nbsp; If you stop the Spooler (using, e.g., the Services applet), you should be able to delete those files.&nbsp; This is typically
 the first step in fixing printer-related problems.<br />
<br />
Again, <b>almost </b>always, Print Spooler problems can be fixed using one or the other of the Microsoft FixIt routines here --&gt;
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2793718/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2793718/en-us</a>&nbsp; The "full mode" FixIt has been described as restoring the printing subsystem to the way it is in a new installation of Windows -- but you say that your
 problem persists even when you do a new installation of Windows.&nbsp; Most peculiar.<br />
<br />
Because you mentioned your "back-up files" in connection with your reinstall, you might want to clarify:&nbsp; Did you install a printer immediately after reinstalling Windows from the original CD (that is, before you used your back-files)?&nbsp; And if so, was the Devices
 and Printers blank or did it become blank only after you restored your back up files?<br />
<br />
P.S.&nbsp; I have no idea why Anannya -- or you -- has been messing around with Bluetooth.&nbsp; That shouldn't have anything to do with this situation unless perhaps your printers are connected via Bluetooth (a fact that would have been worth mentioning in the beginning).<br />

    <title>Strict NAT limitations&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kestrel237  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strict NAT limitations&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I've been playing with a Strict NAT for most of my time on Xbox Live. I manually port-forwarded the Open (or sometimes Moderate) connection to a sibling's console so they can play better, so this Strict NAT is something I have to deal with in our
 household (it's unusual, but it seems to work lol). So only one console in the house can have the Open/Moderate connection at a time. On the 360, it was easy to work around and it barely affected my experience online.</p>
<p>However, I'm encountering a ton of issues with my Xbox Live service on the Xbox One specifically, and I was wondering if these are caused by a Strict NAT? (I'd also like to mention that the signal reaching my console is strong and fairly stable most of the
 time):</p>
<p><br />
- Friends list is "Unavailable" 3/4 of the time, or my friends all show up as Offline in the Friends List menu (even when it says some are online on the dashboard). Interacting with them is difficult when this happens.</p>
<p>- Achievements are "Unavailable" 3/4 of the time.</p>
<p>- I have to reset my console 1-5 times, or unplug my mic at least 3-8 times to hear anyone when I join a party (the host's NAT doesn't seem to make a difference for me).</p>
<p>- 3/4 of the time when I accept game or party invites, the console will not even attempt to load them, so nothing happens. This happens when accepting invites via both the controller and the Dashboard.</p>
<p>- Joining multiplayer lobbies is difficult with my friends, even when I can connect to them fine in parties on both the 360 and the One; I can also join their multiplayer lobbies on the 360 with no problems.</p>
<p>- The Xbox One will tell me I lost my internet connection, when I'm still in parties talking to people. It will also tell me I'm offline and online at the same time in different menus.</p>
<p>There's more... but these are probably the most reoccurring problems. I have to fight for sometimes up to 30 minutes even just to speak with my friends on the Xbox One console.... when it'll take me 30 seconds on the 360. So are these problems with having
 a Strict NAT? Or is my Xbox One just broken? .__. I don't think it's fair that my Xbox Live service should deteriorate THAT much from having a Strict NAT, especially when we pay $60 a year for it, not to mention when we spend on the consoles themselves.</p>
<p>I've already tried reading through the Support pages, but I'm still not sure, since there's so many different types of problems. I know that having the Strict NAT means more connectivity issues and I read a bit about it already, but yes. I'm having none
 of these problems on my 360 and I can connect to peoples' parties and games a lot easier there than on the new system.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, any help or explanations are appreciated. :)</p>

            <p>Alright, so it looks like your router does not support multiple Xbox consoles on the same network. It looks like the router is prioritizing the ports to the Xbox 360 console, which explains the NAT issue you are having with your Xbox One console. You can refer to our&nbsp;Linksys WRT160N&nbsp;post for more information on your router. Once thing you definitely can try is&nbsp;enabling UPnP&nbsp;on your router, but I cannot guarantee that will work.</p>
<p>Best solution is to replace your current router with one that can support multiple consoles. I suggest browsing our list of&nbsp;Routers&nbsp;we have tested for ideas! :)</p>
<p>I know this isn't an ideal answer, but I hope it helps!</p>

<h2>            Windows Update stuck at either checking for updates or downloading updates.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Acer V5-122P won't update windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought an Acer V5-122 and it came with windows 8. I am attempting to update to Windows 8.1 however it keeps telling me i need to do the windows updates before I can do this. Everytime I try to do the windows update it either gets stuck on 'checking
 for updates' or if it gets through tells me there are 99 updates and stays stuck on 'downloading updates' once I start the install but doesn't ever move. I have ran the troubleshooters i have found on a similar question here and everything seems to be fine.
 Internet and everything else it running fine. Any help would be appreciated!<br />

 it is going to do something, then the screen image disappears for a second and reappears as if it is refreshing then nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I opened Command Prompt as an user I thought I could try and go back to c: and then approach it from that direction but I cannot remember the commands to move through directories as its been years since I last used them.

</p><p>Following some more research I've managed to run the System File Checker under Command Prompt as an administrator using the Windows key + X option. This did not find any integrity violations. File Explorer still refuses to open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having run the windows update the other evening it did once allow me to open File Explorer and then promptly went back to normal. &nbsp;Therefore I've sorted out 1 problem with my Kaspersky anti virus but cannot access any of my files. Any further thoughts please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Jan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, have not found a solution as yet. Did not manage to get sfc scannow to run. Have also found that Control Panel will not open which was difficult as I started looking at the software I've got loaded in case there was some old software which was causing
 a conflict. However this has not worked either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully Microsoft will pull their corporate finger out shortly and come up with a fix as this seems to be a large problem worldwide. Generally Windows 10 is quite good, but its worrying if some of the basic windows programmes will not run.</p>

<h2>            Windows Vista Ultimate Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I have been running Vista Ultimate for years without any problems but guess it is time to upgrade! After backing up my e mail etc on an external drive, I'd like to do a clean install of Windows 7 or better (have 8GB RAM and 3 clock speed so can accommodate).</p>
<p>Can MS help with this or do I have to purchase another windows package?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With end of support Microsoft is not telling you that your operating systems won't work.</p>
<p>What they are saying is that after a certain date they will no longer support them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether they still work or not with particular programs&nbsp;is up to the particular program manufacturers.</p>
<p>Example: Google Chrome is no longer supported for security updates in XP or Vista by Google.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What this basically means with Microsoft no longer supporting&nbsp;an operating system&nbsp;is that even though hackers may find "holes" and vulnerabilities to be able to access the operating systems and cause security problems, Microsoft will no longer be&nbsp;monitoring
 or rectifying those problems by way of Security Updates each month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are on your own in regards to maintaining the Security of your operating systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will show you when support (Mainstream and Extended Support) for the various operating systems ends.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It depends on the hardware requirements of later operating systems and also&nbsp;whether the computer/laptop manufacturer supports and supplies drivers for the later operating systems as to whether it is possible or feasible to upgrade or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>There is no free upgrade from Vista to 7, 8.1 or 10.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps before you buy Windows 7.</p>
<p>Microsoft no longer sells 7; try amazon.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to your Computer / Laptop&nbsp;Manufacturer's website and see if Windows 7 Drivers are available for your Make and Model Computer / Laptop.

</p><p>I already know I can still use Vista but unsupported etc. The reason we have to upgrade though is because many programs no longer allow you to use the older software - Netfile for example. Plus starting to get issues with browsers like chrome with the older

    <title>Windows 10 fresh install, revoke &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kayanow2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 fresh install, revoke &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, because windows 10 has been problematic for a while now I have decided to do a fresh install this weekend. Last time I did this (a couple of years ago) I was advised to revoke my key, do the fresh install and then re enter key and I was given a command
 line to revoke the key via Admin command prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;My Windows 10 is a free upgrade from 8.0/8.1 online activated and last time I did this was because I installed a new "C" drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Should I go through the revocation of my key again or is that not necessary because no change in hardware this time.</p>
<p>Also where can I download the latest iso for standard windows 10 Home and what was the command line for key revocation.
</p>
<p>nb - I want to do a complete fresh install so I want to format the drive for a complete fresh start.</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Install Opera, go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps to set Opera as default in the dropdown menu.  
<br />
<br />Then ignore Edge, although it's helpful to have multiple browsers in your toolbox to use the one which works best for each task.  I use Firefox, Edge and Chrome about equally with Firefox as my default.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            MS has repeated their reply to the "Netscape war" a couple of decades ago. They have baked Edge in to Windows as tightly as they can.  So far I have not seen any way to completely nuke Edge.  I use the same strategy as Greg. I just ignore it (and cuss every time they waste my time and space in FireFox suggesting I try it, can anyone say malware ...)

            Edge is the part of the OS and cannot be uninstalled. I suggest you to unpin it from the desktop and forget it.
<br />Uninstalling using scripts would only create problems

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Believe me i did everything in my power to keep from trashing edge and waited and loaded April upgrade hearing there were Edge improvement with that update. They even
 removed the productive fictional “status bar” that was amazing simple task monitor of sorts. and with it the IE11 status bar and with it the on screen zoom percent setting. Now as usual one click turns into two three and four click how they actually believe
 this productive is MS neo demented development. Just like the ribbon for dummies removing the classic toolbars and menus the mas simple function into multi click messes totally unproductive. Edge is going totally backwards. It regression at its best. IE11
 was extremely productive and functional the only problem was MS stopped upgrading the core engine and dumped it for horrible Edge. The horrible handling of pdf files you have to ask yourself WHY??? Just leave pdf files alone or to free Adobe reader that works
 perfectly. We didn’t want or need MS to mess with PDFs EVER you simply do not know what your doing. Favorites storage cannot be found or used anywhere else bit in edge. You can not even copy or cut and paste a saved favorite and move it to wherever you wish
 any longer. Who does that insanity? The best search engine and search web UI tool ever devised the Google package of Google search and Google toolbar was the most productive hardest working web tools ever devised. IE11 was a great browser as simple productive
 browsers go and only needed a speed up tweaking. Edge is a total screw up and after anticipation of the April upgrade Microsoft might as well gone fishing because nothing changed and certainly didn’t improve. The typical neo Microsoft ((FAT &amp; HAPPY)) Please
 bring back the Gates team. </span></p>

<h2>            HP Touchsmart TX2 1270US Reinstalling Windows 7</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an HP Touchsmart Tx2 1270US. I upgraded it from Vista about six months ago. Somewhat recently, my laptop started to act up. Now, It freezes at login (Right before my password screen)
 I have to force shut down. It freezes explorer (Preventing me from launching anything), and has slowed down significantly. I would like to do a Clean Install and reinstall all of my software from HP's site. The two questions I have are,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;Can I reinstall Windows 7 with my upgrade disk? I really don't want to have to revert to Vista (Wait For hours while bloatware, and drivers are installed), and then go re-upgrade to Win 7.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The other question I had is about the auto rotate (Which is a hit-and-miss as it is). The screen will automatically rotate to Reversed Landscape when I convert it to a tablet. Does anyone know where the driver or file to do this is? I didn't see it on
 HP's support site.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, I did not make a system image because of space (Or lack thereof) on my external hard drive (Excuses, excuses).... So I can't just restore.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>P.S. I found all of the other drivers and files I think I need on HP's support site (I hope :O).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />

<p>Clean Install Windows 7 With Upgrade Media and Product Key on Formatted or Empty Blank Hard Drive<br />
<a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/10/27/clean-install-windows-7-with-upgrade-media-and-product-key-on-formatted-or-empty-blank-hard-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/10/27/clean-install-windows-7-with-upgrade-media-and-product-key-on-formatted-or-empty-blank-hard-drive/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please read the following:<br />
The upgrade will check that (Windows XP or Vista) is installed. <br />
However the Windows 7 End User License Agreement does specifically state that, therefore as long as you have a valid COA<br />
and product key for the computer you wish to upgrade you can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if your computer came with a previous qualifying license (Vista or Windows XP). Note: The Certificate of Authencity (COA) must be attached to the computer and readable, then the COA is reason enough for representing compliance to the software license
 agreement. No actual installation of previous software necessary, which means you can do a clean install with Windows 7 Upgrade disk</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------- License -------------------------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade.<br />
Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from.<br />
After you upgrade, you may no longer use the software you upgraded from."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>16.PROOF OF LICENSE.<br />
a.Genuine Proof of License. If you acquired the software on a disc or other media, your proof of license is the genuine Microsoft certificate of authenticity label with the accompanying genuine product key, and your proof of purchase. If you purchased and downloaded
 the software online, your proof of license is the genuine Microsoft product key for the software which you received with your purchase, and your proof of purchase from an authorized electronic supplier of genuine Microsoft software. Proof of purchase may be
 subject to verification by your merchant’s records.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>------------------------------- Phone Activation is required&nbsp; ------------------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to activate Windows 7 or Vista manually (activate by phone)<br />
1) Click Start, and in the Search box type:&nbsp;&nbsp; slui.exe&nbsp; 4<br />
2) Next press the 'ENTER' key<br />
3) Select your 'Country' from the list.<br />
4) Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.<br />
5) Stay on the phone <strong>(do not select/press any options)</strong> and wait for a person to help you with activation.<br />
6) <strong>Explain your problem clearly to the support person.<br />
</strong>7) The support person should give you a confirmation ID, copy it down on paper,
<br />
8) Verify the ID is correct by reading back to the support person.<br />
9) Enter the ID number and click 'Next' to finish the activation process.</p>

            <p>To avoid having to do phone activation, it would be best you really reinstall Windows Vista, then do the upgrade again. If you don't want to...</p>
<p>If your computer came with a previous qualifying license such as Windows Vista or Windows XP and the Certificate of Authencity is still attached to the machine in good condition, then the COA is reason enough for representing compliance to the software license
 agreement. No actual installation of previous software necessary, which means you can do a clean install with Windows 7 Upgrade disk.</p>
<p>How to do a clean install with the upgrade disk:</p>
<p>Boot from the Windows 7 DVD</p>
<p>Click Install Now</p>
<p>Accept License Agreement</p>
<p>When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>Click Drive Options</p>
<p>Select the drive/s click Delete</p>
<p>Click New</p>
<p>Click Apply</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>Click Format and click Next to proceed with the installation</p>
<p>Skip entering your Windows 7 product key and complete the installation.</p>
<p>Once you reach the desktop, click Start, right click Computer</p>
<p>Click Properties</p>
<p>Scroll down to Windows Activation</p>
<p>Click the link x days until activation.</p>
<p>Click the link that says 'Show me other ways to activate'</p>
<p>Enter product key</p>
<p>Click Next</p>
<p>Select Phone Activation</p>
<p>Click Next when Enter your key page displayed</p>
<p>Select your country</p>
<p>Click Next, call the number listed</p>
<p>Remember to explain to the call agent your situation.</p>
<p>Provide the generated installation ID when requested by the call agent</p>
<p>They will give you a confirmation ID in return, enter it</p>
<p>Click Next to complete the activation. </p>
<p>The requirements for upgrade media though is that you have a previously qualifying operating system such as Windows XP or Vista installed to use it. From the Windows 7 End User License Agreement.</p>
<p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from.</p>
<p>So, if you are still denied, you will have to simply reinstall Windows XP or Vista and let it do the eligibility check.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t boot from recovery disk - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c131dave  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t boot from recovery disk</h2>
                    <p>I have two drives connected to my computer, one a regular 1TB hard drive, and a 512mb SSd.&nbsp; I installed Windows 10 on both drives, but i much prefer to boot from the SSD because it is much faster.&nbsp; A couple days ago I got the blue screen during boot, and
 said my ACPI.sys file was missing or corrupt.&nbsp; So I booted with the hard drive, copied the ACPI.sys file from the HD to the SSD, and then rebooted with the SSD.&nbsp; Now when it boots I get the blue screen with the Stop Code:&nbsp; Process1 Initialization Failed.&nbsp;
 &nbsp;I deleted the cache file, but am still getting the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my next step was to create a recovery disk using the Microsoft tool.&nbsp; It burned to a DVD rom disk, but when I try to boot from that disk, it won't boot.&nbsp; What should I do now?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            Hi c131dave, the acpi driver from your hard drive will never be suitable for the driver on the SSD . . .
<br />
<br />OK, 
<br />Remove the HHD and just leave the SSD connected
<br />
<br />Insert the Bootable Media
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS, go into your BIOS and make the following changes:
<br />
<br />1.	Disable Secure Boot
<br />2.	Enable Legacy Boot
<br />3.	If Available enable CSM
<br />4.	If Required enable USB Boot
<br />5.	Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order
<br />6.	Save BIOS changes and restart your System       
        </p>

            Hi Dave.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />To repair the SSD boot unplug the hard drive and set the SSD first hard drive to boot in a Legacy BIOS, or keep Windows Boot Manager set first to boot if UEFI.
<br />
<br />I would create the bootable media flash stick from Media Creation Tool:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br /> 
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup   to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />In advanced Troubleshoot Options run a Startup Repair, System Restore, or go back to Troubleshoot Options to do a Reset saving Files if necessary - if not I'd do the Cleaner option.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want the best possible install do the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Once it's up and running, plug back in the hard drive making sure to keep the SSD set first to boot if it's Legacy BIOS.  
<br />
<br />What I'd do then is temporarily move the data off the drive if possible and wipe it with Diskpart Clean Command to remove any boot or partitiion code that could interfere:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/52129-disk-clean-clean-all-diskpart-command.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/52129-disk...</a>
<br />
<br />Then repartition in Disk management as a data drive:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/248980/how-to-partition-and-format-your-hard-drive-in-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/248980/how-to-p...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

&nbsp;Hi there, </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
The first thing you should do is make sure that the WD Elements HDD is still working properly on a different system. If it does than the problem is likely to be related to the USB host controller driver.
</p>
<p>
You should also try connecting it to a USB 2.0 port if you have one. You can also look for the latest available drive on the motherboard manufacturer web page. Hope that helps. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>
&nbsp;Download and run the WD diagnostics utility. Run only the Quick test first. You can download it here:
<a href="http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=fQPF2E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=fQPF2E</a> . If the HDD is having problems this test should pick them up. Another important thing is the USB cable. If there is a problem with the USB cable
 the HDD might not be able to work properly, especially if it's a portable HDD. Please try using a different short USB 3.0 cable. Keep me posted.

<h2>            After pausing and unpausuing web browser video &#40;such as youtube, or news feeds&#41;, sound level output raises significantly but volume bar does not move</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This question has been asked on a few other threads, and you have NOT provided any kind of willingness to work with the customer! &nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue has been happening since the Fall Creator's Update (at least it seems that way for me)!&nbsp; Just as stated in previous threads about this very issue.&nbsp; Listen to the damn customers!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have ANY WEB BROWSER OPEN IN WINDOWS 10, and you are playing a web video, like YouTube, and you pause the video and unpause the video, the sound output volume raises significantly.&nbsp; This also happens when going from video to video, back to back,
 or clicking a new video. &nbsp; I have noticed that if you pause for more than a second it seems to raise.&nbsp; However, pausing and unpausing in rapid fire doesn't seem to trigger the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example: Say the browser video player's volume is at 10%, and Windows playback volume is at 25%; when the video is paused, and is unpaused, or, the video moves onto a new video, or you click a new video, the sound level output sounds like it would as
 if the WINDOWS sound volume was at 50%.&nbsp; HOWEVER, neither the browser's video player sound level or Windows sound level bar physically changes.&nbsp; After noticing a spike in volume, if you move the windows volume bar one notch in either direction, the sound AUTOMATICALLY
 reverts back to the level output it was originally at, making it seem that there is some kind of synchronization issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried updating the Realtek drivers to the most current version with no luck.&nbsp; I have tried changing different settings in the playback with no luck!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help with this issue!&nbsp; It's really annoying to see you ignore this issue on other threads.&nbsp; Do NOT reply and ask if I can run a virus scan or a malware scan!&nbsp; I do not have malware or a virus infection.&nbsp; Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Hello Erold,<br />
<br />
<br />
Just to verify, have you tried the troubleshooting steps on the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support article</a> that the previous Forum Moderator provided? If that doesn't work, you can try reverting to the previous build and see if you're still getting the same issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.

<p>In the last portion of that guide, under Try different audio formats, <span>I do not have an ADVANCED tab.&nbsp; I also tried the troubleshooter and it tells me that I have a generic driver installed.
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows is reporting I am using a Realtek driver.&nbsp; I am using the latest driver that I downloaded from its website.&nbsp; The driver I have installed is digitally signed. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your solution is for the customer to revert to a previous build, that's not satisfactory.&nbsp; If that testing process yielded a success in diagnosing the issue, it would indicate a fault in a previous build, correct?&nbsp; If so, this would also indicate
 a fault in Microsoft's testing process, which I've mentioned is an ongoing problem at Microsoft in the last few years. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per your suggestion; </span><span>I will not accept reverting to a previous build as a troubleshooting measure.&nbsp; I will however work with a qualified support technician, run tools and submit logs to look at.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Look,<strong> I am not the only customer experiencing this issue.</strong>&nbsp; You can search around on your own forums, and the internet, and find that there are many other customers with this issue.&nbsp; Like many of the other issues customers bring to
 this forum, they are swept under the rug when customer after customer echoes the issue and a moderator is no where to be found afterwards.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>This is an issue where every forum post I've read points to steaming video from
<em><strong>any </strong></em>web browser.&nbsp; It is not necessarily apparent with local applications, such as VLC player.&nbsp; Although one post referred to it but I believe that is an extreme case.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a list of forum posts on your forum, and other forums, since 2015 pointing to this issue.&nbsp; Please provide a qualified technician to work with!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for providing additional information about your concern. We would like to verify, d<span>o you have another user account on your PC? I</span><span>f you only have one user account on your PC, you can try creating another local user or administrator
 account to check if the same issue persists. In this way, we can identify if the issue has something to do with a corrupted user profile.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For more information on how to create a local user or administrator account in Windows 10, kindly check this<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest that you perform a clean boot. It will start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs that can eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the article<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>"<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform a clean boot in Windows"</a></strong>, you will learn the step-by-step process

<h2>            How do I use the pen as the mouse on online games&#63;</h2>
                    I'm currently using the Surface book 2. There are games online where you can draw such as skribbl.io but the only problem right now would be that I can't draw on those. I'm guessing it's because the pen doesn't click when you're using the tip of the pen.
 The pen works for drawing apps and screen sketch.&nbsp;

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>The issue is resolved. I had clean install windows to resolve it. May be some files were corrupt which even DISM &nbsp;cannot repair. The error code started to pop up in desktop apps too. Like Intel driver update utility. To give more background :</p>
<p>1. Windows Spotlight wasn't working.</p>
<p>2. Even mail apps weren't syncing in background.</p>
<p>3. Cortana couldn't set reminders</p>
<p>4. Wallpapers were not syncing</p>
<p>5. Cortana wasn't mirroring notifications&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks everyone &nbsp;for all your inputs.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Print to PDF Missing &#38; Cant reinstall</h2>
                    <p>
<strong>Issue</strong>: Microsoft Print to PDF Missing and I can't get it reinstalled.</p>
<p>
<strong>Methods I've Tried but have FAILED!</strong><strong>:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I've already ran the printer troubleshooter to try to reinstall it, did not reinstall.&nbsp;</li><li>I've tried to run Windows Updates - nothing</li><li>Tried reinstalling it manually using an existing port; however,&nbsp; when I get to "Select Drivers," Microsoft Print to PDF is not an option. Nothing comes up when I run check windows updates for the driver.</li><li>I've checked under Windows Features to see its been turned off, and IT DOES NOT APPEAR.</li><li>I had to resort to calling Microsoft Tech support and the person who answered did not know what Microsoft Print to PDF was and suggested I call the manufacturer of the Printer.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
<strong>What I need done:&nbsp; I&nbsp;</strong>also have Adobe print to PDF; however, I've noticed that when trying to print to PDF from Microsoft Project Professional, the headers/footers get cut off. I have to resort to emailing it to coworker to convert to PDF using
 Microsoft Print to PDF on their station. Using Microsoft Print to PDF is the only way it wont get cut off.&nbsp;<br />
Yes, I've tried changing the adobe PDF settings, no luck.&nbsp;<br />
Yes, I've tried using another program like cutePDF...same thing happens.<br />
Exporting the document is not an option since it exports the entire workbook when I only need 2-4 pages as opposed to 50.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I cannot keep sending my documents to another person to Print to PDF.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
-Thanks for the help in advance. :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I also tried calling adobe tech support to see if there was a setting in adobe that could be changed so headers/footers dont get cut off but they said they did not offer tech services for the product Adobe Acrobat X Pro anymore.</li></ul>

            Are you running Windows 8.1 or Windows 10?
<br />Because Microsoft Printer to PDF is not in Windows 8
<br />
<br />On Windows 10:
<br />If you don’t see the Microsoft PDF Printer installed, make sure it is enabled and configured. Press Windows key + R then type: optionalfeatures.exe. Hit Enter on your keyboard, this will open the Turn Windows Features on or off component. Scroll down then check to make sure Microsoft Print to PDF is enabled.
<br />
<br />If it is enabled and you still don’t see it in your list of available printers, try this:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R, type: control then hit Enter. Open Devices and Printers and click Add printer. Click The printer that I want isn’t listed.
<br />
<br />Click Add a local printer or network printer with manual settings then click Next
<br />
<br />Select Use an existing port then click in the list box then select FILE: (Print to File)
<br />
<br />Scroll down and select Microsoft under Manufacturer then scroll down and select Microsoft Print to PDF under Printers then click Next
<br />
<br />Give the printer a name or leave the default, click Next. It should now appear as an available printer.

<h2>            I cannot access my computer&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Hey, I was recently on my pc and it kept looping the blue screen with system exception&nbsp;error. Then I tried some troubleshooting and decided to just restart the system(keep files) and the system still looped into the blue screen. I then restarted windows(remove
 all) and now when the system turns on, it asks for a username and password which was never created. I attempted to remove this by clicking forgot password n recovery mode but no admin is listed so there is nothing to remove. Please help me I am very frustrated.
 Thanks.

            <p>Hello Carolyn,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a word, no. Windows RT does not need a 3rd party antivirus program (and cannot install one anyway), protection is built into the platform (Windows Defender which contains the antivirus engine from Security Essentials)&nbsp;as well as the RT OS which cannot
 execute traditional Win32 (x86) Programs and has limited support for plugins - both are the common attack vectors for malware and viruses.

            <p>Windows RT has a specific version of Defender loaded in the OS. Since RT is ARM based and not intel/x86, malware written for the standard versions of WIndows will not infect RT. Most malware uses a flash or java based loader so you may see that part of the
 malware try to execute on your Surface Rt or RT based device, however, the infecting portion of that malware will not install or run.</p>
