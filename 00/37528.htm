    <title>How do I get my taskbar to stay on screen&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pimpscort  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get my taskbar to stay on screen&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Here is the problem:</p>
<p>I was using the internet when I may have pressed a button on my keyboard that could have caused the taskbar to disappear. My taskbar is visible when I'm at the desktop, but not when I'm using the internet and things like that. I have made sure that the taskbar
 is locked and the auto-hide option is not selected and it still is not visible unless I'm at teh desktop, or if i press the windows key (but that is only temporary because as soon as i click back on the internet page it disappears again). Please help me out
 here, it's what seems to be a simple problem but is very frustrating. If it helps, I'm running windows 7 and I beleive internet explorer 9. Thanks a bunch.</p>

            It sounds as though you may have set your internet browser into fullscreen mode. On a normal webpage with no video content (use google as opposed to youtube, for instance), press the f11 key.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If it doesn't work, try this on internet explorer:&nbsp; <a href="http://0.tqn.com/d/browsers/1/5/O/P/-/-/ie8-full-screen-mode-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://0.tqn.com/d/browsers/1/5/O/P/-/-/ie8-full-screen-mode-2.png</a>&nbsp; or just press Alt+V, then click Fullscreen at the bottom.<br />
<br />
and for Firefox:&nbsp; Alt+V, then F<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try and remember exactly what you may have pressed, and also describe which browser you have/the website you are on.<br />

    <title>Why are my desktop network shortcut icons disappear - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerry perkinson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why are my desktop network shortcut icons disappear</h2>
                    <p>original title; Why are my desktop network shortcut icons disappear even after applying hotfixes from kb2642357?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scenario:</p>
<p>Desktop shortcut icons pointing t network resources disappear after system maintenance views them as broken and deletes them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Early workarounds:</p>
<p>As part of my job, I deploy new machines.&nbsp; I ran into the desktop network shortcut icons disappearing issue with the workaround listed in
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/978980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/978980</a>.&nbsp; For me, the two workarounds are unacceptable as they are to either not have shortcuts to network resources on the desktop, which is necessary as the
 bulk of what we do is on the network, or to completely turn off system maintenance, which seems like a generally bad idea.&nbsp; Technically, both "workaround" the issue, but they create more problems than they resolve, it just kicks the can down the road until
 the system has much more serious issues.</p>
<p>I want to keep most of the automatic system maintenance routines running, I just don't want it wiping out my desktop icons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Early fix:</p>
<p>After reading far too many questions and many many answers over several months, I had been using the hack to take ownership of a few files and removing them to achieve what I wanted.&nbsp; A real pain but at least it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft fix:</p>
<p>Then I found that Microsoft came out with a fix.&nbsp; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2642357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2642357</a>.&nbsp; Reading it, it did everything I wanted. It actually fixed the problem without causing a new one. And it worked for a month on a couple of newly built machines.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft fix seems to have stopped working:</p>
<p>Most recently, when I try to apply the hotfix, I get the message that the hotfixes do not apply to my operating system, or version or something similar.&nbsp; I thought it might be that one of the many microsoft patches included the patch.&nbsp; A few days later,
 the new machine loses it's desktop shortcut icons to network resources.&nbsp; I go to manually add the keys, and found that they were already there.&nbsp; I don't know if they were added in a microsoft update, or if the hotfix added them despite giving me the funny
 error.</p>
<p>Same problem as before.&nbsp; Multiple icons that the system maintenance task sees as "broken" and they get wiped out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help:</p>
<p>????&nbsp; Is there any fix other than going back to grabbing ownership and removing the system maintenance files that deal with removing desktop icons????</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some workarounds I have seen suggested that won't really work for me (and why as people seem to not understand):</p>
<p>These are not for me, they are for the technical, but not computer-technical end users whom I support.&nbsp; Teaching them to do something translates to them learning by rote to hit yes or no every time they see a particular type of message, which defeats the
 purpose of even having the message if there is no thought behind it.&nbsp; It is not their field of expertise, so it really doesn't make sense to them, nor should they have to learn a lot of technical information just to operate a computer. (I really don't need
 to know how the timing on an engine works to drive a car, nor should I.&nbsp; My users have the equivalent of the license to drive, knowledge of the brake and gas, drive and reverse, basic rules of the road and that's about it.&nbsp; Some may know how to work the radio.&nbsp;
 But that is all they should have to know.)&nbsp; Which means that I have to set it up to work and/or maintain them.</p>
<p>- group policy to set system maintenance to troubleshooting only:&nbsp; it throws the technical knowledge requirement on the end users.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>- Turn system maintenance off:&nbsp; don't we want most of the system maintenance features (the ones that actually do system maintenance) to run to keep the system running smoothly, fixing errors, correcting disk volume errors, etc..&nbsp; Otherwise, aren't we asking
 for more severe errors down the road?</p>
<p>- Don't have more than 4 shortcuts to network icons on the desktop: almost everything we run is off the network, to do otherwise would eat a considerable amount of person hours over time, as well as wear at people's patience finding things across the network.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>- Create a folder on the desktop that can house the icons:&nbsp; Non-technical people.&nbsp; They either won't do it, or won't remember.&nbsp; I cannot personally manage the desktops for 50 people to make sure they put their icons in a "safe" place.&nbsp; Nor should I need
 to.&nbsp; It may only mean a few more clicks, but that starts to add up across 50 people however many times a day month after month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Create a folder with shortcuts, then create shortcuts to those shortcuts on your desktop:&nbsp; If it was just me, that may work.&nbsp; Trying to manage that for 50 people is simply not feasable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Setup a batch file to copy the icons from a folder to the user's desktop at each logon.&nbsp; Similiar to above (being difficult to implement and maintain), plus I would have to constantly&nbsp; check everyone's desktops versus folders to make sure nothing was added.&nbsp;
 Far more work than above.</p>
<p>- A variety of other things that really require the end user to have technical computer knowledge.&nbsp; , it is not reasonable to require even a moderate level of computer system skills (note: system skills, we' aren't talking powerpoint/excel/word skills, but
 things like understanding how the desktop maps to c:\users\username\desktop and other similar things that we computer-technical-folks take for granted.&nbsp; Again with the car analogy, these folks have their license to drive, understand the gas, brake and ignition,
 but don't know how to change the oil, much less check the gap on the spark plugs, or rebuild the transmission.</p>

<h2>            Cut and Paste Interrupted</h2>
                    <p>Disk space was required on a disk so a cut and paste process was initiated to recover disk space.&nbsp; The cut and paste process was at 99% complete when it got interrupted.&nbsp; It looks like the files where moved.&nbsp; The files are accessible on the destination disk
 and are not visible on the source disk.&nbsp; However, the disk space that should have been made&nbsp;available because of the move was not recovered because of the interruption. i.e 50 MB available space&nbsp;on the source disk, 1 GB cut and pasted to destination, cut and
 pasted interrupted at 99% completion.&nbsp; Destination disk show all files moved and source disk shows all files removed but source disk available space still only show 50 MB.&nbsp; Is there a way to recover the 1GB of space that should be available on the source disk?</p>

            Alternatively, I recommend you to use a small tool named "SpaceSniffer" to find out how your disk space is used by files. This tool has a graphic user interface, it will be a very easy way to help you to manage your disk space.
<br />You can download it from its official website:

            I assume the shared network drive's free space is almost exhausted, so you cut some files from it and paste to your workstation. If so, maybe there are some cache files remaining on the server (which provide the network drive) during the interrupted operation. Here are two solutions you should have a try:
<br />1. Reboot the server (this is the easiest way but you should have the permission to access the server)
<br />2. Log in to the server and optimize its drives as same as the steps I've mentioned.
<br />
<br />Let me know if I can help you further!

    <title>Windows 7 and new mic and mixer &#39;Line In&#39; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joellkenyon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 and new mic and mixer &#39;Line In&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Hello -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an ASUS laptop with Windows 7 Home Premium. I recently purchased a Rode Procaster microphone and a mixer. Between the fact that my webcam mic has no option to be shut off and my new issues with this new setup, I'm hoping someone can help me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is, when I try and go to my playback settings I only have the option for 'Microphone'. I need to have an option for 'Line In'. I've updated all of my drivers and I even went so far as to uninstall them and start over. Nothing is working to get
 this option. I've been told that this is a known issue with Windows 7, but I can't seem to find a solution. Someone mentioned getting a new soundcard, but I don't understand why I should have to buy anything more. If this is a known issue, there should be
 a fix provided? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help I can get would be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you! (hopefully, that all made sense.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perform the steps mentioned below and see if it helps. </p>
<p><strong>a:</strong> Click <strong>Start</strong> and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong></p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Click on <b>Hardware and Sound</b>, then click the <b>Sound</b> icon.</p>
<p><strong>c:</strong> Click on the <strong>Recording</strong> tab</p>
<p><strong>d:</strong> Right-click anywhere in the box where the devices are listed.</p>
<p><strong>e:</strong> Click on <b>Show Disabled Devices</b> so there is a check mark next to it.</p>
<p><strong>f:</strong> This will display any device that has been disabled on the computer. If no new devices are found it's likely no device is being found because it's not detected by Windows.
</p>
<p><strong>g:</strong> Right-click the new icon(s) found and click <strong>Properties.</strong></p>
<p><strong>h:</strong> Beside <strong>'Device usage'</strong>, there is a dropdown menu. Click on
<strong>'Use this device (enable)</strong>'</p>

            <p>Thank you for the quick response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried this already and nothing new shows up. It's certainly where the 'Line In' option should be, but it isn't. I don't want to have to buy a sound card, especially if it's a fault in the Windows 7 software.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What other options do I have?</p>

<h2>            My computer keeps crashing after installing windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I had windows 7 when I decided to update my computer&nbsp;to windws 10.</p>
<p>This&nbsp;is my computer:</p>
<p>Processor: AMD FX-8350 4 GHz</p>
<p>RAM: 8.00GB</p>
<p>System: x64</p>
<p>Graphics Card: GeForce GTX 760</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I am normally using my pc after a period of time&nbsp;it crashes and I have no choice&nbsp;but to restart it. This happened to&nbsp;me a bunch of times, the screen freezes and if&nbsp;I am listening music, in the moment of freezing it makes an awful noise. Every time this&nbsp;happen
 I loose all my work (I'm a programmer) so I am tired of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I thought that this happen after windows downloaded or installed an update but now I figured out that this just happen without an apparently cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if it fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to disconnect all the unnecessary external devices connected to the computer (except the mouse and the keyboard) then check if issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Safe Mode</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to boot the computer to Safe Mode and check if the issue occurs or not. In Safe Mode computer starts with minimal set of drivers and files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the article to boot to Safe Mode. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue do not occur in Safe Mode perform a clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 3: Clean boot</span></strong><span> </span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows<br />

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>" in the provided link to return your computer

            I now have had to replace three computers because of endless automatic repair loops. How does turning off your computers cause Windows 10 to break computers?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the link below and check if your system meets the requirement for Windows 10.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/windows-10-specifications#sysreqs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/windows-10-specifications#sysreqs</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ensure that all Windows pending updates are downloaded and installed. </p>
<p>Disable the third party antivirus and check. Use Windows Defender for protection during that process.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also run the performance troubleshooter from the troubleshooting panel. Just type Troubleshooting in the search bar and click on it. Click on View all and select performance troubleshooter and follow the on screen instructions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also visit you manufacturer and update the BIOS of your PC.</p>

            Hi Tom,
<br />you may use RamMap program to analyze memory usage. But this may be a Trojan or some else malware.
<br />Please run off-line checker such as Kaspersky Rescue Disk.

            Hi Tom
<br />
<br />First check what is running on your Startup and try to minimize that:
<br />
<br />Turn off all unnecessary startup applications and processes: 
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager 
<br />Click on the Startup Tab 
<br />See any non-essential items are listed there 
<br />If so, select and click 'Disable' 
<br />Close Task Manager 
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type msconfig and hit Enter 
<br />When the System Configuration dialog opens, click on the Services Tab 
<br />Check the box marked 'Hide Microsoft Services' 
<br />In the remaining list, see any non-essential items are listed there, uncheck any you find 
<br />Click Apply and OK 
<br />
<br />Turn off all unnecessary Background Apps 
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />Go to Privacy - Background Apps 
<br />Turn off any App you do not need running in the background 
<br />
<br />Restart your PC
<br />
<br />
<br />If you are still experiencing this memory leak:
<br />
<br />Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
<br />
<br />On the processes tab, click on the RAM/Memory column header, so that arrow faces down
<br />
<br />What are the top 5 processes listed?

            Hi Tom
<br />
<br />I would suggest, this is caused by McAfee, try uninstalling that and see if that memory leak continues, if not, check their website for an updated version . . .

<h2>            Installing windows 7 from USB</h2>
                    Hello. 



I'm tring to create a windows 7 install usb flash disk with windows 7 usb/dvd download tool but it says: 


" Status: Files copied Successfully. However, we were unable to run bootsect to make the usb device bootable. If you need assistane etc etc...." 



I'm tring to create a windows 7 64bit install usb flash on my laptop which runs Windows 8 Single Language 64bit. 


After plugging usb to my desktop, it gives error: 


Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause etc etc. 


I have a crashed windows on my desktop which loops at starting screen because of a stupid windows startup loop tool. But my crashed windows is not even running because i didn't setted it as 2nd boot drive on my Bios.  


And when i try to run bootsect.exe manualy it gives an error saying: 


This tool can only be run on systems booted using a pc/at bios. This system was booted using  EFI or some other firmware type. 


First of all i think this must be a big joke. I mea

            <p>I figured it out:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can not run the version that is part of the installation media you are trying to make your USB drive with on a EFI or non-PC/AT firmware system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bootsect is part of my Windows 8.1 UEFI systems, and is part of Windows 7 (maybe Vista) on up. &nbsp;So what I did was opened command prompt running as Administrator, which takes me to C:\Windows\System32. &nbsp;Note 'C' might be different, and will depend on which
 drive you have your current Windows OS on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there, without changing directories, I typed:</p>
<p>bootsect /nt60 f: </p>
<p>
</p><p>(f is the location of my USB drive and will be different for most people, just substitute your USB drive letter for it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Voila, done.</p>

    <title>Is the ranking system broken&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> galactic geek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is the ranking system broken&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm a calm and quiet and peaceful gamer that likes to play games to relax, relieve stress, and have a grand ol' time of fun. However, this game makes my blood boil and want to snap my controller in half.</p>
<p>I have been playing this game for months and have learned the ins and outs of the game's mechanics as well as each of the characters, but I can't seem to ever get past rank 4. Every night that I attempt to play this game, I inevitably fail and end up losing
 ranks back to 1. It seems that the system is set up so that if you're going to have a rank-up match, you're going to end up fighting someone who's at least 10+ ranks higher than you... Not only that, but if you're going to have a rank-down match, generally
 speaking, the same exact thing happens. Please tell me how exactly that's even fair? Now, I can understand the need for a challenge, but 10+ ranks higher during a rank-up match? That's not a challenge - it's a slaughter. It should be 2-3 ranks higher - that's
 a suitable challenge. The matchmaking for this game's ranked fights seems to be rigged IMO and needs to be fixed ASAP or I'm liable to break something.</p>
<p><br />
I was ranked in the top 150 players world-wide for Mortal Kombat (using Sheeva and Baraka), the top 50 best Dhalsim players in the U.S. for Super Street Fighter 4, as well as in the top 200 best players world-wide for Injustice: Gods Among US (in the top 10
 among Lex players) and I just can't seem to wrap my head around just how broken KI's ranked system is. It's just so frustrating... :(</p>

<p>If you can't rank up it's not the ranking system that's the problem it's how you're playing. Even if you fight a rank 10 levels above you, the points you lose from it is marginal. I've lost to someone 10-15 ranks above me on a rank up match, then went into
 the next match and it was still a rank up match because i barely lost any points.
</p>
<p>I say this coming from some one who couldn't get past rank 4 and was doing the 1-4-1 shuffle as well. I kept playing and then finally made it to rank 5. You basically just need to keep putting in time and learn you character more. &nbsp;</p>

<p>From my experience (between levels 1-4 that is), it's always been about a difference of 3 wins or losses. In essence, you need 3 straight wins to rank up or 3 straight losses to rank down. Otherwise, your rank remains unchanged.</p>
<p>To be fair, I know how to use the characters and perform their combos (I can get 70% damage easily with Thunder). My biggest weakness is reading my opponent to do the appropriate counter-breaker. I know how to do it, but I'm still adjusting to knowing whether
 I should be pressing light, medium, or heavy and often get locked out as a result. Also, my block doesn't always seem to work, even when I press it in time - I particularly hate how you have to press down and back to block low. I'm used to just pressing down
 to block low (which is how I wish it would work).</p>

<p>Not to set you up or soo but are you sure that you have the ins and outs under control?</p>
<p>Haven't been online for a month because Im waiting for the Fulgore patch but normaly you shouldn't have any problems to reach rank 5 to 7 if you really know the ins and outs of the game.</p>
<p>Also do not get demotivated because someone is 10 ranks higher then you some of them got there by ragequiting and are actually not that good.</p>
<p>It is stil possible to encounter them it just depends how much they went online after the jail system.</p>

<p>As what Benemobious it said, it sounds like you've had the unfortunate luck of the draw.</p>
<p>I think what you should consider is this:</p>
<p>1. Rank doesn't mean s**t!- Rank doesn't really mean a lot when it comes to stuff. For all we know the high ranker might of quit a bunch of times or maybe after so many losses finally got to where they are.</p>
<p>You should always consider your opponent's strengths once you actually fight them, however it is easy to get intimidated. I've come across high ranking guys including a "Widow Maker" and I wasn't certain how I was going to do myself. I was able to catch
 onto his tactics though, even though he was an AMAZING I was two hits away from being defeated and he had a lot more health than I before I was able to lay the smack down that snatched me victory.</p>
<p>2. Knowing the mechanics of the game is one thing, but it's a WHOLE other thing of know when to use that knowledge. Getting an understanding of the characters your opponents us is another example and knowing what you should do to avoid giving them an advantage.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Example: NEVER EVER THROW A SUPER MOVE FROM A REACTABLE DISTANCE AGAINST SPINAL, NEVER EVER EVER! instead get in close and do some normal, and be carful jumping up you can get hit with a wake up attack.</p>
<p>Another trick to the trade is to know your opponents habits as quickly as possible without your opponent knowing yours to quickly.</p>
<p>I've survived a Widow Maker when I was only a rank 4 but honestly my stats was reset so yeah.</p>
<p>That's about as much as I can do to help I hope this is helpful.</p>

<p>As you get more pts from playing against higher ranks, you will actually find that your rank up matches come more often against them. Not because it matches you against them purposely just because that's the amount of pts you need to rank up.
</p>
<p>The opposite can be said for rank down matches.</p>

<p>NoTron, your post doesn't help at all. If you can't &nbsp;say something nice or useful, don't say anything at all.</p>
<p>As for everyone else - thanks. Still stuck at rank 4 though... :(</p>
<p>I'm learning very quickly that I have a tendency to try to counter-attack and get locked out a lot as a result - that's probably my biggest weakness (not necessarily what I said before - I'm getting much better at reading my opponent). I know how to use
 combo-breakers, but don't often get a chance to use it because of this weakness - I'm working on breaking this bad habit.</p>
<p>There are still some issues that I have with this game though:<br />
1) The aforementioned low-blocking.<br />
2) My wake-ups always seem to fail.<br />
3) I will often fail a combo-breaker despite having a correct read and timing (my guess is lag).<br />
4) Game-breaking stage glitches (notably with the Spinal and Jago stages).<br />
5) Rage-quitters and boosters.<br />
6) Timing of manuals and combo-breaking shadow attacks.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t enlarge the tiles positions in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a non-touch machine, but I like much more the Start Screen than the Start Menu. However, I can't place the tiles in right(er) positions.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/41f479f4-1a4f-4f1e-8764-dd8bedb53475" /></p>
<p>As you can see in the image, I try to move the Skype Tile (the mouse is on the tile, outside the screen), but I can't. Is that possible? Also, is it&nbsp;possible to expand the width of group tiles?</p>
<p>What should I do?</p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>I understand the inconvenience caused. I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you better, do let us know what happens when you try to drag the tiles to the preferred location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the steps below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>1. Click on the tile and drag the tile to the preferred location and release it.</p>
<p>2. Right click on the tile and select "resize" and choose the preferred size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do get back to us with the result. We will be glad to help if you need further assistance.

            <p>Well there seems to be some kind of Windows bug.&nbsp; Something to do with the metrics of your screen that makes Windows calculate the space wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It shouldn't be possible to have that half visible tile.</p>
<p>I have tried several resolutions on my machine and I was never able to add another tile into a group that would be partially on the screen (in the horizontal direction).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't grab the Skype tile and move it to another location, then what I would suggest is to move the tiles next to it down and to the left.&nbsp; As space is freed up the Skype tile will move to the left allowing you to move it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the size of groups.&nbsp; Unfortunately there is no way to change the sizes.</p>
<p>There is a test build that gives the option to have 3 or 4 titles per group.&nbsp; Most likely that option will be in the release build on the next update that is scheduled for this month.</p>
<p>When it comes out it would be:</p>
<p>Settings -&gt; Personalization -&gt; Start -&gt; Show more tiles</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to provide feedback on both the problem, and any suggestions on resizing the groups.</p>
<p>Just search for Feedback, you are looking for the Windows Feedback app.</p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for attaching a screenshot along with your response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that in Windows 10,&nbsp;the start window will&nbsp;expand vertically rather than horizontally.&nbsp;Therefore, I would suggest you to drag the tiles at the right bottom corner of the start screen window&nbsp;near the taskbar and drop it there . Continue this step
 until you have enough space to create a new group.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Yeah a lot of Windows 8 users are missing the Start screen scrolling horizontally since it lines up with what phones and tablets do.&nbsp; There are even still parts in the Store that behave that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when Microsoft wanted to please the desktop people, they went to the vertical scroll for basically everything.&nbsp; Personally I think that they should have stuck with the horizontal scroll for the Start Screen.&nbsp; And they should still use the full screen
 for the All apps when the person is using the Start Screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might consider voting up such suggestions in the Windows Feedback app.&nbsp; Just search for Feedback.</p>

            Reckon there should be an option to get the start tiles back in a horizontal scrolling - to&nbsp;better fit&nbsp;to desktop monitors sizes and shapes. Vertical must be aimed at phones - please lobby MS to put this back in. And also the slicker tile "flick" which
 W10 seems to have lost.&nbsp;

<h2>            Network takes a long time to connect.</h2>
                    <p>I have a DELL Latitude E6410 running Windows 7 SP1 Professional, 4GB RAM.&nbsp; It has
<em>always</em> taken 90 seconds to connect to the wireless network.&nbsp; I did a clean boot as suggested&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp; In fact, my case.is very similar to the post at&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-networking/network-takes-a-long-time-to-connect/a3138e0e-2081-4f83-a592-ada11e603440">this
 address</a>.&nbsp; But it only knocked about 15 seconds off of the time it takes to connect.&nbsp; When I boot in Safe Mode, it connects within seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The network adapter used is the DW1520 Wireless-N WLAN Half Mini Card manufactured by Broadcom.&nbsp; Its driver was released on 1/21/2010 and the version is 5.60.48.35.&nbsp; The routers are only a few years old and are supplied by Cisco.&nbsp; They look like smoke
 detectors w/no visible antennas.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have sent my A/V company e-mails about this because the firewall is only enabled when Windows connects to the WiFi network.&nbsp; I think they are becoming frustrated.&nbsp; A rep made reference to the Base Filtering Engine (BFE), but I do not think it is
 a relevant issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Any and all feedback would be appreciated so I can enjoy a faster connection time and tell my A/V vendor the steps I took in troubleshooting this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time</p>

<p>My best guess is that the problem is the router.&nbsp; When you ask for a connection, you are asking the router to recognize your PC.&nbsp; It should require a password, which is only asked for once and stored in your PC, if you have made that initial choice.&nbsp; The
 PC wireless adapter is then communicating back and forth with the router asking for an internal IP address.&nbsp; If there is a long delay, it could be a problem with the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would start by doing a power down (power plug removed), wait a few seconds then plug it back in.&nbsp; That way the router will be initiating itself and be handing out new IP addresses to all the legitimately connected devices on your network.&nbsp; If that does
 not work, I'd suggest a new router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing you could do is to clean up the networks list that is stored in your PC.&nbsp; Delete the ones you no longer need and move the one you use most often the the front of the list:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Control Panel</li><li>Network &amp; Internet</li><li>Network and Sharing center</li><li>Manage wireless networks</li></ol>

</p><p>Another thing you could do is to clean up the networks list that is stored in your PC.&nbsp; Delete the ones you no longer need and move the one you use most often the the front of the list:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Control Panel</li><li>Network &amp; Internet</li><li>Network and Sharing center</li><li>Manage wireless networks</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that I think about it, my place of residence has two different types of routers.&nbsp; That's probably what's causing the delay in identifying my wireless network.&nbsp; I'm not sure about any one else, but I'm sure all of the people's computers have the same
 issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; Thank you for your response.&nbsp; In regard to your last point, I have consulted
<a href="http://www.blackviper.com/service-configurations/black-vipers-windows-7-service-pack-1-service-configurations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Black Viper's Services configuration</a> for my version of Windows 7.&nbsp; There are a lot of Dell applications in Services.msc that I have configured to Automatic Delayed Start Started.&nbsp; Aside from what I see in Services, I don't know hoe to reconfigure startup
 or&nbsp; checking for updates.&nbsp; Please advise on how to do this.</p>
<p>

<p>Configuring those Dell applications to use "Delayed Start" is a good first step, but you also might think about whether you really need some of those applications.&nbsp; If you don't use something that Dell added to your computer, you might consider either disabling
 it or uninstalling it completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the other point, this really depends on what programs you've installed.&nbsp; Virtually all programs except for very simple applications have a "preferences" or "options" menu.&nbsp; Look in these menus for items relating to updates.&nbsp; Remember, however, if
 you disable an application's automatic checking for updates, you should make a habit of manually checking for updates from time to time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't see anything obvious in a program's preferences, use Google to search for "disable automatic updates &lt;name of program&gt;"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that software updates sometimes change where in the program's preferences the auto update feature is located, so don't give up if the first Google result you find doesn't point in the correct direction.&nbsp; For example, this site (<a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/stop-new-itunes-software-downloads-40951.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LINK</a>)
 says that the automatic update preference for iTunes is on the "General" tab of the preferences dialog.&nbsp; In the current version of iTunes, that setting is actually on the "Advanced" tab.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 audio devices no longer work. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 audio devices no longer work.</h2>
                    <p>Problem:<span>&nbsp; </span>After installing Windows 10, audio devices no longer work.
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Device: Dell Precision M6500</p>
<p>O/S: Windows 10</p>
<p>Board:<span>&nbsp; </span>IDT</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details</p>
<p>Windows 10 has been installed as a fresh install on a Dell Precision M6500 (ie not an upgrade).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Sound previously worked perfectly for internal speakers and headphone/speaker jacks under Windows 7 (enterprise).<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There is no sound from headphones under Windows 10 and a barely audible sound from the internal speakers.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Speakers still work if system booted to old Win 7 system (old o/s on another disk so can dual boot while get Windows 10 up and running).<span>&nbsp;
</span>So issue is not hardware related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set up Details</p>
<p>Drivers for speakers are currently shown as below (previously listed as IDT under Win 7):-
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Provider: Microsoft</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Date:<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>09/07/2015</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Version:<span>&nbsp; </span>10.0.10240.16384</span></p>
<p>Signer:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Microsoft Windows<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Options tried.</p>
<ol>
<li>Run troubleshooter – does not find any problems</li><li>Update Driver via Device Manger (using automatic search rather select from local system).</li><li>Uninstalling and reinstalling audio devices (in Device Manager and using hardware change detect).</li><li>Tried Dell website for win 7 and win 8 drivers for IDT high definition audio codec, but device drivers will not install with error that o/s system incompatible or hardware not compatible.</li><li>IDT web site no longer around, appears to be taken over by Tempo. Tempo drivers don’t work with Win 10, appear to be generic audio drivers.</li><li>Various changes to configuration settings based on similar forum posts:- </li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span>change bit rate to e.g. 24bit/44100 Hz or 24bit/192000Hz)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>check disable all enhancement&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of these have worked.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are plenty of forum posts re IDT sound issues with Windows 10 but no fixes that I can find.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It appears that the Microsoft High Definition Audio driver does not work with the IDT board found on Precision and Latitude Dells.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this something Microsoft is aware of and looking to fix?<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>Or does anybody know of a workaround?</span></p>

            <p>Hi Joy</p>
<p>
</p><p>All options detailed in the Windows help on how to fix sound problems in Windows 10 have been tried with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The IDT drivers <span>IDT_92HD93-HD-AUDIO_8DT4T_A04_SETUP_ZPE and Audio_Driver_MH6WW_WN_6.10.0.6491_A01 have been&nbsp;run as you suggest in compatibility Windows 8 mode (run as administrator).</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>This returned an error “The hardware detected is not supported by this IDT software package”.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver <span>Audio_Driver_DMXXD_WN_6.0.1.5988_A06</span><span><span>&nbsp;installed but did not solve the problem.</span></span></p>
<p>Re installing the Microsoft default driver has not worked either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any&nbsp;other logs on the default Windows 10 audio driver not working with IDT boards?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloaded original Windows 7 drivers for IDT audio from Dell website (DRVR_WIN_R278544).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on drivers file does not display an option to run in compatibility mode, so right click and use “Troubleshoot Compatibility”.&nbsp; Run the troubleshooting install in Windows 7 mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to deinstall the existing audio drivers first as the installation package will otherwise stop with the warning “This update package does not support downgrades”.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the windows 7 audio drivers installed the sound volume were fine on both internal speakers and audio jacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue would therefore seem to be Microsoft Windows 10 audio drivers do not support IDT board. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Missed Barenziah stone in Dark Brotherhood sanctuary</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just one question about the Barenziah stone.&nbsp;I missed the one in the Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary. Now the sanctuary is no more accessible and there is a new one elsewhere. Each time I enter in the old sanctuary, it's dark, I see nothing and I can do nothing
 there.</p>
<p>So can I find the stone that was in this sanctuary somewhere else ?</p>
<p>Thx</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact what I tried to say was, each time I tried to enter the sanctuary, the game freeze and I had a black screen. But you know what, I did it once again and in fact it took almost 90 seconds to load the inside sanctuary that's why I thought the game freezed
 before. It's OK now, I got the finale stone. Thank you guys ^^</p>

<h2>            Windows 7, New install, I can&#39;t get updates.</h2>
                    Hi, I did a clean install of a genuine Windows 7 SP1 O.S. on my Toshiba laptop.&nbsp;For 3 days I tried to get update from Microsoft. I went&nbsp;on line to try fixes that other people tried , Nothing worked. I got a copy of FIXIT and ran it. It said make sure that
 I have a internet connection. I do have internet. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling Windows 7, Still no updates. I did update Explorer to IE 11. And downloaded MSE. Thanks.

                    <p>I have uninstalled a program from my computer, and i want to delete all the leftover files, registry keys and values of that particular program from the registry via command prompt. Is there any command line which can scan and delete all the leftover files,

            <p>If the uninstall program is properly written then it will do all of this. If not then you have to do it manually. While it is possible to write a script that will scan the registry for certain strings, this is not a trivial task. Running such a script would
 be quite risky because it could easily delete the wrong registry key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note also that unused files or unused registry keys do <strong>not</strong> slow down a machine, contrary to popular belief. Purging these unwanted things might give you a warm feeling inside but it will have no effect on the PC's performance.<br />

            To boot into safe mode you don’t have to mess with system configuration which can be troublesome.
<br />There are several ways:
<br />1: Open the Settings menu and go to Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; Advanced startup. Clicking Advanced startup will restart your PC in recovery mode.
<br />2: You'll see a light blue screen with three options: Continue, Troubleshoot, and Turn off your PC. You are now in recovery mode. Click Troubleshoot to see your advanced options.
<br />3: In the Troubleshoot menu, click Advanced options. The Advanced options menu will give you several options: System Restore, System Image Recovery, Startup Repair, Command Prompt, Startup Settings, and Go back to the previous build. Click Startup Settings to change Windows' startup behavior.
<br />4: In the Startup Settings menu, click the Restart button to restart your PC. Your PC will now restart.
<br />When your PC starts up, you'll see a light blue screen with the Startup Settings menu. You can now choose an option using your keyboard (number keys or function keys). To start up in Safe Mode, press 4 or F4. 5: To start up in Safe Mode with networking, press 5 or F5. To start up in Safe Mode with the Command Prompt, press 6 or F6. If you change your mind and decide you don't want to boot into Safe Mode after all, hit Enter to boot normally.

<br />
<br />Just click &amp; hold shift key while choosing restart &amp; it will boot into the recovery options, then follow from No: 2 above.
<br />
<br />If you have any problems following these please let me know.

            You are running an incompatible operating system. You should download, create a bootable then perform a custom install if you a full license.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />

<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, configure privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.
