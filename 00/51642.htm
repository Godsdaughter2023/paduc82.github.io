<h2>            file explorer windows 10 - so slow to take any action&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use file explorer to copy some files from my download folder to another folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File explorer opens quickly, I use the mouse to select the files but then !!! I get the circling cursor for 30 seconds before I can select copy or any other option!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to solve this one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Geoff</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried DISM etc but it failed due to "lack of resources ".. I tried various other suggestions - all failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I re-installed Windows 10 from a recovery DVD I created last October!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This updated to 248 with no problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bit of a drastic solution though don't you think?! I now have to re-install a whole series of software.</p>
<p>

<p>Stingr should not have took over (or been allowed to) in the 1st place, from the start he could not keep upto date with updates and was either posting excuses as to why no updates or thanking someone else for doing what he should have been doing.</p>
<p>one things for sure, i'll not be in another challenge run by him.</p>

<p>I don't know. I think St1ngr went into these full of enthusiasm and if he could bring a measure of that into the challenges then they could get back to their previous activity level, perhaps even becoming as popular as the Forum Reg Leaderboard over on the
 US side.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>There could very well be some reason that he can't update every day but if that is the case then he should be asking for help and not leaving things in silence.</p>

<p>Here is the latest update from the challenge anyway.<br />

<p>Well we can only speculate at the moment St1ngr needs to speak and say why he hasn't been postin updates, maybe he will step down who knows. But if people are refusing to join due to who running it that surely isn't good.

                    My computer was trying to run a Windows Live Essentials 2011&nbsp;Update but I didn't know it.&nbsp; My Webroot Antivirus software has a Web Browser Shield called Browser Helper Object (BHO). The BHO told&nbsp; me that a program "msiexec.exe" was trying to run.&nbsp; I mistakenly
 thought it was harmful because I didn't know what it was, so I told the BHO to block it BY MISTAKE.&nbsp; How do I tell Webroot Antivirus to allow msiexec.exe to run so that the Windows Live Essentials 2011&nbsp;Update can completely install.&nbsp; When I try to run the

            Hey syoussef,
<div><br />
<div>Did you check your system for hardware&nbsp;compatibility? Does your system have "DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver"?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Check out your system in the following link for more info:</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor</a>
<div><br />
<div>It does sound like a hardware graphics issue. But that is only a guess at this point.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Are you seeing any errors?</div>
<div>Did you upgrade your drivers (Monitor, BIOS, etc...) when you installed windows 7?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let us know the status when you find time. Thanks!</div>

            Thanks for the information. &nbsp;
<div>Currently my status is...frustrated.</div>
<div>I thank everyone that has responded thus far and truly appreciate the support. &nbsp;I have tried/checked out all of the above links and fixes without finding a solution that fits.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I followed the link provided above and found that I had already run that before initially downloading Windows 7. &nbsp;The monitor was not listed in the error section or anywhere else in the diagnostic. &nbsp;I am not very computer&nbsp;savvy&nbsp;and did not even know that
 monitors, video drivers, etc... needed updates. &nbsp;I thought monitors were plug in and go. &nbsp;I do not know at this point for sure if it is the monitor but I have been searching for update information for my monitor and have come up empty handed, &nbsp;The monitor
 is an HP f1905e. &nbsp;When I press the auto/select button on the side, the words that come up on the screen for the monitor are clear. &nbsp;The ones on the screen coming from the computer itself are blurry/"shadowed". &nbsp;Very frustrated and regretting installing Windows
 7 in the first place. &nbsp;I only did so to be able to homeshare with a newer system that we have in another room of our house (to&nbsp;accommodate&nbsp;our children's homework needs). &nbsp;Now they cannot even use it. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div><span>To answer your other questions...</span></div>
<div><span>I did use Microsoft's compatibility checker. &nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>I do not know how to find out if I have&nbsp;</span><span>"DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver".</span></div>
<div><span>I am not seeing any errors .</span></div>

<p>Hi Sahaj,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue on the Start Menu may be due to a system glitch. Now, to determine if this is the case, you can run the System File Checker tool on your computer. To run the tool, you can follow the easy steps from this article:

<p>Since the SFC tool didn't detect any errors or corruption on the System Files, it could be that the program or a certain file is the one that has an issue. Now, if this is the case, have your tried to pin to Start some other apps and check if it's the same?
 Also, check if your Windows computer is up to date. You can open the <strong>Windows Update</strong> tab to check for available updates.</p>

            I checked, my windows system is up to date, Windows Update tab is showing&nbsp;<em>your system is up to date.&nbsp;</em>And also searched internet for this issue and found that I can use a command on power shell to resolve this issue, but that command changed my

<h2>            Windows 10 Continous Loop</h2>
                    <p>After an auto update using windows 10 my laptop would not reboot. I got stuck in a continous reboot loop, a blue screen and the windows logo appeared as well as the message advising me the computer was attempting to repair itself, without success. Because
 my laptop was over 9 years old I decided to purchase a new HP laptop a few days ago. I pulled the old Hitachi hard drive out and placed into a sata external case. I was hoping to retrieve important data from old hard drive and download onto new laptop. I plugged
 old drive into USB port of new laptop and received the following error messages:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folder is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Location is not available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>G:\ is not accessible. &nbsp;I: is not accessible. H:\ is not accessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The parameter is incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was followed by, </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I:\ is unavailable. if the location is on this PC, make sure the device or drive is connected or the disc is inserted,and then try again.If the location still can't be found,it might have been moved or deleted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These error messages continously reloop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My new laptops operating sytem is currently using Windows 10 Home. If anyone can assist,please help!</p>

<h2>            Forza Horizon 4 crashes to dashboard on new Xbox One X after hardware death of old console</h2>
                    <p>Hello guys, <br />
this ist driving me crazy:</p>
<p>
</p><p>7 days ago my Xbox One X died while playing Forza Horizon 4 which was run from an external HDD. The console was unrecoverable, so I got a new one. I plugged in my external HDD, started the game and it crashed after the Playground Games logo. I did everything
 in Microsofts book: </p>
<p>
</p><p>- reboot console</p>
<p>- move all data to internal</p>
<p>- uninstalled the game, rebooted console, installed game on the account of my wife, cut off network after installing to avoid problems with cloud saves, I did not even install any add-ons, yet the problem remains the same</p>
<p>- and a mix of everything and some more</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any idea, let me know, because I am desperate. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

<p>Hello Dunk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with Forza 4 not starting up. Since you have done some troubleshooting, we recommend a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Soft factory reset</a> where you keep games and apps. Before doing the reset make sure you have a stable internet connection. Also make sure you know email/password for all accounts on the console. Also recommend for start just install game to internal HD,
 after the game working can move to the external.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps, let us know if you need further help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            I ended up exchanging the console. I have tried really everything and nothing helped. The game was just stuck in the PG animation.

After the exchange, everything was fine.

<p>Every other game works fine on my One X so not keen to do an exchange unless it's actually the last port of call...</p>
<p>Did other games work on the console before you exchanged? I have 2 months left to figure out if it's the console or not..</p>

<p>Gerry, no luck yet. I wasn't sure which Fixit for Windows update you meant. I ran a Fixit 50123 and also a Windows update Troubleshooter. The Fixit 50123 didn't make the update available to me. The Troubleshooter gave me this:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried to rename or delete Software Distribution but couldn't because the folder was open or a file in the folder is currently in use. I rebooted and got the same message. How can I force it to close?</p>
<p>

            I also cannot crop photos.&nbsp; Window 7 photo edit abilities were simple.&nbsp; Windows 10 photo editor limits your cropping.&nbsp; You can move the photo but it forces you to be within a specific pic size.&nbsp; If I want to go outside a pic size it doesn't allow it.&nbsp;
 Why did you take away a very flexible feature?&nbsp;&nbsp; Note I checked the photo properties and there are no restrictions on the pics.

<h2>            Upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10</h2>
                    I use a HP Pavilion Desktop 8Gb RAM 64Bit&nbsp; on Windows 7 Internet Explorer &amp; Chrome. I upgraded to Windows 10 quite awhile ago and could not go back to Win 7 because of the time I had the new 10. I did an upgrade almost a year ago and went back to Win 7
 because there were too many bugs in 10 at that time. A couple months ago I did upgrade&nbsp;to Win 10 &amp; was satisfied until last week. My computer suddenly stopped responding and when I restarted it, it began&nbsp;displaying the recovery page &amp; it actually reverted
 back to Win 7 on its own. I realize that sounds nuts, but I assure you that is what happened. &nbsp;It did not completely install Win 7 but screwed up my PC enough to where I couldn't do any Win 10 recovery/Restore or? I finally had to use my Win 7 Recovery CD's
 to install my prior Win 7 OS. I then made sure that I had all the updates installed and tried updating to Win 10 again, twice. Twice, I contacted Microsoft Support and both times I was assured that Wind

            Greetings. I actually had a Microsoft helper like yourself take over my computer and I ran a USB Flash Drive to create an upgrade on. I still have it. I decided to try one more time today. 06-16-2016 and it again did not install. It reported an error code
 C1900101-4000D and a PAGE-FAULT-IN-NONPAGED-AREA displayed. That told me nothing, and I am not anything more than a novice in using computers. I then decided to hide a windows update to keep Windows 10 hidden so it would not display the Windows 10 icon near
 my clock. I also went to GWX.com and clicked on everything it has to stop Windows 10 from trying to download again and again. I don't know what is wrong with my computer that made it suddenly go back to Windows 7 on its own. But, I'd still like to get Windows
 10 back now. I just can't find anyone who knows how to do so or why it reverted back to Windows 7 in the first place. I spoke before writing to this forum to two agents and neither one stayed on-line until my computer was through insta

            <p>Hi Allan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I believe Microsoft has been less than honorable with their Windows user base in support of their win 10 roll out, I can assure you they truly do want everybody, including you, &nbsp;to accept the free Windows 10 update and there is no secret agenda
 &nbsp;to get you to purchase a win 10 license. To the contrary, &nbsp;their role-out model appears to be in full support of renting their software on a monthly or yearly basis going forward. &nbsp;That's right. &nbsp;You won't be able to out and out purchase their software. &nbsp;See
 Note Below. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And even though, you had a Microsoft tech assisting you, it's safe for us to understand that no one technician can have experience with every scenario on every platform that fails. And it's really not to far fetched they could actually misinform you. &nbsp; Again,
 given it's such a infinitesimal knowledge requirement, &nbsp;it's definitely not inconceivable to happen. &nbsp;No fault. Just an individual doing their best to assist. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of curiosity, when you say, your PC reverts back to windows 7, do you actually get your full windows 7 install before the update, or do you perhaps get the HP Recover partition install to revert your machine back to it's purchased win 7 install state?

<p>
</p><p>How big of a PITA would it be for you to do a clean install of windows 10? &nbsp; And since you have your product key, I believe you can still receive the free upgrade. &nbsp; Mr. Kotakuri's recommendations for a bootable USB along with the software creation tool
 should lead the way to a clean install as well as update. &nbsp; At the same time, I would consider, reclaiming the HP recovery partition unless you do potentially foresee a situation driving you to revert your PC back to shelf status as of when you purchased.
 &nbsp;I would gladly advise to the best of 'My' ability, should you choose this path.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Note: that after the update, none of us retain our product keys. &nbsp;After the free update, our license is reported back to us from our machines as a Digital Entitlement of sorts. &nbsp;No more product key. &nbsp;Goes along with &nbsp;the new roll out model I assume. &nbsp;And
 apparently, even when we did have a product key that we out-and-out purchased, and thought we owned, &nbsp;the fine print read otherwise. &nbsp;</p>

            I am not sure whether it went back to the Windows 7 Recovery Partition or whatever. I know it told me it was returning to my prior install. If I would have waited a day or two, could it have taken that long to activate? I read a few minutes ago it can
 take a couple of days to activate if the current Windows was already activated. All I know is, nothing seems to let me have the Windows 10 OS that I was actually already using when it decided to go back to Win 7. Makes no sense. I do know that it's partial
 return to Win 7 was not quite successful because I did have to use my recovery cd's to make it reliable for my own mind. I don't understand why it won't allow me to install Win 10 now. Even using the creation tool. The first Agent Mellanie, told me to make
 sure the USB was FAT and not NTFS something. Was that correct? It just won't install....Help!

            <p>Hi Lloyd Allan</p>
<p>
</p><p>it isn't fruitful to try answering could haves, so moving on in your comments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't know whether you reverted back to recovery or not. Can I take that as an I don't care about regaining Windows 7 where I was? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Futher to wit, can I assume that your sole intent is forward to Windows 10? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, there is only 2 possible goals. A: being an update of your last known win7 install ( remember that you don't know whether it is factory recovery win 7 or win 7 where you last used it)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and B: being a clean install of Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>B seems like the likely most successful path. &nbsp;That depends on whether you can reload all the software you need from your CDs or from downloads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now i I aready asked you about B option and you never replied. I'll let you contemplate that. Meanwhile I am off to bed, it's very late where I'm at.&nbsp;</p>

            Greetings. I am currently in the process of trying again. I've actually gone by Allan all my life until 2006. My birth name is Lloyd Allan Dale. I was adopted at three yrs old and they changed my name to Allan Dale Lazenby. I had a stroke in 2006 and decided
 to try to find my real sibling who was adopted by a different family. His name is Steve. I had written Steve three letters in 1970 while I was in the Marine Corp, but his parents never gave the letters to him. I actually wrote off&nbsp;finding him after not getting
 any reply. I wanted to find him before something worse happened to me. So, after my stroke, I put all my info on google and just a couple of days later I received a reply about my search. I found out his parents never gave the letters to him and he never remembered
 he had a brother. When they passed away a couple of years ago, he found those letters in their effects and it was about the same time as when I put my search on the web. His wife got on-line and began her own search fo

            <p>Hello again Allan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I stuck up for Microsoft for nearly 35 years. &nbsp;From DOS 1.0 days. &nbsp;With Ten they broke my trust. &nbsp;And don't blame it on Bill. &nbsp;He built the empire by giving consumers choices. &nbsp; Whom ever is running MS now have a totally different mentality. &nbsp;And at the
 end of the day, only the share holders count. &nbsp; That said, &nbsp;we move on, or we hang out and complain, or we change platforms. &nbsp;I chose move on. &nbsp;There are no problems than can't be resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you describe things, I don't see that Windows 10 'uninstalled itself, but rather it somehow rolled it back to windows 7&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Ten installs it does not remove the previous OS. &nbsp;Actually the whole entire configuration sits then on your C: drive in a folder called windows.old. &nbsp;It remains there until 30 days has passed because Microsoft promised we could roll back with just a
 click anytime up to 30 days. &nbsp;And it only take a click. &nbsp;Now it that click just did not happen on your machine, then something else must have triggered the roll back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's where you need to focus. &nbsp;I don't have your answers tonight. &nbsp;But hopefully I've given you the resolve to research some more to see if there is obvious online answers to what could trigger the "Recovery of previous OS". &nbsp;and then reach out to Microsoft
 support with the state of mind that it can and will &nbsp;be resolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>please report back either way. &nbsp;It would be nice to hear you are making headway, but if you hit a roadblock, then we can try some more to help you. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Greetings Allan &amp; thank you for responding. I think that I am resolved to forget about trying to install Win 10 again. I'm as frustrated with my endeavor to get back something that was supposed to be free and stubbornly refuses my continual advances to
 accept as any mule ever was when it didn't want to move. I have tried every avenue I have been able to find and am worn out now by my inability to do the job of pressing a download button that would succeed. Thank you for your desire to assist. But, I have
 already hit too many roadblocks. I have a response to your statement that windows 7 OS stays in the windows.old folder. I am thinking that when I re-installed Win 7 with my Recovery CD's, would not that have formatted the entire system? That is, deleted all
 traces of it?

            <p>Hi Allan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure. It would depend on the particular set of recovery CD, and what options it provides. &nbsp;Some will tell you right off the bat, they will reformat the drive and not give you any other option. &nbsp; Many others will give you an option. &nbsp;All will completely
 remove/replace the existing installation of windows leaving you having to reinstall all your programs again. &nbsp; Those that don't reformat, leave the user folders alone. &nbsp;But all put you back to the factory install complete with all the bloatware they ship with.
 &nbsp;Yuk! &nbsp; I've used them a few times before at work. &nbsp;Never on my own machines! &nbsp;I strongly believe in backups and images. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, you can easily check if you have a C:\Windows.old folder. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you didn't lose all your stuff! &nbsp; Hopefully you had most of it backup up anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You said windows 10 uninstalled itself, and reinstalled Win 7 all by itself. &nbsp;My recovery theory would have put your system back to exactly the way it was before you installed Ten. &nbsp; Are you positive it did not do that. &nbsp;The recovery process does not do
 a format and clean install of your last OS. &nbsp; I am just wondering why you had to use recovery CDs. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Assuming you scanned your system for Win 10 compatibility and it reported you were good to go. &nbsp;I myself, was very disappointed in the highly touted, Win 10 compatibility scan. &nbsp; I believe it didn't do much more that check the hardware requirements. &nbsp;It
 surely did not present any list of program incompatibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So perhaps it missed something on your system. &nbsp;Because I can visualize this scenario in an un-attended install. Perhaps Windows 10 went ahead and installed to some point prior to fully complete, then after the reboot, realized your machine was not compatible,
 then rolled your Win 7 back in. &nbsp; That is assuming you weren't watching the whole time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are resigned to stay on 7, so be it. &nbsp;But nothing is forever. &nbsp;The next machine you get will likely come with Ten on it. &nbsp;And by then Ten will have had lots of modifications to fix the multitude of headaches it is currently presenting. &nbsp;And it will
 become a fine OS. &nbsp; Getting from XP to Win 7 was quite bumpy too. &nbsp;:-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the bright side, I've heard &nbsp;Microsoft is going to continue update support for Win 7 for another 5 years. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Although, you may want to read up on the GWX control utility and other similar tweaks. &nbsp;You will likely need to block GWX to stay on Win 7 without being nagged to update. &nbsp;Or at least I have had to on other Win 7 installs. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, allan</p>

</p><p>I would suggest you try to reinstall the Windows 7 camera driver provided by HP. I took a look at Hp's support side, but&nbsp;didn't see a camera driver listed on their site.&nbsp;Sometimes camera drivers get installed with other software packages,&nbsp;possibly the chipset&nbsp;driver
 or graphics. &nbsp;I do&nbsp;see that HP has YouCam Cyberlink listed, you might try reinstalling that. If you have any trouble installing Windows 7 driver, you can right click and run in compatibility mode to install it.

<br />
CPU 2.2&nbsp; (Win7 RC score 5.4)<br />
RAM 2.8 (Win 7 RC score 4.8)<br />
Graphics and hard drive remained the same (5.9-6.9)<br />
<br />
I have checked BIOS settings for Intel speedstep (enabled)<br />
Checked CPU speed, was then running at 2.25Ghz (no progs running)<br />
Checked power settings (all on high perormance)<br />
Re-installed win 7 ultimate&nbsp;(on formated drive)<br />
Installed all original driver in recommneded order<br />
Have no error messages in device manager<br />
Have 0-4% CPU load when idle<br />

I am completely stuck now so if anyone got this problem or can think of something that I could check it will save me from reinstalling VISTA!!!!!<br />

<p><strong><span>Hi FredXPS,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1. What happens when you try playing the high resolution videos?<br />
2. Are you facing issues only when you try viewing the videos?<br />
3. Did you use upgrade advisor before installing Windows 7 on your computer?<br />
4. Which player are you using to view the videos?<br />
<br />
For viewing the videos properly you may <span>reduce the hardware acceleration and check if this helps -</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1. Close Expression Media if it is open.
<br />
2. Click <strong>Start</strong> and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong>. <br />
3. Click <strong>Appearance and Personalization</strong>, and then click <strong>
Personalization</strong>. <br />
4. Under <strong>Personalize appearance and sounds</strong>, click <strong>Display Settings</strong>.
<br />
5. Click <strong>Advanced Settings</strong>, click the <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> tab, and then click
<strong>Change Settings</strong>.<br />
6. Move the <strong>Hardware acceleration</strong> slider to <strong>Medium</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong> three times. <br />
7. Close <strong>Personalize appearance and sounds</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>By default the hardware acceleration will be high, so reduce the hardware acceleration to medium level.</span></span><span><span>
 You may even try changing the hardware acceleration to other levels and then check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Also, I would suggest you to open task manager by pressing <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+ESC</strong> or by right clicking on the taskbar and then clicking on
<strong>Start Task Manager</strong>.<br />
Here in the window under the processes tab sort the process according to the CPU status and check which process is listed to consume the most of CPU resources?<br />
Let us know the process name to help you resolve the issue better.</span></span><span><br />
<br />
<span><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.<br />
Thanks, <br />

            You will need to activate Aero to make that happen. If your pc even works with Aero that is. You will need to have the latest driver for your graphics card installed
<div><br />
<div>If it does you should be able to change the theme to an aero theme: right click desktop - Personalization - Change the theme to one of the Aero themes</div>
<div><br />
<div>If this doesnt work, go to your start menu - Right click computer - Properties - Click on your WEI score - Left pane, click Adjust Visual Effects, and adjust the visual effects as you wish</div>

    <title>&#34;You have been signed in with a temporary profile&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> howellgetigan-namoc  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;You have been signed in with a temporary profile&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have purchased a Windows 8 PC 4 months ago. And one day, I was just shutting down my computer (not knowing I haven't shut it down properly) and when it restarted, it opened up into an all violet screen color (which was not the combination I used)
 by then, I have signed in with my usual password and during it says 'Welcome' and after a few seconds it will have a 'Preparing Windows' and it takes like 5-10 minutes. When I opened it up, it showed a Start screen with just 'Desktop', 'Internet Explorer'
 and 'Store'. My 'Store' cannot be opened and all those other built-in apps were gone such as Weather, Messaging, People, etc. Then when I went to the&nbsp; 'Desktop' it said "You have been signed in with a temporary profile".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is: How do I fix these problems: THE LOADING OF THE TEMPORARY PROFILE and THE LOSS OF ALL BUILT-IN APPS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you could solve this one. Thank you and good day.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know whether the default account is an Admin account or a standard user account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>I would recommend you to follow the methods below to resolve the issue:</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>Enable Built Admin account.<br />
<div>a) Press <strong>Windows and x </strong>key together on your desktop screen.<br />
b) Click on Command Prompt (admin).<br />
c) Type: <strong>net user administrator /active: yes</strong></div>
<div>Note: Please follow the same steps and type <strong>net user administrator /active: no</strong> to disable admin account after the troubleshooting is done</div>
<div>After enabling Built-in admin, please try with the steps below:</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>Perform <strong>SFC Scan</strong></div>
<div>Please follow the steps to perform SFC Scan:<br />
<div>a. Press “<strong>Windows Key + Q” </strong>to open Charms Bar.<br />
b. Type “<strong>cmd</strong>” without quotes in the search box.<br />
c. On the left pane, right click on the “cmd” option and select <strong>“Run as Administrator</strong>”.<br />
d. Type <strong>‘sfc /scannow’ </strong>without quotes and hit enter.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>Please perform Microsoft Safety Scanner to scan your computer for infections.</div>
<div><br />
To download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner, follow these steps: </div>
<div>a) Go to the Microsoft Safety Scanner site at: Microsoft Safety Scanner <br />
(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</font></a>)</div>
<div>b) Click Download Now.</div>
<div>c) If prompted, click Run. Follow the on-screen instructions to download and install the Microsoft Safety Scanner. When prompted, add a shortcut to the Microsoft Safety Scanner to your desktop.</div>
<div>d) From your desktop, double click the Microsoft Safety Scanner icon. When the Microsoft Safety Scanner program launches, click Scan Type, then click Full Scan, then click Next.</div>
<div>e) After the scan is complete, remove all detected malware entries<br />
<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.<br />
<br />
For more information refer:</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong></div>
<div>Please restart your PC and check if you are able to log in to your Default Profile.</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>From Built in administrator account create a new user account and transfer the profile data.</div>
<div>Please follow the steps below to do that:</div>
<div><br />
a) Press <strong>Windows and x</strong> together and select Windows Explorer.</div>
<div>b) Click on <strong>View tab </strong>and Click on <strong>Options</strong> at the top right corner.</div>
<div>c) Click the <strong>View tab</strong>, and then click <strong>Show hidden files, folders, and drives</strong>.</div>
<div>d) Uncheck the box which states <strong>Hide protected operating system files.<br />
</strong>e) Click <strong>Yes </strong>to confirm, and then click <strong>OK. </strong>
<div>f) Locate the <strong>C:\Users\Old_Username folder</strong>, where C is the drive that Windows is installed on, and Old Username is the name of the profile you want to copy files from.</div>
<div>g) Select all of the files and folders in this folder, except the following files:</div>
<div><strong>•Ntuser.dat<br />
•Ntuser.dat.log<br />
•Ntuser.ini</strong></div>
<div>h) Right click and Select <strong>Copy</strong>.</div>
<div>i) Locate the <strong>C:\Users\New_Username folder</strong>, where C is the drive that Windows is installed on, and New Username is the name of the new user profile you created.</div>
<div>j) Right click inside the folder and select <strong>Paste</strong>.</div>
<div>k) Restart your PC and check if you are able to log in to default profile.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
