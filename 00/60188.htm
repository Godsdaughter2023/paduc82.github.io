<h2>            Fallout 4 Season Pass Issues&#33;</h2>
                    
<p><span>Ok so I bought the season pass and redeemed it on the same night and it told me it went through, but it never installed or showed up in the management section for the game.</span><br />
<br />
Under manage game there is nothing there other than the Fallout 4 game, when i check the store and click on manage for the season pass i<span>t just takes me to page that says "Manage Fallout 4 Season Pass" and it's blank.</span></p>
<p>I have contacted support via chat and they wern't able to help, they did say that they see a license for the season pass.<br />
<br />
<span>So basically, how do I know if I actually have the season pass &amp; will have access to the content?</span><br />

<p>I am having the same issue. &nbsp;Purchased Fallout 4 season pass from best buy. &nbsp;Redeemed on xbox.com BEFORE I installed the game. &nbsp;When I installed the game I noticed the Season Pass was not there when I Manage Game for Fallout 4 nor is it available to download.
 &nbsp;When I look at the store on my xbox for the season pass it just says Manage, not Installed or the purchase price. &nbsp;When I click Manage it takes me to a blank screen that just has my profile picture and gamer tag in the upper left hand corner. &nbsp;So I can't
 find it on my xbox and I can't download it again from the store.</p>

            <p>Hey there!</p>
<p>Currently if you have redeemed or purchased the season pass it will not show up under the 'Manage Game' screen, but once the DLC is released you should have automatic access to it. If you have trouble once the DLC releases definitely create a new thread and let us know.</p>
<p>More than happy to help out! </p>

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We just met (for language tutoring) -- she's in another country &amp; is using her phone. &nbsp;I didn't ask her whether it's iOS or Android.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wd you like to tell me how it matters what type of phone OS she's using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll suggest she try your idea.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10, Device Setup Manager &#91;DsmSvc&#93; This keeps running under svchost.exe and using 12.45 CPU Resources and never stops&#33;</h2>
                    <p>On Windows 10, Device Setup Manager [DsmSvc] This keeps running under svchost.exe and using 12.45 CPU Resources and never stops! If I disable "Device Setup Manager [DsmSvc]" in MSConfig after the PC boots everything drops down to
 0 CPU resources if the system is idle. Why does this service not terminate on its own? I can not find any viruses etc. and the system is working fine except for the constant running of DsmSvc, Something I installed or ran or uninstalled caused this I'm sure,
 The sister PC to this one does NOT have this problem and the PC's are identical ? Any ideas? Thanks..</p>

            <p>Thanks for the information, I am trying to sort through the files It had me download and the instructions to figure out what to do? Sorry but I am a Hardware IT Support Tech, (Retired) But I keep learning and work on a small LLC and client base to keep busy
 (o;&nbsp; Software and applications are not my area of expertise by any means.. (o; I can load and repair most applications and setup WEB sites etc. So, I am working on it and will post the log ASAP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been doing testing and research on this issue since about 11-01-16 and The system crashed and I had a **** of a time restoring the system as the backup software I found is not the best when it comes to doing the restoring part! Not Good! But I
 finally got the C: Drive restored and the OS (Windows 10 Home) running again after fighting with it from 12-10-16 to 01-30-17! What was discouraging is the initial problem is still there! So after updating the OS and all my files and software I am back to
 where I was on 11-01-16! </p>
<p>&nbsp; Not to get off the track but this PC has been killing HDD's on a regular basis and I started thing that some of this may be all related! about 3 years ago the WD SATA HDD went bad or crashed after less then 6 months, I low-level formatted and tested the
 drive and it is working great in another PC!? then I went to Seagate same side drive 1TB and it lasted about 5 to 6 months and crashed! Did the same as the WD drive and it to is working fine in another PC today!? About 2 years ago I switched to Seagate's SSHD
 drives! and I installed them 1TB each as my C: and D: drive! internal. The C: drive crashed on 12-10-16!? It had been giving more trouble like locking up and freezing and always had errors on the drive and I kept fixing them until it gave up! and then it failed
 the SMART Function&nbsp;Test! It was still under warrantee and Seagate sent me a New Drive! That's what is in it now after the 2 month ordeal to restore the system and OS. One thing I noticed and when the system would freeze the HDD led would be ON steady, if I
 disconnected the D: Drive it would start running again and everything would be fine until the next time I was doing some heavy use like a movie or a Game it would just freeze! So, I started leaving the D: drive disconnected? But, The drive was probably to
 far gone by then and it crashed anyway! I am just telling you all this as it might give you insight as to what is going on with this PC?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This last month I started suspecting the Power supply! It tested Good, but the SATA Power connectors do not have the 5th orange wire to supply 3.3 volts to the Drives? I know it is said that it is not needed for the drives to function correctly but what
 the heck? and maybe there was some line noise or something wrong with the Power supply IO could not see in the Power Supply Tester? So I changed it out with a new one that also tests very good! under load! 850 watts, it did make a difference! the system is
 faster and seems to run smother and it is not locking up or frizzing yet anyway? (o;&nbsp; &nbsp;everything seems to be working good except for this high CPU usage problem and Microsoft "E" will not launch! I am working on that trying to reinstall it? All other Explorer,
 Fire Fox, etc., run fine, no biggie! (o;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, here is what I know after the system boots svchost.exe keeps running using about 12.46 CPU resources! I did trace this down to a DLL program that is called (DEVICE SETUP MANAGER) Or [DsmSvc] I found that if I disable this program in MSCONFIG the
 problem goes away! and at idle system resources drop to 0&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is that if I leave Device Setup Manager disabled? I may run into problems with software and or drivers that will not get updated correctly and could cause them to become corrupt? or that
 what it says anyway? So, that's why I am trying to find out how to fix it? I was going to try downloading the file from MS and see if that would help? maybe it corrupted from all the HDD errors and crashes? Or, What is Causing Device setup Manager to keep
 running for as long as the PC is tuned on?&nbsp; that's where I am at, I will try to get a log file or dump report for you ASAP.. Thanks for all the help and patients with this issue.. (o;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FYI: The system is a Gigabyte GA-990FXA-UD3 Rev 4.0&nbsp; BIOS F2&nbsp; AMD AM 3+</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AMD FX 8 core FX 8350 4.0GHz Black Edition unlocked (I never over clock my PC's.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows 10 Home, 64Bit with 16GB Ram, 2 CD/ROM RW Drives, 2 Internal 1TB SSHD's C: and D: Drive, 4 TB external drives for data, one is USB 3 the other is eSATA Disconnecting these 2 drives makes no difference.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EVGA GeForce GTX&nbsp;960 SC 4GB GDDR5 Video card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system boars was also replaced with a duplicate spare board and both pass all diags with flying colors! I have Installed the full version of Avast and run Malware Bits and a few others and found No Variants or Viruses etc. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope this helps, Thanks again,&nbsp; Rick289.</p>

            <p>Hi ZigZag3143, </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; OK, I think I got the recorder to run? I was able to load the recorded file and revue it and sure enough it shows the Svchost.exe running and a few steps down it shows all the files and things that are going on! Including the DEVICE SETUP MANAGER that
 will not stop and is using up the CPU Resources! Very nice program! I have never used anything like this before! (o; But, Now I see why you wanted me to do this.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not sure what I am looking at and what's supposed to be there and what is not? So, What&nbsp;now? I upload that file to you for revue? I mam not sure how to go about that yet ether? Do I open the program and get to the point where toughs files are running
 and take a screen capture? Or, Is there a way I can upload the saved or exported windows analyzer trace file? I'll see what I can do on this page, If you could let me know I will get you the trace file ASAP!&nbsp; Thanks for your time and help, talk to you soon,&nbsp;

            <p>HI, Just an Update, I am still working on this issue,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I was able to fix 2 other issues that I thought might be related? But not! &nbsp;Microsoft Edge would not load! you would click on it and it would look like it was going to open and then nothing, and then Cortana would launch OK, but kept saying it could not
 connect to the internet and to try again later!? They are related! I was able to repair both of them buy logging on as my original ID to this PC as the original Administrator! Both Edge and Cortana worked fine under this ID and I went through and check all
 my setting and updated anything that needed updating.. I then Logged out and back in as this user: (my problem ID) and like magic Edge and Cortana are now working just fine! &nbsp;That was a minor issue but at least I was able to get things back to normal and I
 have changed my backup Programs so I have a "Verified &amp; Tested" good backup and Now I also use a spair HDD that is Mirrored to My C: SSHD and has been tested and is working fine! This all started after My C: SSHD started to fail, and I ordered and new one
 and "TRIED" to restore my backup to the new drive! it took over 2 months to get it working! FYI: Do NOT Ever use Ashampoo Backup Pro! It was purchased &nbsp;by Ashampoo last year from Ocster Backup Pro and the original always worked very good with NO Problems,
 But Now when you try to restore your C: drive from the rescue CD it will not even Boot all the way up! because after doing a lot of testing it is looking for a Din Plug Key board and Mouse! The Din Plug is the old stile Round Plug that we used to use on old
 PC's to plug in the keyboard and mouse! &nbsp;Unfortunately most NEW Computers do NOT use Din plugs any more! Mine did have one for the keyboard but not for the Mouse! So other new PC have NO Din Plugs at all! I was able to get the program to run by using an old
 Laptop Duel Din Plug adapter letting you use a Din Keyboard AND a Din Mouse on a lap-top! I was then able to boot up to the recovery CD and start a restore, The only problem then was after the restore was completed and I put the new SSHD in the Drive C: position
 and reconfigured the ?BIOS to boot to the drive it would NOT BOOT! &nbsp;After a lot of Head banging nights and a lot of research and using a product called "Macrium" that has a free version for home use only I was able to correct the boot problem and new I have
 Images and mirrors and backups of ALL my PC's! &nbsp;(o; &nbsp;I always do backups! But when you need it and the backups do not work! Well, it is very frustrating! This problem with the Windows 10 (Device Setup Manager [DsnSvc]) Started about a month before the SSHD
 started to fail and that brings me to problem number 3! My SSHD's or HDD's where failing every 2 to 3 years and this last one was still under warrantee! So Seagate Sent me a new drive, but I started doing some testing because I have drives that are much older
 in sister PC's that are NOT Failing! and are still running great! There was a small noise or distortion in my Power Supply!? the Power Supply tester did not show it even under load it tested good! But I just changed the Power Supply to another NEW one and
 the symptoms seem to have gone away? &nbsp;I think it has something to do with using several HDD's and with a PS that does NOT have the 5th orange wire in the Drive power connector at 3.3 volts! I know it is not supposed to do anything But this PC would lock up
 for no resin and the HDD LED would be ON Solid! all I could do is reset or force power OFF/ON reset! I found that if I just disconnected the D: HDD (Just pulled the power connector off the drive) the PC would take off running again like nothing was wrong?
 I know this is not a good thing to do but I was trying to find the problem and why! I replaced the D: Drive and it did not help after a few days it was doing it again! Anyway this started giving me errors in some of my data and program files and errors on
 the drive its self until it Failed the S.M.A.R.T. test and I called the drive in for replacement! Now with the New PS That problem seems to be gone!? I have run the PC under all kinds of stress Playing games and Videos and leaving it ON for Days at a time
 and it has NOT Frozen with the HDD LED ON one time in the last month!? (Knock On Wood!) &nbsp;(o; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I think that this is when the problem I have now with the Svchost.exe and the consistent running of Device Setup Manager under Svchost.exe! Started? &nbsp;I Thought if I explained how I got to this point it might help someone to help me come up with a Fix?
 I hope (o; &nbsp; Where I am at now is Svchost.exe keep Running with Device Setup Manager using 12.45 to 12.65 Percent of the CPU Resources and it never stops! no matter how long the PC is ON or what I am doing? &nbsp;I have found that if I "run" &nbsp;MSConfig and Take
 the check-mark out of the Box next to Device Setup Manager! It Stops the issue?! I boot up and after everything is loaded and just setting idle at the desktop it drops down to 0 CPU Resources being used! BUT! it also says if I do this I may run into problems
 as some system files my not get the updates they require and the system can become unstable or even stop working!!! SO, What do I do Turn it ON once a week? and let run that day? then Shout it OFF again? I can do this but with the way it keeps running when
 its ON? I don't think it is doing what it should any way? And this may be causing my system to crash every 6 months or so? I am going through ALL the operations on this Svchost.exe group that runs Device Setup Manager on my sister PC's that everything is working
 fine on and trying to find an inconsistency in some program or application that might be causing this and I have uninstalled some apps, and reinstalled and so far I am not finding anything so Any help would be greatly appreciated... &nbsp;I know it must be a Curuped
 or missing file in some program? But there are so many apps running under this process of Svchost.exe.. &nbsp;It very hard to find this problem I have a Trace file from when its running with Scvhost.exe running consistently, I am not sure how to upload that file
 in this forum? &nbsp; I will try to do a screen shot? Or if someone knows what they are asking for and how to send it I will be happy to post it? &nbsp;Thanks for any help in advance, Sorry I am not of a lot of help, I am a hardware Guy Retired and don't do much in
 software! LOL, that's why I am not sure how to upload this file? &nbsp;Thank again, Rick289 &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Desiree, Thanks for the information,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Well, I am not really sure, It was back in October or November when I first noticed this was going on! I do know there was several Windows 10 updates during this time period? I did not do much in the way of installing anything new, I just noticed my
 resources were lacking and some things like Videos or Games where lagging and that's when I started checking into what was running, I do have a sister PC to this one and they are almost identical, same Windows build, both where originally built with windows
 7 home, then upgraded to windows 10 last year while it was still free! The sister PC is NOT having any problems? they got the same upgrades at the same time, and I run the same games and all the apps I use are the same. I use the same user ID's and yet the
 sister PC does not have any of these symptoms and so I have been going through the registry lately looking for differences, so far that has not found anything different but it takes a long time piece by piece! (o; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This PC the problem one was having a strange System Power supply problem that did not show up under load testing etc, but the PC was killing HDD's at an early age, Meaning they where still under warrantiee! Most recently the C: drive died, it went out
 of SMART range and SeaGate replaced it, I am running 2 SSHD drives C: 1TB and D: 1TB This happened about the second week of December, I was already having this issue with Scvhost.exe, and "Driver Setup Manager", running under it and using the resources and
 not ever stopping! I had just done a monthly Full Backup, So, When I installed the new SSHD I restored my Backup and the system came back as it was before and yes it still has the Problem with Driver Install Manager, I guess it was backup up with everything
 else and so that was disappointing! (o;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&nbsp;also changed the power supply and the drives seem much more stable and I have not had any lockups or freezing that started almost 2 years ago and we could never figure out why, It was not constant but every now and then the drive LED's would just
 stay ON and the system would freeze up and then it would finally start writing again, If I disconnected the D: drive it would also start working again, so that led us to the power supply! And it may have caused a corruption in some file that is now causing
 this issue? I have been checking all the Files involved with this issue in the system 32 Folder and so far they are all the exact same size as the file in the sister PC? &nbsp;So, this brings us up to now...</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have run all of my apps and programs and there are NO errors reported and everything runs Just fine, I checked all my drivers and they are all up to date. I did as you suggested and restarted the system in SAFE MODE and the Problem is Gone! after
 everything loads it settles down to "0" CPU resources being used? When I reboot in Normal mode the issue comes back! Like before? &nbsp;I can also go into MSConfig and take the check BOX out of the "Driver Update Manager" so it can not load, and reboot the system
 and the issue is Gone as well? But it says if I leave that disabled It will not update system drivers and the system may become unstable and quite working? So, I need to find out what is causing Driver Update Manager To keep running under Scvhost.exe, From
 what I have read, it is supposed to shut down or stop running after it has nothing left to update or verify, It is set to its default in System Services, it is set to: {Manual} (Triggered Start) But it just shows Running all the time and if you try to stop
 it there it just says it is shutting down but never does, it just keeps running, The only way to stop it is to Disable it from starting in MSConfig? &nbsp;I have got a few other leads that say it may be caught in a loop! trying to update a driver or File that is
 not working right and making it just keep trying to update it! they where talking about Windows Update, But that seems to be working OK, the last updates show that they installed good and are OK? &nbsp;Also, I have 3 users on this PC and all 3 are affected the
 same, so it is common to all users on the PC, I hope this helps you some? let me know what other information you might need or things you would like me to try? &nbsp;Thanks so much for your help, Rick289...</p>

            <p>Hi Desiree,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK,&nbsp;&nbsp;Update, I disabled everything in Startup and System Services, and did a "Clean Boot"&nbsp; The CPU resources dropped down to "0" once everything was booted and setting at the desktop, I re-enabled everything in startup and rebooted and again once everything
 was loaded and setting at the desktop the CPU Resources dropped down to "0" So we know its nothing in Start up?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I then started enabling each box one at a time in System Services and each time I rebooted everything looked good and CPU Resources would drop to "0" after it was Ideal at the desktop! I thought we may be on to something?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But! When I enable "Device Setup Manager" [DsmSvc] The Problem Came BACK!&nbsp; Setting Idle at the desktop after 30 Minutes the CPU Resources where still up at 12.45 or better and would not stop! I turned everything back ON in System Services and rebooted
 and it stayed the same! The I disabled the "Device Setup Manager" ONLY! And rebooted and after the boot and setting at the desktop Idle, Everything including CPU Resources dropped to "0" ???&nbsp; At least its isolated to something that "Device Setup Manager" is
 trying to update or verify, So I think we are getting closer! I am looking at all the possibilities associated with [DsmSvc] and verifying if they are an active program or something left over, and then I am going to start uninstalling all programs that are
 connected to [DsmSvc] and uninstall them and see if I can isolate the problem?&nbsp;I believe it is a network driver? or LAN Driver or something in Communications and even one source indicated it could be a problem with Windows 10 Update? I don't think that is
 the case as it just went through this months Windows update all by its self and I verified the download and installation went just fine and it shows the update as installed successfully?&nbsp; So let me know what you think I might try next as well and I will let
 you know if I have any luck on my end with some of these programs?&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks again for all your help, I now believe this is going to be something very minuscule and just a silly thing as the system is working just perfect other then this CPU resources issue with Device Update Manager?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk to you soon..&nbsp;&nbsp; Rick289...</p>

<h2>            Windows live mail deleted email and lost folders</h2>
                    Hi, internet provider deleted my email account because thousands of old emails were continually downloading into it. When he set up the new account all of my storage folders were gone. I cannot import back. Ive found pathway to appdata/local/microsoft/
 windows live mail but cannot identify a folder to import. I see a mail.msmessagestore file and wondered if this is my old storage files. Cant import this file though. &nbsp;Ive looked in previous versions of wlm and there is not a version available that is prior
 to deletion. &nbsp;Can anyone help me reinstate my important storage folders emails. &nbsp;Im desperate. &nbsp;Internet provider cant seem to help..too hard. .. im running windows 10. Thankyou,Karen

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Windows Live Mail are prone to getting lost even if you don’t delete them. In some cases, Windows Live Mail users have reported some or all of their Windows Live Mail folders disappearing either after a Windows update or a Windows Live Mail Update or following
 the deletion of any one email folder. For us to resolve this issue, we suggest that you follow the methods to restore lost Windows Live Mail email folders listed below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Restore the folders using Compact View</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Windows Live Mail</strong>. Click on <strong>View </strong>in the taskbar.</li><li>Click on <strong>Compact View</strong>. Doing so will collapse all of the Windows Live Mail folders listed and a green sign in the shape of a plus will appear under them.</li><li>Click on the green plus. As soon as you do so, a dialog box that lists ALL of the Windows Live Mail folders on your computer – including the ones that you have lost – will appear.</li><li>Simply check each of the lost folders that you want to restore by clicking on the checkbox beside them, and then click on
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Once done, click on View and then click on <strong>Compact View</strong>. As soon as you click on Compact View the second time, all the email folders that you thought you had lost should appear exactly where they should be.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Restore the folders that were lost using the import feature from the default directory where the mail’s are stored</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The first step is to Hold the <strong>Windows Key</strong> and <strong>Press R</strong>.</li><li>Then, type <strong>%appdata%</strong>&nbsp; and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Once there, check the following locations:<br />
<strong>AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail</strong><br />
<strong>AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail</strong></li><li>You will then see your folders in one of those directories, copy everything and create a new folder on Desktop. Name it as
<strong>Back Up Live Mail</strong> or something. This will be the back up folder, the reason it is supposed to be copied is to not corrupt or mess up the existing data.</li><li>Now that you've got the back up, you'll need to import the files to your Windows Live Mail.</li><li>Open <strong>Windows Live Mail</strong>.</li><li>Open the <strong>File</strong> menu located in the upper left corner of the window.</li><li>Click on <strong>Import messages</strong> in the File.</li><li>Select the file format in which you saved your Windows Live Mail backup. If you’re restoring from the back up in the above method, then use the
<strong>Windows Live Mail option</strong> and click <strong>Next</strong>. Click on
<strong>Browse</strong>, navigate to the folder in which your backup is stored, click on the backup file (the folder or mailbox) you want to restore to select it and then click on
<strong>Next</strong>. Click on <strong>Next</strong>. As soon as you receive a message confirming the success of the restoration of the folders, feel free to click on
<strong>Finish </strong>and see that the folders you restored are now visible in the left pane under Storage folders or where they were imported.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the resolution provided works.</p>

<p>Hi paolo, thank you for your response. Ive done both of these methods and i still cannot recover the &nbsp;folder files i want &nbsp;. It recovered lots of other folders/files (mostly from my other gmail account- not the iinet acc that im trying to recover. &nbsp; I can
 see some folders called recovered and imported folder but there is nothing useful in there that i am looking for.... the folders i want are the ones i created myself under my old inbox. &nbsp;I had dragged important emails across into these folders over many years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the internet provider reinstated my acc he changed it from a pop account to an imap acc.. could this be affecting my ability to recover the folders i want?</p>
<p>
</p><p>any ideas?</p>

<p>Since you have already performed the troubleshooting steps to recover deleted emails but the issue still persists, we suggest that you back up all your files in case something happened to your computer or your emails in the future.<br />

<h2>            Why is this &#34;help forum&#34; now such an embarrassment to Microsoft&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong>I really don't get it.......&nbsp; Will someone at Microsoft KILL this "help forum" ??&nbsp; The old MSDN with knowledgeable MVPs was very helpful.&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>This is worse than useless and it is obvious to anyone seeking just about any answer.&nbsp; Any missing feature or question with NO answer is LOCKED, so no one can even hope to try to help, get help, or complain about that answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure by now, the former veteran MVPs must feel like they've wasted their time, trying to help users in the past.&nbsp; Now, this "help" provides zero method for even flagging all the idiotic "official" responses.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EXAMPLE:&nbsp; Today, I tried to find something about "Skype Backpack" in search....
</strong></p>
<p>Top search returns are these forums, giving all USELESS, MISLEADING and LOCKED answers.&nbsp; The best answers simply begged Microsoft to stop adding features like BackPack, with NO documentation, and NO help method, and with only the ILLUSION that you could
 ask a question and get help.&nbsp; Even the advice for how to disable this feature (that no one knows how to use), is obsolete and there is NO method of even disabling it.&nbsp; At least do a WORD SEARCH for "Backpack" in you source code and DELETE any reference to
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Will someone with some authority please reinstate the OLD MSDN help system and KILL this??&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>And, FIRE all the official "helpers" here that merely recommend reinstalling, for ANY problem...&nbsp; Get them jobs as Walmart greeters, training or real budgets...&nbsp; Then if at Walmart, even if they don't know how to help since they aren't expected to know much,
 their smiles might be welcome and not frustrating.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>WUDFHost.exe&nbsp;</strong>is Windows Driver Foundation- User-mode Driver Framework Host Process. This is related to Windows User Mode drivers. This background process is essential for Windows to communicate with hardware devices and is created automatically
 to load drivers. Hence <strong>wudfhost</strong> is needed for the relative program to run properly and so removal is not recommended.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the issue with Windows Media Player increasing your CPU usage, I suggest that you perform the methods stated below and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Perform full system scan and check if there are&nbsp;virus or malware infection in your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Disk Cleanup.</strong></p>
<p>Run disk cleanup, as this will help you remove all unnecessary junk files that might cause the above to happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method&nbsp;3: Defrag Drives.</strong></p>
<p>I&nbsp;suggest that you optimize and defrag your drives and check if the issue pertains.
</p>
<p>1. In the search box type <strong>Defrag and Optimization</strong>.</p>
<p>2. In that window select one drive and click on<strong> Analyze</strong>. Once the tool has performed the analyzation, click on
<strong>Optimize.</strong></p>
<p>3. Repeat the same for all&nbsp;drives&nbsp;allocated&nbsp;on your PC.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Reboot the system and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Windows 10 is a service that includes updates, just like Microsoft Office, anything by Google and an increasing number of software applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can physically stop receiving updates e.g., by fiddling with your system settings or by breaking the operating system, but that's really unwise for at least two reasons:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't stop some updates and not others, which means you also won't get security updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going forward, all new software applications will presume that they are being installed on a fully patched system. If your computer is unpatched, the results from installing new software are unpredictable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The better thing for you is to find out why your computer doesn't perform when an update applies, and fix the problem.</p>

<p>Bungie controls their language filter. If they don't want something showing up on their website, they block it. There's nothing that complaining is going to do about it, just change the name if it's that bothersome to you.</p>

<p>You complain an awful lot for only having played 12 days and 170 total games.. maybe this game isn't for you.</p>

RIprova più tardi" , riprovo, e mi dice "impossibile connettersi a facebook in questo momento"</p><p>Ma è 2 giorni che provo :(</p><p>Può essere dovuto al fatto che ho chiesto di chiudere 2 account microsoft?

<h2>            How can I unlock the power options on my laptop&#63;</h2>
                    When I go into the Power Options window, all of the options are locked and I can't "retrieve the information". I get a message saying "Your power plan information is not available. Access is Denied." any and every time I've tried to fix it. It's been like
 this since day one, over the summer, but it's now becoming bothersome to have to wake my computer up every three minutes.

            It may have to do with the laptop manufacturer.&nbsp; Here is a link from Samsung support noting that you need to disable their Fast Start program.&nbsp; Other laptop manufacturers may have different options.<br />

<h3> tangomouse  say:</h3>
<h2>            editing ntldr </h2>
                    i dont know if this is the correct place to ask this question <br />
whats the law on editing windows xp NTLDR file ,from what i understand is its illegal .<br />
but what i need to know is if a virus changes this file to prevent safe mode from running IS it illegal to replace these changes that the virus made! ie restore the NTLDR<br />
<br />
my reason for this is i have created a application that restores windows functions after a virus attack has disabled these ,and a part of my application checks NTLDR for any changes made to it and repairs the changes to defaults so F8 safemode menu is no longer
 disabled<br />
i really need to know before i release this ,i wouldnt want any law suits <br />
<br />
or would this question be better put to MS directly?<br />
<br />
Edit: sorry i just noticed this is posted in windows vista .... opps!

            If you want the guessing to stop and the problem solving to begin, do this:<br />
<br />
If you are in the middle of something and your computer restarts, that sounds like XP is crashing.<br />
<br />
When XP crashes, it is configured to restart automatically, but you can configure it to stop and display some error message that will help you figure out what is going on and fix it.<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum implementation does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and
 agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
What is your Internet browser and version?<br />
<br />
Do you have the problematic Windows Desktop Search installed?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see (exactly) that you don't think you should be seeing and when do you see it?<br />
<br />
What do you not see that you think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
Now configure your system to not restart on a system error:<br />
<br />
XP automatically restarts on a system failure, so configure your system so it doesn't do that, then you can see the error message.<br />
<br />
Configure your system to not automatically restart on system failure and to create a crash dump file when it does crash.<br />
<br />
Right click My Computer, Properties, Advanced, Startup and Recovery Settings.<br />
<br />
In the System failure section:<br />
<br />
Put a check mark in the "Write an event to the system log" box<br />
Put a check mark in the "Send an administrative alert" box<br />
Uncheck the "Automatically restart" box<br />
<br />
In the Write debugging information section, choose:<br />
<br />
Small memory dump (64 KB)<br />
<br />
Set the Small dump directory to:<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\Minidump<br />
<br />
Click OK, OK to save the settings.<br />
<br />
Restart your computer and then wait for the next restart/crash.<br />
<br />
If you can only boot in Safe Mode and are seeing a BSOD, from the Safe Mode options menu,<br />
choose the option that tells XP not to restart automatically on a system failure:<br />
<br />
Disable automatic restart on system failure<br />
<br />
Then you can see the BSOD when it happens again.<br />
<br />
Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a><br />
<br />
Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.<br />
<br />
Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you.&nbsp; We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what your BSOD looks like.<br />
<br />
If there is a file name listed under the STOP message, be sure to include that too.<br />

<h2>            Skype is extremely slow &#40;to point of failing&#41; on windows 10</h2>
                    For the last few weeks, Skype (both for iPhone and Win 10 desktop) have been losing messages.&nbsp; Furthermore, the app for windows 10 is often taking minutes to 30+ minutes to send a message.&nbsp; It sometimes works and sometimes it gets stuck on sending.&nbsp; Sometimes
 it catches up and sometimes it goes to failed to send.&nbsp; I have already deleted the nearly empty Skype folder under %AppData%, and the problem still occurs.&nbsp; How can I fix things so message send and receipt is again quick and reliable?

<p>This is very strange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to reinstall Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am typing (from that computer) this response message.&nbsp; So it sure appears to me that the Internet is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the App Store shows:<br />
<br />
Check your connection</p>
<p>The Microsoft Store needs to be online.&nbsp; It looks like you're not.</p>
<p>With two buttons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So for some reason both Skype and MS Store think I'm offline while I am online enough to access answers.microsoft.com.<br />
<br />
After a few refresh pages, the store worked.</p>

<p>When two computers have Skype running, it becomes inconsistent to get updates on either.&nbsp; It appears that being signed in multiple places breaks it.&nbsp; When I started my second computer because I needed to run a long process and didn't want to slow down my
 main machine, the updates to my main computer became erratic again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having Skype running on my phone also seems to lose notifications to the desktop.&nbsp; It is very common for either the desktop or the phone to get the messages.&nbsp; Closing and reopening skype on the desktop does cause all the not yet shown messages to appear.</p>

    <title>Computer takes long time to startup normally and is very slow after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sunibo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer takes long time to startup normally and is very slow after booting.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title:</strong> Why is 'system', aka ntoskrnl, taking up to 95% disk usage for up to an hour at boot up or wake up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a new HP Pavilion G7 laptop with W8 64bit, 6gb memory, Intel i5-320M processor and 1Tb hdd.
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At first, as I investigated W8, it was a dream - then I started to load my data files. I now have about 425gb data loaded, mainly pictures and video. I have potentially another 250gb I'd like to load, but I'm loath to do so until I sort out this problem.
 When the system started to be slow after boot/wake up, I turned off search indexing (disabled wsearch) but the computer still runs veeery slowly for up to an hour after every start up. Task manager shows the culprit is always 'system', using 50% to 95% disk
 utilisation, though not much memory. This is extremely annoying, especially as this is a laptop that I dip into every now and then. I expect to open it up and use it, not sit in front it waiting for programs to load and run.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What does 'system' do that could require that amount to disk time at every start up, and how can I make the computer work at the speed it should as soon as it wakes up? OK, there may be a minute or two of system related stuff, but not 20, 30, 60 minutes
 worth, surely?</div>

<p><br />
</p>
<div><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span><br />
<span>I would suggest you to boot the computer in Safe Mode and check if the issue occurs in Safe Mode or not. If not, you may perform clean boot to check software conflicts.
</span></span></div>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<div><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span><br />
Start the computer in Safe mode, to start the computer with minimal set of drivers and files.</span></div>

<p><br />
</p>
<div><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span><br />
Now perform clean boot from Safe Mode and check if it helps.</span></div>

    <title>Reinstall windows 8.1 from built-in recovery partition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davy49  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstall windows 8.1 from built-in recovery partition</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently purchased a ASUS T100TA transformer tablet, it's the 64 GB version, I believe the first time I installed windows 8.1, I chose the transfer settings from backed up skydrive files. I should have chosen the 'new pc' option. I just performed a 'refresh'
 on my tablet, but I still have some of the previous file's that I was hoping would have been deleted by performing a refresh. My question is this..if I perform another refresh, and chose the 'fully clean the drive ' option, will this delete my recovery partition
 that contains my copy of windows 8.1 ? I'd rather be sure about this, that's why I'm asking this.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>David</p>
                </div>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you want to perform a Refresh and you want to fully clean the drive, however, you are concerned that&nbsp;if it will delete the recovery parition.&nbsp; Recovery partition will not be deleted by performing a Refresh and Reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform a Reset to remove everything and reinstall Windows.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</a><br />
(Please backup all important data before performing a Reset.&nbsp; Also, please make sure to read through all the warning notes mentioned in the article).</p>

<p>Hope this information helps.<br />

            <p>Hello RajithR,</p>
<p>I want to put my tablet back to the state that it was when I first took it out of the box, and start out as if it was a 'brand new' computer. I think where the problem is that I have some item's stored on Microsoft skydrive, and some how the tablet acquires
 those file's and installs them. Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>David</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>P.S. I think this is the method you are talking about, since my 'original' installation of windows 8.1 resides on a separate recovery partition, I feel like I won't lose anything of value whatsoever. My reason for doing this is just to do a 'major' cleanup
 to my ASUS T100TA 64 GB transformer tablet. I just wish I would have chosen the 'install as a new PC option' to begin with, I guess that's how we learn isn't it.</p>
<p>Here's the part of the article I'm referring to :</p>
Note
<ul>
<li>
<p>You'll be asked to choose whether you want to erase data quickly or thoroughly. If you choose to erase data quickly, some data might be recoverable using special software. If you choose to erase data thoroughly, this will take
 longer but it makes recovering data less likely.</p>
</li></ul>

            Hi,
<div>I just performed yet another 'reset' of my tablet, I chose the 'erase data thoroughly' option. But when I go into the file explorer area, I'm still seeing some files with shortcut arrows on them, that's what I was trying to get rid of..I wanted my tablet
 to be in a 'like new' state. Some how..windows doesn't delete everything like it's supposed to, for instance..in the internet explorer browser when I click on the bookmark's star, all of my saved bookmarks are STILL available. I still think this is due at
 least in part to skydrive. I'm really getting frustrated now.</div>

            Hi David,<br />
<br />
Yes, your assumptions might be correct. The synced files or the personal files that are stored under SkyDrive are to be deleted from SkyDrive settings. All you have to do is visit
<a href="http://skydrive.live.com/win8personalsettingsprivacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://skydrive.live.com/win8personalsettingsprivacy</a> and you will be presented with the screen:<br />

<br />
Now before you go and click the “<b>Remove</b>” button, you do have to first turn off syncing on each Windows 8/RT PCs that are connected to your Microsoft account, refer to the link to turn off Sync settings on all the connected devices with your account:<br />

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">So basically your PC creates a separate LAN&nbsp;using Wi-Fi direct&nbsp;beside your LAN that is connected through the router or switch. You then have two LAN&nbsp;networks that are completely separate from each other.
 The network your router is the host and your network in which the PC, in this case,&nbsp;is the host and the two networks don't know about each other.</span></p>

http://www.samsung.com/in/support/model/GT-S5620DKAIRD</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Toward the bottom is a pc sync. I believe that will help you sync your data. The main reason to use wifi direct is in a situation where there is not host network to use to facilitate a link between the two devices. You may need to right click the setup file
 choose properties &gt; compatibility tab &gt; choose run in compatibility mode &gt; windows 7 &gt; select run as admin at the bottom of the properties sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the pc sync from Samsung doesn't work or you need a peer to peer network there is another way to do it using an ad-hoc network, but that feature was removed or hidden well from windows 8, probably because of the wifi direct addition. I have heard people
 still able to create an ad-hoc network in 8.</p>
