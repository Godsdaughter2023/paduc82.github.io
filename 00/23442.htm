    <title>Cell reference problem using Subtotal function in Excel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cell reference problem using Subtotal function in Excel</h2>
                    In Sheet 1 of a workbook, I reference the values of cells in Sheet 2 that contain subtotals of data in the rows of Sheet 2 (e.g. =Sheet2!F6). When I insert a row of data in Sheet 2 (which moves the locations of everything below it down one row) and recalculate
 the subtotals, the cell references in Sheet 1 get broken. I have to go back and edit the cell references in Sheet 1 one-by-one to re-establish links to the correct subtotal cells. Why are the cell references in Sheet 1 getting broken? Is there a way to make
 additions to Sheet 2, and re-calc subtotals without losing the correct cell associations in Sheet 1?

<p>Don't use links to the cells. Instead, either:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Remove the Subtotals and create a pivot table based on your data set and the subtotals will be properly shown no matter what you do to the source data - well, within reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Use the Subtotals but collapse the data to show just the subtotals, and don't use a second sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Use a formula like</p>
<p>
</p><p>=VLOOKUP("East Region Total",Sheet1!A:B,2,FALSE)</p>
<p>
</p><p>replacing the "East Region Total" with a cell reference or a hard-coded string that will find the subtotal of interest.</p>

            Tables of one way of addressing the additional data, but an easier and more foolproof way (tables are good but are not entirely errorless) is to use entire columns as your data source rather than specific rows within the columns.

<h2>            Problem with tables in Word 2010 - slow editing</h2>
                    <p>We use Word2010 and Windows 7, and have an annoying problem in Word documents that have tables.</p>
<p>Editing a document becomes extremely slow, adding or deleting a single character takes a few seconds, saving the file (if it works at all) takes minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no problems with documents that only have a few pages, but it starts to become an issue with documents that have a large number of pages and have one or more tables. Unfortunately that type of document is the most common here...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, we have figured out that the problem is more or less solved when autosave is deactivated, but that hardly seems a real solution to me...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody else had the same problems, and found a way to solve this?<br />

<p>In general rows don't span multiple pages. We don not seem to have issues with all of the files that contain tables; I have checked on a document that does have the problem and indeed there are a few rows that span multiple pages.</p>
<p>So we will check if this has an effect.</p>

<p>We have had this issue for quite some time (since going to Word2010).</p>
<p>There are no error messages when editing the documents (just "Word doesn't respond").</p>
<p>
</p><p>On opening the documents, everything goes fine, until the first autosave happens. After that, editing and saving the file gets extremely slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no problems in the save mode (but autosave is automatically turned off there?)</p>

<p>Why you guys have not added S60v3 FP2 phones in the compatibilty list of Free Nokia Maps v3.03, 3.04, 3.06 anyone while they are supported by other cheap phones like Nokia 2710 Navigation, Nokia 5230 xpress music edition then why have you not provided free
 maps to N79, N78, &amp; many other Nokia FP2 phones....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier I got a reply from your maps team that maps for other FP2 phones will be added soon but it's almost one year since you have launched this free maps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IF it's not available now then plz tell all of us clearly whether they are in coming version like 3.08 or something like that or not. You have told in the newspaper &amp; advertisement that Nokia Maps free forever for your device but we still have to pay for
 the licence....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, Nokia Ovi maps team, plz tell us clearly....</p>

<p>There are two differnet types for Maps app with free navigation, one installable on S60 models and one built-in to some S40 models. In the case of S60 models, the free navigation was introduced as part of Maps 3.03, which was a new app which wasn't able
 to be compatible with all models because it needed software updates, those models that had already ended production and were not being updated any more could therefore never get the free navigation - my N96 was one of the unfortunate ones, too. Some models
 were added after the initial launch, but not very many.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will also note that compatibility with S60 3rd Edition ends with Maps 3.04, Maps 3.06 is only available for S60 5th Edition and S^3 phones, again for compatibility reasons.</p>

            I know that buddy but Nokia has updated the firmware of Nokia N79 after they had launched free Nokia maps still they did not merge that upgradation into that...<br />
<br />
Even Nokia N86 production has been stopped but still they have added it into the compatibility list....<br />

I just want that let's make it big guys for Nokia to have a look &amp; give free maps to N79, N82, N78 , N96 &amp; other phones....because that's what there maps tagline says.<br />

<p>Cost for me in North America for navigation for my N79 is US$ 15 per year, which is trivial.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I'm more concerned that the map data is accurate.</strong></p>
<p>Based on what happens when I run the Nokia Map Loader, it appears that the map data
<strong>are</strong> being continually updated, so I think that the maps are the same as those used in Nokia Maps 3.03 and newer.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I know how to find the maps version on my mobile (00.01.25.114) but do you know where to find the current version of the maps on the server ??</p>

<p>Unfortunately connecting up to OVI Suite &gt; Maps is currently the only method of checking current map set for the older versions of OVI Maps pre-v3.06, whereas in the most recent v3.06 there is an "Update" icon within the device application for checking such.</p>

    <title>Large Percentage of my Contacts in Outlook Office 365 just Disappeared - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul sorauer &#40;paul&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Large Percentage of my Contacts in Outlook Office 365 just Disappeared after Switching to &#39;New&#39; Outlook Experience</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, what else can I say? A whole bunch of my contacts from Outlook 365 just disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know these contacts were on Outlook as I recently (last 6 months) migrated from Windows Phone to Android and simply used the Android Outlook app to connect to my Exchange account and sync mail and contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then yesterday morning I noticed that the names were missing from my SMS's in the Messages app. I simply presumed that it was a sync issue and so in a misguided attempt to reset and resync, I deleted all my contacts from the phone, removed all my accounts,
 and re-added them. I guess it didn't make much difference to have deleted the contacts as the missing ones were already deleted anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon seeing that I was still missing a bunch of contacts, I've since gone into Outlook OWA online and looked through my Contacts and discovered that the contacts in question are indeed gone. They're simply just not there. So there's no problem with the sync
 - it's working just fine. It appears that MSFT has simply lost a bunch of my data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess it reinforces that it doesn't matter if you're data is on enterprise cloud or not, you should always frequently make your own backups. It just disappointing as I've been using Office 365 online for many years now, never had an issue and
<strong>trusted </strong>that my data was safe. But I've been an IT professional for nearly 20 years now, so I ought to know better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anecdotally, this has happened immediately after I switched to the 'new' Outlook experience - I switched late on Monday night and then I saw my contacts missing on Tuesday morning... I'm not saying it's connected necessarily, but it's damn suspicious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, firstly I think MSFT need to know this is happening, even if it's an isolated case. Secondly, if there's a MSFT techie around that can help understand the issue and even recover the lost data it would be great - though I suspect it'll need a very
 experienced support technician as opposed to Level 1 support (hint).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul</p>

<p><span>Hello Paul,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Many thanks for your detailed description. Based on my knowledge, Office 365 doesn’t automatically delete user’s data which located in Exchange server. I understand that a bunch of your contacts were disappeared
 on OWA and your phone, since OWA syncs with Exchange server directly, I suggest we troubleshoot this situation from OWA first which can exclude interference on the phone. To check if it exists in your mailbox, you can type one of the missing contacts in search
 box see if there is a return result.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, if you deleted those contacts accidentally, it won’t show in your contact list as well. I would suggest you check your Deleted folder see if those contacts are there (the path is
<strong>Contacts</strong> &gt; <strong>Deleted</strong>, see the below screenshot).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3a65ba1a-ee23-4bea-9f35-4e2b20ac693a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3a65ba1a-ee23-4bea-9f35-4e2b20ac693a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If so, you can recover those items from Deleted folder. For more information about Recover deleted email messages on OWA, you can refer to:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/recover-deleted-email-messages-in-outlook-on-the-web-a8ca78ac-4721-4066-95dd-571842e9fb11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Recover deleted email messages in Outlook on the web.</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you haven’t found that information in your whole mailbox, to help us narrow down your symptom, I need to collect some additional information for further analysis:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. You mentioned that a bunch of you contacts were missing, may I know if there is some difference between these missing contacts and contacts that have not disappeared? For example, were those contacts created
 by your phone? </span></p>
<p><span>2. Are these contacts shared contacts or normal contacts?
</span></p>
<p><span>3. For “the 'new' Outlook experience”, did you mean the
<strong>new Outlook</strong> button (see the following screenshot) on OWA? </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e40fefb6-c6b5-4726-90bb-049a602db13c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e40fefb6-c6b5-4726-90bb-049a602db13c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We truly appreciate your cooperation to help us troubleshoot this symptom. I am looking forward to your reply.</span></p>
<p>

<p>Hi Sylvie</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your assistance on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I had already looked at the Delete folder but there's nothing there - as I would have expected as I hadn't deleted any contacts, either via my Outlook application, OWA or in my phone's contact list. One day they were there, the next they were not, and
 the only interactions I had with the Office 365 service were:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Performing 'normal' background syncs via the phone and the Mail app on Windows 10</li><li>Sending email via the Outlook app o the phone</li><li>Logging in to OWA to send an email (at which point I also opted in to the 'new' Outlook experience (see below)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your specific questions:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>From the distribution of remaining contacts, it appears as though the <strong>
majority </strong>of missing contacts were those with a first name starting between A through I - though of course it's hard to tell without performing a reconciliation which I'm unable to do since I don't have an exhaustive list.
<ol>
<li>I do have a few remaining contacts with a first name starting between A - I, but of those 14 that remain, the majority were recently created but some were created 12 - 24 months ago... I would think that they were all created on my phone, as would most
 of the contacts that are now missing.</li><li>From a quick look through my SMS history I can see that I am also missing some contacts with first names that start with: J, N, T, W - though that's likely not all.</li></ol>
</li><li>They are all 'normal' contacts (not shared, as in not in the global address book)</li><li>Yes</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul</p>

<p><span>Hi Sylvie</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Further to my last, I've managed to dig out an old PC and extract the contacts from my Outlook desktop app that was last synced on 20th October 2018. It's not ideal of course, but at least I can get the majority of
 my missing contacts back.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
So, bearing that in mind:<br />
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>I'll let you investigate whatever you still need to overnight, in order to track down what the cause may be;</span></li><li><span>Unless I hear (a compelling reason) otherwise by say midday tomorrow my time (Sydney, Australia GMT+10), I'll have no choice but to import the missing contacts as this issue is currently impacting my ability to perform
 required business functions (e.g. I need to contact people that are no longer in my contact list)</span></li><li><span>Whether or not I hear back by midday tomorrow, I would still rather value an explanation as to how / why the contacts were lost in the first place - I'm paying for a enterprise grade business service&nbsp;and I don't expect
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hello Paul,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Many thanks for your updates. I am glad to hear that you found your contacts on your old PC so that you can import those contacts to Outlook to prevent data loss. I can see this caused many inconveniences
 to you. I totally understand your concern and want to know the root cause of this symptom.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since this problem happened on OWA, as you mentioned before, the contacts just disappeared after switching to 'New' Outlook. Generally, the log on OWA requires tool to logging and need to be opened in real
 time. Besides, we need customer to reproduce this symptom so that we can gather enough logs and details to investigate further. We also need to test on our side to make sure that this situation can be reproduced and check the log records to find the root cause.
 We are glad to try our best to help you find the root cause if we can.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Your situation is accidental and isolated, there is no log that recorded your OWA settings in that time (as I mentioned before, you need to turn on the log first in real time). Furthermore, this is about data
 loss problem which is what we care most about. We prefer to not let you take the risk of reproduce such problem to provide logs to us. Your understanding is much appreciated.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Besides, to prevent data from being loss again, as a workaround, we suggest you back up your data in a timely manner. You can export your Outlook items (such as email, contacts and calendars) to Outlook .pst
 file. For more details about back up Outlook items, here for your reference:</span></p>

</p><p><span>I understand this may not be the best solution for you. We are doing our best to protect user’s data and improve our features for a richer user experience. We truly appreciate your understanding and cooperation.</span></p>

<p>You have 2 alternatives. You can buy Outlook as a standalone application, or buy Office Home and Business.</p>
<p>The tricky part is that 2007 is not "officially" for sale any more. So if you must have 2007 Outlook, you will have to find "old" stock.</p>

<span><span><span>I Need Installation files/CD for pre 2007 version of Office, What Can I Do</span></span></span>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Find
 a friend (new or old) who has 2003 Pro and is willing to lend you the CD. Unlike the very "old" DOS days when there was a signature file on the floppy, there is nothing unique on the CD to identify it. The uniqueness is provided via the Product key you use
 to activate it. So, you can borrow a CD without threatening their installation/activation.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Ask at
 work if they have CD you can borrow</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Try to
 find a local "PC Computer Club". There is almost certainly a geek or three with disks you could borrow.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Find
 a small local computer store or repair business. They often have old versions of software because they are still supporting customers using them.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Try getting one from MS (if it works, please post back here, there are many interested people who would like to know that MS is still providing
 that kind of support)</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/326246/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/326246/</span></span></a></span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span>

<h2>            PC Suite and Bluetoothe can reduce you to tears</h2>
                    Am I alone in finding that PC Suite is simply not capable of managing Bluetooth Connections properly.<br />
<br />
I have just spent two hours of my valuable Sunday trying to set up a link between Outloo, PC Suite and my phone. The link drops all the time, re-com=nnection using the PC Suite functionality times out before passkeys are exchanged, Synchronisation drops out
 because the link falls away. ... etc<br />
<br />
Rather that throw the phone out of the window I an going to sit in the cupboard under thst stairs with my thumb in my mouth and just sob quietly for a while.<br />
<br />
... and another thing. If they are going to have different versions for different phoes, why in god's name can they not allow co-residence on one PC. How hard can it be!!!

            Nokia PC Suite works with most Nokia phones, so you only need 1 to be installed.<br />
(well, not entirely 100% rule since old phones like 6600 require a separate Suite but for most phones, the newest Nokia PC Suite is the solution.<br />
If you need help with Bluetooth, give us some details about the Suite, PC and phone.

                    <p>Hi There; Well one issue solved an now a new one pops up :-) lol</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've made a combo box where I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;type in the&nbsp;product code and 2 other fields will auto populate. Auto expand is set to yes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the drop down arrow it shows the list of products. However I can't type in the product code - it won't show the code or enter info into the other fields. It works fine if I select from the dropdown list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've made a combo box on another db and it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance&nbsp;for simplistic instructions :-)</p>

            Ahh that's easy. You don't! As a general rule we don't store calculated values. So its fine to use the expression as the controlsource of a control on your form or use it in a query. But the value shouldn't be stored in a table.

            If you are inserting the PipeSize and NominalDensity into columns in a referencing table then you are introducing redundancy, which means the table is not normalized to Third Normal Form (3NF)&nbsp; and consequently at risk of update anomalies.&nbsp; The referencing
 table should contain only the foreign key column ProductCode.<br />
<br />
The PipeSize and NominalDensity values can be shown in unbound text box controls in the form, with ControlSource properties of:<br />
<br />
=cboProductCode.Column(1)<br />
and<br />
=cboProductCode.Column(2)<br />
<br />
The Column property is zero-based, so Column(1) is the second column, and so on.<br />
<br />
The removal of these columns from the referencing table would of course rule out the use of a calculated column based on one of those columns.&nbsp; The calculation can be done in an unbound computed control in the form, however, or in a computed&nbsp; column in the
 form's RecordSource query.&nbsp; Calculated columns in tables serve no useful purpose; the place for such computation is in a query or in a control in a form or report.<br />
<br />
You say that <em>'Some of the product sizes are listed with no product codes'</em>.&nbsp; How can that be the case?&nbsp; From the information that you have provided ProductCode, as the combo box's BoundColumn, must be a candidate key of the Pipe Product Codes table.&nbsp;
 A candidate key cannot be NULL.<br />

 When I click OK on that, it comes up with a new box which says "Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook Window. The set of folders cannot be opened. " it then lists a directory place on my computer under Microsoft/Outlook and says that a file
 named "2015falkb3", the username for my school email is not n outlook file (.ost). Outlook then closes, and whenever I try to reopen it, the same thing happens. What should I do?</p>

            It appears that another member of the recipients' organization was cc'ed and replied. I can only assume that whatever issue that caused the error was on their end. Thank you for your prompt response and follow up! Much appreciated.

<h2>            Excel file is grey when open from sharepoint online</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>when open excel file (which contains data connection to our on premise server) from SharePoint&nbsp;Online,&nbsp;it is grey and empty. All menus are greyed out as well, so not possible to do anything.</p>
<p>If we save the file on the desktop it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are on version 16.0.7301.1021. This have worked before, but stopped working lately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What we tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run repair</p>
<p>Re-installed office</p>
<p>Added site to trusted sites in IE</p>
<p>Added to trusted sites in Excel</p>
<p>File-options-advanced-general- ignore other applications that use DDE is not checked.</p>
<p>Same if use Firefox, Chrome, IE or Edge</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this known issue and are there other workarounds than saving the file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

                    &lt;p&gt;suggestion: when you select text and gives us the option to copy would also be a good idea to give us the option of taking advantage of the awesome tool to translate bing (more options could still occur , for example bing search , share, etc)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;bye,
 thanks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;saludos desde Uruguay&lt;/p&gt;

            That's a good idea but the bit saying about searching copied text, if you highlight some text and press copy, if you immediately press the search button then it will search what's been copied without needing to paste.

<p>Sometimes the temperature of my Lumia 920 will get so hot that the SIM card will stop registering. This results in the phone throwing up a SIM error.</p>

            what usage patterns of your phone? if it is heating up unnecessarily in daily use, with apps such as HERE Drive+, Here Maps, and Games shut down, then sounds like something is wrong hardware-wise. to be on the safe side, i would check that battey draining
 processes such as Location in the Settings, and Tap + Send are turned off, and that you have the Portico update for WP8 downloaded and installed, by chjecking Settings &gt; Phone Update. also ensure that you are fully up to date with all the latest Nokia system
 app updates in the STore.<br />
<br />
failing that, you can try performing a soft reset (pressing the voluime down and power buttons together until the phone vibrates), or if that doesn't work, then a hard reset (Settings &gt; About &gt; Reset your phone). please bear in mind that this wipes everything,
 so you will need to make a backup of personal data to PC and/or online storage first.<br />
<br />
failing that, need to take your phoen to Nokia Care for inspeciton: <a href="http://nokia.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Critical problem - cannot edit my own meeting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rpmm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Critical problem - cannot edit my own meeting</h2>
                    
<p>I recently tried to get Google Calendar sync working to be able to see my Exchange/Outlook calendar on Google Calendar. It worked ok but I just realized that *some* of my meetings have been modified very badly.</p>
<p>I have since uninstalled the sync program, but I am looking for help in how to restore my calendar. Here is what is happening - I can see my meetings but it shows*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (my email address at work) as the organizer
 and yet, the only actions I can take are respond to the meeting. So it behaves like I am the meeting invitee and not the organizer even though in "Meeting Organizer" it shows my work email address. In addition, I see that it added my gmail address as an invitee.</p>
<p>Is there a way to undo this issue? Is there a way to rectify existing meetings? Can an administrator do that? If admin can do it, I can request my IT to fix it for me.</p>

<h3> holdstock  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can intra-spreadsheet hyperlinks update automatically&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a spreadsheet that has hyperlinks on tab 1 that point to tab 2.&nbsp; If I insert or delete rows on tab 2, the hyperlinks on tab 1 don't update.&nbsp; Now, formulas on tab 1 that point to tab 2 automatically update under the same circumstances, of course,&nbsp;but
 the hyperlinks don't.&nbsp; Is this normal behaviour or am I missing something?&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm trying to avoid the "use labels" route because in reality I have hundreds of hyperlinks on tab 1 that point to hundreds of corresponding items on multiple tabs (not just a single Tab 2).&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Okay, this works but only to a certain extent.&nbsp; I know I'm missing something but I'm not sure what.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used your formula and it works great in that the cell updates with the new address, but when i click the link I still go to the old address.&nbsp; I've tried saving and reopening, but I still end up jumping to the old cell address.&nbsp; I'm guessing I need to manually
 update something but I'm not sure what.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Curiously, when I highlight the cell, I can see the updated address in the bar.&nbsp; When I right-click and choose Edit Hyperlink, however, it still shows the old address.</p>

            Re:&nbsp; relative hyperlink only gets 2 stars<br />
<br />
I tried the formula as a brand new entry and also by modifying an existing cell reference.<br />
Whan the hyperlink is clicked it goes to the "new" location.<br />
<br />
Maybe?...<br />
Do not use Insert Hyperlink, just enter the formula in a cell<br />
Also, "address" is entered as "address" not as a cell reference.<br />

            <p>Jim, I can't explain it but I cleared the cell and tried again and it worked.&nbsp; One thing that stood out to me was that after entering the formula manually the first time, I then right-clicked/Edit Hyperlink to&nbsp;change the label.&nbsp; Then I tried to Insert/Delete
 on tab2 and the whole relative operation&nbsp;failed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So entering the formula manually and then editing the hyperlink via the GUI seems to break the operation somehow.&nbsp; I'm not sure how or why but I'll try to work with that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help!&nbsp; This should save me an extraordinary amount of work in the future.</p>

            <p>I used James Cone's suggestion myself recently, replacing a bunch of entries that had been typed in and set up using the "Insert Hyperlink" function.&nbsp; Initially after setting up the formula, the cell still went to the original hyperlinked location (which
 in this case didn't exist since the sheet had been renamed already).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went into the Visual Basic Editor and, with that sheet still selected, entered</p>
<p>ActiveSheet.Hyperlinks.Delete [Enter]</p>
<p>into the Immediate window.</p>
<p>That&nbsp;got rid of the left-over hyperlinks and let the ones I'd set up using James Cone's suggestion in place and working properly.</p>

<h2>            Interop.Powerpoint - save image from shape in C&#35;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have the following issue - I am using Microsoft.Office.Interop.Powerpoint to obtain information about a PPTX file. I am getting all the required information regarding text shapes - size, width, height, position, content, etc. However when I have a shape
 with an image inside I cannot get the content - I need it either as a byte array or as a Bitmap in order to save it. Powerpoint supports it and I can right click and save the image, however I cannot get access to the image programmatically. Please assist and
 advise whether this is possible at all, or whether I should looking into OOXML further, because I believe it can take care of this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance.</div>

            Try copying the image to the clipboard and then examine the clipboard contents. &nbsp;PPT generally puts the image up there in several formats; one or more of them should be useful.

<h2>            Why does MS Outlook keep locking me out of my email accounts&#63;</h2>
                    I've had&nbsp;3 original Outlook.com accounts with you (NOT 365) Get this understood I DO NOT OWN OR HAVE ACCESS TO A CELL PHONE. For some S.O.B. reason you have Temporarily Suspended my second email account with you. The way it was set up I couldn't even SEND
 emails from my account (cant do a phone verification for account authentication). Why oh gosh damn why have you done this again? You did the same thing to my first account with you which lasted about 4 weeks and you TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED it. I posted on this
 community about that and the third party advisor on here told me not to worry just set up an extra Outlook.com account so if I should get locked out again I could receive a verification code at my extra email address. I try to sign in to my now regular outlook.com
 account this afternoon which up till this week was working satisfactory and I get this TEMPORARILY SUSPENDED notice again. Third party advisor GET THIS, I DO NOT OWN A CELL PHONE, I CANNOT BORROW SOMEONES PHONE TO DO

            Microsoft gives Windows Home licenses away free to OEM's making the cheap tablets.&nbsp; It is called "Windows with Bing."&nbsp; The OEMs simply have to promise to set Bing as the default search engine.&nbsp; Windows Lean would very likely be the same.

                    Hey, Cortana has apparently learned where I live and where I work and when I usually leave for work and leave for home.&nbsp; She has started reminding me when I should leave.&nbsp; I think that's super cool, but I'd like to know how to toggle that feature on and
 off but can't find it.&nbsp; Can anyone advise how I can turn off these automatically generated reminders?

            <p>There is no on and off switch. Most&nbsp;spend time trying to get it to work.</p>
<p>Here are those suggestions to get it to work. Try changing one of those to make it stop.</p>

    <title>Downloaded music on lumina 650 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Downloaded music on lumina 650</h2>
                    Hello there, when I download music to my "new" Lumina 650 it appears in the music file that's in storage on the device&nbsp;and can be accessed and&nbsp;played. But when I go to use&nbsp;the same&nbsp;song as an alarm ringtone, when I access the same music file through the
 "Alarms &amp; Clock" app&nbsp;to select the song I want, I get the music/band/album file&nbsp;but there's&nbsp;no song in the album file. How is this possible when the song is already proven to be in that file,&nbsp;and what can I do? Thanks, Robert.

            use a ringtone maker app to create ringtones from your music.

                    <p>We need to use the publish to SharePoint feature only available in Professional.</p>
<p>But i can't find anywhere to buy a upgrade from Standard 2010 to Professional2010 and i cant justify buying a new professional copy and leaving the standard doing nothing.</p>

            I don't know specifically that it applies, but this is worth a try. Take a look at the "Anytime Upgrade" tool. Anytime Upgrade allows people to "upgrade" Office 2010, say from "Home and Student" to "Home and Business" or to "Office Pro". If you are lucky
 the same will apply to Project.<br />
<br />
<b>Use Upgrade Anytime Option to upgrade from one Office 2010 bundle to another</b>
<p><span>Here is the new and improved solution (much better than our previous advice) to your problem, direct from MS Customer Service.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you don’t like the cost of the upgrade</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p>Dear Charlie,</p>
<p>Warm greetings from Microsoft Customer Service Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Based on our recent phone conversation, here's the step by step instruction of upgrading the Office Home and Business 2010 to Office Professional 2010.</p>
<p>Click the start button</p>
<p>Click all programs</p>
<p>Click the Microsoft Office folder</p>
<p>Click the Microsoft Office 2010 tools folder</p>
<p>Click on office anytime upgrade</p>
<p>You'd be routed to a new window so click the "buy Microsoft Professional 2010 link</p>
<p>You'd be routed to another window, just click on the "upgrade now" link for $220.
</p>
<p>Just follow the prompts and you should be good to go.</p>
<p>I hope I was able to address your inquiry to your satisfaction, should you have further questions, relating to this inquiry, please don't hesitate to contact us back.</p>
<p>Australia: 13 20 58 Option 2</p>
<p>New Zealand: 0800 800 004 Option 2</p>
<p>Business Hours is Monday to Friday - 8:00 am to 8:00 pm Sydney time and 8:00 am to 6:00 pm New Zealand time.
</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and have a great day ahead!</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p><b>Carol</b></p>
<p><b>MicrosoftCustomer ServiceAustralia and New Zealand</b></p>

<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<br />
<br />
If Anytime Upgrade doesn't apply, as long as you have the "retail" / "FPP" license for Standard you can resell it to someone else, say a student at a local college or university?<br />
