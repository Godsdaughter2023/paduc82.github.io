<p>THIS IS DEFINITELY A PROBLEM THAT MICROSOFT NEEDS TO FIX, as there is no other place to check the number of items scanned..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MPDetection....txt and MPLog....txt files under C:/ProgramData/Microsoft/MicrosoftAntimalware/Suuport do NOT provide this information
 and probably should, as does all or most other virus scan software do in their log files.&nbsp;

            <p>Why is this so critical, in other words, what true value is knowing the number of files scanned providing to your protection?&nbsp; I'm not telling you it's not, I'd simply like to understand why knowing the number of total files scanned is perceived as providing
 any sort of security improvement?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was curious enough about the apparent inconsistency of these reports that I performed a few tests using the Quick scan, since these could be done much more quickly and both these and Full scans appear to be similarly affected.&nbsp; I thought I'd picked up
 a pattern, but then it changed again and so I'm not certain, but it at first appeared that the numbers might not be displayed if they didn't change between 2 scans.&nbsp; However, this also wouldn't explain an instance of this occurring immediately after a fresh
 install which just recently happened to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though I have seen these occur on occasion, they are rare on my own systems and so difficult to detect what's causing them.&nbsp; This seems to point to an intermittent cause and so may be difficult to pin down.</p>

            I don't disagree that there's an issue with the item count and the progress bar -- confusion surrounding it. I do believe that the progress bar should present progress reasonably well, though all progress bars are approximations for any program using them,
 hence the oddball behavior observed at time. The count issue could be an indication of a deeper problem.
<div><br />
<div>However, the thing to consider is that a scan -- any scan -- is after the fact. What is most critical is real time protection and monitoring of activity that might be suspicious. Things found in a scan are rarely active infections. They are typically dormant
 in saved files that were not detected when originally encountered and an updated definition set now recognizes the infection. Real time protection would then also recognize the infection on access.</div>
<div><br />
<div>A full scan does scan all files. A quick scan only scans the likely locations for infection and a custom scan is user defined. It is my understanding that a full scan will not scan inside compressed files/archives that have been previously scanned if the
 footprint (hash) of the file is known by MSE from a prior scan. So, let's say an archive contains 1,000 files. On the first encounter of this archive during a full scan, everything inside the archive is scanned and the container file is catalogued by MSE with
 a hash. On a subsequent scan, there is no need to scan deeply into the archive as long as the hash is intact.</div>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general I agree with Steve and note that if there were any malware found by either type of scan, the display would by entirely red and indicate there were infections found to deal with, regardless of the other items displayed within the GUI. However,
 the specific items that you've indicated do deserve, and I now appear to have at least partial answers to both.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) This apparent&nbsp;issue is actually well known and understood, it simply isn't being recognized here because you've linked it to the Scan completed isuue, which is entirely separate.&nbsp; The 25,000 items you commonly scan are the number that MSE will scan after
 either a system restart or disabling real-time protection, while the 4,000 items will be scanned each time between these occurrances.&nbsp; In my case the larger number is ~70,000 and the smaller ~13,000, so you've likely got very few or very simple applications
 installed, while I have Office Pro+&nbsp;and a handful of relatively large applications.</p>
<p>This difference is caused by the scan caching that MSE performs which allows it to 'skip' most files during a subsequent Quick scan until Real-time protection is disabled, which causes this cache to be reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) This is an extension of your original concern and is the core of the problem caused by the lack of a Scan completed message, while the numbers themselves are basically meaningless, patially for the reason I just mentioned above.&nbsp; The real problem isn't
 the numbers, it's that the entire message is missing including the second line which states that "No threats were detected on your PC during this scan", but no one has even mentioned this so the answers are focused on the numbers rather than the
<u>real</u> propblem.</p>
<p>So now to try and partially address this display issue I performed a few (actually dozens) more Quick scan tests.&nbsp; Though still not 100% consistent I've found something repeatable enough that it should be able to be tested by others and hopefully continued
 to find the true cause and fix.</p>
<p>First, try running a Quick scan and then immediately minimize the MSE GUI until the scan completes.&nbsp; I found that this nearly always resulted in the missing Scan completed message and also indicates that the core issue is somehow related to the GUI display
 itself, which makes sense.</p>
<p>Then try running the same Quick scan with the GUI open, but move the mouse around a bit at first to insure there is some activity within the GUI application window.&nbsp; Though a bit&nbsp;less consistent, this almost always resulted in the Scan completed message
 being displayed for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though the above needs more testing to determine exactly what and when the ciritical timing occurs which allows the message to display, it clearly points to a strange GUI issue where an inactive (not just out of focus) application window during some critical
 moment is suppressing the message display.&nbsp; I also determined this critical moment is near the end of the scan by opening the minimized window in the last 10 seconds or so, which generally dsiplayed the message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I've tired of testing, I'll leave the refinement of this to others.&nbsp; However, it seems to me that the display of any numbers here is only adding to confusion for many and it might be best to remove these completely from the final screen, leaving only
 the Scan completed and second line as these are the true important results of the scan.</p>

            <p>Rob, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were previous&nbsp;threads about this same problem, but they are all marked "answered" when in fact, this problem still exists.&nbsp; It appears that the community moderators have acknowlegded this problem, but indicate that it is only happening to some people
 and also, happening inconsistently.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Having been a super programmer in another lifetime, that to me indicates the problem to more likely be caused&nbsp;by hacker(s) than a bug in the software.&nbsp; However, the latter is still a possible cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why are you trying to convince everyone that the display of the total number of items scanned is unimportant?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MSE has always displayed this all important count at the end of every scan,&nbsp;until the last&nbsp;software update KB2691905.&nbsp; Also, to the best of my
 knowledge, every virus scan software product on the market displays this count.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In regards to your two points: </p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&nbsp; 1) This apparent&nbsp;issue is actually well known and understood, it simply isn't being recognized here because you've linked it to the Scan completed isuue, which is entirely separate.&nbsp; The 25,000 items you commonly scan are the number that MSE will scan
 after either a system restart or disabling real-time protection, while the 4,000 items will be scanned each time between these occurrances.&nbsp; In my case the larger number is ~70,000 and the smaller ~13,000, so you've likely got very few or very simple applications
 installed, while I have Office Pro+&nbsp;and a handful of relatively large applications.</p>
<p>This difference is caused by the scan caching that MSE performs which allows it to 'skip' most files during a subsequent Quick scan until Real-time protection is disabled, which causes this cache to be reset. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>My QUICK SCAN usually scans about 25,000 items.&nbsp; When it starts to scan fewer, it is usually about 6,300 items, but&nbsp;the GREEN LIGHT INDICATOR does move all the way to the end.&nbsp; Now, I am not concerned with this symptom, which I did initially report in a
 separate thread.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when the QUICK SCAN only scans 4,000&nbsp;items -and- the GREEN LIGHT INDICATOR moves only about one-third the way across the bar -and- the scan ends abruptly without&nbsp;displaying the total number of items scanned, something is wrong!&nbsp; I have seen this
 happen intermittently at least 3 times over the past 2 weeks.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; ....&nbsp; Though the above needs more testing to determine exactly what and when the ciritical timing occurs which allows the message to display, it clearly points to a strange GUI issue where an inactive (not just out of focus) application window during
 some critical moment is suppressing the message display.&nbsp; I also determined this critical moment is near the end of the scan by opening the minimized window in the last 10 seconds or so, which generally dsiplayed the message.&nbsp; .... &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought about the GUI myself.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the GUI has nothing to do with this problem.&nbsp; Remember that nobody had this problem until the last MSE software update KB2691905.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the first things that I did weeks ago, was turn off my screen saver as well as power saving options.&nbsp; Then, I&nbsp;watched&nbsp;entire scans run without anything else happening.&nbsp; That is how I noticed&nbsp;the scans&nbsp;that ended abruptly. &nbsp;

            <p>1) Yes, you apparently have a deeper problem on that system and one that I've not heard of before.&nbsp; Though it might be malware I'd think that if it was the scan would either never complete or in fact never even run, since that's what we've most often seen
 when malware is the cause.&nbsp; Either way you'll need to do more trouble-shooting to determine and resolve the true issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Yes, it's the new MSE v4.0 that kicked off the display issue, but that's been known since it released.&nbsp; What no one could determine is what was causing it, since no one could repeat this successfully on systems like mine that rarely had the issue if ever.&nbsp;
 The difference now is that I've provided a method by which anyone should be able to repeat the issue, so hopefully those in development can now see the symptom and determine the true cause.</p>
<p>I never stated that my discovery was the cause of the problem, only that the key symptom that so few have been complaining about has not had a potential&nbsp;explanation until now.</p>

            I'm in agreement with Rob on #2 and not so sure about #1. However, in your other discussion, I advised you to run the McAfee removal tool. I wonder if that will help with #1.
<div><br />
<div>For #2, I also ran a number of tests.</div>
<div>I plan to repeat the test on my XP netbook when I get a chance. That's the machine that also exhibits the ghost image of the MSE user interface even after it is closed until I refresh the desktop, so it will probably exhibit the issues Rob found in his
 testing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>On 2 machines with Windows 7 and dedicated graphics adapters I am unable to repro the problem. All variations of quick scans return the results of the scan -- count and "all clean" message.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will share all of these finding with my contact on the MSE team and hopefully it can be addressed as it surely appears to be a graphics resource issue.</div>

            <p>2) To provide better information related to the testing I did, these Quick scans were performed on a 5-year old Dell Inspiron laptop w/4GB RAM &amp; Win7 Pro.&nbsp; There are typically several application windows open,&nbsp;with most other than Outlook 2010&nbsp;minimized
 to the task bar as was true during the tests yesterday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The age of this laptop and the fact that it's resource limited, as well as the OP having indicated he's using a netbook makes it likely that these issues are either resource or driver related.&nbsp; Something isn't allowing the final screen to update properly
 at scan completion, since otherwise my own system has actually completed all of&nbsp;the scans, as confirmed by reviewing the System Event log entries for Microsoft Antimalware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WizardJohn may also want to check these System Event entries after running a few scans to see whether the results for those scans that seem to abort at about 4,000 items indicate anything different.</p>

    <title>&#38;quot&#59;Nokia Connection Manager&#38;quot&#59; missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adam_00  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#38;quot&#59;Nokia Connection Manager&#38;quot&#59;  missing &#38;quot&#59;Bluetooth &#40;Toshiba&#41;&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    I have just reinstalled my whole windows, and after installing the latest Nokia PC Suite ver. 6.83.14.1, I can not connect to my Nokia phone using the connection manager. In my previous windows setup it worked fine, therefore I know that it is not a hardware
 problem.<br />
<br />
The difference between my previous setup an now is that when I open up the Nokia Connection Manager, there is only one type of Bluetooth connection, namely "Bluetooth (Microsoft)". In the previous version, there were two, the Microsoft one and "Bluetooth (Toshiba)".
 Of these two, only Bluetooth (Toshiba) worked.<br />
<br />
How can I get the Bluetooth Toshiba on this list? where does the Manager get the information from to generate this list?<br />
<br />
I know that the actual connection between the pc and phone works, as I can send files to my phone using the wireless file transfer program that come with my Fujitsu laptop, so it is not a BT Stack issue, but some other problem of Nokia Connection Manager not
 recognizing the Toshiba Stack.<br />
<br />
Any help is VERY welcome. Thanks,<br />
Adam

I think that 4.0 is first supported Toshiba stack but I recommend you to update your Toshiba BT stack to newest version (5.10).<br />
<br />
The latest Nokia PC Suite is 6.84.10, update that also

            <p>I checked with the team on this one, and apparently the Contact list filter will only show people who are actually available to talk i.e. Available means they are online, and excludes away etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; So if they are away, then won't show up in that filtered list.</p>
<p>However the Web IM icon in the top right should be active and you should be able to see them.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it shows as non-active, then it may be something to do with the scripts not completely loading in time, and apparently a refresh of the page will usually resolve
 it.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a bug though that it is not loading quickly enough for some users and they are working on it.</p>
<p>Whether they are online or not, you can message your Friends, since if they are not "available" the system will still send the message and they will get it.&nbsp; If they are offline at the time, then it will be delivered as an offline message which is displayed
 when they go online again.&nbsp; If they are away, then it will be delivered to their Messenger client and they will see it when they are back.</p>

            <p>You are correct in your analysis of the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp; We have noticed a small number of these where someone had previously connected Facebook, and then removed the connection, but the disconnection didn't complete correctly.</p>
<p>The quickest way to resolve this is to re-Add the connection to Facebook and then try removing it again, and it should disconnect completely this time.</p>
<p>If you continue to have any issues with this flow, please reply with your Microsoft account (in the form
x@y and it will be hidden from other users), and we will investigate further on your behalf.</p>

<h2>            word document - how to create custom section headers&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">I have a Word 2016 document with 6 sections in it. Each section contains 3 tables. It's possible for the tables to span more than one page. When they do, I'd like to repeat the section header at the top
 of the second page, with " (continued)" tacked onto the end of the header. I looked at "fields" for this, but I don't see that level of customization. Can anyone suggest what Word features I should use to create this effect?</span></p>

<h2>            Scheduling 45 min interviews in Scheduling Assistant mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will do my best to describe what is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm is Scheduling Assistant In Outlook and working on scheduling 45 min meetings. When my times are 3:00 - 3:45 I used to be able to change the time, &amp; SA would automatically change the blue highlighted lines to indicate a 45 min. Now However, the blue lines
 still reflect a 30 min time slot, and when I change back to Appointment the 45 mins time slot gets changed to a 30.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if I'm in Appointment mode, and I change the times to a 45 min time slot I can see that reflected in Scheduling Assistant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get the scheduling Assistant to recognize 45 min timeslots?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Becca Pence,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have made a test on my side and the Scheduling Assistant was working fine, here are my steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.Choose specific time
</span><span>range by select 3 time slots (each 15 minutes) under day view in my Outlook's calendar, then right click and choose New Appointment.
</span></p>
<p>2.Then it shows 45 minutes range between start time and end time which is correct.
</p>
<p>3.Then I go to look at Scheduling Assistant and it is also showing 45 minutes occupied.</p>
<p>4.Finally I change back to Appointment view and it remains to show 45 minutes time range there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further investigate this issue, please perform followings:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Please compare my steps with yours and provide your detailed steps so I can test on my side.</p>
<p>2.Please provide your Outlook version. File&gt;Office Account. It's like Version XXXX (build XXXX.XXXX).</p>
<p>3.May I ask if you can always reproduce this on your side or it just happens to some appointments?</p>
<p>4.Are you using pure Exchange online or Exchange hybrid?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>

    <title>Sharing Calendars internally to be viewed on iPad IOS Calender - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> office365admin5043  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharing Calendars internally to be viewed on iPad IOS Calender</h2>
                    
<p>Members of my organisation would like to view each others calendars on their iPad's IOS Calendar, rather than just visible on the OWA app. I was going to set this up by sharing a public .ics URL however I cannot find either the option to share this. On the
 Admin Centre I have enabled "<em>Let people in your organization use a public URL to share their calendars</em>". When users go to
<em>My Calendar / Permissions / Public Calendar</em> &nbsp;there is only options to go to a .html URL or download a .ics file which does not open on iPad IOS.</p>
<p>Can anyone give me instructions on how to get an ics URL or preferably another way to add shared calendars to IOS that does not involve making it public to all.</p>

<p>Thanks in advanced.</p>

<p>Hi Office365Admin5043,</p>
<p>We can only view the shared calendar for Office 365 accounts in <b>OWA for iPad app
</b>but not in<b> built-in app</b> or<b> Outlook for iOS app </b>in iPad.</p>
<p>To view the shared calendar in iPad, you could add the shared calendars in <a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Outlook Web APP</a> and then view it in OWA for iPad app.</p>
<p>However, I do think it would be nice if we can view shared calendars in Outlook for iPad and built-in app. Therefore, I would suggest you submit feedback about the feature via the link below:</p>

<p>I have the same problem, my phone is "branded" to Vodafone &amp; has software 032.005, yet the version for unlocked phones is 033.014.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia state "note that not all countries and operators support the latest version".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a link for software upgrades on the Vodafone site, that simply goes back to the Nokia site!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vodafone's comment is</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><em>Why doesn't Vodafone issue software updates at the same time as the manufacturer?</em></font></p>
<p><em>Prior to releasing or approving any software update for users who have bought a phone from us, we test it thoroughly to ensure it gives you the best possible experience on our network.<br />
Our testing process begins as soon as we receive the software, which often happens once the manufacturer has already released the open market version of the software. During the review process, we report any issues with the software back to the manufacturer
 for them to address. Once the firmware is approved by us, we return it to the manufacturer and they will then distribute the software to users through the appropriate channels.<br />
<br />
We undertake this process with every device that we sell, regardless of whether or not the phone contains our branded software.<br />
<br />
</em>I have e-mailed Vodafone asking why I still have a&nbsp;8 month old version of software, when numerous updates have been made. So far no response ...</p>

<h2>            Is it possible to save IE Proxy authentication &#40;user &#38; password&#41; into registry &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Internet Explorer requires proxy username/password authentication. Can I save username/password into registry ?</p>
<p>My proxy setting of IE can be find in following registry:</p>
<p>"Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings"</p>
<p>It seems that there is no variable for proxy user/password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            Hi tinhdo ... not sure I understand.
<br />Proxy settings don't need a username and password.
<br />They just need proxy server settings which consists of IP and Ports.
<br />Do you mean VPN settings?

<p>Hi SarahKong,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reply.</p>
<p>I means that my Internet is&nbsp; behind proxy, and proxy server requires username and password for authentication.</p>
<p>Can I permanently store proxy username and password into registry ?</p>
<p>I want every time I start Internet Explorer, the prompt that asks for proxy username and password does not show. Internet Explorer can get proxy username/password from registry for authentication. Is it possible ?</p>
<p>

            I know what it means been doing this for over 25 years.  But normally when you have that type of proxy it is a 3rd party app that you are using.  Not the default IE settings.  Therefore the settings would go in the app not registry.
<br />If you look at the IE options you will know there is no option to enter username and password.
<br />I think you might be referring to the security that IE is using.
<br />For example, when i use SharePoint sites I put the sites in internet options- security tab and trusted sites.
<br />Add the sites prompting for username and password in the trusted sites and see if that helps.

Welcome to the Nokia discussion boards!<br />
<br />
It might be worth you trying to do the following resets:<br />
<br />
Soft Reset:<br />
Enter into your keypad *#7780# and when prompted, enter the default passcode 12345. If you have changed the code, it will be the code you changed it to.<br />
A backup will not be needed as this will not delete any data.<br />
<br />
Hard Reset:<br />
This will erase all data on your device, so a backup is recommended before you do this.<br />
Once backed up, enter *#7370# and when prompted, enter 12345 as the default passcode.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
haZey</p>

<p>1. Does the behavior persist if you start IE in No Add-ons mode?</p>

<p>2. Does the behavior persist if you Reset IE Advanced settings &amp; reboot?<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</a></p>
<p>3. What anti-virus application or security suite is installed and is your subscription current?&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender)?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>4. Has a(nother) Norton or McAfee application ever been installed on this machine?</p>
<p>5. Did a Norton or McAfee free-trial come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>================================================</p>
<p>There is a very good chance that you are seeing the effects of a hijackware infection!</p>
<p>NB: If you had no anti-virus application installed or the subscription had expired *when the machine first got infected* and/or your subscription has since expired and/or the machine's not been kept fully-patched at Windows Update, don't waste your time
 with any of the below: Format &amp; reinstall Windows.&nbsp; A Repair Install will NOT help!</p>

                    Just did a fresh install of Windows 7 (Upgraded my hardware and I wanted a fresh start) and I was wondering if the weird Windows 10 "Giant letters in the start menu" alpha listing thing had been removed from Windows 10 yet.

<h2>            Inserting Text vs Typeover</h2>
                    In the past, when typing anything I've always been able to place my cursor and insert text rather than it being overwritten. Today, for some reason, it's overwriting what's already been typed. I suppose the Insert key is for that purpose but why do I suddenly
 have to use that when I've never used it before?

            <p>You probably inadvertently pressed the Insert key when reaching for Backspace or Delete. This is all too easy to do and affects all applications, not just Word.</p>
<p>As you've seen, you can press it again to toggle from Overtype mode back to Insert mode. You can also double-click on OVR in the status bar. When OVR is black rather than dimmed, it's a dead giveaway that you're in Overtype mode.</p>

            <p>Probably not worth it right now.&nbsp; If you have a Media Center key, it will change the build to "Windows 8.1 with Media Center", and that may stop you from updating to other builds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used my key last night, and since I have it on another drive (activated), it screwed everything up, so just did a fresh Win10 9879 install.</p>

<p>In other threads, folks have reported being able to add Media Center from Win8.1 -- but there have been posts indicating that after you do that, you lose the ability to update to newer preview versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, until TP comes out with a Media Center add-on (or upgrade),&nbsp; you will need to live without it.</p>

            I also tried original media center and had to reinstall Windows 10 Preview because of issues. There are other programs that are working on Windows 10 Preview. I am currently using nextpvr which is using my current&nbsp;Hauppauge tuner.&nbsp;You can also use kodi
 with nextpvr and popcorntv plugin&nbsp;for movies.

            Yes streaming media is very popular but many, many people still like the features of dvr's. Netflix, HULU, and so on have lots of great content. But not all tv shows are available online. So many cord cutters and tech enthusiast want and love Windows Media
 Center. It is a one stop shop for all media. I use it to record and watch tv every week and love it. Cable companies and satellite providers also still offer DVR services because people want it. So until every show, sporting event, newscast, and so on is available
 online so people can watch what they want when they want DVR's are not dead. Windows Media Center is a great way to watch live tv and record it. Streaming Media programming has a long ways to go...

            <p>Streaming video is not near the quality of Windows Media Center with a cable card setup.</p>
<p>You can use as a DVR and watch your recordings on any computer with Media center.</p>
<p>Build 10049 killed the usage of cable cards. I found only one software that actually worked.</p>
<p>It was not near the quality of Media Center. Microsoft has now killed the use of windows as a home media center. Windows 8.1&nbsp;with Start8 works great.</p>

            Microsoft has not officially killed Media Center for Windows 10. If you heard that it's simply roomers or speculation. Gabe Aul from Microsoft was interviewed April 8, 2015 and asked if Windows Media Center was going to be part of Windows 10. He said at
 this time he had no information he could release. So some will believe roomers but until Microsoft makes an official announcement I won't count out WMC for W10. In regards to cable card not working with W10. W10 is still very much in beta and lots of things
 don't work right. That is why it's called beta. W10 will not be released for at least 3 months and a lot can change between now and then. Lots of roomers, speculation, and leaks online about W10 and very few of them have panned out to be true.&nbsp;

<h2>            Magento Checkout with Internet Explorer 9 &#40;IE9&#41; - Cant Select Credit Card</h2>
                    I recently began getting phone calls that the checkout window in my Magento store did not allow the customer to input credit card information. After some research, I determined that it was most likely IE9 at the root of the problem. I found quite a few
 people having the same problem with visitors using IE9. Some were able to "patch" the IE problem by inserting the following code into the .htaccess file to make 9 think it's 8:<br />

<strong>BrowserMatch MSIE best-standards-support<br />
Header set X-UA-Compatible IE=8 env=best-standards-support</strong> (copy and paste and no font control)<br />

&nbsp;- an inelegant and unsatisfactory solution. And it didn't work for me! I also saw a solution that involved doing the same thing by putting a similar thing into a meta tag, but i have been unable to do this so far - I'm not so good with php.
<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, IE does not recognize my (and other) store as being secure, even though it is, and so to protect the users, makes it difficult for them to complete their orders. This can be (is usually) frustrating for them, they usually end up losing
 the information they have been able to input, and makes my business look bad. I don't know how many orders I have lost because of this problem built into IE9.
<br />
<br />
Yes, there is a pop-up telling the user that "Only secure content is displayed" and a button allowing to get past this if they tell IE to "Show all content", but the pop-up is at the bottom of the&nbsp; not obvious, and if it is seen, the implication is that the
 site or the page is not secure. But it is!!! <br />
<br />
My visitors are mostly caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease, or even people in the early stages of the disease. They are an older than average population of internet users and not as comfortable using a computer as the average user. Because of their
 situation they are often, understandably, easily frustrated. <br />
<br />
Please help.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
John<br />

            <p><span>Hi.</span></p>
<p><span>The reason for the secure content message in Internet Explorer 9 is to help protect you from security threats. The warning is letting you know that you are on a secure (HTTPS) page that is attempting to load non-secure (HTTP) content.
</span></p>
<p><span>Web pages delivered over HTTP allow anyone along the delivery path to see what they contain; leaving them open to malicious attacks that can rewrite the page or entice you to perform unsafe actions.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Internet explorer 9&nbsp;blocks non-secure content by default and Microsoft does not recommend that you change this setting.</span></b></p>
<p><span>To read more about the risks of allowing mixed content or modify this setting, see KB 2625928:</span></p>
<p><b><span>“Only secure content is displayed” notification in Internet Explorer 9</span></b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2625928" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2625928</a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Important</span></b><span>: Internet Explorer 9 blocks non-secure content by default and is set to prompt you when this is happening. Changing this setting may make your computer vulnerable to viral, fraudulent or malicious attacks. Microsoft does
 not recommend that you attempt to change this setting. Modify this setting at your own risk.</span></p>

    <title>Excel 2010 file set to open as read only still locking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jakeu1701  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010 file set to open as read only still locking</h2>
                    <p>We have several files that one person maintains, but everyone reads for updates and running reports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The files are available on the network and have been saved to prompt for read only access as default.&nbsp; They are also locked behind a password to edit that only the person that updates the report knows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is that even with these safegaurds, the editor still runs into the "This file is locked, open as read only..." message when someone else on the network has it open in read only.&nbsp; This has been verified several times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to find out if there is a way to stop this from happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previous articles I found talked about turning off the details and preview panes, but I use a shortcut or jump list to access the files I need/edit, not via windows explorer.&nbsp; I did open them that way to verify and I still get the message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the person that has it open in read only closes the file, I can immediately open it with the passwrod prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If any one has a solution, please let me know.&nbsp; My current workaround is to open the files I need first thing and keep them open all day to avoid this, when possible.</p>

<p>If you crate a new Outlook profile with a new pst file, assuming<br />

<p>Hi DrunkenKratos96,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Blue screen errors or stop errors are usually caused by hardware or software failure. Try starting your computer in safe mode. This is done to start Windows in its basic state with limited set of drivers and programs to eliminate software conflicts. Normally,
 you can access safe mode from the Windows Recovery Environment through the <strong>
Settings</strong> in Windows 10. In your case, since Windows is not starting, we have to intentionally interrupt its boot phase 3 or more times to make it automatically access the
<strong>Windows Recovery Environment</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Turn on your computer.</li><li>Turn it off by holding the power button when the computer manufacturer logo shows up.</li><li>Repeat for 3 times.</li><li>Once you are in Windows Recovery Environment, select&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt;
<strong>Advanced options</strong> &gt;&nbsp;<strong>Startup settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Restart</strong>.</li><li>Select <em>5) Enable Safe Mode with networking</em> by pressing <strong>F5</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are in safe mode, there are couple of things that you can do to resolve this issue. Here are some things that I highly suggest:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Turn off core isolation</li><li>Download latest Windows updates</li><li>Perform a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
system restore</a></li><li>Reset your PC</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, you can check this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/14238/windows-10-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>If you have other concerns, let me know by simply posting back and I will get back to you as soon as I can.</p>
