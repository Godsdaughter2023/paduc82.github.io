Yes please help, outlook is not receiving the verification codes from instagram which has in turn caused me to be locked out of my instagram account as I cannot verify it. Please help me.

<h3> davidhill2  say:</h3>
<h2>            EXCEL FUNCTION SUMIF&#47;SUMIFS</h2>
                    I am trying to bring certain information across from one (EXCEL) workbook to another (EXCEL) workbook.&nbsp; There could be several records that need to be summed before I bring it across to my summary file.&nbsp; I have been trying to use the SUMIF and SUMIFS functions
 in my summary file to bring the data across to my summary file.&nbsp; I am finding that these functions work very well when you have both workbooks open but lead to a #VALUE! error when the workbook that holds the raw data is not open.&nbsp; Does someone have a FIX
 for this ........... PLEASE?

<p>David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No fix for this!</p>
<p>The nature of these function requires the source workbook to be open to keep calculating the result!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use SUMPRODUCT function instead of <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
SUMIF/</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">SUMIFS to </span>
<span>keep calculating the result when the source workbook is closed as the below syntax:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Instead of SUMIF:</strong></p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT(--(<span>criteria_</span><span>ran</span><span>ge=</span><span>criteria)</span>,&nbsp;<span>sum_range)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Instead of SUMIFS:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>=SUMPRODUCT(--(</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">criteria_</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ran</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ge1=</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">criteria1)</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">--(</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">criteria_</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ran</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ge2=</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">criteria2)
 ... , </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">sum_range)</span></p>
<p>

<p>Haytham:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for replying to my question about ****IF? EXCEL functions and bringing data across from one workbook to another.&nbsp; My use was to bring checking account information across to a summary actual expenditure spreadsheet, saving time and possible
 errors by having to input information only once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I got your reply, I had found another solution, replacing SUMIF with SUM(IF....., and I had to school myself in the use of array input methods.&nbsp; Your suggestion, to use the SUMPRODUCT(--(....... function was far more to my liking, and, undoubtedly,
 I will have many more uses for the SUMPRODUCT function, now that I have learned about how powerful it is.&nbsp; Thank you again.</p>

<h2>            Can not regulate volume of zoeakers AND headphones, when on skype - too LOUD</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I bought special earphones with micropones (wireless) so that I can talk by skype to far away friends and family. However, in skype, there is no volume control. Although if I listen to anything on my ipad mini3 through the earphones and I can adjust
 the sound through the speaker icon with no problem, the skype sound has NO result... It stays too loud with the earphones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot find any place inthe skype app to regulate the sound so I do not understand why it doesn't react to the speaker controls of the ipad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solutions known?</p>

<p>I may have discovered the problem.</p>
<p>It seems when a batch of new mobile phone numbers are issued (especially the first 5 numbers)&nbsp; it can take quite a deal of time to be resolved. (Anywhere up to a month).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quote from an Australian Provider:&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The issue identified relates to the mobile phone prefix you have ( the first 5 digits of your mobile number).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When we (or other carriers) release a new block of phone numbers, these are updated globally as belonging to a specific country (not carrier - thanks to porting). This appears to have not been done correctly
 for the block associated to your mobile phone prefix for certain international carriers. It is why you are able to receive from most numbers onshore, but not others offshore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So hopefully time will fix the problem.</p>

            Hello Norm_916.
<br />
<br />Thank you for the follow-up. It is very helpful and very appreciated for us to be informed of that.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile your block of phone numbers are being updated globally, may I suggest you to explore two-step verification to enhance your account security?
<br />
<br />See: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/12408/microsoft-account-about-two-step-verification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/12408/...</a>
<br />
<br />Since you cannot add phone number as alternate security info to your account, I highly recommend you to add an alternate email if you have one. 
<br />
<br />Helpful reference: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/12428/microsoft-account-security-info-and-security-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/12428/...</a>

This morning my inbox updated to the god awful new layout. I went to mark my six emails as read, but instead I accidentally pressed empty folder. I now have 50,000 emails dating back to 2011 in my trash and I can't move them back to the inbox. How do I do this?
 Also, please change back this layout.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Ron,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply. I actually tried the eM client solution earlier, it looked like it was working. But now when I try to connect to outlook.com, I'm unable to. I keep hitting this message.<br />

<h2>            how to delete conversations on Skype</h2>
                    I now have version 8.11.0.4 for Mac and cannot figure out how to delete conversations. The older version was very user friendly. THis version is not....cannot figure out how to delete recommended contacts also.

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand how this is important for you. Currently, we are on the process of improving Skype to be able to provide a better Skype experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the new Skype, there is no option to delete the entire conversation history. However, there is an option to delete the conversation history with a specific contact. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in to Skype.</li><li>Choose the contact you&nbsp;want&nbsp;to delete the chat history.</li><li>In the messaging window, click the profile of your contact.</li><li>Select <strong>Delete Chat</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post. <br />
Thank you!<br />

<p>This doesn't work - there is no DELETE CHAT.</p>

</p><p>Honestly, it's crazy that something simple like deleting chat history is so hard, actually imnpossible.&nbsp; Also, when i delete one conversation, using the swipe left, it just reappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't new conversations with the same person just be added on to the last conversation rather than create a new window??!!<br />

            Is this resolved yet? If I click on profile contact, I only get a window with profile information, there's no delete conversation. Only hide conversation exists, but it can be easily relived through show hidden conversations. Guys, please, simple delete???

<p>
</p><p>Make sure that you have the updated version of Skype, you can update your Skype app using these steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To update <strong>Skype on Mac</strong> from within the app:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Sign into Skype.</li><li>Select <strong>Skype </strong>from the toolbar.</li><li>Choose <strong>Check for updates</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>To delete the messages, select a particular message and click with two fingers on your trackpad, the option to delete the message should show. Your device must be connected to an internet so the command would directly update the Skype cloud.

Then just use the following formula in cell A1 and copy it down in column A as far as you have data in column B.<br />

Is it through a web browser or a built-in mail application?</li><li>Have you tried to access your Microsoft account using different computer and different web browser to see if the problem still persists?</li><li>Have you checked your different folders to see if the email that you're looking were redirected into that folder?</li><li>Did you experience this problem after being migrated to Outlook.com interface?</li><li>Did you make any changes to your account prior to this incident?</li><li>Have you tried any troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue?</li></ul>

<p>Hi Wayne,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better assistance, we’d like to collect some information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Whether you updated the Outlook before the issue occurred?</li><li>The type of your account, IMAP, POP3 or Exchange. How do you set up it?</li><li>If your account was Exchange account, can you use the OWA(Outlook Web App) normally?</li><li>The version of Outlook 2016. Click <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Office Account</strong> &gt;
<strong>About Outlook</strong> .</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I suggest you try the following workarounds:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the Outlook in the Safe Mode. Exit Outlook &gt; hold the <strong>Ctrl </strong>
key, startup the Outlook&gt; on the pop-up windows, choose <strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>Repair the data file. Click <strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Account setting</strong> &gt;
<strong>Account setting</strong> &gt; choose the account, click <strong>Repair</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Note:</strong> please back up the data.</li></ol>

<p>Choose Page Layout, Colors, Create New Theme Colors&nbsp; and pick your colors.&nbsp; Save this with a name of your choosing like Bartel1.</p>
<p>Then on the Page Layout tab choose Fonts, Create New Theme Fonts, pick your fonts and save with a custom name like Bartel1.</p>
<p>You can also choose an Effect.</p>
<p>Finally, choose Page Layout, Themes, Save Current Theme.</p>

            There are two ways to read the question: how to design a custom color scheme for office documents, or how to design a custom color scheme for office application windows. Both use the term "color scheme" to denote what colors are used in various parts of
 the window. I would like to know how to design a custom color scheme for the windows themselves (ie, set one color for the window title bar, possibly another for the window border, background, menu, etc). Office 2007 &amp; 2010 both seem to hijack the normal appearance
 settings that windows uses, making it difficult for some people to distinquish where windows are when there are multiple overlapping windows. since the built-in color schemes do not provide high-contrast borders for the windows.

            Exactly!!! I have had my Windows colour scheme set in the same way for over a decade, and now MS Office apps do not follow the colour scheme set for Windows. And as Laserray70 stated, it is hard to see what is the active window due to lack of contrast.
 I would like my Office applications to run with the same colour scheme that I have set Windows for over a decade. How do I do this?

            Wow, I had assumed that I just did not know how to do this.&nbsp; I finally got around to looking and came across this thread.&nbsp; Very disappointing.&nbsp; I am a daily office user,&nbsp;am now in my 50's and &nbsp;have a great deal of difficulty with the UI because of the
 color scheme.&nbsp; I&nbsp; prefer the old windows color style because of the contrast between the different segments of the screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the current scheme some of the icons wash out and the screen segments run together - even in windows file explorer.

            They don't care. and they do really stupid things with color like light blue or gray text on white. It is aesthetically pleasing but unreadable. MS is not alone in this. Human factors skills are not being taught to designers and programmers. A failing.<br />

            <p>I am frustrated with the grey on grey slider and scroll bar with all high contrast themes. Also, Office uses seemingly unrelated Theme colors for example VBA form colors use the Windows ButtonFace color. I have had limited success hacking the color settings
 in the registry but haven't found how to fix the scroll bar colors.</p>

            <p>ok, I found a round-about way to change this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on the Desktop&gt;Personalize: &nbsp;Scroll down to "Basic and High Contrast Themes" and select any of the High Contrast themes (I suggest white if you'd like to keep it similar but get rid of that awful grey, grey-blue (blue), or dark grey (black) and
 revert back to the white-ish).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you select any of the High Contrast themes, click the Window Color icon on the bottom of the window and customize 'til your heart's content. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes it's clunky, and yes it's a pain in the neck, but yes, it does allow you more than the 3 poor options available by default.</p>

            <p>This method was close, but still failed to bring Office back to the usability it once had.&nbsp; I pretty much gave up on Microsoft after Office 2007 and now with Windows 10 I've dropped to about 10% of the use I once had.&nbsp; The company I worked for even went
 bankrupt after many of us left in frustration.&nbsp; They had to hire 2 to 3 people each to replace 4 of us, yes -&nbsp;a small company, but they just couldn't keep up with what we used to be able to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks to me like Microsoft is single-handedly responsible for dropping the unemployment rate by a LOT.&nbsp; Yet at the same time, productivity has dropped off the chart.&nbsp; (unless you use the marketing charts that MS uses...)&nbsp; The offices that would have employed
 2 to 3, or 4 workers, now has to use between 5 and 10 people to accomplish less than we did before.&nbsp; That's just pretty sad.&nbsp; All of our customizations over the years ( macros and such ) weren't compatible unless jumping through all kinds of hoops that made
 it too difficult.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh well, I'll get off the soap box now.&nbsp; Sorry to clutter.</p>

            I, too, find this frustrating, but take some solace in the ability to use an alternative office suite that uses the operating system's settings for window borders:

            <p>I live in GMT+1, so yeah, I probably do. I mean September 30th, my bad. I have been using the Realtek RTL8111E chip (10/100/1000 Mbit) that came with my Gigabyte GA-P67A-D3-B3 Motherboard, until it stopped working on September 30th, following an update.
 Was installing a new GPU into the machine at the time, so there is a faint chance something might have gone wrong there as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I switched the machine back on, it was incapable of connecting to the internet. Believing a clean install might resolve the issue, I tried that and it didn't work either. I have also tried manually downloading and installing Realtek drivers for the above
 chip, to no avail. Currently, I'm planning to install a discrete networkscard, hoping that will fix the issue at least for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I formatted the machine and it hasn't been online since then, I'm unfortunately unable to provide the exact build.</p>

<p>Hi JatinWP,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your information.<br />
<br />
From your information, I learned of that broken image problem solved, now the focus is picture sliding, right?<br />
<br />
As for the picture sliding, In a recent update to Office 365 that is currently being deployed, the ability to automatically switch to new images is being deprecated for libraries that do not have a Content Delivery Network (CDN) enabled. This means that the
 AutoPlay functionality for existing websites will no longer function for Picture Library Slideshow web parts.<br />
<br />
To use the CDN together with the Picture Library Slideshow web part, your SharePoint Online tenant administrator must enable the CDN within your Office 365 tenancy.<br />
<br />
For more detailed information, refer to the article below:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4021555/non-cdn-enabled-sharepoint-picture-library-slideshow-web-part-no-longe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Non–CDN-enabled SharePoint Picture Library Slideshow web part no longer switches automatically
 to new images</a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can also refer to the solution of running PowerShell command as Jiaxing mentioned in this thread

<strong>To report spam or unsolicited emails:</strong><br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><br />
</span></em><br />
<em>* Non-MIcrosoft customers should address an email to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** or *** Email address is removed for privacy ***,&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (Depending on the originating
 mail domain: hotmail, msn,live, or Outlook.com). Attach a copy of the spam email to this email and send it. If we do not receive a copy of the email as an attachment our ability to take action against the spamming account is severely impacted.</em><br />
<em>* We ask for a full copy of the email so that we have conclusive evidence showing from which Windows Live Hotmail account the SPAM was sent. It is possible that the email address
 was spoofed, and we don't want to mistakenly close a non-spamming account.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>To report abuse:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>
abuse</strong> <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">about harassment, impersonation, child exploitation, child pornography etc, received</span>
<strong>
from a outlook.com account</strong> <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">should send their complaint to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** with all the relevant&nbsp;information (abuse@hotmail, or *** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</span></em><br />
<em>*
<strong>If you are being threatened please call your local law enforcement.</strong></em><br />
<em>*</em>
<em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you wish to report abuse against a non Microsoft account, please send the complaint to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** , where xxxxxx.com is the text that appears after the "@" symbol
 in the sender's e-mail address. For example, if the unwanted email came from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** then report the email message to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. You can also use the site http://abuse.net to identify the correct abuse reporting address.</span><br />
</em><br />
<strong><em><span style="color: rgba(235, 0, 115, 1)">* In addition to these ways of reporting Spam you can also click the "Report Spam," button in your email program.</span></em></strong></span></span>

<p>The phone showed successful download (100%) and preparing to install (100%) but then, I got the error code&nbsp;0x80070020. The phone did not restart and did not install the text suggestions. I was not able to install any other text suggestions or speeches. Instead,
 I went for:</p>

<p>If you find an easier workaround, please, say so. If you have issues with one of these steps, please, say so.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Notes</strong>&nbsp;(intended reader: Microsoft)</p>
<p>I have to re-test, whether the steps 6 and 7 are really required (or even the cause of this). If a Microsoft employee is reading this: This is not just a software bug, but an usability issue as well – when somebody adds another English menu language, not
 only the keyboard but also the speech for that country (plus United Kingdom) should be downloaded in one package. Furthermore, the description in ‘phone update’ should state exactly what/which language package/part is going to be downloaded, not just the generic
 ‘additional language support’.</p>

            <p>I had various issues with downloading new language packs along similar lines. One involved using English&nbsp;(Australia) keyboard&nbsp;and trying to get text suggestions to work when typing. Various reading indicates there is a bug that requires you to download the
 English (UK) speech pack for that to work, but doing so can generate similar error messages about failed download, "attention required" "pending" "preparing update" and similar.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried adding speech pack for English (US) but that stayed "pending" indicating the UK one that showed "downloading" really was stuck and was blocking other stuff. Note this condition remained even after soft rebooting a few times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While it probably won't help everyone, note that you should check Settings/Update where you may find it is waiting to DL a speech or language pack. If so tell it to go ahead, and after a couple of reboots you may find the above problems have cleared. Took
 me a while and a fair bit of reading to notice this as the phone never prompted for it&nbsp;outside the "Update" area, just showing the error or alert messages but with no clue what to do about them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The speech and language pack download function&nbsp;appears to have one or more bugs in the current production release, though Insider versions may improve matters. Reading suggests this has been quite a problematic area since 8.1&nbsp; At the time of writing&nbsp;my Lumia
 950 is on version 1511 OS build 10.0.10586.218.</p>

            <p>Paul, what is your current situation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Australia keyboard text prediction even works without UK. However for Australians, the UK speech is required for Windows Maps. Furthermore, the current Insider builds on the Development Branch (Redstone) do not make the situation better because there, download
 does not work at all. On the Release Branch (10.0.10586.xxx), the keyboard prediction and speech downloads work for me. Therefore, did you consider to
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/reset-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reset your phone</a>? By the way: Please, remove the battery (cover) and post your Product Code (059…). That indicates for which region/country your phone was designated.</p>

            <p>My Product Code is 059X183 for an 640XL LTE, Model RM-1096 . I bought the phone when OS, not realising that (apparently) Microsoft has different firmware for different regions. I am Australian.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why? Do Apple or Android do this? My Android phones have happily switched regions, languages etc for different countries.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it appears that when you think you are changing the Language, Region, Speech, Keyboard settings in a Microsoft phone - if you bought it in another country - you may fail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps Microsoft is uncomfortable with the notion that people might travel. (Note - I recall calling a company in Washington. The PA of the person I was calling asked where I was calling from. When I said "Australia", she thought for some time, and said
 "Is that in Texas?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, be careful using a different region etc on your phone to your PC, if you have them registered in the same Live account, and have the PC set to sync your settings. It may be a coincidence, but I started getting warnings that signing on to my Group
 Policy had failed after updating the phone to Win 10, and trying different regional settings to get Cortana working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any safe way to change the phone firmware? Has anyone done it and got the Australian language download without errors? If so, where did you obtain the firmware, and how did you flash the phone?</p>

<p>You do <em>not have to</em> go for a different firmware, when you follow my above steps. However as alternative, you

<blockquote>
<p>Perhaps Microsoft is uncomfortable with the notion that people might travel.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mhm. Windows 10 Mobile is designed (might not make sense, but is the way its software is coded), you do&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;change All apps » Settings » Time and language » Region when you&nbsp;<em>travel</em>. You might change your keyboard and/or language, but you
 keep your region forever, regardless where your are on the world at that moment. That avoids any issues with your Microsoft account. When you are not about travelling but&nbsp;<em>moving</em>&nbsp;to a different region, please, say so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>059X183</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That phone was designated for Hong Kong. Therefore, you face this issue here. In the world of Microsoft Mobile (former Nokia), each phone has a designated region and comes with a custom firmware variant. Why ever. Modern and more clever operating systems
 solve this issue through downloading operator settings depending on the currently inserted SIM (to guess the region and operator). Anyway, because your phone was designated for Hong Kong, you ran into this issue here. However, if you follow the above workaround,
 your issue should be solved.</p>

            <p>I did mean travel in the sense of purchasing a phone in one country, to take it and use it in your home country. That was the context, but I hope it is now clarified. As noted above - no other major phone manufacturer has this issue. The thirteen steps in
 Abi99's response demonstrate more clearly than I could the need to fix this. Perhaps they could get a few more ideas from Apple?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I assumed Microsoft understood the international nature of modern business. And I don't believe that I should need to understand how a phone is coded, if it is implied that I should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If our Microsoft accounts have "issues" because we travel, work in, spend extended periods in other countries, or move to another country, then Apple and Android clearly have a better understanding of the nature of their clients. I don't travel as much as
 in the past, but by September this year in a twelve month period I will have spent several weeks each in South Africa, China, and the UK. I know project managers who regularly move to different countries as part of their business model.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Abi99's thirteen steps involve hard resetting the phone. Having done this once in Australia, it is not for the fainthearted. I did not receive a reset code text message.I had to find, and then select for, and eventually, an option to get the reset code via
 a voice message. It eventually came through&nbsp; - from the US. I then had to reinstall most of my apps, and my desktop, and even some phone settings. (The time involved! The MS phone backup and restore is the anorexic model. Android and Apple are much better
 at backup and restore.) Abi99's link to a firmware change took me to a page which advises visiting a Microsoft/Nokia Care Office. I appreciate it, but it was not helpful. Microsoft Australia does not value Australia enough to have physical support offices.
 I know this because a Microsoft rep arranged for me to send my previous Lumia 1320 to the Philippines for a warranty repair. It would be interesting to see which countries do not have such offices, besides Australia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Apple owning business friends don't seem to spend any time tinkering under the hood, or carrying out thirteen step procedures on phones they may have bought overseas - they just do what the owners need done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will bet you can count the number of international Fortune 500 companies who standardize on Windows phones on the fingers on a 1960's sawmill workers hands.<br />
</p>
<p>I am an early adopter, and like the MS phone. There is much to like. It is fast, not loaded with bloatware, and does work to some extent with MS Office and OneDrive. However, it is one of those products which has technical advantages, but doomed. It will
 fail unless the company realizes it has an organizational culture which is technically oriented rather than customer oriented.</p>

<p>Traveling even for extended periods is of no issue, because you do not change your region on your phone then. That setting is just for displaying certain locale things like the date format you are used to. However, why ever, that setting is linked to the
 country specified in your Microsoft account. If both settings mismatch, buying stuff in the Microsoft Store is getting complicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it comes to the rest of your feedback, please note that Microsoft wants you to use Windows 10 Mobile » All apps » (Windows) Feedback instead of Microsoft Answers. Again, why ever. However, Microsoft Mobile (former Nokia Mobile Phones) do this since
 day one (early 90s). They continue with that and have not changed that model until today. Why ever.</p>

    <title>C7 navigation settings problem. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ngc7  say:</h3>
<h2>            C7 navigation settings problem.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all, i have a C7 which tells me "con failed. con unavailable" when i use navigation. i've looked at some of the nokia FAQ's and gone through the settings and it still won't lock on to the network positioning assist (or whatever it's called).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When i first got the phone 3 months ago it worked fine and would lock on, set my position and calculate the route in just a few seconds. now it can takes between 5 and 10 minutes to lock onto the GPS signal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've also requested network settings from my provider-GiffGaff-but it's still not working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm at my witts end, help please!</p>

<p>I uninstalled maps and the map/navigation engine and reinstalled both the engine and the maps and updated to the latest versions. and still the same.</p>
<p>when i'm home it uses my home modems wifi and locks on no problem via wifi, but i still get the message for "con failed. con unavailable".</p>

<p>Do you know what access points you use when you connect your phone to the internet? Goto Settings&gt;Connectivity&gt;Settings&gt;Destinations. Here you will see 3 categories for the various access points previously set up for accessing the internet. Click on the
 categories and you should see the list of accesss points under each heading. You also have to option of moving them around if you so wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now go back to the network destination setting in Nokia Maps. This setting has to match the category under which you have places the access point you wish to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope I have answered your question.&nbsp;</p>

            Or you could do this to set up You access point. Select Menu &gt; settings &gt; application settings &gt;settings wizard &gt; operator. The phone should ask you to whether to set destinations. Select yes for all and your access points should be set up automatically.

<p>I've tried everything obvious such as going through the settings making sure it's set to online and not offline, looking at the destinations and so on. still nothing.</p>

<p>Setting Nokia Maps to Offline does not necessarily completely stop your phone from accessing the internet when you navigate. It only stops Nokia Maps from accessing the internet for map data and searches. You will also need to disable Positioning Methods
 which may also require internet access. To stop Positioning Methods from accessing internet, you need to disable, Assisted GPS, Network based and Wifi in Positioning Methods.</p>

<h2>            Phone update - critical battery failure</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My lumia 930 phone updated last night to a new version of windows, which I understand is 10.0.14393.1770.&nbsp; I'm running windows 10.&nbsp; Since the update, if the phone is not plugged into a power supply it will state that there is a critical battery failure and
 shut down immediately.&nbsp; This can happen straight after booting up, even before I unlock the phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this error only started to occur after the update, it seems likely that this is a result of something that was built into the latest update. Can anyone help?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You can save the mail merge main document and then open it and use it again with the data source, which will still be attached to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your being only have to print the first 30 labels implies that you have NOT actually executed the merge, which has to be done by the use of the Finish &amp; Merge facility in the Finish section of the Mailings tab of the Ribbon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use the Edit Individual Documents (a really misleading title) destination, a document will be produced that contains a label for each of the records in your data source.&nbsp; You can print and, if you want to, save that document to print the same labels
 again at a later time.&nbsp; The other option for labels is to execute the merge directly to the printer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The first option is probably the best as it will give you the opportunity to check the labels before printing them.</p>

<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0eddfdf2-e8e1-4dec-bb61-b43b0942ab85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0eddfdf2-e8e1-4dec-bb61-b43b0942ab85" /></a></p>
<p>if i click ok button, the box disappears and i can use the application without any problem or any warning about the license. any other new application opening in the same windows session comes up without the license warning.</p>
<p>how can we solve this annoying problem?</p>

<p>best regards</p>
<p>stefano</p>

    <title>A Powerpoint figure pasted into Word is messed up even with - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            A Powerpoint figure pasted into Word is messed up even with &#34;source formating&#34; checked</h2>
                    <p>So I make this great flow chart in Powerpoint. I fixed all the text formats so it fits in the allotted space. I select and past the figure into Word as a MS graphic and set keep source formatting. And...</p>
<p>YUCK. Text all over the place! </p>
<p>Source tabs and ruler settings are ignored and re-editing in Word is such a pain!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know a fix?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I did find a way involving using jpeg, but it involves an extra process.</p>
<p>If you save your slide "as a picture" (jpeg) then the &nbsp;image file has a much higher resolution than a screenshot-- 250 dpi vs 72. So crop your image &nbsp;vertically and paste it into Word. Resize it, if needed (&amp; you probably will), to the same width as the
 ppt slide width. Then the fonts will have the correct size and the picture will look good because of the high resolution.</p>

<h2>            Trying to Accept Changes in a redlined Word Document. Won&#39;t do it.</h2>
                    <p>I have created a rather long document in Word and then entered many changes, using Track Changes under Tools. All changes appear in red, which should be removable when I click Accept All Changes, or click Accept Change word by word. But nothing happens to
 my redlined document: it remains redlined.</p>
