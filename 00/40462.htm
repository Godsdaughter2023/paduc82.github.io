<p>Choose how you want to prepare your files. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Install by creating media</strong></p>
<p>This I think is one of the most important steps, a lot of persons do not have fast Internet Connections, or they are using metered Internet Connections which prohibits them from downloading large files using their ISP over a period of time. Windows 8 is
 a 2 GB download which is still significantly large for some Internet Connections.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>USB flash drive</strong></p>
<p>If you have a thumb drive with 3 GBs of available space, you can use that to create a bootable copy. Thumb drives are very cheap these days, so pick up a couple and create one as your first backup option. This is especially recommended for persons using
 Ultrabooks which do not include optical drives (DVD) or Netbooks. There are some desktop systems that do not include one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ISO file</strong></p>
<p>An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 8, a blank DVD. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO and burn it using the built in Disc Image
 utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero.

<p>For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. </p>

    <title>Adobe Premier on Surface Book - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnshepherd1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adobe Premier on Surface Book</h2>
                    <p>Recently got a DJI Mavic Air drone. I use Adobe Premier Pro CC to edit. This computer won't handle the 4k clips that I am getting from the drone. I will load a little 20 sec clip but anything longer and I get "media pending" and then eventually it crashed
 PP. This computer should be plenty of machine. I can do it with my PC that is less capable. It seems to be an issue with the Surface Book...not the software or media files since my PC does it. Guessing it has something to do with the 2 card fighting?</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The display adapter on your Surface may not be running the software that can support the program you are using. To make sure you have the recommended software packages, you can
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023505/surface-install-surface-and-windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
install Surface and Windows update</a>. Apart from that, the refresh rate of the screen may be posing conflicts with the program you are using to edit your clips. Configuring the taskbar to make the refresh rate real time may correct this problem. You can display
 seconds in your Taskbar Clock to do that. However, this suggestion involves editing the Windows Registry. If you would like to proceed, you can follow the steps on
<a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/display-seconds-in-taskbar-clock-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>The registry hack for seconds on the task bar has absolutely nothing to do with this. Refresh rate has nothing to do with the screen resolution in this case. And the statement about a conflict with drone clips makes no sense.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the Windows Central registry hack now an official Microsoft solution? For which issues? And it is is official, why doesn't Microsoft package it up as a hotfix and offer it officially?</p>

            Yes. Performance base and Nvidia. Shot more DJI 4k footage and the new stuff is working but I changed it to Cinema Coloring. Now worried to shoot colored. Makes no sense though that my PC will work with the clips and may SB is more of computer than my
 PC. So it's something to do with it being and SB.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba4d8890-afb1-4e39-8352-0a3fa5af59c1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba4d8890-afb1-4e39-8352-0a3fa5af59c1?upload=true" /></a>

<p>No, there is not a way to create a new shell folder by default using the Windows interface, and is not a supported end-user scenario. &nbsp;For this reason, this discussion might be better suited to the TechNet or MSDN development forums rather than this Answers
 site.</p>
<p>That being said, there are 3rd party programs that create new shell folders. &nbsp;Some programs, such as Norton, do this for their own purposes. &nbsp;Other programs,<a href="http://www.technixupdate.com/tip-create-custom-shell-folders-like-my-documents-my-pictures-with-my-shell-folder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">such
 as this one</a>, allow end users to create their own. &nbsp;There are also resources from Microsoft about how to leverage the underlying file system and features to create your own shell folder without a 3rd party tool. &nbsp;These can be found here:</p>

            This is a very old post and you may have figured it out by now, but there is a way to create a new "special folder" in Outlook 2010. I'll go ahead and post this in case anyone else is trying. This answer is specifically for creating new "special" folders
 in different PST files. For example, I add a GMAIL account and I want the "special folders" in the PST file as well as my original.<br />
Open the account settings and set the email account you are wanting to add the folders to as the default account. Here is the important part, go to data files and select the PST file you want to add the "special folders" to and set that PST as the default.
 You will get a warning message, but click past the warning box. Close settings and restart Outlook. When Outlook restarts the new PST will have ALL of the "special folders." You can then reverse the process to set your original PST as the default for everything
 and the new PST file will keep the new folders.<br />
Warning, this will create ALL of the "special folders" in the new PST file and they calendars, contacts, etc, will not stay synced. If you create a new item in one connection, you will have to manually add it to any of the other accounts you want to use.<br />

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Try Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot. The Admin Account there has no password by default<br />
so unless someone changed it you should have access there. Then Control Panel - User Accounts -<br />
Manage another account - use this lower your account to&nbsp;user (to lowest level) APPLY/OK&nbsp;
<br />
then go back and reset&nbsp;it to Admin APPLY/OK - this helps clear corruption. Do this a few times.<br />
Then fix the password in your normal account. Be sure to leave your account as Admin if you<br />
wish.<br />
<br />
If no joy with Safe Mode :<br />
<br />
Try this -&nbsp;use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to&nbsp;user (to lowest level) APPLY/OK&nbsp;
<br />
then go back and reset&nbsp;it to Admin APPLY/OK - this helps clear corruption. Do this a few times.<br />
Then fix the password in your normal account. Be sure to leave your account as Admin if you<br />
wish.<br />
<br />
Make another&nbsp;Admin Account&nbsp;with your password&nbsp;and use it to fix the others when needed. (just to
<br />
repair with, not to use as regular account, a safety valve) Always keep a spare ADMIN&nbsp;account.<br />
<br />
DO NOT LEAVE THE HAA ENABLED OR USE IT DAILY. If it corrupts you are toast!<br />

<br />
You can run the Hidden Admin Account command from the Command Prompt from here if needed.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a&nbsp;Vista DVD<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx</span></a><br />
<br />
If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a new one (remember to always<br />
leave an Admin Account that is unused except to test and fix).<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Doesn&#39;t Fit to Screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just upgraded my desktop PC to Windows 10, from Windows 8.1, however, the taskbar, and the rest of the screen, stretches off of the monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The graphics drivers are all up to date, all Windows updates installed, rebooted, set resolution, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tweaked the monitor settings, they are all as they should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - how do I get Windows 10 to fit to my monitor screen? Every other Windows version has been fine.</p>

            <p>I spoke to Microsoft Technical support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We did a lot of troubleshooting, and it appears the issue is with the 15.x driver for AMD Graphics Cards, particularly on the R7 2xx series.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue has been escalated to level 2 technical support, and they are currently evaluating the system logs and error reports - and will give me a call tomorrow to discuss getting a patch pushed out.</p>

            <p>I found a way to fix this if your computer has the AMD Catalyst Control Center.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); font-style: italic">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>1. Open the Device Manager (right click on Start-Icon in left corner)&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Then click Display Adapters and click your display card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Click on "Search for a driver on the computer" (second entry)</p>
<p>4. Click "Select driver from list"&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Pick the newest one you have</p>
<p>6. Restart your computer and it should work.....mine did</p>

    <title>Synced Theme doesn&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Synced Theme  doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Synced Theme</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like to sync the desktop theme across PCs, and searching for solutions online only led me to topics that want to "disable" this. I have 3 different PCs, and I use 2 of them constantly, but most of the time the Synced Theme doesn't work. It simply changes
 to "Unsaved Theme" whenever I change the wallpaper, even if I deleted the "Unsaved Theme" another one gets created as soon as I change the wallpaper. I am getting tired of having to switch the sync settings on and off and restarting each PC just to get this
 to work, which even then doesn't always work. It rarely does. When I installed Windows 10 on both desktops the wallpaper was getting synced no problem for some time, I don't know what exactly changed. Why is it not possible to simply change the wallpaper of
 the "Synced Theme"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Thanks for the reply ^^</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't think of any major changes that I have done, and I ran the troubleshooter before, but I did so again now. At first it showed me a message saying that some apps have sync turned off after clicking next I got two issues detected:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-No rootcauses found and created logs</p>
<p>-Some settings have sync turned off (in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sync your settings, I have everything turned on, of course including "Theme")</p>
<p>
</p><p>After constantly switching between the "Unsaved Theme" and the "Synced Theme" on the main PC, the wallpaper on the second PC finally changed, but the main PC is still on "Unsaved Theme" while the second is on "Synced Theme". I tried changing the wallpaper
 again on the main PC, but it didn't change on the second PC.</p>
<p>Here is the current situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wallpaper 1, Wallpaper 2, and Wallpaper 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wallpaper 1 on main PC and second PC is synced.</p>
<p>Changed to Wallpaper 2 on main PC, but second PC stayed on Wallpaper 1.The "Synced Theme" had Wallpaper 1 in both PCs.</p>
<p>After constantly switching themes in the main PC, the "Synced Theme" and the second PC finally displayed Wallpaper 2. (I also turned the Sync settings on and off 2 or 3 times before it synced, but of course it was on before running the troubleshooter)</p>
<p>Now the main PC is still on "Unsaved Theme" with Wallpaper 2, which is no problem, but I tried changing to Wallpaper 3 and it didn't sync. Switching to "Synced Theme" on the main PC still shows Wallpaper 2, and changing to Wallpaper 3 while on "Synced Theme"
 changes the used theme from "Synced Theme" to "Unsaved Theme" on the main PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Changing to Wallpaper 2 was done yesterday, and it only finally synced an hour or so after posting this question.</p>
<p>Does syncing take 1 day? I doubt it.</p>
<p>___________________________</p>
<p>So basically I am not able to change the wallpaper on the "Synced Theme" properly. If there is a specific workaround way to edit the "Synced Theme" that would be great even if it's a more complicated process then simply changing the background on a PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks ^_^</p>

            <p>Is this a work PC of some sort?&nbsp; Typically the "Unsaved Theme" is created because there's some system setting that is not otherwise reflected in the Synced Theme.&nbsp; You could use windiff to compare the two themes to note the difference(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "synched" theme is a subtheme created from a roamed / synched theme.&nbsp; You would always have a non-"synched" theme on one of the machines, since one would be the source theme.</p>

<p>
</p><p>No, they are both my own home PCs. I compared the 2 theme files using WinDiff, and the differences were in Display Name, Theme ID, Wallpaper, Colorization Color, and Wallpaper Write Time (Synced theme didn't have Wallpaper Write Time).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the current wallpaper that is displayed on my second PC is the one that was previously on the main PC, but the wallpaper in the Synced Theme hadn't changed in the last 2 weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I just confirmed that resetting the internet connection on the second PC will immediately sync the wallpaper with the one on my main PC. I tried this more than once now, and it happens every time. A good alternative to restarting the PC, but still...I
 would love it to be perfect. There should be a manual sync button at least.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Profile corrupted offline account - Recovery very much desired.</h2>
                    <p>Dear support,</p>
<p>I will stick to the facts on this. This afternoon i wanted to relax and play some videogames on my xbox 360. It's a first generation with a HDD drive (20 gb) that had 8 profiles on it, of which 3 have been connected to xbox live in the past. One is of the person who previously owned the xbox 10 years ago and gave the device to me, one is my main profile and the third i have logged into only once, it's the result of an attempt to recover the email adress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This afternoon I wanted to play a bit. It first went as always. Something came along, I shut the xbox down by holding the middle button for a few seconds and shutting the device down remotely. When I tried to log in again later, it showed 6 accounts instead of 8 accounts, my account and my sister's (completely offline) were gone from the list. These two accounts were recently used to coop fable 3. On the storage overview, it gives 6 profiles and one corrupted profile of 7 mb. On various games, it gives corrupted savegames.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My own account is linked to an e-mail address that no longer exists (things happen in 10 years) and has no online back-up. Is there any way to recover this account? I have googled, so far I've seen that the only options seems to be to retrieve the account from the xbox360 and recover it on pc, but there is no clear list of instructions on this. I think this is because normally you're not supposed to try this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The xbox has never been hacked/modified and hasn't had any internet connection since October last year. The tv it was linked to via hdmi was connected to internet (for complete info)
<br />
</p>
<p>I really hope you can help me, this account means a lot to me as it has so many memories and savegames (also some 12k achievement points..) that I would not lose like this without any attempt to salvage. Please help!<br />
</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Timo</p><p><br /></p><p>ps. The nickname under which this is published is the third account created last year, turns out it comes in handy, unfortunately<br />

            But is it compatible with Windows 7?<br />
<br />
Considering that IBM sold its PC business to Lenovo back in 2004, if you are using any of the tools that come with a IBM PC on Windows 7, they are likely not work.<br />

<h2>            AMD RADEON 7670M not detectec by win 10</h2>
                    I installed a clean version of Win 10 on my laptop. Its model is HP pavilion G6 2260tx. The graphics card version is AMD radeon 7670M. Its not showing my graphics card anywhere, like it doesn't exist. My graphics card was working fine in Win 8. But now
 in win 10, I cannot find it anywhere(in device manager list and in dxdiag dialogue box). I have tried installing AMD catalyst manager, but its not working either. Please help.&nbsp;I am attaching the relevant screenshots.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f4ae675-ed4d-4ff1-a3fe-ade2fb615804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f4ae675-ed4d-4ff1-a3fe-ade2fb615804" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8511f4a5-486e-4bc2-84e0-96d9607bfd30" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8511f4a5-486e-4bc2-84e0-96d9607bfd30" /></a>

            Thanks for the reply,<br />
I tried to install drivers from both AMD's utility and from HP's website in compatibility mode.<br />
The utility provided by AMD doesn't detect any AMD hardware and drivers provided by HP just wont install in compatibility mode. The process in AMD catalyst manager in compatibility mode for win 8 just hangs in this stage.<br />

<h2>            Is it possible to hide the &#34;All Apps&#34; tab&#47;group in the Start Menu&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>After being a Windows 7 user for many years, I've recently decided to migrate to Windows 10, although I tested it when the Technical Preview went public. There are currently no problems with the operating system, but one "minor" thing is what I want to be
 solved and I can't figure out how to, and it's a "new" tab that has appeared with the Anniversary Update for Windows 10. That tab (or group) is not really new, as it was included on previous Windows versions and was known as "All Apps" that could be accessed
 by clicking on it. Now, since I installed the latest update, it turned into a permanently-open tab, which I don't really like.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03560dec-769f-491c-be34-27c20096deea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03560dec-769f-491c-be34-27c20096deea" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to personalize the Start Menu on every Windows operating system I used, even on Windows 10 before the update, but now it's a different feeling and I'd like to know if there's a method to hide it. I once right-clicked on a custom app to access its
 installation location, but it instead redirected me to where the shortcut was located, along all other shortcuts that represented the ones on the menu. I decided to delete them all, which only decreased the amount of apps in the list (this also made those
 apps not to be found when written in the menu, so you better not do it). Any tips to hide that group or make it look like the one on Windows versions prior to the Anniversary Update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and have a nice day!</p>

            <p>Currently no, but the latest builds in the Insider preview have modified this somewhat. We will just have to wait until the next release in probably March&nbsp; or join the Insider program and check it out.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the answer, but sadly it was already checked since I tried many (if not most) things to hide that Apps group. It's good enough to hide the apps list, but I
<em>never liked</em> a full menu as Start Menu like in Windows 8.x. Still, thanks for letting me know that it will be reworked in some way in future builds. I basically left Insider when I installed Windows 10 Technical Preview as secondary OS, which made it
 pretty slow (however, if you do a clean install and there are no more operating systems, it's pretty well optimized), so that's why I'm most likely missing many change previews.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please screenshot it, if you don't mind? Thanks!</p>

    <title>Rushing versus camping - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> axemator  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rushing versus camping</h2>
                    
<p>So lets beat the proverbial dead horse. Why do people get so upset about campers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I pose an interesting outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your team mate is camping the whole game and does awesome is it good or bad? By camping I mean pure 100% camping - switching corners etc. Not objective/choke point killing. I ask this as I have had may people on my team who rush and they are 5-17 at the
 end of the game. Obviously they are bad at rushing. Which would you rather have on your team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far on all the posts of people hating campers or rushers I have yet to find what the rest of us are doing who do neither. I personally use the camp method when I am either tired or I am holding an objective. For example -0 ther eis nothing wrong with
 being in a room if you are shooting out of it. And it is perfectly fine to use defensive measures (shocks, betties and claymores) to protect your back. I am not sure why some people decide to stay in a corner and switch after a kill. However my hat goes off
 to these people who do it rather well. I will hug a corner if I notice my team is across the map and many red dots close to my position. May as well take a few out with me but again I do this under the situation I just described.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the posts here&nbsp; are about camper hate and usually by people who do well at rushing. However their opinion and posts are silent/non-existent when their teammates rush and die horribly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In retrospect it is still a game meant to have fun. If you are getting angry because of the way people play then obviously the game isn't fun. And I would bet the angry ones get just as mad when they are playing someone who is far better than them. My son
 and I were playing the other night and we were laughing so hard as our team was killing the same rusher over and over. He was swearing and yelling that we were all a bunch of campers. Of the 6 times I killed hima nd the 8 my son killed him we were coming around
 a corner and probably his lag killed him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read the whole BO2 box last night and it never said the game had to be played a certain way. Why do you think people are getting really angry? They are competetibe or just angry in nature?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>in the end it all depends how good your connection is. some people accept the lag and do terrible instead of finding a lobby with better connection and anyway, no-one can blame anyone for being bad.... not everyone has what it takes so just leave it at that,
 i know it's annoying sometimes when you go for the win but that's what FPS are like now-a-days, i remember how the majority played when Cod 4 or WaW came out, nobody really camped because the map layouts weren't made for camping but now since IW and Treyarch
 absolutely clutter their maps it all started to be a "modern campfest". i could only wish for more basic maps like we had in WaW, i can't mention one map that was awful in WaW,they were all top notch in my opinion.</p>

<p>@Axemator: &nbsp;You are being reasonable. &nbsp;That only works with reasonable people. &nbsp;A lot of us use "tactics" when we play, which means we will rush when we need to, camp when we need to, and everything in between. &nbsp;Some people treat CoD as a wargame, with all
 the potential of such, with the ultimate objective being to kill as many of them as you can without dying. &nbsp;Others treat it as an arcade game; dying doesn't matter, only getting kills matters, and if you aren't screaming, "Whhheeeee!" while running and spraying
 bullets, you are a "camper". &nbsp; Nothing will convince these people otherwise; possibly because they would have to think when they play, and who wants to do that? &nbsp;Since these people are the whining, complaining, vocal minority, it seems like this is the majority
 opinion. &nbsp;I firmly believe that the majority of the people playing are happy with the game (except for lag, everybody hates lag), and unfortunately, happy people are quiet, and don't complain, so they are never heard from. &nbsp;Play and let play. &nbsp;;oD</p>

<p>@darcmyk: Agreed on the reasonable statement. And I fully agree with the comment that most people are happy with the game, and&nbsp;most likely the people who are not, hate losing or take the game way too serious.</p>
<p>I personally will go to hard camp mode ( hard camp meaning not in a corner but will camp a choke point)&nbsp;when I I am really upside down. For example: if I am 4-8 I will hard camp until I even it out just so the team isnt being hurt by my negative game. I
 have seen many games being lost by people who went 7-19. If they had just slowed down and the 19 deaths was only 12 we would have won.</p>
<p>I play mainly for fun - but if we are losing and I have more deaths than I should - then I change tactics big time.</p>

<p>When I play, I play to win. I am just kinda competetive in nature I guess. I will rage every now and then when connections are bad (very raging) or I am solo and playing a full team. I have taken my share of 8-47 games, mostly due to lag as the host can
 change and the next game, same map, same teams, Ill be 47-8, yes, weird, BUT I see it as all XP gained, even those 8 kills and maybe 8 caps, is contributing towards my max prestige that I am grinding, who cares if my stats take a beating? I try to win and
 cap flags, even when the connection is killing me and my bullets dont work, I can still jump on flags. On topic, I would think that camping would be way easier to obtain a higher K/D. I wouldnt be shot in the back 25 times or more a game if I camped, just
 saying. Its just boring to me in a way. Id rather rush flags, push spawns around, and walk through the enemy (but it doesnt always happen that way, LOL) but its funner to try (working on "skills") LOL. Its way easier to sit back headglitching a choke point
 with an AR.</p>

<p>Good thread.</p>
<p>I only play TDM, so I don't have to worry about objectives. &nbsp;I think many people don't keep track of the score in TDM, and realize that, depending on the score, there's a time to slow down and a time to rush. &nbsp;If your team has a lead late in the game, slow
 down; &nbsp;don't blow that lead rushing into a spot where the bad guys are set up and waiting. &nbsp;If your team is losing, it might be time to get aggressive.</p>
<p>I've also had games where nothing was working. &nbsp;I know it hurts the team if I go big-time negative, so I slow down and make sure to shoot down any enemy air support.</p>

<h2>            System will not boot up..message is..&#34;usb device over current status detected..system will shut down after 15 seconds&#34;</h2>
                    <p>i recently bought a new golf gps unit and connected it to my desktop pc to register .Afeter disconnecting its USB cable from m computer I cant boot up my computer.</p>
<p>everytime i start it the pc its normal routine but then i see the following message...USB device over current system detected.System will shut down after 15 seconds.l</p>
<p>Fifteen seconds later the system shuts down. It wiil also not enable me to start up or access safe mode, setup or any other type of recovery mode i could normally access.It will also not recognize my Win XP installation disc.I assume that is because of the
 BIOS setup which accesses the hard drive before the CD rom drive. </p>
<p>The problem was obviously created by the golf gps USB cable but I cant find a way to get the system to boot up so I can figure out how to eliminate the problem.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help anyone can provide. I am running WinXP Sp3</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What happens when you try booting into the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/boot_overview.mspx?mfr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
advanced boot options</a>?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you receive the same error?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you any external devices connected now?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try the following.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>Disconnect any non-essential external devices connected to the computer and reboot the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b><span>Load default
<span>BIOS (Basic Input\Output System) </span>settings and then restart the computer. Make sure you have the CD drive set as the first boot device. Check the settings by referring to the manual or contact manufacturer to do so.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span>&nbsp;Be careful when changing BIOS settings.
 The BIOS interface is designed for advanced users, and it's possible to change a setting that could prevent your computer from starting correctly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:

<h2>            Reader App in Windows 10&#58; How do I open pdf files in a new window by default&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I have a pdf file open in the reader app on Window 10 and I open another pdf file, the new pdf file is opened in the same window as the other pdf file. &nbsp;That is, rather than creating two windows with each pdf in a separate window (like Adobe would),
 the new pdf file is opened in the same window as the other pdf file. &nbsp;If I right click in the reader app window, I am shown all of the previously opened pdf files. &nbsp;I can then right click on a pdf file and have it opened in a new window. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like the reader app to open pdf files in a new window by default. &nbsp;Is this possible?</p>

 from the task manager.</p>

<h2>            My MS cardfile.exe is v. 3.0 - is there a higher 32-bit version that the workaround for Windows 7 64-bit might like better&#63;</h2>
                    I've been running cardfile.exe 3.0 for years. Works fine on my home laptop running Vista. New office system is running Windows 7 64-bit. I just found here in these forums a good workaround to allow functionality (<a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?4ah27wr4x164hl4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?4ah27wr4x164hl4</a>&nbsp;-
 and many thanks again!) but the fonts display is wonky - everything is&nbsp;"extended" fonts - wondering if a version higher than 3.0 might be liked more than 3.0. Help appreciated.
