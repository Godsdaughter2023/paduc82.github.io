<p>Its all you can do. No one on here can help. As for the ddos attack you should (after following the instructions above) call your Internet provider for a new ip address. That is a crime and you can take legal action. (Though im not sure how)</p>

<p>Ambassadors are merely community members, fellow gamers and Xbox users who've been around long enough to know the answer to a few frequent questions, and want to help the community out. &nbsp;Being ambassadors does not grant one the ability to ban users. &nbsp;There
 is currently but one formal process for filing a report about a player who is violating the Terms of Use. &nbsp;The console's built-in menu system. &nbsp;Any actions taken will be decided by the Xbox Policy &amp; Enforcement Team only after they have conducted their own
 thorough investigation. &nbsp;Reports are NOT filed through the forums, regardless of what anyone may have told you, or even prior experiences.</p>

<p>I've had my Xbox One for a few months now, and it's starting to get dusty. &nbsp;I want to try and keep it looking as new as possible, so how do you guys clean your XB1's and get rid of &nbsp;the dust that will inevitably collect on the system?</p>

            Hi &amp; tank you for the answer.<br />
<br />
<p>&gt; Based on the above description, it appears that you’re getting an error while starting</p>
<p>&gt; “ThinkVantage System Update”.<br />
</p>
I think it is just one application (the first I realized it at). <br />
E.g. The error also comes up at installing Visual Studio 2012 Premium WebInstall.<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>&gt; Before we proceed troubleshooting this issue, I would appreciate if you could answer
</p>
<p>&gt; the following questions.<br />
</p>
&gt; 1. What exactly happens when you open the log?<br />
&gt; 2. Are you getting any error message?<br />
When I double click the CBS.log the notepad opens (empty) and grayed and a Messagebox says Access denied.<br />
... of corse I'm administrator ;)<br />
An klick on OK. shows an empty editor. Not sure if it is the content of the file ... (Size is ~ 1MB)<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; Method 1: I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the program and check if it helps.<br />
&gt; http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program<br />
&gt; If the issue persists then I would suggest you to contact with the software vendor.<br />
It comes at installation of Visual Studio 2012 Premium. So I can not _reinstall_ it.
<br />
<br />
<p>&gt; Method 2: Also try to refer the steps outlined by “Step2: If the System File Checker tool
</p>
<p>&gt; cannot repair a file” from the link and check if it helps.<br />

<br />
So I would say the files:<br />
wpfgfx_v0300.dll<br />
diasymreader.dll<br />
wpccpl.dll<br />
themecpl.dll<br />
are corruppted ... <br />
<br />
So I should replace them (as mentioned in the Link)<br />
But where do I get those files from?<br />
And which should I replace? It seems that some of them exist more than once on my hard disk...<br />

<p>This mentions Windows 7 so it might be worth a glance?</p>

            <p>"size is zero" may also mean your user doesn't have access to the files in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whatever you are trying to run can you start it this way?&nbsp; Have you tried right-clicking on the shortcut to the program, or the .exe, and selecting the "Run As Administrator" option?&nbsp; Do so even if your user is an Admin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried running it with the Built-in Administrator?&nbsp; See this example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This EXAMPLE (ONLY) might or might not work for you with your program it uses the built-in Administrator account to perform the install?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It seems that the "Run as administrator" command only gives you some administrative privileges, and they're not enough to install Java (and OpenOffice, by association). In order to get around this, you need to actually log into the built-in administrator.
 Open a command prompt with admin rights by clicking start, typing cmd into the search/run box, and hitting CTRL-SHIFT-ENTER. At the prompt, type:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>net user administrator /active:yes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then log out of your regular account and back in as the built-in administrator, where you might be able to install the program. When you're done, log back into your regular account and, for security purposes, disable the built-in administrator account using:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>net user administrator /active:no "</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In either scenario check to see if files size is still zero bytes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the condition of your hard drive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try running ChkDsk to check your drive for errors. Right-click your Drive icon/ Properties/ Tools/ Error Checking.&nbsp; Try it first by not checking either box (this will run it in a Read-only mode, which is much quicker and safer,&nbsp;to see if it flags any hard
 drive or file problems.&nbsp; If it does, restart it by ticking both boxes, and rerun it to allow it to attempt to fix any found problems.

Maybe, but with what reason it should be changed from one day to another at the same time of the crash?
<p>Before there were no problems with all that.<br />
</p>
<br />
&gt; ... "Run As Administrator" ...<br />
&gt; ... Built-in Administrator ...<br />
No change<br />
<br />
&gt; What is the condition of your hard drive?<br />
Thats fine. ChkDsk has run after the crash and maybe fixed some problems. <br />
But now it does not find any problems.<br />
<br />
And I found another: <br />
Starting Powerpoint got the same problem for "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\ppcore.dll".<br />
<br />
What I'm now thinking of is the Restore Point that was created at the installation of the last Application (maybe some weeks old).<br />
But would that fix the problems? Does this restor all the system files?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't specifically answer the question about all the possible reasons a zero byte file is created. Of course corruption is caused by many things on a computer, mostly I see zero bytes created when some program tries to create a file in an area it doesn't
 have permission to create files, or a file is about to be written to, at the exact time the power is turned off, or the program creating such a file, itself crashes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did this other program, Powerpoint, specifically mention, both ,Net Framework, and also
<em>diasymreader.dll?</em></p>

    <title>COD&#58; Black Ops 2 DLC error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thefoxybassist  say:</h3>
<h2>            COD&#58; Black Ops 2 DLC error</h2>
                    
<p>I just purchased the new Vengeance DLC for Black Ops 2 and now every time I load up either the Multiplayer or Zombie menus, i get a popup that says
<strong>ERROR Downloadable Content Has Changed: FC80070570</strong>. I've been searching the internet for hours now trying to find a solution. I've deleted and re-installed all DLC and updates, cleared the cache, checked that every memory unit was properly
 installed, and I cleaned the disc. I've tried installing it and running it that way and again by uninstalling it and running it from the disc only. No matter what I try though, nothing changes. I keep getting the popup and then I don't have access to any of
 my DLC. Does anyone know of any other ways to fix this or do I just petition for a refund? I have purchased Nuketown, Revolution, and Vengeance each separately and now it seems like a waste of my money.</p>

<p>Hi TheFoxyBaddist,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Checking on the xbox.com error lookup page <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/error-code-lookup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../error-code-lookup</a> which detailed that there could be an issue with the content you have downloaded or with xbox live at that time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As you've already tried deleting and re-downloading this content then I would suggest running this by the xbox support team or on twitter:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us#1:3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../contact-us</a></p>
<p>Also worth trying to download the content to a USB flash device as there could be a hardware problem with your harddrive so worth eliminating that also.</p>
<p>Solution 3: Download the item to a USB flash drive</p>
<p>Try to download the item you’re purchasing to a USB flash drive rather than to your hard drive. For more information, see USB flash drive support for Xbox 360 and Xbox 360 storage.</p>
<p>If this solution works, there might be a problem with your hard drive. See Troubleshoot Xbox 360 hard drives.</p>
<p>If you keep getting this error message, try the next solution.</p>
<p>Hope this Helps</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>BoA</p>

    <title>Can I Use Microsoft Network Adapter Multiplexor Protocol - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark cate  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I Use Microsoft Network Adapter Multiplexor Protocol</h2>
                    <p>I am having problems setting up VPN for Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit.</p>
<p>I am also having general non-specific problems with Internet connectivity, according to network engineers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I having a WiFi Mac and a hard-wired cable connect PC sharing the same modem at home.
</p>
<p>The two machines are not 'networked', but standalone workstations. Relevant?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically, I get script errors when I try to setup any 3rd party VPN service.
</p>
<p>I can ignore error and VPN sets up.</p>
<p>But then the number of non-specific problems increase.</p>
<p>All of the 3rd party vendors, AND MY ISP ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT... blame Windows.</p>
<p>LOL! Maybe more specifically, there's something Windows and I should be doing, that we are not doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that my Ethernet Network has not selected Microsoft Network Adapter Multiplexor Protocol.
</p>

<p>What happens if I install this "Microsoft Network Adapter Multiplexor Protocol"?</p>
<p>Is this why VPN is grumpy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found these two interesting links, but they don't point me in any specific direction.<br />
( Direction? I am lost. That is why I am posting here? )</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, every time I click Diagnose (hiding behind Properties popup in above capture), I get errors after installing Windows. Microsoft Research did something here, and the errors are gone in this particular&nbsp; Windows installation, but I still can't install
 VPN without errors. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Very simply, the batcmd files runs as follows:</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Refresh Deleted Files That Came With My PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dallinlaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Refresh Deleted Files That Came With My PC</h2>
                    <p>So I kept having serious issues with my computer. it would randomly stop working for no apparent reason. So I did a restart. In the description, it said that it would keep all the files that came with my computer. This did not happen. After the restart,
 my computer came with fewer files than when I had just taken it out of the box for the first time (excluding the windows.old file). It deleted all of my Lenovo applications including things such as Power2go, PowerDVD10, some cisco stuff, Intel rapid storage/management
 engine components, LVT, Adobe(Air, acrobat reader DC) and others that I may have missed. Now I'm fine with most of the stuff that was deleted&nbsp;like Autodesk, any games, Chrome, Grammarly, literally all my personal files, etc. So I'm wondering, is there any
 way to get back all those applications to working condition (I grabbed the files from windows.old but they don't work) short of just going to the Best But I got it from and having them get the software/ completely wipe and redo my PC. The warranty&nbsp;should still
 be in effect (and probably the protection plan as well, I got it September 2015). However, any suggestions including agreement with me taking it back is&nbsp;welcome. (of course) I'd prefer if there was one place for me to get all my missing files back and if somehow
 you find that tell me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dallin Law</p>

<p>Hi Ralph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have recently upgraded the operating system of your PC, it is best that you also check for updated sound and device driver. To help us identify the appropriate solution to your concern, we would like to ask for additional details.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the current build and version of your Windows 10 device?</li><li>Were you able to check for pending driver updates?</li><li>Have you checked with the device manufacturer if they have a compatible driver available?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We will wait for your response. </p>

<p>Greetings Jennifer,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said, I have an HP Envy 700-074 desktop computer.&nbsp; It came with windows 8 and I updated it first to windows 8.1 and then later to the free download of windows 10 when it became available. &nbsp; The computer&nbsp; has version: 1703; Build: 15063.726 of windows
 10 now.&nbsp; I have checked with hp's support web site to no avail as far as driver updates go or compatible driver availability.&nbsp; Any input you can come up with would be very much appreciated.&nbsp; Regards,&nbsp; Ralph</p>

<p>Thank you for responding. Since you have already contacted your desktop manufacturer regarding the driver update, we would like to recommend first the basic troubleshooting steps found in this support page article:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix sound problems</a></strong>. Kindly test each suggested solutions from the dropdown list especially the section where its recommended to try the
 generic audio driver.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are done, we would appreciate a feedback so we can further isolate the issue and provide additional help.</p>
<p>

<p>Like so many others it always fails somewhere between 30 and 47% and then tries again. If we could download the file (msi or whatever) then could wait until MS finds a solution to this endless loop.</p>
<p>That way I can turn off windows update (uninstall) without it bugging me every time on the internet.</p>

<h2>            Armored Core Verdict Day</h2>
                    
<p>I Know that the list is expanding monthly for "favorites" but what about games that are still being played. I had to go out and buy another Xbox 360 to keep playing Armored Core Verdict Day when I could have just been playing it on my Xbox One.</p>
<p>Games Like ACVD that are still being played actively should be added to the backwards list it makes sense right?
</p>
<p>I bought my Xbox One for that reason to stop playing the 360 and upgrade but yet I'm on both systems when I could be only on One.
</p>
<p>Is there anything that can be done about this? or is it a waste of time to try and fight for something I'm passionate about?</p>

    <title>Questions about Hot Spot and Spotlight in lock screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prots893  say:</h3>
<h2>            Questions about Hot Spot and Spotlight in lock screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I asked here on forum and found out something but not all answers.</p>
<p>I went yesterday to bed and today after putting my PC out of sleep mode I found Magnifying Glass icons on my log in screen. They are part of spotlight. I never saw them before so I freaked out and googled what they are. I found something about Hot Spot,
 but I probably understood it incorrectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have an option "Turn on Remotely" in windows 10 settings - network&amp;internet - Mobile Hotspot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I can turn on hot spot on my PC through other nearby device. They need to be paired through bluetooth first though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Mobile hot spot has absolutely nothing to do with spotlight lock screen feature,right? It operates whether I am connected through wifi or off or whatever.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. What do you think triggered them to appear now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Since I had both bluetooth and hot spot off (I turned it off after installing windows because they were turned on by default), and even if I found this "Turn On Remotely" option ON, no device would be able to connect to my wifi or PC in first place since
 I turned bluetooth off right after windows installation, right? They would still need to accept bluetooth pairing invitation,and they have no physical access here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>4.so I should be safe,right?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>5. When I installed windows,I had bluetooth and mobile hot spot turned ON by default, is option "Turn On Remotely" turned on by default as well?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
Under mobile hot spot I of course mean PC hot spot, it is just named that way in windows settings.</p>

            Hi Prots893 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Mobile hotspot has nothing to do with windows spotlight, correct.
<br />
<br />They probably appeared from an update that ran on your PC.  Updates will sometimes unfortunately change features.
<br />
<br />And correct if your bluetooth is off then you would need to turn it on.  
<br />You can fully disable it which i do on my kids PCs.  
<br />To do that right click start button and go to device manager.
<br />Expand Bluetooth and right click you bluetooth radio adapter and disable it.
<br />Just remember if you need it you have to go back to device manager to enable it.
<br />You do that an your safe.

            Hi Prots893 
<br />I have responded on your other thread.
<br />1) Right, the links are not connected to the hotspot settings. 
<br />2) I wish I knew, perhaps I could get rid of them so that I could see the picture properly. most likely a windows update.
<br />3) Right. the devices would need to be paired and Bluetooth switched on on both. 
<br />4) Yes. nothing here to indicate otherwise.
<br />5) surprisingly (in my opinion) it seems that it is on by default, but, as above, the triggering device needs to be paired and within the range of Bluetooth which is about 10m.

<h2>            Receive error wuaueng.dll missing when trying to run Windows Updates</h2>
                    <p>I've been having problems with Windows Update and can't get it to run. &nbsp;I've searched for hours attempting various solutions, but the problem remains (though on occasion, the error codes I receive will change). &nbsp;But in summary, I cannot start the Windows
 Update Service (wuauserv). &nbsp;One of the solutions I attempted was to register a plethora of DLLs, and in doing so, I found that wuaueng.dll does not exist on my computer, so perhaps this is the cause of the error. &nbsp;I tried downloading various versions online,
 but when I try to register it, I either get an error that it is not found, or that it is not compatible.</p>
<p>Additionally, I do not see the "Automatic Update Service". &nbsp;I've tried running Microsoft Fix It (default and aggressive) but every time it says "Service 'Windows Update' (WUAUSERV) failed to start. &nbsp;Verify that you have sufficient privileges to start system
 services." &nbsp;Of course I do.</p>

            On <strong>which</strong> edition of Windows and <strong>what</strong> Service Pack level, please ?<br />
<br />
As to the updating services name, in XP it's called the&nbsp;Automatic Updates service.<br />
In Vista/Windows 7 it's name is the Windows Update service.<br />
<br />
If the Fixit is giving that message in <strong>XP</strong> then the most likely cause of the AU service's failure to run&nbsp;or not being present is malware.<br />
Open the services console by pressing the <strong>Win</strong>dows key + <strong>
R</strong> simultaneously. In the&nbsp;<strong>Open</strong>: field type in&nbsp;<strong>services.msc</strong>, then click OK.<br />

<p>Please answer all of the following diagnostic questions by number in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. What anti-virus application or security suite is installed and is your subscription current?&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender)?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>2. Has a(nother) Norton application or a McAfee application ever been installed on this computer?</p>
<p>3. Did a Norton free-trial or a McAfee free-trial come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>

<p>1. Currently running Avast, though it does not work under the current conditions, gives an error about some side-by-side configuration. &nbsp;Searching showed that the error stems from Windows Update not running. &nbsp;No third party firewall. &nbsp;I also run SuperAntiSpyware.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Norton and McAfee have never been installed.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;There may have been a free trial of Norton on it some time ago, but I removed it (about 2 years ago).</p>

<p>The computer is about 2 years old. &nbsp;First antivirus used was ESET's NOD32, followed by Avast about a year ago. &nbsp;Yes, I did uninstall NOD32 (expired) before Avast and WU was most likely fully updated. &nbsp;The WU error first occurred about a month or two ago,
 by the way. &nbsp;I ran the tool you linked but it didn't solve the Fix It error, sadly.</p>

<p><br />
Your NOD32 subscription had already expired by the time you replaced it with Avast?</p>
<p>Did these Windows Update problems start about a year ago, too?</p>

<h2>            help with syncing bellsouth mail in windows 10 mail app</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp; was able to get yahoo in windows 10 app and works great. I have tried and tried with Bellsouth. I do not have a Bellsouth legacy account.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a later Bellsouth account. When I look under my Bellsouth account properties it shows&nbsp; POP3 server as
<em><strong>inbound.att.net&nbsp; </strong></em>and where it gives the port later it has 995.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outgoing it shows: outbound. att.net:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and where it give smpt port there is 25.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried and tried and part of the time I get mail error code when it does not sync and the other times I get incoming serves code not recognized or no code at all.
</p>
<p>I tried chatting with&nbsp;ATT and they did not act like they knew what I was talking about and then connected me with Uverse and I cannot get where I live rurally, I have the highest speed for DSL.&nbsp;&nbsp; UVESE chat said someone would call. That was about 4 days
 ago, no ca and still haven't solved my problem. I have an older computer where I can access Bellsouth email at his time. The reason for new computer due to many issues with older one.
</p>
<p>Can anyone help me.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            All I might suggest is to go to their site and check if there has been a change or an addition of some Port numbers you can use for your mail.&nbsp; A couple of years ago Time Warner added some additional ones and I use those now.

    <title>Windows 10 Wont Show My SD Card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> psychocat1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Wont Show My SD Card</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10 on a Lenovo Ideapad 310. When i put in my SD card, the task bar shows that an SD is in and i can eject it but I cant find it in the This PC area. I troubleshoot it once and it showed. But i couldnt open it. I ejected the SD and put another
 one in. That one aint showing either. But again, i can eject it from the task bar. No troubleshooting fixes it. I tried the SD troubleshoot AND the Hardware and Devices troubleshoot. Both said there are no issues.</p>
<p>I honestly dont know why doing some things on Win 10 is so hard. Sometimes its the simplist of things. There may be something im missing but i never had this issue with Win7 or any issues at all. It seemed to know what to do and told me if i needed something.
 Win 10 leaves it a mystery. Ive been on this forum so many times for issues with Win 10. And i can easily figure things out, even on MAC. And I NEVER use MAC. But my gf does. And i can fix issues on here. Win 10? 7 chances out of 10 i cant.... If there is
 a Win 11, i hope to God its a lot like Win 7.... I know noone here has no control over the OS and who makes it but still. Maybe word will and is getting to them that Win 10 is just as bad as 8 sometimes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, after that little rant, how the heck do i fix my issue?</p>

<p>Sorry. I just now finally have the chance to reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get no error messages. It just dosent show. I found one SD that shows up with no issues. But my others wont show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 version is 1709 (OS Build 16299. 192) Which is not completely up to date but i was told by a verified person on here that i dont need to update until its a Feature Update. But im kind of scared to let it update because the last time i let Windows
 update, my install shield files were corrupt and i couldnt install older games anymore. Or even plays the ones already installed. And it seemed to screw up a lot of things. So i just reset the whole computer and customized it the way i want it to be.

<h2>            I&#39;m curious....</h2>
                    
<p>why is it that everyone plays CoD?</p>
<p>I played MW2 (my first and only CoD), I thought it was a cool game. The campaign was action packed and fun (however brief). Spec-Ops mode was really nice, lots of cool challenges there. And it had some fun multiplayer....or you know, would have had one if
 it wasn't for the most frustrating respawn system I've ever seen in a shooter, campers at every corner, glitches without end, and cheaters in every other lobby you stumbled into.</p>
<p>To be more specific the spawning and campers really threw me off at first and I didn't like MP much, but since friends played I stuck with it, learned how to play best in those situations and made my peace with the MP. Then the glitch abuse and cheaters
 started popping up wihtout end. Again I stuck around expecting this would get fixed at some point...it never did.</p>
<p>Overall, I had some good times with the game, but I definitely felt like the developer didn't show enough care with its handling of the online component, and that to me is pretty off putting (also, $15 map packs...really? Are we as gamers that easy to swindle?).</p>
<p>Now because of these things I held off on a Black Ops purchase (despite all my friends running out and buying it) to sit back see how the game had changed. I read some reviews, asked my friends...consensus seems to be it's about the same game. Yet all my
 friends who had the same complaint as me about MW2 continued to play Black Ops, even though according to them very little had changed. I asked them why then? Why not try another online shooter? It's not like there aren't plenty to choose from after all, if
 there's a genre with options, it's shooters. None of them seems to have a great answer except "it's Call of Duty".</p>
<p>So I ask you now, assuming that since you're here a good majority of you are big CoD fans. What makes it so special that 20 million people will choose to buy this, rather than spread out across other shooters?
</p>
<p>This year for example will see the release of Gears 3 and Battlefield 3. From what I've seen both of those game blow anything CoD has done in the last 2 years completely out of the water (in my own opinion of course), still I'm quite certain MW3 will handily
 outsell them. It just completely baffles my mind that CoD manages to trump sales record year after year on launch despite so little innovation (if any). Again, please don't misunderstand me, CoD is certainly good and hell even great when things are running
 smoothly. But surely it isn't good enough to deserve 20 million every year when there are so many other (and often quite arguably more deserving) games out there is it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I realize I just went on a huge rant and if you beared with me through all that I appreciate it. I just want some thoughts from you guys as to what makes this game such a phenomenom.</p>

<p>It just grew big, and now if you don't buy it, all your friends will and you'll be playing your other shooter taking 5 minutes to get into a game and thinking to yourself you should have just kept the game. Personally i think your first cod should have been
 CoD: 5 or CoD:4. Dissapointing you got in late. But good you see it from a different angle.</p>

<p>I think that the easiness of the games is a major factor in why people play Cod. Minimal skill is required for online multiplayer. There are perks and weapons that can be used as crutches for new / bad players. Since you have these crutches, almost anyone
 can get on, play a round and get some kills. They still might get completely destroyed, but the crutches lessen the extent of their destruction by other players. (painkiller, anyone?) Killstreaks also contribute to this. A terrible player might manage to get
 a care package (or steal one). They could then get a chopper gunner and destroy everyone else. By having things like killstreaks and "crutch" weaponry and perks, bad players can have a funner time playing the game than they would have without them. It's this
 which makes the game accessible for many people of different skill levels to play. It's reaching out to the "casual gamer", which attracts a whole lot of people.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's why I believe everyone plays Cod. Now, why people buy Cod games every year that have little innovation..I don't know. It's their money.</p>

<p>Wow, so many things wrong in a few short sentences.&nbsp; Its amusing to think that if you dont play COD, its impossible to get into any other game online.&nbsp; Homefront takes me a few seconds to find a match, BC 2 takes only a couple seconds to get into Vietnam
 or vanilla, MOH, a game that has 1000 players on daily, I can still get into a match within seconds.&nbsp; COD isnt the must own game.&nbsp; Its just an easy game that anyone can pick up and be good at.&nbsp; Personally, I think everyone should have started COD with either
 COD 1 or 2, or even 3, its a shame YOU started playing COD so late, because the games before COD 4 were so much better, more balanced, better host migration and maps, better hitboxes, and no lame perks or computers in the MP.&nbsp; Had to work for kills.&nbsp; Everytime
 I pop BC 2 in or MOH and play it online I think to myself, man Im glad I dont play COD anymore.</p>

<p>My friends were on Xbox live a couple years before I got into it and the game they told me to get was COD4. I had a summer where almost every night we played that game. So naturally, I kept up with the series. I like it because I think its a good game, but
 its just a game my group of friends likes to play. That doesnt mean I dont play other games though.

<p>it has the "cool factor" right now</p>
<p>its the same idea as "wow you never saw the Hangover what are you a loser?"</p>
<p>its gotten to the point where its "wow you have a 360 and you play fable 3 but not call of duty wow what a loser"</p>
<p>of course, going into the "Mainstream" always results in negative final products</p>
<p>EA knows people will buy the next Madden no matter what simply because it is Madden, developers have realized that people will buy COD simply because it is caused</p>
<p>at the same time, COD has caused a dozen of carbon copys now and innovation is lacking</p>
<p>Yes, it is true that Brink has several problems with it, but it is a fact that even if it was a good game and consistently received 8.0s and 9.0s it would not be heavily purchased because it is a new franchise, and is nothing like your "typical shooter"
 ala cod, battlefield, etc.</p>
<p>I loved playing crysis 2 for the first couple months it came out, but a. people had no clue how to play, and b. it did not have a heavy online community, im assuming because it is not something u were able to pick up on the first day and become pro at, cod
 is essentially pick up and play yet also the prestige of the hardcore community, although i feel as if that is decreasing</p>

<p>i first got my xbox in 2007 so i obviously picked up cod 4, but i didnt forget to buy the other games and play online like some people forget to do. personally all the reason people like it is because its easy to pick up and play its easy to do "good" in.&nbsp;

<p>Exactly.&nbsp; COD is easy to pick up, easy to do well, which is why every kid out there under the age of reason plays it, because it doesnt require any kind of thought.&nbsp; Pick it up, run around the map, guaranteed 5-6 kills before you die.&nbsp; Yes I picked COD 4
 up when it first came out, and thought it was good, but after a month or two, I thought, wow this game really isnt that great.&nbsp; It got boring, and felt half the stuff in it was just cheap.</p>

<p>COD will be COD (obviously with the same engine) but hopefully the graphics and sound get a huge upgrade. I mean CODs "play" fine and I have lots of fun with it. I do believe its time for graphics and sound to "step up" though.</p>

            <p>Its a convenience factor. Sometimes it takes say 10 seconds for the progress bar to complete. If you are moving among a number of folders this can be anoying.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folders do not contain large files. Many times they just contain Url's.</p>

            <p>I tried one of the suggestions, changing the properties of the folder but that did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have hesitated turning off the indexing function but will try that next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;researched online and came across numerous articles that called this progress bar effect a bug in the OS. This is another reason why I have held off turning off the indexing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen the same problem on my laptop (Vista x32) and seem to remember it back on Xp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to think about it a bit more before doing further work. This the main computer and I tend to be careful doing experiments on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the thorough replies.</p>

            Does the progress bar impact you?&nbsp; When I've seen it myself, it might be up there running, but all my files are ready for me anyway, so I just ignore it.&nbsp; Is yours actually hindering something?

    <title>Sony Bluetooth overhead headphones MDR-100 connects, but dot do not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lorenzobraghieri  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sony Bluetooth overhead headphones MDR-100 connects, but dot do not work</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Before the last Microsoft update on my New Surface Pro, when I turned on the headphones, they automatically connected and worked just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, whenever I switch them on, I have to manually open the bluetooth settings and click on the "connect" button, which is very much frustrating. If I do not do this operation, the headphones connect but do not transmit any audio!!!</p>
<p>I tried to solve this by going into the bluetooth support service and turning the startup to "automatic", but this still keeps happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I solve this very annoying problem?</p>
