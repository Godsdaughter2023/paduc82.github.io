    <title>Accidently made all accounts standard and now have no admin - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Accidently made all accounts standard and now have no admin permissions</h2>
                    I was attempting to setup Parental Controls. I setup an second account. I switched this account from a standard account to an admin account... or so I thought. I then changed my initial account to a standard account so I could set up the parental controls
 for it. However, when I went to log in to what I thought was the new admin account, I found that it was still a standard account. Now I have no admin accounts. I have attempted to enable the Hidden Admin Account... but in some bizarre windows black hole...
 I need admin rights to do so. Next I tried to use Gateways Recovery Management tool to Restore back to Factory setting.... but that also requires admin right. I also tried to boot in safe mode, but pushing F8 or Shift+F8 as I have seen recommended does nothing.
 Gateway support has washed their hands and says I need to pay for a Recovery USB.... which pisses me off considering the PC has been in my possession for about 10 minutes! Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks for the response. The problem has gone away under its own power. I have concluded that my Dell computer is haunted. It does things all on its own, usually things to pi..s me off. If it acts up again I'll let you know and we&nbsp;can have a prayer vigil for
 it just prior to my taking a hammer to it.</p>

    <title>Rollback Win 10 by Command Line Utility&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> galanb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rollback Win 10 by Command Line Utility&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am helping a friend. &nbsp;He successfully completed his Win 10 upgrade from Win 7 Home edition. &nbsp;Today he issued a shutdown of Win 10 and went out; he thought the laptop had shutdown. &nbsp;When he came back the screen was flashing (in some way-haven't seen it
 myself yet) and clearly it had not completed the shutdown. &nbsp;Now he cannot boot his laptop, and when he tried to go into Safe Mode (with networking) he is getting a message which sounds to me like the system config file is corrupted. &nbsp;There are no restore points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He is still within the 30 days as he only did the update to Win 10 yesterday. &nbsp;As he cannot get the laptop to boot into Windows to allow him to rollback to his Win 7 system (and then roll forward after to Win 10), I was wondering if anyone knows how to or
 if it is possible to do the rollback to Win 7 using the command line utility CMD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you Sumit for your reply. &nbsp;I have now got my friend's notebook in my hands. &nbsp;Unfortunately the Repair option does not work. &nbsp;I have also booted up from my own Win 10 Recovery Disk and tried repair from there, but the result is the same. &nbsp;It seems that
 the system configuration file is corrrupt. &nbsp;Using the Command Prompt, I looked to see if there was a backup copy in ...system32\config\RegBack but the folder is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only as a last resort do I want to do a Win 10 system Refresh as it will wipe out all the apps he has installed on his notebook, and it would take him a while to reinstall them all. &nbsp;Fortunately he does have a backup of his personal files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... still looking for a viable, manual method to roll back ...</p>

                    <p>Is anyone else having trouble getting onto fallout shelter? I was playing it just fine yesterday, saved the game and exited it. Then when I came back to it a couple of hours later it comes up saying 'something went wrong' and my screen gets stuck on syncing data. Nothing loads after this and I've waited for an hour with it being stuck on this screen. (Only had one bloody save! Surely it wouldn't take over an hour!)</p><p><br /></p><p>I've tried uninstalling the game twice now and that hadn't made any difference!&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Anyone got any ideas as to what I can do next? Or if anyone else has/is experiencing this?</p><p><br /></p><p>Many thanks from your friendly neighbourhood Domosaur xx</p>

<h2>            Batman Arkham City &#40;PC&#41; GFWL update errors 0x80072741 and 0x80004005.</h2>
                    <br />
IM posting on here as the GFWL forum fails to respond, so hedging my bets so speak..<br />
Everybody's most hated platform GFWL, fails to retrieve updates upon trying to log in for Batman Arkham City PC.<br />
Without a successful log in,&nbsp; players you cannot save their progress or retireve much needed patches for the game.<br />
<br />
I repeat I CANNOT log in to GFWL. so&nbsp; please do not start your answer with "log in GFWL..."<br />
Secondly I have already tried uninstalling and reinstalling the GFWL client, and the Batman game itself.<br />
<br />
GFWL finds my profile, but then I get the following of two error mesages.<br />
<br />
"failed to retrieve update. You are not connect to the internet.&nbsp; 0x80072741 or 0x80004005" Try microsoft support.<br />
<br />
Really?<br />
1) My service provider panel tells me I've been continously connected for the last 11hrs.<br />
2) If im not connected how did you find my profile hmmm!??<br />
3) Microsoft support has so far not providedanswers for errors 0x80072741 or 0x80004005. I have noticed these errors have being reported by other users(older posts over two years old I might add) for both the Dirt 2 and Dark Souls games, but no resolution was
 provided.<br />
<br />
Do any of the support staff know how to fix this frustrating and tiresome problem.<br />
<br />
Im running on Windowx XP<br />

            Hi Sharwin
<br />
<br />This is not actually an issue with Windows, it is a known hardware issue with the  HP ProBook 430. This problem is reported all over the HP forums in relation to that model and HP have not produced a fix for this . . .
<br />
<br /><a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Business-Notebooks/Probook-430-G5-coil-whine/td-p/6532337" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Business-Notebook...</a>
<br />
<br />If I were you, I would contact HP and demand a replacement device, because they know this problem exists . . .

            Hi yasserfadel,<br />
<br />
What exactly is happening here? <br />
<br />
Are you getting any error message while installing?<br />
<br />
If so, what is the error message?<br />
<br />
Please understand that there could be various reasons contributing to this issue. Without knowing the exact scenario or the exact error code, we can only provide generic solutions.<br />
<br />
How about the devices for which you’re trying to install the drivers for? Are they working?<br />
Please verify the details from Device Manager.<br />
<strong><br />
To go to device manager:</strong> <br />
<br />
1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to start and type device manager.<br />
2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select device manager from the control panel list.<br />
3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the device list, see if there’s any exclamation mark or error reported for the devices whose driver installation failed<br />
<br />
&nbsp;If device manager reports any error message/error code, please post the error code in your next post.<br />
<br />

Regards,<br />

<h2>            How to prevent windows messenger from popping up at startup</h2>
                    At bootup, live messenger starts up as does yahoo messenger.We have to minimize it or close it each startup.&nbsp;We do not use windows live messenger, and would like to config the startup program to prevent this. In win XP, I could simply go to the C:/docs
 &amp; settings/all users/startup/programs/startup and select what I want to startup, or simply delete it in all programs/startup. &nbsp;I can't find this path in win 7

            <p><span>Hi Lee,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and we are happy to help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The System Volume Information folder is a hidden system folder that the System Restore tool uses to store its information and restore points.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can prevent the system from creating restore points in your Pen drive by following these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type system restore in the search bar and select <strong>
Create a restore point</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Enter password if the system prompts.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>System protection</strong> tab and click on the
<strong>Configure</strong> button.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Under <strong>Restore settings</strong> click on <strong>
Disable System protection</strong> option.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now that you have disabled the restore points from being created on the Pen drive, you can now take ownership of the system volume information folder and delete it. System volume information folder is a hidden system folder and usually you don’t have
 access to it. So, you have to first take ownership of the folder and then delete it. Connect the Pen drive and follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press Windows + E from the Keyboard to open the File Explorer.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select View menu and click on Options drop down.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>Change folders and search options</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>View</strong> tab and under <strong>Advanced settings</strong> click on
<strong>Show hidden files, folders and drives </strong>option.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now, go to the Pen drive and right click on the Volume system information folder and click on
<strong>properties</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab, click <strong>Advanced</strong>, and then click
<strong>Change</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type the name of the person you want to give ownership to and click
<strong>Check Names</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The user name that you’re giving ownership to should be display, click
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you want that person to be the owner of files and subfolders in this folder, select the
<strong>Replace owner on sub containers and objects</strong> check box and click <strong>
OK</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now, you can delete the folder.</p>
</li></ol>

            <p>Sorry <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/76d89af8-1bf9-44f8-ab13-5603cc1e755b" title="Harshavardhan Rathod">
Harshavardhan Rathod </a>, but your information is not that much helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make the matter so much more stupid, I got this "System Volume Information" being created even on my Kindle e-book reader !! Can you believe that ? (I know that for windows the USB memory of my Kindle is treated the same as any normal pen drive, but nonetheless,
 what use is this folder on my Kindle device ?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no "Security" tab in the Properties window for this folder on any of my pen disks; maybe this is because my Windows 10 is the Home Edition ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is not of deleting the folder from my USB drive (Kindle reader among them), but as to PREVENT doing this again in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As another strange I found about "System restore" manager: in the System restore configuration window I do NOT see any of my USB devices at all.</p>
<p>This one is even stranger, isn't it ? So then why does the folder is created ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the only decent way to remove the folder is to connect the USB drive to my Linux box and ... simply remove the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I'm getting tired of this "game"..... windows creates this folder on the USB drive (for no reason, in my opinion) and Linux (is capable of) deleting it !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any option in the settings, or even a registry key that I should create/modify and thus prevent Windows 10 from creating this folder on any of my USB drives ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tips I found so far are more or less adapted to WIndows 8.1 or maybe Windows 7, but not workeable anymore in Windows 10.</p>
<p>For instance, I can't find any Window Search key in my HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows .</p>
<p>Is it normal ?</p>
<p>Is it located somewhere else ?</p>
<p />

<p>None of the replies I have seen from Microsoft actually address the issue, I suspect that the programmers responsible for this bug are not being contacted by the Customer service reps that moderate the forums here.&nbsp; "The left hand knoweth not what the right
 hand doeth."</p>

    <title>How to Disable UAC Alt-Tabbing me out of Programs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zibathy  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Disable UAC Alt-Tabbing me out of Programs</h2>
                    <p>I have an administrator and user account on my computer for security purposes (mostly against viruses and such) so I want the pop ups to REMAIN, but I am TIRED of them kicking me out of any program I'm using just to show me them. I don't care enough to have
 it ruin every single experience I have on my computer in the middle of what I do. Updates for things like my antivirus software, random other things, always prompt me and kick me out of any game I'm playing, killing me every time. It's frustrating. Why did
 you guys even design it this way? Why? It makes no sense. How does kicking someone out of a program just to have them click "no" assist them more than even just a sound effect to let them know access was denied to something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me how to make it stop kicking me out of games. Please. It's so frustrating. I set it to the setting just below the highest on the UAC, but that didn't make a single difference, just made it so my screen isn't completely impossible to interact
 with when I'm staring at my desktop doing nothing anyways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a sneaking suspicion that a setting to not have popups that ruin any program you use doesn't exist, due to the genius of Microsoft, but I figured I'd ask anyways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. Again, I know how to use UAC, I just want the pop ups to stop kicking me out of everything while still making it so altering my computer requires a password. They aren't more important than everything else in my life.</p>

<p>You have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable UAC.</li><li>Use games that are Windows 10 compatible, i.e. games that refrain from attempting to perform privileged functions such as modifying protected registry keys or altering files in System folders (C:\Windows, C:\Program Files etc).</li></ul>

    <title>JAWS 18 not working with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trouble156  say:</h3>
<h2>            JAWS 18 not working with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Already tried with Microsoft accessibility staff and, so far, they've managed to duplicate my entire external back-up drive as part of an account to "fix" the problem with Windows 10 that they say is a problem is with the account I had and not the OS itself....&nbsp;
 So, now my computer is running at a quarter of the speed it should, still doesn't have the quick keys working properly and half my files and programs seem to have disappeared or are missing (I'm sure there somewhere... but, because things were duplicated and
 moved.... who knows where they actually are).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, if anyone has seen this happen before and actually knows how to fix this, I'd greatly appreciate the help.... tired of dealing with incompetents at Microsoft.</p>

<p>&nbsp;As of just after I wrote this I received the patch from your level III tax in your accessibility office which turned off my sound card so now I can't access my computer at all so I don't know where any of the files are &nbsp;as for whether or not the computer
 was working fine before I had called into your tech department as soon as I put in a clean version on a brand-new hard solid-state drive a brand-new version of windows 10 pro and I got errors before I install of anything else &nbsp;at that point in time your tech
 department did a similar thing they created another account didn't fix the problem the pop the problem replicated got worse then another tech went into my computer and turned off the sound card because I'm blind and I use jaws and I need my soundcard in order
 to &nbsp;in order to access my computer I couldn't get into it and because it was the normal people's tech department as soon as they couldn't figure out how to go ahead and deal with it and they realized I was blind they started yelling at me because I called
 the wrong "" department that people like you don't belong &nbsp;people like you shouldn't be calling the normal people's department people like you should be calling the disabled people's department even know the problem I was having had nothing to do with accessibility
 and therefore they should've been able to deal with it like anybody else's computer &nbsp;I was forced to transfer over to the disability department where they swore up and down they go ahead and fix the problem they created by turning off my soundcard but of course
 they couldn't because well they need is a sighted person in my apartment and what was the first thing they did ask me for a sighted person to get on the phone and where was the person who &nbsp;Who left her with me where was the person who assists me all the time
 when I informed them that I don't have people assisting me I take care of myself I take care of my own affairs I live on my own it was as if that wasn't possible so to add insult to injury and they start acting like I'm to competent &nbsp;to company and to deal
 with two carpeting to help even though I bought your product and the product wasn't working and now they broke my machine they didn't offer to pay for somebody to come physically into my bed and into my apartment to fix my computer that they broke it shave
 now broken again &nbsp;so to answer your question no it hasn't always worked windows 10 has been faulty out of the box and your tech department hasn't fixed it I spent three weeks trying to work with your tech people and all they did was break my machine and I
 have to spend $100 fixing my machine myself any other stupid questions from the tech department at Microsoft so you can not help me again</p>

<h2>            Driver for old parallel port&#59; This Device Has a Problem&#58; Code&#61;28 &#40;0x1C&#41;</h2>
                    <p class="contentCodeblock">We run a Dos based application on Windows 98 and I need to find a driver for the on-board parallel port. The motherboard is a ASUS P5GD2-TMX/S. Both the local supplier and ASUS only provide XP and up drivers for the motherboard.
 How can I determine the manufacturer of the parallel port and download the driver directly from their website? I have done this before for the serial port and downloaded and installed a driver from Sunnix, which worked.</p>

    <title>XBox One X losing input HDMI signal from cable box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael a.cross  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBox One X losing input HDMI signal from cable box</h2>
                    <p>Recently my Xbox has been losing the input signal for the cable box. The problems begins by the picture freezing then returning. Then the picture will freeze and a screen will appear saying that the xbox has lost connection and check the input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix this I have to reset my xbox. Remove the TV settings, and cable box settings. Then reset them. This will fix the problem for about a month, then the problem will return, and I have to reset all the setting again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something else that can be done to correct this, so the problem does not re-accrue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hey Michael thanks for taking the time to bring this issue to us!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can definitely understand the frustration behind this but we will need a little more information to better assist with the issue at hand. First things first, how is the reset being done? Has another TV been used? Let us know so we can further assist and
 get this issue resolved!&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Everything works fine and I find the sound and picture quality far superior through the Xbox then just going through the cable box. Also the menu is easier to read. After about a month, the TV picture will start to freeze and jump. The symptoms will get
 worse and I will start to receive a picture showing the back of the Xbox and a message telling me the TV signal has been lost and to check my cable connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unplugging and plugging the cables does not solve the problem. I have contacted my provider thinking the signal was the problem, but it was not. Finally I removed the TV and cable box setting in the Xbox's Setting screen, and then reset the TV and cable
 box setting on the Xbox's Settings screen, and this will solve the problem and again I can enjoy the great picture and sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After about a month the symptoms return. I have tried many different things to correct this problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last time I just removed and reset the TV and cable box setting on the Xbox's Settings screen , I did not touch the cables or the cable box, and no setting were changed on the TV. And the problem went away only to return again last night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No other TV or cable box is used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I very much enjoy the sound and picture quality with this setup. The picture is noticeably sharper then just cable box to TV and the sound is much richer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hey Michael thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This sounds a lot like an update issue on the consoles end. To get this squared away in a way that the issue doesn't return we suggest a reset of the console itself since it would delete said update and get a new copy pushed through, to reset the console:<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">Since the problem might be on the actual OS of the console so we would suggest a
<strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults">Soft Factory Reset</a></strong>
 (while keeping games and apps) <strong>IF AND ONLY IF THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA IS MET:&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">There is a stable network connection.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">The information for all profiles is known (email and passwords)</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Once the setup is complete it will ask if we want to keep settings or manual setup lets do manual setup. Give it a shot and let us know of any changes!</p>
