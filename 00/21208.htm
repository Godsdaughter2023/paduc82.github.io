            Korngear, You have an N82 now? Or Have you just changed your picture?<br />
<br />
Please say the N82 you've got isn't buggy? All the blogs I've read have been very positive.<br />
<br />
All the flagship stores have top customer service I heard, I'm sure a UK one will change that though :D. So yeah no buggy phones.<br />
<br />
I'm looking to get a N82 but just need to know the UK RRP before I buy one from somewhere (Looking Like Import). The UK does not have the N82 sim free yet which I'm getting more and more annoyed about, I can't understand.

I really observing this this phone, seeing if it would have any chance to get a revamped version, only then I will grab it.<br />
Besides, I am currently busy upgrading my pc (It is huge..;)).<br />
Glad you helping bunny to get world domination.:):D

            I almost bought the N95 8GB but lucky it was very hard to get in the UK because of Vodafone's exclusive deal, even sim free very hard to find. I have a stupidly cheap line rental with 3 mobile at the moment because they didn't want me to leave, so I'm
 wanting a sim free phone this time.<br />
Anyways happy I waited cause my N80 has left me wanting a candybar rather than a slider this time, and the N82 Looks spot on! I know there's always problems with the first firmwares (hardware is normally top dollar) so the phone can be buggy for a while, until
 the software writers get sorted, but the N82 being almost the same hardware as N95's might not have these problems. Looking how much your on here you must of seen this thread but one to watch to see any problems with the N82

            You are asking about system functions that are not part of Office for the Mac. Without a macro you cannot delete files from Office apps. Also download the OneDrive app.

            Hi, yooo007.<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting your query on Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
Are you having trouble connecting to WiFi?<br />
<br />
Try restarting your phone and connect on the WiFi again.<br />
<br />
Please check this link on how to connect your phone to WiFi and set it to Auto-connect:

            <p>yooo007, you are not about a Nokia Series 40 like the Nokia 310 based phone but a Nokia Asha Software Platform based phone. Therefore, let us approach this issue from a different angle:</p>
<ol>
<li>Did it work before with another Wi-Fi?</li><li>Which network operator do you have, in which country – in the next step, I go through the network access points with you, and we both double-check the default setting does not block Wi-Fi – some operators send faulty settings which block Wi-Fi not by purpose
 but of&nbsp;coincidence.</li><li>Which Wi-Fi access point do you use (brand, model, and if possible firmware version)? Some are incompatible with Nokia Asha Software Platform, when other Wi-Fi devices are used – if that is the cause, turning off all other devices and restarting the Wi-Fi
 access point might help – at least until you use one of those other devices again.</li></ol>

            <p>3. I face the same symptom with my Nokia Asha 501 with one of my Wi-Fi access points. Therefore, please answer that question.</p>
<p>2. I need the name of your <em>mobile</em> operator to determine its Internet Access Point (APN). In the Nokia Asha Software Platform, those settings relate because if Internet is configured for WAP, it (might) block Wi-Fi auto-connection.</p>

<p>India, I guess. Could you please ask them for the Internet APN in your region. I tried to determine that in the past, but failed with Indian operators. That is one puzzle piece required to address your issue. Go figure!</p>

<p>NOTE: This works only over USB. BT not supported</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attached is the Zip file of the Installer. I have named it .txt, please save the file on your mac as .zip</p>

<h2>            DirectX12 or Nvidia GeForce Crashes every game i have</h2>
                    <p>So here I am with Windows 10, yayy! Except now I can't Play space engineers. I think Okay, this might be their problem and let them know. then I open another game, same problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>the Problem is that whenever I click a menu item on a Directx11 game that's running in full screen mode, the game minimizes itself, and opens the start menu. (Is this not the most astonishingly bizzare thing you've ever heard?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>anyhoo, I was wondering if it is possible to Downgrade DirectX12 back to DirectX11? The helpful Guys that made Space engineers believe DX12 MAY be the issue.... makes sense I guess seeing as there aren't any games that currently support DX12.</p>

            <p>When folks start talking about DirectX and what version is running, I get a little confused.&nbsp; So I may have gotten some incorrect perceptions, but maybe you can correct me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 does run DirectX 12.&nbsp; But your game should run in the DirectX version it was written for.&nbsp; The particular game you mention states it is using DirectX 9.0c so I assume that would be what was responsible for any Bluescreens.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember reading a thread concerning DirectX 9.c specifically, but cannot recall the point of that thread.&nbsp; This is where you may need to correct me.&nbsp; Where does DirectX 12 enter into the picture when the game&nbsp;was written for an earlier version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is strange about your situation is my games run fine once they start.&nbsp; The problems I have&nbsp;had with the latest builds is the Desktop and Video Drivers stopped responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I loaded the latest Nvidia driver this morning and so far have not seen one of those errors.&nbsp; Since your situation seems to be different, it may be more of a DirectX 9 problem than Windows 10.&nbsp; The games I normally run are the Borderlands series, which is
 also DirectX 9.0c.&nbsp; I have Dying Light, which is a DirectX 11 game&nbsp;but have not really been running it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is only recently there has even been a Benchmark which would allow you to even test DirectX 12 and even that test will not work using SLI.</p>

</p><ul>
<li>Purchased a new WP 635 8.1 LTE from an eBay seller</li><li>It was sold as a T-Mobile locked phone, which at the time, was my carrier</li><li>I recently ported my number to AT&amp;T</li><li>Problem is, my phone is locked to the network upon inserting my new SIM card.</li><li>Contacted T-Mobile, they say they don't show the phone as a T-Mobile device and can't unlock it</li><li>Obviously, there's some way to get the unlock code from the manufacturer.</li></ul>

            Thanks very much for your reply. However, T-Mobile is saying that they cannot unlock it from their end because they never locked it in the first place. Isn't there some way that Microsoft can help me out with this?

<p>Hi Marc,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This normally happens when the number you're trying to call is misdialed. Check that you have dialed the number correctly. Remember to select the country from the drop-down, or enter a “+” and then the country code plus the number you want to call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're sure that the number is correctly typed,&nbsp;please respond to this thread with the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you calling a telephone or mobile number?</li><li>Is this a toll-free number?</li><li>Is the number reachable using a phone or mobile?</li></ul>

<p>I used to call the same phone number (landline in Turkey) for the last 5 years.&nbsp; I don't think there is anything wrong with the way I dial the number which is saved under contacts.&nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday, I had to purchase another app to make the call and it worked.
 But what is annoying is that I needed to have a Microsoft account to be able to ask a question.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We faced the same issue twice yesterday.&nbsp; My mother forgot her password and when we asked for a new one and created one, Skype asked my mother to log into the Microsoft website with a user ID.&nbsp; She is 85 years old does not need to go through an exercises
 like this.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 No Default Mail Client Error</h2>
                    
<p>I am using the Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2010 Home Use version.&nbsp; I have tried everything, read all the forums, and continue to get the following error message:&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Either there is no default mail client or the current mail client cannot fulfill
 the messaging request.&nbsp; Please run Microsoft Outlook and set it as the default mail client.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I am on Win 7 64 bit,&nbsp; The Outlook version is 64 bit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Outlook runs fine, otherwise.&nbsp; This is causing all kinds of problems in integrating other programs with Outlook and email.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am open to ideas.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Screen Saver and Screen Timeout not working post update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Screen Saver and Screen Timeout not working post update</h2>
                    Since the last update if I have Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer open on my PC my Screensaver and Screen Timeout setting are no longer working. If I close these browsers everything works fine. I am now forced to use Firefox or Chrome as the screensaver
 and power settings function as intended with either of those browsers. Any ideas why the Microsoft browsers would be preventing my power options from working? TIA

<p>Hi Steven1972,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To know effectively the reason behind this issue, kindly provide the information I need below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is model of the computer?<br />
</li><li><span>Have you installed any third party security software?</span></li><li><span>Have you made any changes prior experiencing this issue?</span></li><li>Which build and version of Windows is currently installed on your computer? <span>
You can find this information by clicking the&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Start&nbsp;</strong></span><span>button, type&nbsp;</span><span><strong>winver</strong></span><span>, and then press&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Enter</strong></span><span>.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I would suggest that you try different power plans and check if there's any changes made in the power settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance. </p>

<p>Thank you for the information you have provided, SteveC1972. Just to add, I'd also like to know if you're using a built-in screensaver or third party screensaver. In the meantime, I suggest that you

create a new user profile </a>and check if the issue persists. <span><span>&nbsp;</span>If the issue doesn't happen in the new user profile, it is possible that your previous user profile is corrupted.</span></p>

                    I have Live ID sign in that works just fine when i sign in on the computer or even the browser on my Touch Pro 2, but My Phone gives me this message whenever i try to log in to retrieve my contacts:<br />
Either the Windows Live ID or password you entered is incorrect. Click Back to try again. If you do not have a Windows Live ID, create a new&nbsp;one

 recognize my log in. I had to do a hard reset on my&nbsp;TP2 which means i had to re-install My Phone. Since then, i have not been able to log in and retrieve my contacts and stuff or sync.&nbsp; Any ideas?<br />

            It sounds like you might not have a Windows Live ID that ends in hotmail.com or live.com.&nbsp; If this is the case, be sure to select
<em>other</em> in the drop down THEN ERASE <em>OTHER</em> from that box and enter in the domain for your email address.&nbsp; For example, if your email address is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, replace all the text with gmail.com.&nbsp; Hopefully this fixes your issue.<br />

            I was able to get all of my old folders imported into Outlook 2013.&nbsp; The first attempt I had selected all folders.&nbsp; Several folders did not import into Outlook.&nbsp; I went back into WLM and selected the Sent Items to export, then into Outlook to import it.&nbsp;
 I did this three times to get the remaining folders into Outlook.

            Skype will not connect or it immediately drops the call. The other person can Skype with other people. Disabling the Commodo firewall does not fix the problem. Reinstalling Skype does not fix the problem. No one has had any suggestions.

    <title>No Field Options in Insert a Field Dialog Box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chatelaine  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Field Options in Insert a Field Dialog Box</h2>
                    Hello All Tech Wizards.<br />
<br />
I am trying to insert variable fields in a template.&nbsp; I go to insert &gt; field &gt; doc automation &gt; field names &gt; doc variable &gt; field codes.&nbsp; In the dialog it says, Insert the value of the document variable named NAME.&nbsp; Problem seems to be on the right side of
 the dialog where it says No field options available.&nbsp; I insert ADDRESS and can't get it to insert the term / name in the document.&nbsp; I've also gone to field codes and tried from there.&nbsp; I've put the terms in quotes, to follow their example and I'm getting nowhere.&nbsp;
 I've got a pending assignment and would like to have this figured out so I can accept it.&nbsp; Thank you for helping me this problem.&nbsp; Have a great weekend!<br />

            What seems to be missing here is whether the document contains a document variable named ADDRESS. When you start a new document, it doesn't contain any document variables, and the only way to create one is to use macro code. Did your assignment include
 instructions for how to do that, or were you supplied with a document that's supposed to contain variables?<br />
<br />
The other part of your question is about the "no field options" on the right side. When you select the DocVariable field name, the dialog will always say that. The DocVariable field has no options, and no input other than the name of the variable. If you want
 to see what options look like, choose a different field type, such as Filename or IncludeText.<br />

            Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; They want a template for a set of legal documents that I will rewrite from their source material.&nbsp; They want a list of variables inserted into each document for several websites, Domaine Name, Business Name, and so forth.&nbsp; So
 I start with a macro code for each variable in the first template, then I can go to doc automation, and insert the doc variables?&nbsp; And then copy them to another document and / or template?&nbsp; Here is a link&nbsp; to give you an idea.&nbsp; http://cl.ly/image/3s3z180R3u0L.&nbsp;

<h2>            Updating nameservers on Squarespace</h2>
                    Hi, I have a domain registered through squarespace and am currently trying to set up my Office 365 email.&nbsp; I'm at the stage of updating my nameservers.&nbsp; There are 8 existing nameservers in the list - do I need to delete these?&nbsp; I've tried simply adding
 the microsoft ones but that doesn't seem to be working.&nbsp; I'm worried about deleting the existing ones in case I lose my hosting etc.&nbsp; Squarespace offers no support for Office 365 (I only just discovered this) due to their deal with GSuite.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.

            Hello Lorna, 
<br />
<br />I am not sure of Squarespace, but if, you can replace it just for one domain and wait for the replication of the servers. post that you can check for that one domain if it works? this way it will not impact all the other domains. 
<br />
<br />Please check below
<br />Change nameservers to set up Office 365 with any domain registrar
<br /><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admin/get-help-with-domains/change-nameservers-at-any-domain-registrar?view=o365-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/admi...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use DNS diagnostics
<br />The Office 365 DNS Diagnostic and DNS configuration
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/2776497/the-office-365-dns-diagnostic-and-dns-configuration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/277649...</a>
<br />
<br />When did you add the new nameservers? usually it takes some time to replicate over internet
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Parmi

                    well seems every time i get a new update something else breaks,this time it is within a program i run it runs and has been running well till now i try and print a report within the program the file will not show up,i have to save the file then find it
 in my documents folder before i can print it,how many other things will break before they get fixed? or is it the responsibility of the person who made the program to fix it? at this point i might just go back to windows 7 it was stable for me

            <p>It is the responsibility of the program originators to ensure their programs run correctly on W10, some programmers will not upgrade their program to be compatible with W10 until the final version is released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try uninstalling the program and install the latest version in compatibility mode with Admin rights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you require a more stable version of W10, suggest you opt out of the Insider program and you will then only receive the most stable version of W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you remain in the Insider program be prepared to receive W10 versions with a few bugs &amp; inconsistencies.</p>
<p>

            There might be a temporary issue with the website and they probably update the main website and for some times it was not accessible, while may be the mobile version of website was working because they didn't update it.

            <p>Hello&nbsp;</p>
<p>This might be the cause for Outlook to stop working and getting that irritating box, and I only learned of this recently:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Routers have ports to receive various things like email, or to be able to access websites. The mail port is 25, and it must be forwarded -- or clear so you can get email. &nbsp;Port forwarding is just a term for making sure the port is clear.<br />
</p>
<p>My Outlook always worked great for years when Verizon owned the FIOS, which is my internet and TV provider. The provided the Router/modem. They could help with the settings for outlook which are not that hard, and anything else that was a bit more technical.
 They never tampered with ports, because I never had these problems before Frontier bought them out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier this year Verizon (FIOS) sold to Frontier Communications in Florida, Texas and I think, New York. Besides having a crappy tech service, they tend to do things like fob off for free bad routers -- you wouldn't know unless you do your due diligence
 -- and close up ports. Then they try to make people pay for "enhanced" tech support. I say BS to that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It wasn't until I learned that Frontier had closed off ALL the ports in my router, including those to my security cameras. My security camera company has techs who can help when you go into the router and forward the ports for my cameras. They can take remote
 access and set up the port forwarding, and I am good to go.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the mail port is not their job. But, either Frontier or I have to take care of the email ports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, check to check to see if your ports are forwarded (or clear) is t go to www.canyouseeme.org and it will list your external IP address already in the box. Then it has a list on the right of common ports. 25 is the smtp port, and there are a few other
 ports for various this and that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked and 25 is closed. All were, but my security camera company fixed the ones for that. I have been trying to open the mail port -- so far unsuccessful -- it should be an easy thing and I'm sure I just don't quite have the right setting. I am going
 to contact the maker of the router for help. I pay rent for that damn router, and personally I think this crappy company Frontier needs to take care of things like most basic port forwarding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They try to force you to you to use their mail &nbsp;-- *** Email address is removed for privacy *** but I don't want to use it. Part of the Verizon deal was I could keep my email. I did everything they said like migrating over at the time they said. But a few months down the road,
 on June 10 exactly, port 25 was closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is worth a try. That is the ONLY explanation I can find for why Outlook is not working. I have all the settings in, AOL provided that. I can use my verizon email. It is all there. But I keep getting that hellish box that pops up and I personally think
 it is because emails can't get through because the port is blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you go to the site, put in 25 in the box for the port you want to test. If your port 25 is blocked, it will say "error." If it is open, it will say in green, "success."&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be interesting in knowing if this blocked port is the culprit in these cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, it would be great to have someone help who knows how to forward the smtp port (25).</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope this helps. I have window 7 professional, 64 bit, and an HP probook. Been using Outlook forever, and this is the first issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't been able to use Outlook since.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS -- it is also a good idea to change the password to your router, create your own, write it down. If you ever do lose it, a "hard re-set" will change everything to default (which also means the security is off on your wi-fi.</p>
<p>I have had nothing but grief with Frontier, which under the guise of "updates" have caused the security to be dropped on my wi fi. That is pretty damn serious when you start to see cars lined up on your street to use free open wi-fi. This company is bad
 news. I say one more thing, after three drops of the security, and I go to another company. If you have Frontier, beware of them -- I don't care how many times they say they have all American workers. What good are they when they can't do basic things like
 get your email working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>good luck,</p>

            <p>If you are using Gmail as your mail server you should be:</p>
<p>1) Configuring your pop mail so it is using Port 995 for "incoming mail";</p>
<p>2) Checking the box that says "This server requires an encrypted connection (SSL)"</p>
<p>3) Using Port 587 for "Outgoing Server",</p>
<p>4) Specifying "TLS" in the drop-down box after "Use the following type of encrypted connection".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event, "Blocked Ports" are NOT the issue.&nbsp; This is an Outlook bug - pure and simple!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After hundreds (1,000s?) of complaints over MANY years, from a myriad of different users like me (who have used various releases of Outlook, with numerous different MS Operating Systems, on many vastly different computers, routers and ISPs, in many different
 parts of the world) its clear that Microsoft clearly does not care about resolving/rectifying the issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember, MS is a VASTLY skilled/resourced/staffed company - not like they couldn't fix this in a wink if they wanted to.&nbsp; But... Microsoft wants us to move to MAPI and the Cloud - NOT to continue using POP 3, which I have not doubt they will simply stop
 supporting at some point in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem appears to be the that (email account) profile becomes corrupted.&nbsp; The only way to fix it is to delete the troublesome Outlook email account (from within Outlook), then recreate it again using EXACTLY THE SAME SETTINGS!

<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks MS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>AND.... how about some better support for us long-time LOYAL MS users that have made choices (like continuing to use POP3) that don't pay you as much as immediately migrating to (i.e. PAYING FOR) the latest/greatest MS whiz-bang?</p>

<p>I have all the setting correct however I do not use gmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had wondered if it was a blocked port, so thanks for clarifying. You have to admit, though, it is really annoying that this box should keep popping up because most people like myself PAID for Outlook. I have the key, the receipt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it isn't anything like incorrect settings or block port, what would trigger this? Why would Outlook work for some intermittently?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to say I want to scream, because for so many years I never had any issues, not with this version of Outlook or the previous one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This did start happening after I had to bring in my notebook computer and get a new hard drive, and I wondered if that had anything to do with it. I thought this, or Frontier buying Verizon (ruled that out). However, I also have upgraded to bigger hard drives
 and added memory before with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like after upgrading to windows 10, the problem stops. So is this microsoft's way of forcing people to upgrade? I really don't want to, obviously, I still wouldn't be using windows 7 pro 64 bit. Why should Microsoft really care? I mean, seriously?
 I paid for it, so it's not like I'm using some free software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone eventually finds a fix, or like others have said, microsoft puts out a patch. Would be nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my notebook will no longer get windows updates. That stopped in April. I have another question in here about that, but nobody ever has an answer either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the prime example of why monopolies are horrid.</p>
<p>thanks and good luck&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Just part of your comment ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How would one go about deleting the Outlook account and recreate it? Would that entail deleting all the emails you have (which are kept in my notebook) and of course, starting over? I would do that if it got Outlook working, but I hate to do anything that
 deletes emails and MOST important, I don't want to change my email. Would it force one to create a new email, or could you use the same?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could create a new account with the same email, and use the correct settings, I would try that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a link to how to do that? Is anyone sure you would still create a new account with the same email?&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've suffered this problem intermittently for years, and now hypothesise that it is actually one type of problem that appears to be another type of problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What it <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">appears</span>&nbsp;to be is a problem with the email account / profile that necessitates regular re-authentication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What it <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">really</span> is is a problem with ones external network connectivity and/or ones local wi-fi connectivity, such that the connection drops, and then when it reactivates Outlook does not realise it has already
 authenticated and asks the account to re-authenticate i.e. the pop-up box appears demanding&nbsp;"Enter your user name and password ...".<br />
<br />
It can readily be proven that it is not a problem with the email account / profile -<br />
<br />
In Accounts Settings, select the problem account, click on Change, then&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">without changing anything</span> click on Test Account Settings ...<br />
<br />
This will send a Test Message to your Inbox.<br />
(If the pop-up box appears during the test, repeat the exercise until you have sent a test message&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">without</span> re-authenticating, just to prove that your current settings do work with no change.)</p>
<p>The fact that the Test Message appears in your Inbox demonstrates that there is nothing wrong with&nbsp;the email account / profile, because the test could not work even once if there were.<br />
<br />
So now how do you actually fix the problem?<br />
<br />
In Accounts Settings, select the problem account, click on Change, then click on More Settings, click on Advanced tab, then on the Server Timeouts setting
<p>
</p><p>My version of Outlook had default 1 minute which I increased to 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Since I made this change, the pop-up box which had been appearing very regularly has not reappeared.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate your help to test this hypothesis - please make a similar change yourself, and then report your results here in due course.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,<br />
Glenn</p>

            <p>Hi Glenn, &nbsp;</p>
<p>Several months ago, my server timeout was set at one minute, like yours. &nbsp;A previous commenter on this thread suggested increasing the time to 5 minutes, so I did. &nbsp;I didn't receive the error popup for about a month, and then it returned. &nbsp;My experience
 is that the popups disappear for up to two months and then return for about a week. &nbsp;Consequently, I'm thinking you need to wait at least 3 months to judge any fix as a success. &nbsp;I do appreciate your excellent efforts and persistence, and I continue to subscribe
 to this thread! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Cindy</p>

            <p>Hello Glenn and thank you for the suggestion and help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was so hopeful because mine has been set on one minute. I upped it to a timeout of six minutes. I also re-checked all the settings, just to be sure they were what they should be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then made sure everywhere the password goes (there are a few spots) have the correct password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it did not work. I tried first thing in the morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried with the test account settings, and just trying to send an email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got two error messages: 1) That the logging into pop 3 failed, due to connection to the server was interrupted.</p>
<p>and 2) your email server rejected your log-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why I don't know, because I made sure the password was put in everywhere it asked for a password and that it is the current password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do those error messages ring a bell with anyone? Is it a timeout, or something else?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed to a t all the settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read previous entries about deleting folders/creating new ones but I did not follow them well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other suggestion? I thought this was a good suggestion, but something else is bedeviling this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>Gina&nbsp;</p>
<p>ps -- let me add, I am not even getting a connection, much less getting rid of that box. Thanks again.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Trying to figure out why Outlook just stopped working is too exhausting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I tried just hitting the send/receive, which I would do occasionally when Outlook worked so well. I got this three "task email" messages, error number 0x800CCC0D and something to the effect can't find server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I think something is wrong with the settings. I am using the ones the server provided. I had verizon, and always could sync with outlook. &nbsp;Even after they transferred to AOL -- migrated -- in April, all was working great. Then in June, June 10, it just stopped.
 I have tried all sorts of settings provided by AOL, and honestly, I can't be sure they are all correct.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would seem not judging from the error messages I am getting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for any suggestion from anyone who might have this issue.</p>
<p>

            <p>I have been struggling with this for years, yes years.</p>
<p>I found that it has to do with the server to which you are trying to access.&nbsp; This happens to me mostly with Hotmail.</p>
<p>When something is happening with the server, outlook times out and tries to resign in, which is when you get the message.&nbsp; The sever host (Microsoft in my case) always denies there is a problem, but it usually fixes itself within a day or two (strange if
 there was nothing wrong in the first place).</p>
<p>So the solution, at least for me, check the email directly on the server site until the problem goes away, and save time trying to fix it. The problem is not on your computer.</p>

</p><p>I did some researches and found out that Skype for business online is working with exchange on-premise, but I haven't found any detailed configuration example or a config guide except this link: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2614242/how-to-integrate-exchange-server-2013-with-lync-server-2013-skype-for</p>
<p>According to this link, to get SfB working in our environment, I would only have to do the steps 1-3? Is this correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is a hybrid environment when you would use Skype for Business online &amp; Skype for Business on-premise server? As in our case we would connect Skype for Business online with our on-premise exchange, this would be a normal Skype for Business Online only environment?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another question would be regarding the archvied conversations: Is it correct that all the data would be stored on the exchange on-premise?</p>
<p>Are there any datas which would be stored in the cloud?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Is a hybrid environment when you would use Skype for Business online &amp; Skype for Business on-premise server?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The answer is yes</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As in our case we would connect Skype for Business online with our on-premise exchange, this would be a normal Skype for Business Online only environment?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The answer is yes (it is not a Hybrid environment)</strong></span></p>

<h2>            Active Sync 6.1 - won&#39;t sync with new Outlook Profile 8503001F</h2>
                    
<p>My Outlook profile got corrupted at work, and I created a new one.&nbsp; I'm now getting the 8503001F error.&nbsp; Saw the advice for identifying a new profile for v.4.3, but I don't think I have the same options with 6.1.&nbsp; I'm running Vista.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any help
 greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
