</p><p>I used Windows Media Player to create a DVD from an SD card.&nbsp; I can view the video in Media Player, but when I take my dvd to a blu ray/dvd player, it says "nothing recorded."&nbsp; The format for the video files is .mts.&nbsp; How do I fix the video so it can be

            <p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the computer. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Sound Recorder, you can record sound as a digital media file on your computer from a variety of devices, such as a microphone that is plugged in to your sound card. The types of audio input sources you can record from depend on the audio devices you
 have, as well as on the input sources that are available on the sound card that is installed on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are experiencing this problem because .mts is not supported by Windows Media Player. Please follow the below link to know the supported files in Windows Media Player.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please post in case you have any further issues, we are happy to help you further.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Asus Z87-K USB 2.0 reports code 43 - A request for the USB device - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Asus Z87-K USB 2.0 reports code 43 - A request for the USB device descriptor failed</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to use a USB 2.0 hub on a new Iiyama 2483HSU monitor with built in powered USB hub. The PC is custom built using Asus Z87-K motherboard, I7 4770 CPU and 8GB Corsair DDR3 dual channel memory.&nbsp;Windows 8.1 reports Code 43 - "A request for the USB
 device descriptor failed". I have tried updating the BIOS, installing all the latest drivers from Asus website, changing the USB cable, I've also run Microsoft Message Analyser as per USB Blog. This confirms it is&nbsp;NOT a BOS descriptor error. Driver version
 is 6.3.9600.16442.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I plug in a flash drive, Windows recognises it, assigns it a drive letter, asks what to do (open folder to view files). I can then read the files but if I try to write a file the write process starts but then stops after a few seconds. Some small files
 can be written to the device before failure occurs and Windows reports "USB Device not recognised" and Device Manager reports the error and states that Windows has stopped the device. The flash drive works OK if plugged directly into a USB socket on the motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Thanks for the suggestion. Here is what I did:</p>
<p>Plugged the monitor into my HP Laptop running Windows 7 using the same USB and HDMI cables. I got exactly the same behaviour (read OK, delete OK, write = failure). I then swapped the USB cable (3m) for another shorter cable (1.5m) I had spare&nbsp;and the USB
 hub worked fine copying a 2GB video file at around 8 - 8.5 MB/s. I then repeated this with my desktop PC running Windows 8.1 - everything still working OK with the shorter cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then used a USB extension cable to connect the monitor to the new shorter cable making the total cable length back to 3m. USB hub still working fine and repeated file copy again to prove it was OK.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion: The 3m USB cable has a fault so I checked the continuity and resistance of each conductor. The USB Vcc and Ground conductors showed 1 Ohm resistance plug to plug. The Data+ and Data- conductors showed 4-5 Ohms resistance each. By comparison all
 the conductors on the shorter cable showed less than 1 Ohm resistance. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I bought what I thought was a decent USB cable with gold contacts from a reputable PC supplier (not any old cable from Ebay) it would appear that this is the cause of the problem. Once I have a new cable I'll confirm everything is still OK.</p>

    <title>Black Screen Caused by display driver Intel hd graphics - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steadiestflame  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black Screen Caused by display driver  Intel hd graphics</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have upgraded from windows 7 to 10 in the last week and ever since I get a black screen before the login page. I have figured out a work around for this which is when I see the black screen I press the function button and f3 at the same time to put my
 laptop in standby and once its in standby then wake it back up by pressing the power button and the login page then appears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is getting rather annoying and I would prefer to not have to do this every time I boot up my laptop. I have done some digging around and noticed when I remove the display driver intel hd graphics version&nbsp;9.17.10.4459 dated 19/05/2016 and allow windows
 to replace this with the Microsoft basic adapter that I can boot my laptop with no black screen at all but unfortunately the screen resolution isn't any good.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there another driver I can use instead of the version? Every time I ask windows to install the latest version it keeps saying I have the latest version, so I am now stuck.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My laptop was on the market since 2011 and I have owned this for over 5 years. It performs really well and it's a shame that I am now getting this issue from upgrading to windows 10, which I need to because windows 7 is on the way out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any display drivers I can use, instead of the version I have got now,&nbsp; or do you know of another work around for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            Hi SF.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS/UEFI firmware (very important), network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) Adjust the screen resolution until it fits and looks best at Settings &gt; System &gt; Display.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            How to invert wedge keyboard function keys</h2>
                    I'm a developer and I just purchased the new Wedge Keyboard as I like the form factor and mobility of it. However, I'm finding it to be very tedious when I'm coding as a lot of shortcut keys range from F5-F12. I'm now forced to press the FN key when I
 want to do this.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a simple way to invert the function of these keys? So pressing it by default would trigger the F* key and with FN it would bring up the windows 8 charms?</div>
                </div>

<p>Hi,</p>

<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/8df6485a-50cc-4cdc-be3e-0f05c7745117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/8df6485a-50cc-4cdc-be3e-0f05c7745117</span></a><br />

-------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before these started? (Check<br />
Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there about the time this started)<br />
Main likely culprits are Video driver, other major drivers, memory, and antivirus/antispyware/security<br />
products could be at fault as well as drive issues.<br />
<br />
Use the troubleshooter below and refer to the next message for drivers and memory when you get to
<br />
those sections and then return back to the troubleshooter as needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong><br />
<br />
The BCCode&nbsp;50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure of installed
<br />
hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or video RAM).</p>
<p>Another common cause is the installation of a faulty system service.</p>
<p>Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.</p>
Resolving the Problem
<p><em>Resolving a faulty hardware problem:</em> If hardware has been added to the system recently, remove it to see
<br />
if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace the faulty component. You should run
<br />
hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's
<br />
manual for your computer.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a faulty system service problem:</em> Disable the service and confirm that this resolves the error. If so,
<br />
contact the manufacturer of the system service about a possible update. If the error occurs during system
<br />
startup, restart your computer, and press F8 at the character-mode menu that displays the operating system
<br />
choices. At the resulting Windows <strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu, choose the
<strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> <br />
option. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</p>
<p><em>Resolving an antivirus software problem:</em> Disable the program and confirm that this resolves the error. If it
<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen
<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other
<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />

BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.
<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,
<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate
<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after
<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check <br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a>

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually
<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)
<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (can happen<br />
when they seem to be identical) and when slower memory is placed in front of faster memory.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.<br />

<h2>            Error Code 800B0100 &#40;Windows Update KB2685813&#41;</h2>
                    I attempted to install the Update for User-Mode Driver Framework version 1.11 for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2685813) the day that it was available on November 13th, 2012.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried multiple times every day since the problem first occurred, but to no avail. This is the error I get every time:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"You may need to restart your computer for this update to take effect.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Installation status: Failed</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Error details: Code 800B0100</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Update type: Recommended"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried everything from downloading the Hotfix tool to having a Microsoft support member remote access my computer to try to fix it. Every time it's error code 800B0100, which I've been told is the unknown error code.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'd greatly appreciate any help whatsoever that anyone can provide, as I believe not having this update has been the root behind some other issues I've been having with my computer recently (including but not limited to fingerprint reader issues, etc.)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you in advance.</div>

            <p><span>Hi QStew,
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to know that you are facing an issue to install
<span>KB2685813. </span></p>
<p>It would be helpful if you could reply to this question to assist you further.</p>
<p>Did you try the steps provided in this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Windows-Update-error-800B0100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you haven’t tried the steps, then try the steps provided in the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Windows-Update-error-800B0100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a> and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span>You may also try performing a clean boot, disable security software and try installing the update.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1:</span></p>
<p>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.
</p>
<p><span>You may refer the following KB article to put the computer in clean boot:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing
 a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>Make sure you put the computer back to Normal Startup once you are done with the troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p>Step 2:</p>
<p><span>Disable third- party antivirus software and firewalls installed on the computer and then try the installation.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Make sure to enable the security software on the computer after installing the update.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This also seems to be an optional update.</span>
<span>During this driver package installation, the package checks the computer to determine what version of UMDF is currently installed, and then the
<b>package updates the files to 1.11 if they are an older version</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>For further information, refer the article.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2685813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">User-Mode Driver Framework version 1.11 update for Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows
 Server 2008 R2</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you it is an optional update and if you are not facing an issue without installing the update, you may also hide this update.</p>
<p><span>Right click the
<b>update </b>in Windows update and select <b>hide.</b></span></p>
<p><span>For further information, refer the suggestions provided by José Antonio Pontón Posada CEO on November 22, 2012.</span></p>

            I did all of this and I still get the Error Code 800B0100. I did the System Update Readiness tool (which I believe is the same as Hotfix), but it didn't work. I ran a clean boot, I turned off all my anti-virus software, I ran an automatic troubleshooter
 that says it fixed all possible 800B0100 errors and registry corruptions, but it's still not installing the update properly.

<p><strong><span>Hi LSSolomon,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1. Have you recently done any changes to the computer?<br />
2. Have you done any changes to the theme settings on the desktop?<br />
<br />
If you have calibration enabled for display then you may disable calibration loading by
<span>Windows.</span> You must be logged on with a user account that has administrative privileges to make the below changes -</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1. Open Color Management by clicking the
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span> button, and then clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span></span><span><span>. In the search box, type
</span></span><span><span><strong>color management</strong></span></span><span><span>, and then click
</span></span><span><span><strong>Color Management</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span></span><span><span>
<br />
2. Click the <span><strong>Advanced</strong></span> tab, and click <span><strong>Change system defaults</strong></span>.<br />
3. Click the <span><strong>Advanced</strong></span> tab in the <span><strong>Color Management - System Defaults</strong></span> dialog box, and do one of the following:
<br />
- To prevent <span>Windows</span> from loading display calibrations, clear the <strong>
<span>Use </span><span>Windows display calibration</span></strong> check box.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Click
<span><strong>Close</strong></span> in the <span><strong>Color Management - System Defaults</strong></span> dialog box.<br />
5. Click <span><strong>Close</strong></span> in the <span><strong>Color Management</strong></span> dialog box.

            <p><em><u>Original Answer</u></em></p>
<p><em>I'm not sure you can do it in paint.</em></p>
<p><em>But you can do it in (free) Paint.net.</em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Goto - </em><a href="http://www.getpaint.net/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>http://www.getpaint.net/index.html</em></a><em> download
</em><em>(AV check it for safety sake, but its fine)</em><em> and install Paint.Net</em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em>There are a few downloads on that page, look for:</em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Get it now (free download):<br />
Paint.NET v3.5.10</p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Open the pictures in Paint.Net and pick 'Adjustments' 'Invert colors' and it seems to do what you want (I think).</em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em>Hope it helps.</em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong><u>Late EDIT</u></strong> - Sorry, bit more fiddling around, it appears you can do it in Paint.</p>
<p>1 load the picture</p>
<p>2 Home - Select - Select All</p>
<p>3 right-click your selected picture and click 'Invert Colors'</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There is also a short cut key(s), just press &lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;shift&gt;&lt;I&gt; keys all at the same time. ( Control Shift i )</p>

<h3> mikydotcom  say:</h3>
<h2>            German Language Keyboard.</h2>
                    I only have one question. Where oh WHERE can i get a German Language Keyboard from--to be compatible with my Windows 7 home premium laptop? I have tried absolutely everywhere and all manner of different sites but to no avail. I'm looking for something
 like a virtual keyboard which presumably sits on my desktop so i can type away whilst studying--i saw this in a windows website and could only access it by joining Windows live i.d--and now i can't find the site!! I am doing a German Language course with the
 open university and desperately need this ''keyboard'' for my studies. Apart from reconfiguring my hard drive to accept such a keyboard--which i am NOT prepared to do!--i really do not know what to do. Any help would be appreciated thanks.

            I am using Windows 8.1 - for most of the last year the computer will run / install Microsoft updates, then in reboot following the installation begin to uninstall the update. &nbsp;This is painful - with the computer tied up for hours going through these steps.
 &nbsp;Now I wish to jump onto Windows 10 but do not have the option to register since the Windows 10 icon is not displayed in the right tray. &nbsp;How can I get the current 64 bit Windows 8.1 to install the updates that will remain installed? &nbsp; &nbsp;

 each time I start my computer, or each time it locks from inactivity, and I have to enter my password.<br />
I have tried a fresh install of Windows without any drivers or programs. A fresh Install of Windows with ONLY the system drivers, and no other programs (Yes, the current ones, I have been building PC's for over 8 years and am quite computer literate). BIOS
 versions are current on both computers as well.<br />
<br />
I have tried searching via Google, but all I could find were posts regarding errors actually being thrown at the user. My PC's don't do that, or display any other symptoms, but these errors are appearing in Action Center, which I do occasionally check for the
 sake of it. It seems to me that this is another consequence of using Windows 8+, as I didn't have any problems on Windows 7.<br />
I am actually considering going back to 7, as the so-called "Gains" from Windows 8.1 aren't really worth putting up with the stupid "Metro" interface, and the sheer "all over the shop" clumsy, disorganized, several options for the same thing in different places*
 that don't change what you want, having to go looking for things that you knew the location of in previous versions, but for some stupid reason have been moved, utter chaos of this O.S. compared to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
*Example: File explorer icon on taskbar - If you right click on it to locate the music, videos, etc. shortcuts, and right click on them to change your directory, it doesn't also set it in the folder shortcuts in the top of the window you have when you actually
 open File Explorer, and vice versa. You have to change your directories there too! Wtf!? On windows 7, you changed what you wanted ONCE, IN ONE PLACE, and that was it!<br />
<br />
Fast, Fluid, Dynamic.... Yeah right! Faster to boot and shut down maybe, but only a little. That doesn't compensate for all the hassle though, Microsoft.<br />
<br />
Just thought it might be worth having a little rant there, just in case Microsoft are listening (which I doubt they are).<br />
<br />
Computers:<br />
<br />
Desktop:<br />
<br />
Liquid Cooled and Overclocked (problems persist with no overclock on a fresh install).<br />
ASUS Maximus V GENE<br />
Intel i5 3570K</p>
<p>8GB DDR3 @ 1333MHz<br />
O.S. drive: Samsung 840 EVO 250GB<br />
Graphics: Asus ROG Poseidon Platinum GTX 780 x1<br />
PSU: Corsair AX860<br />
<br />
Laptop:<br />
<br />
ASUS ROG G750JX<br />
As purchased, Not overclocked at all (can overclock GPU).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am convinced this is a problem with Windows 8.1 and isn't solvable by anyone except Microsoft. As I said, I have tried running the PC's with ONLY Windows 8.1 on it, not even any third party driver software, so what else could it be?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reliability Monitor is an advanced tool that measures hardware and software problems and other changes to your computer. It provides a stability index that ranges from 1 (the least stable) to 10 (the most stable). You can use the index to help evaluate the
 reliability of your computer. Any change you make to your computer or problem that occurs on your computer affects the stability index.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Reliability Monitor is intended for advanced computer users, such as software developers and network administrators.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Form the screenshot which you have attached on your post. It seems that your computer is having issue with “Windows logon interface host”.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can happen if system files are corrupted. Follow these methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Run System file checker tool on the computer and check. If a Windows Resource Protection (WRP) file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For example, some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may
 crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to run check disk on the computer and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Go to Start Page. <br />
b) Type: CMD<br />
c) The Apps page will come up. <br />
d) Right click command prompt<br />
e) Click “Run as Administrator” on the bottom pane.<br />
f) If you get the User Account Control prompt. Click Yes to continue.<br />
g) At the Command Prompt, type Chkdsk /r /f</p>

            <p>Hi, and thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
However, I already know everything you have just told me, and tried everything you have suggested. These would be some of the first steps I would to take whenever having problems with Windows.</p>
<p><br />
As I said, I am quite computer literate, In fact, I have studied I.T at Tafe.<br />
<br />
sfc passes with no integrity violations detected, and there is nothing wrong with the SSD's that are running Windows on either computer.<br />

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to make sure you install all the latest hardware drivers on the computer or else Windows will show the error if proper drivers are not installed. You might also want to install the latest Windows Updates which will fix the Critical security and
 bugs issue on Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Download and install drivers</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also see what information appears in event logs:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press Windows key + X, click Control Panel, </li><li>Click System and Security, and Administrative Tools, and then double-clicking Event Viewer.‌
</li><li>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</li></ol>

            Hi there.<br />
<br />
Sorry to be so blunt, but if you read the original post, you would have seen that I said I have installed all the latest system drivers, all updates for Windows 8.1, and the BIOS is up to date too.<br />
<br />
I will say again, that I have tried a fresh install of Windows, which I fully updated, with all the latest system drivers, and did not install any third party apps/programs, or any other apps from the Microsoft store or elsewhere. All I did was install and
 update Windows and all the drivers, and the problem still persisted. I did this on BOTH of my computers, and left them in this state for two days. I even disconnected them for the network after updates, as I went so far as to not install ESET Smart security
 7. It really was JUST Windows and the system drivers, absolutely nothing that could have caused a conflict was installed at all. The only thing Windows could have conflicted with was Windows itself, and it wouldn't surprise me if it did from what I have seen
 of Windows 8/8.1.<br />
<br />
As this has happened on two computers, and I have gone through the same steps on both of them, and they are totally different systems, it is fairly obvious that it's Windows at fault.<br />
<br />
Are you guys aware that your apps don't work properly either? The built-in PDF app won't let you print, nor will the photo app even though it can see the printer. You tell it to print, it just sits there. Yes, the printer drivers are up to date. The Skype app
 won't let me send files either. I can see them, I can select them, but when I click "Send" it just takes me back to the messaging conversation window and doesn't send the file. It doesn't even attempt to; it just carries on as if you never tried in the first
 place. This happens on both my PC's, the PC's I have used at TAFE, in fact, EVERY PC I have used that is running any version of Windows 8. The standalone version of Skype works perfectly, Standalone programs that you can use in place of other built in apps
 work perfectly too. It's just everything that is built into Windows 8/8.1 that doesn't, and neither does the operating system itself.<br />
<br />
Seriously though... what is the point in having this app system if none of them work properly? That just means that the user has to install standalones, which defeats the point in having these apps in the first place! It means more startup programs, which again,
 defeats the point in Windows 8/8.1, and means that the user may as well just use Windows 7!<br />
<br />
I am sure you are aware of the view that everyone has of Microsoft's Operating systems. They run in a cycle of:<br />
<br />
Good, Bad, Good, Bad, Good, BAD.<br />
<br />
Windows XP - Good. Windows Vista - Bad. Windows 7 - Good. Windows 8/8.1 - BAD!<br />
<br />
Again, sorry to be blunt, and I thank you for taking the time to reply to me, but I think Microsoft should do us, and themselves a favor - Scrap Windows 8 and start again as you did with Vista.
<br />
<br />
I might add that my Laptop originally came with Windows 8 pre-installed. I used it for about 2 days before I got fed up with it, and installed Windows 7 instead. Now, as ASUS released this laptop with Windows 8, they don't provide any drivers for Windows 7,
 so when I installed 7, I had to go and find all the drivers from the manufacturers myself. Surprisingly, Windows 7 ran PERFECTLY - no errors whatsoever.<br />
<br />
I installed Windows 8.1 a couple of months ago, which ASUS do offer drivers and support for, and I now have problems. Just to add a bit of justification to my rant there.<br />
Windows 7 ran fine when I couldn't even get drivers for it, and had to use some Windows 8 drivers instead, but when I install Windows 8/8.1, which the laptop is designed to run, Error central!<br />
<br />
I think I will go back to Windows 7, as it is a better O.S. and actually works properly. That seems to be the only way to solve the problems I am having, as I certainly didn't have any of them before I started using Windows 8/8.1.<br />

            Hi. I tried resetting the reliability monitor yesterday. This reset the Stability scale to 10, however it promptly dropped, as the issue is still not corrected, and I am still getting the "Windows Logon User Interface Host has stopped Working" error in
 the Reliability monitor.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Use your event logs in the Admin tools and try to trace back and find the culprit/culprits. This can also happen due to a faulty driver.<br />
<br />
You need need to provide us with more info. The Event log will help. Use the Problem Reports and Solutions inside the control panel to give you a rough date and time and then back track through the Event Log.</p>

So it looks like logonUI.exe is having a tiff with the nVidia Driver, and that's why I get a notification in the reliability monitor that tells me that Windows logon user interface host stopped working. I have tried various drivers from nvidia, as they recently
 had minor problems with a handful of games in a couple of their drivers, but I'd actually rolled back to a stable one that I was using with Windows 7, and they released a new one yesterday, which fixed everything except this. The problems with the driver only
 affected certain games, and were only little things like micro-stutter, and it wasn't really that bad. The stutter went away when I rolled back to a previous driver, and hasn't come back since the latest update from nVidia, but I only had the stutter on my
 desktop, which obviously, has a different GPU; I didn't get it on my Laptop. However, this logon user interface error occurs on both computers.<br />
<br />
I will repeat for the sake of it, that I have only had this problem since switching to Windows 8.1. I didn't have it at all in Windows 7. I made the switch to 8.1 about mid point between nvidia driver releases, so I'd been using that particular
<strong>stable</strong> driver on Windows 7 for quite some time, and was using the same nvidia driver for a while also after upgrading to Windows 8.1. Since switching to Windows 8.1, nVidia have released 3 drivers, and I have this problem no matter which version
 I use.</p>

<p>hey waj, i am having the exact same issue. are you trying to record bf1 by chance? i tried recording a bf4 footage, and i had no issues, even the 20 min clips.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This only started happening within the last few weeks or so, so i think it might be a game specific issue when recording with shadowplay.</p>

<p>It doesn't. I don't have the English version of Windows, so I can't give the exact message, but it says something like "The problem cannot be identified with Troubleshoot".</p>
<p>
</p><p>@bobbysamsel. I have the same issue with saved Shadowplay recordings of Overwatch and Fortnite. So I don't think it's a game specific issue, but an issue in Shadowplay and Windows.</p>

<h2>            Switching between Chinese simplified and traditional character sets</h2>
                    I have a need to quickly switch between traditional and simplified Chinese in the same document. This has been a major source of frustration ever since upgrading. Is there any way to do this without opening up the language settings control panel in Windows
 8? Previous versions of Windows (7, XP) had a method to change the char set within the language bar.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is this question in the right topic? I do not see any option relating to languages.</div>

            Changing languages is not what I am after. I have to use the Simplified Chinese language as the input method I am using is Microsoft Pinyin, which is only available under Simplified Chinese, however under Simplified Chinese, there is the option to change
 character set to Traditional Chinese.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Thus I am using the Simplified Chinese language setting with Microsoft Pinyin input method to write Traditional Chinese characters. I'd like to know if there is any way to quickly change the character set of a language without opening the control panel.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am aware that it is possible to change languages quickly, but that does not help, as I cannot add a duplicate of the same language (Simplified Chinese) using a different character set, even playing around with the sublanguage settings. If I could add
 a second Simplified Chinese language to the language bar, I could set one to use the Simplified characters and the other to Traditional characters, achieving my goal of retaining the Microsoft Pinyin input method and being able to switch quickly between character
 sets.</div>

            Hi, due to the nature of my work, I faced the same problem on my Windows 8 computer too. To give the technicians a better view of this problem, I "print-screened" the language bar of my Windows 7 laptop.

<div>("写字" and "寫字" are Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese version of "Write" respectively.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>As you can see, I can easily switch between Simplified and Traditional Chinese on my Windows 7 laptop. However, this is not easily done in Windows 8 and I have to go to the control panel to change the settings each time I need to switch between the languages
 (which involves a lot of steps). This is really inconvenient as we may need to type Simplified and Traditional Chinese characters in a document simultaneously. We would be really grateful if anyone has a solution to this problem in Windows 8! Thanks!</div>

MS Help, please help us solve this. This is EXTREMELY annoying when a user can't switch between traditional and simplified Chinese while typing. Going into the menu and changing it (through clicking different bubble) is not the right user interface. Please
 make these changes as this is quintessential Chinese typing feature across China/Taiwan/Hong Kong. Thank you.&nbsp;

            Switching between traditional and simplified characters was (and still is) relatively easy to do with Windows 7. Is there someone at Microsoft WHO USES CHINESE LANGUAGE INPUT DAILY that can address this question? If you don't read, write, and use Chinese
 characters on Windows 8 or above on a daily basis, please do not bother to respond to this question. Thank you. 谢谢你。

<p>After upgrading to Windows 10, i noticed that my PC boots up in seconds,&nbsp;&nbsp; but takes an unusually long time to shut down.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am using a desktop PC with an SSD.&nbsp; i tried turning off all apps (virus protection, malware detector etc.) before shutting down,
 but it didn't make any difference.&nbsp; I just wondered if anyone else is experiencing this,&nbsp; and if i should be concerned.</p>

<h2>            Win 10 - Taskbar Overlaps Start Menu, Max Windows, System Tray popups, Bottom of  all - No Solution Found</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Anniversary Update installed, my locked taskbar overlaps the bottom of my Start Menu, Maxed Windows, Systems Tray popups.&nbsp; Windows doesn't think that the taskbar is there, so the bottom of everything is hidden behind the taskbar.&nbsp; Nothing has
 fixed it yet.&nbsp; Attempts to fix this issue -</p>
<p>- ran SFC /scannow</p>
<p>- many options in settings</p>
<p>- turning on hiding taskbar in desktop mode, reboot, turn off, reboot</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find any fixes, only the multitude of folks with this issue, but no real fixes.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 V1903 Update failed with error code 0x80070005</h2>
                    <blockquote>Split from <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-1903-update-failed-with-error-code/3db78d33-ab78-464f-a5c1-c176cae1c64d" title="Split from this thread">
this thread</a>.</blockquote>
<p>
Another feature update, another failure. After a few hours I'm told the update has failed with 0x80070005 and invited to retry, and of course this fails as well. But this update is significantly different. Before updating I went into Settings&gt;Update and Security
 where I was told that 1903 was available and to install it I needed to click on 'Download and Install Now'. I've never been given the option before, feature updates until now have been forced upon me. Of course it failed so I'm back to 1809 but with 24Gbyte
 less space on my C disk. Now Update and Security tells me that the update failed, but I can try again. Now I was quite happy with 1809 and although I've seen that there seem to be many experts suggesting ways to overcome the problem I consider life's too short
 for all of this worry and turmoil. Perhaps this failure to update is Microsoft's way of telling me my PC isn't up to running 1903? So here's a question; can I just leave things as they are and continue to use 1809 ad infinitum by avoiding 'Download and Install
 Now'? I realise I am able to do a clean install using a USB stick, but what's the point, 1809 suits me.

<p>Another thing you should do before trying 1903 again is to update your drivers. I know you tried to have the site auto-detect them. Maybe try that once more. If it fails...</p>

<p><span><span>(c) <strong>If NVIDIA is there</strong>, double-click it for its

<p><span><span>(d) At the <strong>Driver tab</strong>, check its version. Take the one from the site, if it is greater.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Check all the drivers at the site against Device Manager that way. If greater at the site, maybe first have Device Manager try to get it (search automatically). Sometimes that will even get a greater version. If not, take the one from the site.</p>
<p>

</p><p>To see what you've currently got, ask Cortana for<strong> MSInfo32</strong>. Look for

<div><b>Drive or Storage Space issues; Check Physical Drive and Storage Spaces sections.</b></div>

<div>In the Physical Drives section, all 4 2T drives are checked as okay and have either 49.6% of their capacity used or 49.8% of their capacity used.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>These drives are in a 4 disk enclosure that can be attached either by eSATA or USB 3.0. &nbsp;I get the same error under either attachment method.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am guessing that the virtual disk information is corrupt and the data on the four drives are not recognized as a storage pool any more. &nbsp;The device manager shows the disks individually, and the storage pool. is not recognized. &nbsp;In the Storage Spaces
 section of the Control Panel, the storage pool is recognized, but inaccessible.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since the data on the disks appears to be good, is there a way to rebuild the virtual disk data. &nbsp;Parity is the redundancy method.</div>

    <title>How many &#34;Undo&#34; steps are available in Fresh Paint&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ezondaeye  say:</h3>
<h2>            How many &#34;Undo&#34; steps are available in Fresh Paint&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Fresh Paint appears to automatically save all the changes I make. After a number of changes, if I decide not to save the art, how can I revert to the original template without keeping all the changes I have made? At the very least, there should be multiple
 "undo" steps available if Fresh Paint is set up to save automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adobe apps have a "Revert" utility which will take you back to the last time you saved the file. It would be nice to have a similar feature in Fresh Paint.</p>

<p>Hi Akheel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. The suggested link answers many of my questions. However, it is still not clear how many "Undo" steps are available in FreshPaint, or if the "Auto Save" feature can be turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I make changes to the original template or artwork, I would like to be able to go back a few steps if not happy with the results. Auto Save feature seems to defeat this purpose. Also, it would be nice to have a "History" function like Adobe Photoshop,
 so you can go back several steps if you are not happy with the changes you have made already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I have not figured out how to save the original template or artwork in case I want to use it again. I suppose, I could save it as a different file before starting a project, but how many people will remember doing&nbsp;that until it is too late? Auto
 Save certainly does not help this situation either unless you remember within the five minute time frame set by the app.</p>

            Hi 1979AV,<br />
<br />
<br />
Are there any lights when you plug your computer? In general, issues like this are hardware-related. It's possible that the power brick, battery, or the motherboard is faulty. It's recommended to have this checked by a technician or your hardware manufacturer's
 support team to verify the cause of the issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.
