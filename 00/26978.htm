<p>Can an arrow have AutoShape defaults independent of a line, i.e. "Set as Default Arrow"?</p>
<hr />
<p>My problem: I am working with PowerPoint 2007. &nbsp;I want all my arrows to appear with a specific arrow head style and arrow head size.</p>
<p>I cannot seem to set this anywhere so that they appear on the slide identical every time.</p>

            You cannot set a default arrow style in powerpoint 2007, only default line can be set. refer to
<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/list/en-us/default.aspx?dg=microsoft.public.powerpoint&amp;tid=398ce985-ef8e-4617-ac8d-742a90c07c43&amp;mid=df4c4db7-e500-405a-a538-160ef62dbe86&amp;cat=&amp;lang=&amp;cr=&amp;sloc=&amp;p=5<br />
<br />
The way around may be to either write a macro to select all lines and set the default arrow settings for them or to select the arrows slide by slide and change the arrow head for the same

    <title>GPS not working with Windows maps navigation on Lumia 650 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nl810  say:</h3>
<h2>            GPS not working with Windows maps navigation on Lumia 650</h2>
                    <p>I have recently purchased a Lumina 650 and the GPS will not work with the turn by turn navigation in the Windows Maps app. The GPS works just fine when you first start the app and it finds my location easy, but once I enter a destination and hit "Go" the
 phone begins voice navigation and after about 30 seconds says that there is "No GPS Signal". I have reset the phone and the problem is still there. This seems to be an isolated problem with Windows Maps as I have been able to download other Navigation apps
 and not have any problems. (I prefer using Windows Maps because of its ease of use and clean interface) I am running the latest consumer build (non insider release) of the Windows 10 anniversary update. This is a very frustrating problem as I do a lot of traveling
 and rely heavily on my GPS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced this or knows of a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi, Joe. Thank you for your responses. I have checked for updates to the app and it is fully updated. I have also cleared the history as per your instructions above. Still having the same issue. GPS works in app until I start the navigation, then "No GPS
 Signal".

            <p>Hi, Let me give you&nbsp;more details, I&nbsp;bought 3 Lumia 650 to replace our 3&nbsp;Lumia&nbsp;&nbsp;820.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually I have replaced 2 of them, the last one is for a salesman, therefore I have not repaced that one, since the GPS on the 820 works better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hard reset the phone more than&nbsp;5 times, in the &nbsp;last reset I did not recover from the backup, I started as new and the problem persist.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me say that the 3 Lumia 820 have Windows 10 preview installed as a Insider user and work perfect, except for the fast battery drain, that was the reason to jump to Lumia 650, but look like was not a good idea.</p>

            Same&nbsp;here as with Javier. I have done a hard reset with backed up data and as a fresh reset. The issue is still present. I thought that maybe this was an isolated weird event. I have searched all over the internet for others who have had this problem and
 I had no luck finding any answers or similar problems. I see from Javier's comments that I am not alone. I am thinking this is either a flaw with the phone or the app. Perhaps the app doesn't want to play well with the type of GPS in the phone. Though, it
 is hard for me to believe that Microsoft would produce and market a product that won't work well with its own apps.

            <p>UPDATE: I think I solved my problem!! I had a case on the phone made of aluminum. I removed the case and the problem went away. I put the case back on the phone and immediately the problem resumed. I removed the case again and the GPS navigation worked perfectly.
 I believe the metal on the case was disrupting the GPS signal. Hopefully this is the solution for the others having this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you to everyone who helped with working on a solution!!</p>

<p>There is no real way to "backup"your device.&nbsp; All data for Contacts and Calendar are stored in the Cloud at your Live account.&nbsp; Programs that have been installed can be dowloaded back to your device if needed by going to your account history if you lose
 track of what you have installed.</p>
<p>There is a free program called "reinstaller" that does a great job reinstalling programs automatically if you ever need to use it.</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t access my email because I get asked for a cell number and I don&#39;t have one</h2>
                    
<p>I'm already signed into my Outlook email, but when I click on the bookmark for it, the page (already signed in) flashes up for a split second and then it gets blocked by a message asking me for a cell phone number. I don't have a cell phone number, so what
 the hell do I do? &nbsp;I've tried removing the second layer of security, but it doesn't work, and as I'm already signed in I can't do anything there either, and there is no way I can sign out and start over. &nbsp;I use Gmail as my default email, but occasionally I
 need to get into Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, yeah...also...in the subtopics box below-that I can't leave blank-there is no choice for this topic. Dumb. So, what do I choose-none apply! Connecting to Outlook? Not really. Connected but blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously looking at Linux now... because I'm fed up with wasting hours and hours on updates, resetting everything after updates, having to figure out why the brand new printer no longer works (4 more hours of multiple updates), why files got messed up,
 why the start menu and task bars disappeared (and NO... your fixes didn't work!), why I had to reinstall Windows 10 THREE times (the second was your tech who did a crap job I had to sort out) wondering how we were supposed to know that Office 2007 was about
 to end (I found out by accident while sorting out the printer) and the just dumb choices of paying for 3 Office 365 subscriptions for my desktop, my teen's laptop, and the laptop husband rarely uses but still needs to be kept usable, or the onetime purchase
 of Office 2016 that is not supported. OMG! Well, ha! to you MS because I've switched to open source office programs-for free. WPS Writer, Apache versions, and LibreOffice are even better than MS Office, too. Oh... and there's my teens' laptop - which the Creators
 update first blocked from the internet and then crashed. Thank goodness he has a full warranty and service plan-because it's had to go in to be sorted out, and very inconveniently at the end of a summer college course for which he needs the specialised programs
 on said laptop. More downloads to the loaner model, more time wasted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and the ultimate: I asked answer desk chat for a solution for another problem, gave him my Gmail, and he's sent it to outlook-which I can't access, and which I told him about, which is why I gave him my Gmail.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's stopping you from accessing your Outlook email is called <strong>Two-step Verification</strong>, it is a security feature that protects your email by making it difficult for others to sign in to your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have the option to<strong> turn two-step verification on or off</strong> following the steps that can be found on this

<p>No, that does not work. I've already done that. Nothing gets rid of the pop-up blocking my account. I spent 2 hours with an answer desk person, and he couldn't do anything either. You know what his answer was? He went straight to the pop-up and told me to
 enter my phone number -AFTER I had already explained I had no cell phone. Then after eons of doing who knows what, his only solution was to borrow someone else's cell phone and use that number. Seriously? If this pop-up happens every time I want to look at
 my email, does he seriously think I'm going to be running around asking to use someone else's phone? This is just stupid planning with no forethought given to those who do not have cells. Dumb, dumb, dumb. If MS had better security, then there wouldn't be
 a need for all this, would there? I have ONE device - a desktop computer, on which I have plenty of security (I don't rely on Windows Defender-hell no!) and I'm not some 20-something bird brain. So stop treating me like one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, in case you didn't read it right the first time: I am already signed in to Outlook email, and the page is saved to my bookmarks. I click on the link and my email pops open &nbsp;-for a split second before being blocked by the pop-up (it calls itself
 a puzzle, but it's not) asking me to prove I'm human, but it's asking for a cell number. Here is the page: &nbsp;https://outlook.live.com/owa/owahipcontrol.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p>And in case you ask, I've also tried getting in by not using the bookmark link and going to Outlook.com. Same problem. It goes straight to my inbox/email (no sign-in requirement because I'm already signed in) and up comes the pop-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can do nothing-I can't even sign out of outlook because this thing blocks everything. I have thought of just abandoning the email account; however, I'm still signed in, and in its stupidity, MS decided to make that account my MS ID, when I upgraded to
 Windows 10 (biggest waste of time there) and now my desktop sign-in and skype are all connected- even though I didn't want that. I can't even delete the account...because MS requires me to have it. If it weren't for Windows 10, I would never have created a
 MS email of any kind. Long live Gmail.</p>

<p>So, yes I did need further assistance, but apparently you ignored my previous reply, and then five different MS people -yes-<strong>FIVE!</strong> (Answer desk, customer support, tech suppport, by online chat and in person on the phone, and a some sort of
 supervisor) could not sort this out. I went through the charade of account recovery (because they had no other answer) and still I cannot access my account properly or sign out of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So, hey, people! If you have the same problem, here's something for yo</strong><strong>u!</strong> Very interestingly, and ridiculously, I've found a couple of work-arounds, and all by myself, no thanks to MS. I remembered there was a One Drive file
 in my user folder when I first signed up, so I checked that and found that if I right-clicked on it, there was a "view online" option, and guess what? It takes me right to my One Drive in my account so I can see the photos that I foolishly uploaded there,
 and also any documents etc. if I'd done that too. If I click on email itself of course, the page comes up and is still blocked by the pop-up asking for a cell phone. However, the tile in start menu is... guess what... active! So ha! Microsoft! Despite all
 your dumb so-called security, I have found two back doors. You'd still need to use both of those for access, but it's do-able if any of you are desperate enough to need to use any MS email still. If you don't have an active tile, you can still retrieve photos
 etc. from One Drive via the One Drive folder in Users in Windows File Explorer. You may still have it pinned to your Quick Access by default.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, even though MS thinks they're stopping me from getting into my own account, I got into my photos, downloaded them, and then deleted them off One Drive, and I will never, ever, use Outlook as an email again. Long Live Gmail. Google may not be perfect,
 but their security is better, Gmail is far better an an email than any MS rubbish, and no cell phone number is required. It's an option, as in... a CHOICE.</p>

<div>they are not only cheap but also from branded companies</div>

<div>Hi all,</div>
<div>you can also log into xda forum for more details</div>
<div><br />
<div>Currently, the Focus/WP7 in general is having some technical difficulties with external SD cards. Below is the list that users have confirmed compatible and incompatible. I will keep this updated until the issue is resolved, in hopes that new users find
 this list and make the correct purchases. Please post your results with brand name / storage capacity / class #. Also, please only post your results after installing the card using the prescribed methods from the Samsung Focus instructions or the Windows Phone
 7 site. This includes formatting the card and then testing the stability with soft reset(s).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>*Note* Some people are reporting that their cards will work for about a day, then proceed to make the phone go berserk, restart, and then return with the data cleared and only 15MB of available storage. If this happens to you after initially reporting
 a compatible card, please check back in with us! Use this list with caution, as the results are based on our short time with the device. Thanks</div>

<h3> otto mania  say:</h3>
<h2>            ActiveSync or non-pop protocol &#58; Ubuntu&#47;Mint client or local webmail</h2>
                    I have learned I cannot have unique From-Name per alias in outlook.com&nbsp; ref: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/mail-email/custom-from-name-per-alias-outlookcomlivecom/958762ac-7d87-468c-ae99-4dbeafb0bab5<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><u>1</u></b><br />
I'll need a linux [ubuntu 12.04/mint13] email client that speaks EAS [ActiveSync] or other protocol other-than-pop3 (since microsoft resists IMAP) because I HATE POP. Not tribalism and not looking for evangelism.&nbsp; Further POP is not capable of synchronizing
 Sent folder :(&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<u><b>2</b></u><br />
If not a client then a webmail suite <b>run locally</b> [ubuntu 12.04/mint13...&nbsp; RoundCube, Squirrel, ilohamail maybe or another savvy suggestion.&nbsp; I don't have the system resources (or the budget) to run a version of windows in Virtual Machine.&nbsp; The vista/w7
 fiasco converted my home to linux.&nbsp; But I'm <i>still a hotmail fan</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Can't use gmail)&nbsp;&nbsp; Though I'm not amused with the poorly thought out filtering "capability" of hotmail/outlook.com: no compound filters (and'ing).
<br />
<br />
Your suggestions will likely be warmly received<br />

            Hi Roswell,<br />
<br />
May I know which <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/About-Office-What-version-of-Office-am-I-using-932788B8-A3CE-44BF-BB09-E334518B8B19?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
version of Office</a> are you using?<br />
<br />
Regarding “<em>Outlook is not opening I am getting an error</em>”, please provide us with a screenshot for further analysis.<br />
<br />
Try using Outlook in safe mode and disable add-ins to check this issue.<br />
<br />
To start Outlook in safe mode.&nbsp;<br />
1.<span> </span>Choose Start &gt; Run.<br />
2.<span> </span>Type <em>Outlook /safe</em>, and choose<em> OK.</em><br />
<br />
If Outlook does work in safe mode, then the problem is likely with one of add-ins. You'll need to disable all the add-ins before restarting Outlook.<br />
<br />
You may also try the online repair Office from the Control Panel to see whether the problem still occurs. For more information, see
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Emails going to junk folder - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Emails going to junk folder</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Junk Mail filters gone wild.</p>
<p>Outlook is sending emails from trusted sources i.e. my wife, kids, business associates, to the Junk Mail folder. No matter how many times I marked them as Safe Senders, or Rules I create for handling these messages, they end up in the J folder.</p>
<p>Some of the remedies I read suggest to go to the cog icon in the upper right of the screen and Select Settings. No such option in the drop-down menu:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c7ca62e-423d-4181-84c1-e602f8940d0a" /></p>
<p>Outlook has become a very difficult tool to use. Can't be chasing legitimate emails in the Junk Mail folder, just because Outlook refuses to cooperate.</p>
<p>Help please!</p>

            I changed my settings as directed, and now I'm getting almost ALL the items that should be junk mail. I have been deleting and unsubscribing to eliminate the number of emails I receive, but I would like to know what changed within Outlook that caused previous
 emails I received in my inbox to go to the junk folder.

<p>
</p><p>After all, the code repeat this part many times searching for some e-mails with specifics contents in each folder and subfolder.</p>
<p>I don't know where specifically the Outlook 2013 crashes, but it always happen after an e-mail open. Most of the times, after the first e-mail open. It doesn't happen when Outlook 2013 is offline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you guys figure out what is happening?</p>

            <p>Does Outlook really crash, or do you just get an error message? Do you use an error handler at all? If you just rely on what the user says, they sometimes mix it up (error vs. crash).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The code you show seems to be ok so far. An error would occur, if okMsg is declared as MailItem and if the folder contains other types of items.

<h2>            Where are the Windows Phone 7.5 default pictures stored&#63;</h2>
                    <p>By default the Photo's tile on the Windows Phone 7.5 shows the pictures stored on the phone. There were some default pictures of some kid by a pool, someone playing soccer or on a bike, a busstop with a big 3 on a pilar and a close-up of a seacontainer...
 I removed these pictures and the album they were in. However, after the last systemupdate the pictures returned to the tile... But I can't find them in any album, so I can't delete them this time... Does anyone know where these are stored and how I can get
 them off again?</p>

            <p>Not ignoring you, just not sure anyone has a good answer. Based on the age of this, you may have already solved your issue. In any case the pictures that are cycled on the picture hub come out of Favorites, not actually an album. It is more of a category
 to which you can send a picture to by pressing and holding. Add to favorites is an option.
</p>
<p>You can't delete a favorite, you can only remove a picture from favorites. If you delete a picture from it's source, camera roll, whatever, and it was a favorite, it will disappear from favorites as well. It's just a tag that makes it appear in that list.
</p>
<p>I did notice that after I dumped a picture, that I had favorited, and it disappeared from favorites, it did still get cycled through on the picture tile on the home page, but it only did that for a short period of time. Not sure if it was just time that
 fixed it, or if my going back and forth between home and pictures cleared it out.</p>
<p>As far as where are they stored, your guess is as good as anyone' considering there is no user accesible file system in Windows Phone. So even if it is somewhere like Windows/user/pictures/favorites, there is no file manager to go there and do anything.
 At least not on a stock phone.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the issue is still not solved :-) I originally removed the standard pictures from the fovorites and for a while the pictures didn't appear on the pictures tile in the 'start screen'. After a system update they returned to the tile, but they are not found
 in any album or favorites...</p>

            I agree Michael - it is really annoying! I have tried adding more pictures to favourites, and only the first one I ever added appears on the tile....followed by the 'system' photos, which are truly awful!

            Actually that doesn't happen with me... i added 4 pictures to&nbsp;favorites and only those pictures cycle through the live tile and the picture hub background.. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>what you do is you select a few pictures and add them as favourites... it depends on the number of pictures you add.. try three or four.... after you do.. press shuffle background</div>
<div><br />
<div>The&nbsp;background&nbsp;will be set to one of the images in the favourites... normally the first one...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Exit the hub... Lock and Unlock ur phone... the images in the tile wud have changed and you will not get the system images...</div>

            <p>Brilliant!! The shuffle background seems to be the critical part...if anyone else can't find that, it's in the options for Favourites when you first go to that...and before you press "see all".</p>

    <title>Messages not sending in Outlook Android App -- stuck in outbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loraleecuthbert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Messages not sending in Outlook Android App -- stuck in outbox</h2>
                    A few days ago my messages stopped sending my emails. I was wondering why no one was responding to emails and turns out it is because they are all getting stuck in the "outbox" folder of my outlook app. I receive no error message, the messages simply don't
 do anything and sit in the outbox folder. I have tried syncing my account, and my internet connection is working with everything else on my phone. I can't figure out what might be wrong with it. If anyone else has had this issue, please help!!!

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The problem is very likely your oldest message in&nbsp;your Outlook-for-Android app's Outbox.&nbsp; In my case, my FOUR oldest messages were each problems.&nbsp; I began by&nbsp;deleting them one at a time,&nbsp;the&nbsp;oldest&nbsp;one first.&nbsp; Following each&nbsp;individual deletion,&nbsp;I returned
 to the Inbox, and clicked the Sync button.&nbsp; Upon syncing after the fourth oldest one was deleted,&nbsp;more than entire month worth of email messages that had been jammed up in my Outbox without me realizing it&nbsp;all got sent in a&nbsp;long, multi-minute sync-up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE TO MICROSOFT:&nbsp; Made the Outlook-for-Android app somehow prominently display that their are unsent messages in the Outbox, like a pop-up that has to be "OK'd", rather than having to open the drop-down list of folders to see the Outbox, at which time
 I am usually on my way to a specific folder, and immediately start scrolling without even noticing that their are one or more messages indicated in the Outbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hotmail's individual email message attachment size&nbsp;limit is still 10MB, I believe--has been for many years.&nbsp; All of the messages blocking my Outlook-for-Android app's Outbox were less than 10MB (Hotmail, itself, as opposed to the Outlook app,&nbsp;had given me
 an error when I tried sending them together as one email message, so I broke them up into four separate messages).&nbsp; So, I don't think the problem had anything to do with size of the attachments.&nbsp; Maybe&nbsp;the problem&nbsp;had something to do with&nbsp;the&nbsp;fact that they
 had attachments, at all,&nbsp;however, and&nbsp;maybe not--personally, I don't think so.&nbsp; What I am pretty certain&nbsp;the problem&nbsp;had to do with was&nbsp;my connection status when I tried sending the messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All four of them were attempted sends from the same physical location at approximately the same time.&nbsp; At that time, I was vacationing&nbsp;in a location that was not serviced by my carrier, and although my voice service was roaming, roaming was not available
 for data service unless I&nbsp;paid for it (T-Mobile in Montana), which I didn't, so I only had a data connection if and when I was connected to Wi-Fi.&nbsp; I don't believe I had turned off my phone's mobile data radio, however, so I believe&nbsp;my phone (an LG&nbsp;Nexus 4)&nbsp;was
 making attempts to link up to data towers, and I believe my phone was in some sort of limbo or error state between the Wi-Fi radio and the mobile data radio when I attempted to send the emails (I believe all email activity is via&nbsp;data connections, but even
 if not, these four messages would definitely have required a data connection, due to the images I had&nbsp;attached to them).&nbsp; I believe this limbo or error state&nbsp;caused some sort of malfunction that either Android or the Outlook app wasn't able to rectify, even
 after an eventual data connection was established.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This whole process created a bit of a&nbsp;headache for me, as I didn't know whether recipients would receive them in their Inbox as current ("Today's") receipts, or whether they would&nbsp;be placed in&nbsp;their Inboxes chronologically by the date I originally created
 them and tried sending them, in which case the recipient&nbsp;may never even notice them being received--except for them showing as "Unread" messages, I suppose.&nbsp; In my "Sent" folder, they displayed as though they had been sent on the date I created and first tried
 sending them.&nbsp; It turns out that the messages were received by recipients the same way--as&nbsp;if they&nbsp;had been received&nbsp;the dates I had created and originally attempted sending them.&nbsp; Many people were unaware of their existence, therefore,&nbsp;and so I sent follow-up
 duplicates with an explanatory note included.</p>

            <p>I deleted some of the older emails in the out box as suggested and all 43 of them got sent all at once. &nbsp;Thanks for the suggestion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This of course caused some confusion at the receiving end but all is well. &nbsp;Next time I will probably get rid of some of the newer emails first and then go back to the earliest emails. &nbsp;For reference I am using a Nexus 7 if that makes any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked on my PC and my apple IPAD and noted that there is no OUTBOX folder that I could discover on those systems. &nbsp;</p>

            I have found that messages with attachments seem to be what is causing the issue. I haven't tried different types of files to see if that matters, but I've tried attaching Word docs from the Downloads folder on the device, and those messages consistently
 get stuck in the Outbox. In all instances, the Word docs were saved locally&nbsp;using the&nbsp;OneDrive app, so I'm wondering if the Outlook app is stuck trying to attach the document to the message and it never completes attaching it. Maybe a file rights issue?

<h2>            Changing font for body of tasks, office 2010</h2>
                    I can't figure out how to change the default font for the body of a task (the note portion when you open up a task). I can obviously change it for an individual task, but I want to change the default for all current/future tasks. We have Outlook 2010.
 Thank you!

    <title>Microsoft Word 2013 recovering unsaved file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frostedcookie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Word 2013 recovering unsaved file</h2>
                    Hello everybody first and foremost thank you for taking the time to read this post. I was working on a paper in Microsoft Word and Word closed unexpectedly. I saved the file once but when i went back to open my project &nbsp;the word file didn't open as ".docx".
 The type of file listed is " A file" and when I try to open it a box pops up with the following message: "File Conversion - *name of my file*" with the text " Select the encoding that makes your document readable." then it gives the options "windows (default)",
 "MS-DOS", and "Other encoding". When I open with "Windows(default)" I get text that looks like this "<span>‹Ÿ±Ö</span><span></span><span>§x3ãMž¡ñ»À‰vìÚÍæ¥#x»MI§‰œ‹©™’ö8“í</span><span>".</span>&nbsp;I also have a ".tmp" file of my work but am not sure how to convert
 it. I'd like to recover my work and would appreciate some help. I'm stuck and not sure what to do. I apologize for my formatting.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Karen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We haven't got any information that this feature is deprecated. I also did a test on my side and it worked. Therefore,<span>&nbsp;
</span>I would suggest you download the template to local -&gt; create the new site collection referring to the detailed steps mentioned in
<a href="http://blog.ciaops.com/2013/07/using-site-template-with-new-site.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this blog</a> to check the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please provide the following information:</p>
<p><span>1.As far as I know we should upload and activate the template to the solution gallery first, then a custom table including the template will appear in the above template selection.
 Later, we can select this template to create site collection. Regarding "</span><span>Upon selecting the custom solution from the solutions gallery
</span><span>,</span><span>I receive a 404 error and the URL no longer works.</span><span>", please show me your detailed reproduce steps and related screenshots.</span></p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.the error indicates the issue may be related to this specific template, please check if you can use other templates to create site collection.
</p>
<p>3.Let another SharePoint administrator to do a test
</p>
<p>4.Check if the browser is related. You can use InPrivate mode or other browsers.</p>

            Hello hanana_eniorxx 
<br />
<br />Thank you for participating in the Microsoft Community, My name is Miguel T. I'm an independent Advisor  
<br />
<br />Since your Skype account is already a Microsoft account the only way to delete it, is removing your Microsoft account it self.
<br />
<br />Do you still get sign in into your skype account?
<br />
<br />If your school removed your Microsoft Account, Skype account was removed also.
<br />
<br />- To get more info please follow the Reference below:

<br />
<br />I hope this information has been useful, please let me know if you still need assistance.
