<h2>            Stuck in chat room</h2>
                    Hi there, I am currently experiencing a glitch that, after searching the web, I do not think anyone else has experienced. So I was chatting with my friend and I used the Bing Images function to find a picture. All of a sudden I crash. Thinking nothing
 of it, I simply tap the Skype icon, it brings my to the usual screen showing my friends, chats, etc. But when u try to click on my friend to respond to her, I notice that the HUD is completely unresponsive, so I go to youtube, everythings responive to me tapping
 the screen. I swipe out Skype and try again, nothing. After a few Hard Resets and uninstalling and reinstalling, I have it to a point where I can access the main HUD, tap in and out of every single chat room accept for the one. Me and this friend have been
 chatting for years now, but since this glitch started, I can only see grey. It will let me click INTO her chat, but not OUT of. I can call her outside of the chat (holding down her icon and selecting call) but when I go inside the chat room everything is unresponsive
 accept for the keyboard, accept I can type words but not send them. Hope to hear back. P.S sorry for making you read so much.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b2f5aa2-83ab-4133-83bd-5b4b339b6178?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b2f5aa2-83ab-4133-83bd-5b4b339b6178?upload=true" /></a>

            <p>Hi Marvin,</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Which security software is installed in the system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might arise due to firewall from the security software blocking the connection, so I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Run the network troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>W</em></strong>” keys from the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” in the search bar and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>c) In the “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” window, click on “<strong><em>View</em></strong>
<strong><em>All</em></strong>” on the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click on “<strong><em>Incoming Connections</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>e) Click on “<strong><em>Advanced</em></strong>” and then click on “<strong><em>Run</em></strong>
<strong><em>as</em></strong> <strong><em>Administrator</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>f) Click “<strong><em>Next</em></strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></p>
<p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Disable (<strong>preferably uninstall</strong>) the security software (if any) installed in the system and check if the issue is reproduced.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong><em>Disclaimer: </em></strong></span><em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software.
 If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></em></p>

 with a blank CD (made on a different computer if necessary).&nbsp; Boot to this disk.&nbsp; This should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way) to backup your important data.&nbsp; If that doesn't work, slave the hard drive to another computer
 and access and move the data using the other computer (again, to wherever you plan to store the backup information (external hard drive, flash drive, CD/DVD,...)).</span></p>
<p><span>Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk or the Recovery
 Partition (whatever process is dictated by your computer manufacturer – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps to get recovery disks).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted
 as necessary by the procedures of your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly
 150 updates pending,...</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 BOSD and power problem</h2>
                    <p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I have a Medion P54016 MD20315 64bit PC.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>A couple of weeks ago my screen froze but after switching it off it started again OK.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>However it has reached the stage where the screen came up with “Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We are just collecting some error information
 and then we’ll restart for you.” <span>&nbsp;</span>but nothing happens so I switched off.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>It has now got to the stage where if I switch on the mains input blue light on the PC is still on and does not go off even when I keep switching it
 off at the mains input. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I have seen that this is likely to be Blue screen BOSD but I am at a loss as to what to do.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Any help would be much appreciated.</span></span></p>

                    <span>I have accepted a Windows 10 request to update my laptop on 22/5/18 to find the update failed to complete and left me in the 'Choose and Option' loop (never getting to
 Windows screen), none of which allows me to roll back to a previous build/version!!! Two days wasted trawling the www to learn what I have.&nbsp;&nbsp; MS-DOS 'ver' tells me I have 10.0.17134.&nbsp; The directory defaults to X:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32. I only appear to have 'internal'
 DOS commands. Following the '3 hard power off' rule and exploring recovery options I find 'Reset your PC' is not available, 'Startup settings' is not available to get to 'Enable safe mode' and when drilling down through Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Go
 back to previous version &gt; Windows Rollback tells me "We ran into a problem and won't be able to take you back to the previous version of Windows. Try resetting your PC”....but that’s not available to me!!!! I’m not impressed and expect better from MicroSoft.
 What can I do to recover my data files and re-establish a working laptop?</span>

            Hi Tara, Windows and indeed Windows Explorer is useless when it comes to working out where your hard drive space is being used . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility called Treesize. Using that tool, you will instantly see where this space is being used
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />
<br />Once you have worked out where this space is being user, please let us know so we can advise on what is safe to remove . . .

            I've started working on a wiki article to answer that question, but there have been so many questions I published it before finishing. So, take in a look in the following link at the section "Treeview or Treemap Disk Space Mapping Utilities".  It shows a utility that gives you a visual representation of how space is being used on your drive. Then you can drill down to get more details.  There are also tools that show the same info in text view is thta is what you prefer

            Here are some things you can do to free up space:
<br />
<br />1 – OneDrive On Demand Files - <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-onedrive-on-demand-files-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-onedriv...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have Windows 10 running on a limited capacity device, you probably are looking for the most affordable option to recover some space. Starting with Windows 10 1709, Microsoft reintroduced OneDrive Files on Demand. This nifty functionality lets you keep all your files on OneDrive and only download the ones you need. Our recent article covers all the details how to set it up and configure it.
<br />
<br />2 – Disk Cleanup and Storage Sense
<br />
<br />Windows 10 is notorious for creating archived files you don’t need. Two features in Windows 10 that can help you with that are Disk Clean up and Storage Sense.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: disk cleanup then hit Enter.
<br />
<br />Once Disk Cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if it’s not already. Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
<br />
<br />After Disk Cleanup completes its scan, click the button Clean up system files.
<br />
<br />This will perform another quick scan including every file that can be removed. Browse through the list then check off what you don’t need. Pretty much everything in Disk Cleanup can be safely removed. If you keep files in Recycle Bin for safe keeping, you probably should remove them.
<br />
<br />Storage Sense helps automate storage management by automatically deleting files like temporary files and content in your Recycle Bin. Starting with Windows 10 1709, you can delete files in your Downloads folder that haven’t changed in 30 days. Storage sense can also be set to run automatically when you’re low on disk space.
<br />
<br />To set it up, open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage. Click Change how we free up space.
<br />
<br />Enable and modify the settings you would like to be applied when you are running low on space.
<br />
<br />Within the Storage interface in Settings, you can get a bird’s eye view of what’s stored on your drive and what might be using up a lot of space. Under Local Drive, click your Local drive where Windows 10 is currently installed.
<br />
<br />There you will see a list of locations and the amount of space being used by each. As you can see, Temporary files are using about 7 GBs of space, installed apps and games 6 GBs, and Documents 2 GBs. If you click on one of the locations listed, you are not given many options except viewing the contents of the location and manually removing files you might no longer need.
<br />
<br />3 – Delete Data Stored by Apps and Games
<br />
<br />Going back to apps and games a bit, sometimes data no longer in use is kept by the app. If you have exhausted all the options previously mentioned, maybe it’s time to see how much data is being stored by each app installed from the Store.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features. Select an app then click Advanced options.
<br />
<br />Click Reset which will delete all the data stored by the app.
<br />
<br />4 – Delete Your Recovery Partition
<br />
<br />The recovery partition used to reinstall Windows 10, can eat up a significant amount of disk space. It’s used rarely, if ever, so there is no need to keep it. If that makes you nervous, you can back up your recovery partition to a USB thumb drive, which you can use to reinstall Windows 10 when you need to.
<br />
<br />To do that, open Start, type: create the recovery drive and hit Enter.
<br />
<br />Connect a USB thumb drive with enough space—16 GB should do—then click Next. At the end of the wizard, you will be asked if you would like to delete the recovery partition. Proceed to do so.
<br />
<br />5 – Use Treesize to Find Hidden Large Files (Free)
<br />
<br />Use Jamsoft’s TreeSize (<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-u...</a>), which can find large files not readily visible in Windows 10. The program is simple and easy to set up. Our previous article covers the details for scanning your drive and looking in the right places. Jamsoft provides a portable version of Treesize, so you can run it from a thumb drive and scan your system without using up disk space for the program itself.
<br />
<br />6 – Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
<br />
<br />Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
<br />
<br />Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups (<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/partition-hard-drive-macos-time-machine-windows-10-backups/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/partition-hard...</a>).
<br />
<br />There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.
<br />
<br />Repeat this step for other folders where you keep large files.
<br />
<br />7 – Install an SD Card for Apps.
<br />
<br />For devices with an SD card slot, Windows 10 lets you move large apps and games from the main drive. These days, you can get an SD card with as much as 256 GBs of space. This is more than perfect for a system with limited onboard space.
<br />
<br />Note: This only works with Microsoft Store apps. Classic desktop apps and those that come built into Windows 10 cannot be moved.
<br />
<br />In Windows 10 open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features. Select an app or game downloaded from the Windows Store, then click Move.
<br />
<br />Click on the Select a drive to move this app to: list box, choose the drive representing your SD card then click Move.

<h2>            Enabling Bidirectional Communication for a printer on a computer with Windows 7</h2>
                    My computer says this :"Communication Not Available- The printer cannot communicate with the computer. Please turn on "Enable Bidirectional Communication" setting in the printer properties dialog." every time I try to print. My printer is connected, and
 when I go into printer properties the closest option to this is Bidirectional Support, when I click on this and hit apply, it changes nothing. When I go back into printer properties after that, the bidirectional support box is no longer clicked. It won't stay
 selected, and there is no other way for me to fix this. My printer worked fine with Windows Vista, and now it won't work at all. I thought Windows 7 was supposed to be simpler? It has only made my life harder.

Is it a detached Weather gadget from your Windows Sidebar? If you have the Windows Sidebar icon on your Notification area (system tray), right click on it then click "Open"(or Bring gadget to front). Your Sidebar should appear on the Desktop. If you don't have
 the Temperature gadget showing click on the "+" sign on the top of the sidebar. Double click on the Weather gadget. Then you can drag it to a location you want on the Desktop (or you can right click &gt; Detache from Sidebar). To change the current temperature
 location, right click &gt; Options, type your location on the "Search for location" box.</p>
<p>If the Windows Sidebar icon is not on the Notification area (system tray) turn on the sidebar:<br />

<h3> cjh999  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft family- no longer monitoring child&#39;s activity</h2>
                    <p>I use Microsoft Family to restrict and monitor the web and app activity of my children on our PC.
</p>
<p>For the past few weeks, it shows that they have not browsed the web and have not used any apps, although both are not true. I would like to block Chrome (for example), since web filtering only works on Edge, but it won't let me block it unless it was used.
 So I'm stuck in a catch-22: it is being used but since apps (and browsing) are not being monitored, it's not registered as having been used and thus can't be blocked.
</p>
<p>Browsing in Edge is not being monitored or restricted either. </p>
<p>The only feature of Microsoft Family that seems to be working is restricting screen time (but not monitoring it).</p>
<p>Several fixes were posted to this problem in the past but were in reference to older versions of Windows.
</p>
<p>I added a new child/profile yesterday, but it still doesn't work, so it appears that starting again will not solve the problem.
</p>
<p>Help!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>This did not work.</p>
<p>I removed both children and added them (so far just one of them) back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It still shows that there has been no activity.</p>
<p>And when I try to log in as the other child who has not yet rejoined the family, it will not allow them to log in to the computer because of a screen time issue. This is in theory correct, however, I don't know why that should be since they are no longer
 part of the family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is true even after rebooting the computer.</p>
<p>What else can I try?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Let's update the privacy settings on your child's device to get accurate usage data report of websites visited, refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>On the child's device, press the&nbsp;<strong>Windows</strong>&nbsp;key to launch the Start menu.</span></li><li><span>Go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>, then click&nbsp;<strong>Privacy</strong>, then click&nbsp;<strong>Feedback &amp; diagnostics</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Under&nbsp;<strong>Diagnostic and usage data</strong>, make sure the level is set to&nbsp;<strong>Enhanced</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Full</strong>. If it's set to Basic, child activity will not be reported.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly give us an update on how it goes and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>

<p>I have the same problem after upgrading to Windows 10. I searched, read and followed many threads about this issue*. Although having updated to Windows 10 Creators Update and followed the above steps here, i<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">t
 still shows that there has been no activity. Most seriously, I found my kids sometimes are redirected to some s</span>urreptitious/hidden/popup<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> adult websites. I cannot protect them by using the blocking
 list because I have no activity report to know what websites they accessed. On the other hand, since the problem exists in the 2 desktops, familysafety&nbsp;works fine on the laptop, that confuses me very much. I am URGENTLY demanding a REAL solution.</span></p>

</p><p>Hi Frederick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recent activities of your child's device not being reported is usually due to the settings under
<strong>Feedback and diagnostics</strong>. In the Creators Update, Website activity is set to
<strong>Basic </strong>by design. Go to <strong>Settings/Privacy/Feedback &amp; diagnostics</strong> and check if the level has been changed
<strong>Enhanced </strong>or <strong>Full</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, please check this link for the steps to make sure that activity reporting is turned on:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12441/microsoft-account-monitor-child-device-activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Monitor your child's device use with activity reports</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue remains, May we know what browser are you using to monitor your child's activities? Also, are you experiencing this issue with other browsers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

</p><p>Since you previously upgraded to Windows 10, there are a few steps that you need to take to turn on family settings again. First, your child will need to sign in to Windows 10 with a Microsoft account, and then you'll need to add that account to your family

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I started to use Family Safety many years ago (I miss the age of XP) and it worked fine along although Family Safety revised several times. When Windows 8 came, my kids have already had their Microsoft accounts to&nbsp;fit for the&nbsp;new version of Family Safety.
 After Windows 10 came, I removed my kids' Microsoft accounts from and added them to my family many times just for the willing of Activity Report working but never success. I reviewed and retried many times to follow this&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10551/microsoft-account-set-up-family-after-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>&nbsp;but
 never success. I followed this&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_security/troubleshooting-family-safety-features-in-windows/29533738-5766-4ba5-881c-c588e45201dc">link</a>&nbsp;but still
 no&nbsp;success. Its Web Filtering and Screen Time work fine but I never received the reports of internet activities (although 'Activity Report' is on). I&nbsp;believe there is something&nbsp;wrong in the core&nbsp;of the Family&nbsp;Safety but not in its settings or the privacy of
 Windows 10. Therefore, I now beg for a total solution (I used to believe that Windows 10 Creators Update was) instead of step-by-step or ad-hoc. Really, I don't want to hear to abandon Microsoft Family Safety in the end. Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note:</p>
<p>My kids are using verified Microsoft accounts that surely belong to my&nbsp;Family.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Definitely you will need to make a backup of the drivers. What you can do is, before re-installing windows visit the manufacturer's website and download all the drivers and save them on a usb/flash/pen drive.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Once the Windows 7 is installed on the computer install the drivers from the back that you will make.</div>
<div><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly<br />

<p>PowerDVD is an application that auto-read medias from<strong> Compact Discs (CD)</strong> and
<strong>Digital Versatile Discs (DVD) </strong>like PowerISO. This application is installed upon installing the drivers from your motherboard's driver CD. PowerDVD simply reads your files upon inserting your CD. You can simply close it, then add your music
 files to your preferred music player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you can try changing the default apps by file type to set which opens which. To do so, kindly follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Default apps&gt;Choose default apps by file type</strong>.</li><li>Scroll down to find <strong>.3gp, .mp4, mpeg, .mpe, .mpe,</strong> and <strong>
.divx</strong>, then set their<strong> Default app </strong>to <strong>PowerDVD.</strong></li><li>Scroll down to find <strong>.mp3</strong> and set its <strong>Default app</strong> to
<strong>Winamp.</strong></li></ol>

<p>This topic is not about .mp3 files, it's about which application is launched by Windows upon inserting a CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only one program can register itself in the Registry. I could update the registry manually but that's not the intention.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, isn't there a GUI option available for setting which program is launched by inserting a CD?</p>

<p>There is none. Only DVD player applications could automatically play media contents of DVDs/CDs like Window DVD Player, PowerISO, PowerDVD, etc. But as I mentioned earlier, you can close the DVD player application and reload the media files using your preferred
 media player.</p>

<h2>            The module &#34;jscript.dll&#34; was loaded but the call to DllRegisterServer failed with error code 0x80004005</h2>
                    Win 7 professional&nbsp; 32bit system. Had issues with media player just flashing on screen and does not open. No error message displayed. To make it work I had to manually register jscript.dll after every re boot.
<br />
Separate issue of failing wireless card and I was advised by HP to update bios. Updated bios successfully (?) now wireless card works but media player still flashes but cannot manually register jscript.dll.
<br />
In elevated CMD receive error message "The module "jscript.dll" was loaded but the call to DllRegisterServer failed with error code 0x80004005"<br />
Tried turning off UAC too. Manual register of vbscript.dll works successfully.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to solution. : )<br />

<p>By default, Windows 10 builds are pre-keyed, meaning, you do not have to enter a product key and should not be prompted to enter one even after Windows 10 has completed setup.</p>

</p><p><em>Microsoft tells me that it will be possible to do so. And that a key part of this process is that it will save a product key tied to the previously upgraded PC or device in Windows Store. This is how Windows 10 will later know that the install is allowed:
 It’s “one of the benefits of the new delivery system,” a Microsoft representative told me.</em></p>

</p><p><strong>Suppose I need to reinstall Windows 10 after one or two years from now or I install a new hard disk?</strong></p>
<p>Windows 10 is registered to the device, not your hard disk. Just install a new hard disk and reinstall Windows 10 and it will reactivate automatically.</p>

            <p>These answers are unsatisfactory.&nbsp; Disregarding the issue of</p>
<p>OEM users- let's instead examine retail directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us consider the following hypothetical situation.<br />
Our user, Samantha, downloads windows 10 using the<br />
upgrade to 10 mechanism from an updated retail copy of windows 7, and successfully upgrades to 10.</p>
<p>She does not know how her install is registered</p>
<p>with microsoft- but it is not her desire to be</p>
<p>cloud-connected, and for security purposes, she must not</p>
<p>use the internet. . She has made a copy of the backup media</p>
<p>and when her windows 7 machine fails,&nbsp;</p>
<p>attempts to transfer it to a new machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, her copy of the backup media is damaged.</p>
<p>How does she recover her property rights? After all,</p>
<p>she has a retail copy of windows 10, not an oem copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>let us consider a second hypothetical situation.</p>
<p>Our user, Joseph, is a microsoft insider. He experiences</p>
<p>the same chain of events as Samantha, with the exception</p>
<p>that he received his copy of windows 10 retail as part of the</p>
<p>insider process. Does he receive oem or retail?</p>
<p>Is his copy of windows 10 attached to his microsoft account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>---------------</p>
<p>I wish to underline these concerns with one more.</p>
<p>I do not trust microsoft. I do not trust anyone. I allow microsoft</p>
<p>the leisure of using me as an insider guinea pig, and pay</p>
<p>microsoft to provide me with office and email services that</p>
<p>are reasonably secure, with the understanding that I do not</p>
<p>use them to discuss any confidential details that I would not</p>
<p>want examined by state parties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is demanding greater and greater trust, and greater</p>
<p>and greater reliance on remotely configured and controlled</p>
<p>systems such as microsoft accounts and onedrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I, on behalf of all windows users, many of whom like me have used windows since version 1.0, on behalf of the security</p>
<p>researcher, state agency, and private citizens rights,</p>
<p>demand that microsoft make available their products that</p>
<p>are intended to be installed as a local client copy with the </p>
<p>option to remove, not simply disable, but fully remove </p>
<p>functionality relating to phoning home and remote access.</p>
<p>This is the only way to ensure our trust. I don't care what</p>
<p>you want to make of it- if you don't comply with</p>
<p>this demand the EU will force you to. There will be some</p>
<p>massive **** leak involving some **** hacks that you didn't</p>
<p>expect, physical access possibly involved, the NSA probably</p>
<p>involved, and your trusting customers are going to be </p>
<p>unhappy.</p>
