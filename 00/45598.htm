</p><p>I've tried all the suggestions. &nbsp;There are no additional updates and the troubleshooter does not detect a problem. I think we're stuck for now. &nbsp;As I stated an official MS technician was not able to fix the problem this week. I think we're stuffed by Windows
 10 for now.</p>

            <p>I paid for my window 10 pro to be sure that is not the issue coming from the upgraded for free version, still have the problem. went to ASUS website and tried to see if they have any update on sound driver for window 10. NO there is nothing so far for this
 issue. I have a ASUS n55sf and it has a bang &amp; Olufsen sound system on it &nbsp;:(((</p>
<p>Good luck on that.</p>

            <p>I had this issue over the years any time my asus n55sl tried to update the audio driver. The easiest solution I found was to roll back the realtek audio driver to what it was originally. I've had no issues since and sound works fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently running version 6.0.1.6526 (12/13/2011) of the Realtek High Definition Audio. Had same issue as above on both Win 7 and Win 10 and rolling back the driver to this one has solved all problems. I just uncheck this driver anytime I'm prompted
 to update it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this has helped.&nbsp;</p>

            Please go to this link from ASUS and download all of the driver you use to have on the window 7. They will all work perfectly with window 10 as well. I do have a window 10 pro and I could get back every thing to my laptop properly.

<h2>            Achievements not unlocking</h2>
                    <p>Is anybody else having the problem of achievements not unlocking for them? I play both offline and online because I get around quite a bit and take my Xbox around with me on a daily basis to work. It was around May last year Microsoft had a new&nbsp;system update and after the update I noticed i wasn’t unlocking achievements offline anymore. Did they screw over people that play offline on getting achievements or something? I’m&nbsp;beyond pissed right now!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I'm not so sure about it having to do with it being between offline and online, considering achievements only prock if you are online when you earn them, but I've been having bugs in it. I've played several games and far passed their requirements, but nothing's been popping for a couple days. I'm not sure if its a problem on their end or mine.</p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            Sell to CEX online experiences &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Basically as title. Thinking of selling a game or two to CEX through the online site as selling on other sites just cant guarantee a sale. I need money sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>So whats everyones experience selling games to CEX online ? Or even instore if needed. Do they have cash instore and do they try to worm out of giving you the set price for cash ?.</p>

<p>Many thanks all</p>

<p>Cex is a brilliant place to sell your old mobile phone and a great place to get GAME and Grainger to price match trade in value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look on the website and you'll see how much they offer cash and trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the shop WITH picture ID (driver's license or passport are best) and they'll make you a CEX account and give you a little card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you may sell in store.&nbsp; Walk in with the goods, walk out with the cash.</p>

<p>I sell all my games to Cex instore, I've heard nothing but bad things about the on-line side of things. I've also bought 2/3 items from the on-line and that was just as bad.
</p>
<p>Scene it cost me 50p so I didn't moan but the case came with no disk inside, and when I e-mailed them about it (no phone number) they told me to pay to send it back myself and they would sort it. For the sake of 50p I just left it.</p>

<p>Ah, another CEX thread.</p>
<p>Good times.</p>
<p>CEX are usually ok with what they offer - i mean you can get good coin for GoW3 if you want. However this assumes they have money in their tills as, bizarrely, they often don't. BTW you can buy gears new for less than they charge for it second hand and you
 don't get the DLC codes either.</p>
<p>Of course dealing with them requires you stand in a huge queue for ages listening to the most obnoxiosuly loud music they can find, usually emo rock.</p>
<p>The staff are pretty thick at times: they don't check the quality of that qhich they buy in and are happy to sell incomplete products all the time.</p>
<p>You also need to be a member, though i question how this stops them buying in huge amounts of 'hot' materials.</p>

<p>Bought from them before and as above the experience was ....unique. Never sold though but no one else (from what I can see) is offering as much for the Gears 3 Limited Edition £45 cash.</p>
<p>Wanted to ideally send the game but even selling instore seems like a hassle. :(</p>

<p>Its just the hassle for me. I'm disabled due to very bad leg joints so multiple trips are not desirable.</p>
<p>Will try instore early next week and hope for the best. reading some online reviews for the sell-to option, they always try to downgrade the worth of your games VS online prices.</p>
<p>So is morning best for selling or would mid-day be better due to more sales made ?. Or do everyone just sell to them and not buy ? lol.</p>

<p>One more question - What are they like for selling a limited edition with contents missing ?.</p>
<p>Want to sell Gears of War 3 LE but I gave the Adam Fenix code away and I would like to keep the small flag if possible.</p>
<p>If they will give me less for keeping the flag I will trade with the rest. Need the money more than a cool flag ATM.</p>

<p>I have only ever had 1 experience trading in a limited edition before. It was the Dead Rising 2 Zombrex Edition the one with the pen. I wanted to keep the pen so I did. Took it to CEX and they gave me the full amount for it.</p>

<h2>            IPv6&#47;IPv4 dual stack Xbox One connectivity issues</h2>
                    
<p>SO the other day I started having some laggy gaming on Advanced Warfare. I noticed my PING went to 1 red bar and fluctuated up and down the entire game. I switched lobbies to a different game type and kinda did that over the course of an hour or two, thinking
 it was just a bump in the road. Kept having the issues so I bounced to the Xbox One home screen to do a speed test. It came back to 26 DOWN and 11 UP. Which is FAR below average speeds I have gotten in the past but still WAY above Microsoft's recommended bandwidth
 settings for gaming. </p>
<p>SO I said OK, to the router/modem we go! I went ahead and just turned my Comcast
<span>SMCD3GNV</span> wireless gateway/router/modem/telephony modem off for several minutes and then rebooted it. After rebooting, I logged into my handy dandy router/gateway/modem/telephony via HTTP. I checked out a variety of different things. My eyes first
<span>SMCD3GNV</span> wireless gateway/router/modem/telephony modem off for several minutes and then rebooted it. After rebooting, I logged into my handy dandy router/gateway/modem/telephony via HTTP. I checked out a variety of different things. My eyes first
 took me to make sure my Xbox One hadn't somehow changed it's local IP and offset the DMZ setting. I setup a reserved static IP for ALL devices on my network just because to me it only seems sensible since i have about 6 total connections on my network. Why
 bother with the hassle of IP conflicts? ANYWAYS. My Xbox One still had the same IP and the IPv4 DMZ was still active, as well as UPnP still showed an active 3074 port connection. Here is where my question comes into play.</p>
<p>My router firmware had recently updated (unknowingly to me), and there was now an option for an IPv6 DMZ. I am like, sweet, well I guess I should probably make sure that is enabled on the X1 as well. I went to the "Connected Devices" screen and found the
 IPv6 address (or so I thought) to my X1, put it in there, and moved on. I thought, GREAT problem solved! Until I kept having lag issues with an OPEN NAT. I got online and googled it, as well as poured over the XB website/forums and all that jazz. I turned
 up a few articles from 2013, which weren't really relevant to my question. They basically just confirmed what I already knew, and that was X1 would support IPv6 and apparently the X1 will dual stack IPv4 and IPv6, meaning if a host/server/whatever is using
 IPv4, X1 will utilize that protocol for you to connect, but if they have IPv6, it will utilize THAT protocol.
</p>
<p>I login to my router and discover it has (2) IPv6 addresses listed. I go to my X1 and open IE and go to a website that tests for IPv6 and it comes back to tell me my native IP is an IPv6 address. The IP it gives me is the one I setup for DMZ. I figured that
 was the PUBLIC Comcast IP and NOT the local IPv6 for my Xbox. So I went in and changed the IPv6 address in the DMZ to the other one listed in my router. I noticed the DNS servers listed in my X1 console were IPv6 address supplied by Comcast. I have had several
 issues with Comcast DNS servers, so I attempted to change them. It only allows you to input IPv4 DNS addresses.
</p>
<p><br />
I apologize for telling you my entire back story and maybe giving you a TLDR post. In my experience people tend to ask pointless questions that just prolongs a solution, so I like to include every dumb little turn we take in this journey.</p>
<p>My questions are as follows:</p>
<p>How do I know 100% for sure what my X1 IPv6 local IP address is so I can set it up for a proper DMZ? Or does it even matter if the IPv6 is DMZ'd at all?
</p>
<p>How do I change the DNS servers from Comcast's to my choosing? </p>
<p>From what I am seeing there are lots of different variations of IPv6 addresses and I just want to make sure my console is setup to game in the best way possible. Since there is basically no literature on this, I assume not very many people have attempted
 to figure out/tackle this issue. </p>

<p>"my Comcast SMCD3GNV wireless gateway/router/modem/telephony modem ".....those are not good for gaming imo , not xbox 1 friendly anyway...anytime you use your isp's equipment instead of your own its a gamble , they have their own firmware and (somewhere
 , in fine print , you agreed to this) they can change things around , usually , most people don't notice , but gaming consoles sure do ....you can fiddle with it , and maybe get it right but I would be surprised if it stays that way ....get your own modem
 (NO GATEWAYS) and own gaming router that does UPNP (netgear is good) &nbsp;and forgot about all the DMZ and ipv6 and all the other stuff....been there ...</p>

<p>Well, I had just a simple internet modem, no phone. Had to sign up for their phone service which required me to switch to the modem I have now. Have had up and down connection issues since. Called Comcast to ask if there was an alternative modem and was
 told that was the only one they were using. I was told it could be placed in bridge mode and then allow me to use my Netgear router as I had before.</p>

<p>@RhinoTheGreat87 hey hey</p>
<p>I know that this not an answer to Your questions, but the best chose for You is to use only UPnP, so Xbox One would open ports for it without manual configuration. Right now You do his job, DMZ is bad chose for security, because Your Xbox One is connected
 thru DMZ directly to internet, in most gateways/routers without any firewall's at all.</p>
<p>As for Your questions, this not really easy area, if You like I can provide to You some links about IPv6 and hot it works, but my suggestion, just use UPnP, it's great answer to all Your questions.</p>

            <p>Go to Best Buy and pick up a Motorola Surfboard modem and a good router. &nbsp;I have a LinkSys "max speed" (model EA7500). &nbsp;Go home, hook up the cable modem and plug a computer directly into it. &nbsp;Go to internet browser and you will hit a comcast page for activation. &nbsp;It takes about 2 minutes and your modem should be all set, you can return theirs the next day and save money every month.</p><p><br /></p><p>Once the modem is done just unplug the computerand plug in your new router. &nbsp;The setup on that should only take about 5 minutes and is very&nbsp;basic. &nbsp;Once it is done just go turn off IPv6 and then have fun gaming.</p><p><br /></p><p>In regards to the "we have to use OUR modem with a phone connection for 911", that is complete BS. &nbsp;I havent used one in years and argued with Comcast about it till they gave in.</p>

<p>With Windows 8, Microsoft has changed from stickers that have the product key that the user has to type in when installing the operating system to new BIOS embedded product keys. The idea is that by eliminating the sticker, you eliminate one of the easier
 ways for nefarious users to get a legitimate product key. Eliminating the product key sticker also removes any worry that the sticker might get damaged while at the same time eliminating the long and irritating process of typing in various letters and numbers
 when installing the operating system.</p>
<p>If the user has to reinstall the operating system on a machine that came with Windows 8, the installation process automatically grabs the software product key from the motherboard BIOS with no input from the user. This means that those familiar Windows product
 key stickers will no longer appear on the Windows 8 computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you bought a retail box copy, look in the product box, it suppose to be on a business card like paper with a key symbol on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you bought it online, check your Microsoft Store account:</p>
<p>Go to this website and click on "Account/ Download + product keys " (near the page bottom), the information there should help you obtain your product key and order information.

    <title>Xbox One SUDDEN LAG, HIGH PING - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raawzy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One SUDDEN LAG, HIGH PING</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>right from the beginning I was having network issues with my XBOX ONE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Never had issues with any lag before (using the Xbox 360) although my connestion is pretty bad. It was always enough to play online.</p>
<p>DL: 1,2Mbit</p>
<p>UP: 0,3Mbit</p>
<p>Ping: 60ms</p>
<p>I know 3Mbit is required to use Xbox Live. But everything works fine until the Ping rises... It seems like the
<strong>PING</strong>&nbsp;on my Xbox One rises limitless every now and then. Ping is usually about 60ms for me. No matter which game I play or if I have just turned my Xbox on and am only in dashboard. The Ping rises to like
<strong>2500ms</strong>! lol yeah really :D</p>
<p>I have tested this several times with the same results. Support and ISP couldn't help me.</p>
<p>My guess is that the Xbox is down- or uploading something in the background... something you cannot turn off. Since my connection is already bad this may be the cause.</p>
<p>Cannot play any games online. For example I'm getting rubberbanding n BF4.</p>

<p>Anyone having similar or even the same problem?</p>

<p>Hi Raawzy,</p>
<p>Your connection is definitely an issue. &nbsp;I'm not sure what can be done You might can try going to www.speedtest.net from a computer and test your speeds there as well.</p>
<p>One other thought- I would definitely make sure your X1 is hardwired, not wireless to your connection with those speeds. &nbsp;That's will definitely help.</p>

<p>So I forgot to say that my console is hardwired and my NAT is OPEN with all Ports open needed for Xbox One. The proble is that the lag only becomes a problem once in like 5 or 10 minutes. For the rest of the time everything works just fine (playing multiplayer
 etc. ). So my hope is that I can find out what exactly causes the rise of thr ping times. There must be something.</p>
<p>Just to mention it. I am only having issues like that on my Xbox One (not on any other devices).</p>
<p>I tested it with www.speedtest.net byt he way ;)</p>

 media player, vlc player. itunes . The sound output registers in the sound display in the control panel setting, but no physical sound out. I have checked all the drivers are up to date and there is no errors in the device manager. The realtek driver test
 area for the speaker configuration works fine i get audible test sounds out. i treid&nbsp; fixes from this forum but no change in the audio output<br />
&nbsp;The only other thing i can add is that my pc&nbsp; a medion akoya e4057 d has a preloaded media player which lets me select audio out via speaker / sound type ie 5.1 surround and this give me audio out<br />

            <p>What is the make and model of your existing computer? What edition of Windows is installed e.g. Home, Professional etc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether you can transfer an existing copy of Windows 10 to your new computer depends on whether the qualifying version of Windows entitling you to upgrade to Windows 10 was an OEM version or a retail version&nbsp;of windows. OEM&nbsp;= original equipment manufacturer
 and they can be provided with a branded computer e.g Dell, HP etc., or a System Builders version&nbsp;which can be installed on&nbsp;a motherboard and other selected components.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An OEM version is tied to the original motherboard and cannot be transferred to a second computer. A retail version of windows &nbsp;can be removed from one computer and installed on another computer. You pay substantially more for a retail version.</p>

            <p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>

<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

<p>Heyo. To get right to the point, when I start up my xbox it makes loud buzzing noises. Now, this only happens when I insert and play Modern Warfare 2. Heck it's even frozen a couple of times with MW2 as well.</p>

<p>Hey there, welcome to the Forums! So it only buzzes on that one game specifically? &nbsp;The first thing I would try is clearing the cache:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a> and then installing the game to the system (or deleting and reinstalling if it's already there.) &nbsp;If that doesn't help, you can also try reorienting the system (so if it's laying flat, stand it up and vice-a-versa).
 &nbsp;Let us know how that goes, yeah?</p>

<p>The loud buzzing noise tends to actually be the DVD drive spinning quickly which is why you are getting it with CoD in the drive. If you turn on your Xbox 360 without a disc in the drive do you still get the buzzing?
</p>
<p>If possible, try to install CoDMW2 to your console HDD, this way the DVD is read only briefly and once the game is started the console should return to quiet running as it pulls the game information from the HDD instead of the DVD drive.</p>
<p>Also make sure your console is on a flat surface, it could be vibrating on the platform you have it on currently which would increase the buzzing noise.</p>

<br />It's often a Startup freeloader so go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello AlanParrish,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Suggest you to run System File Checker scan:
<br />
<br />1. Search for 'command prompt' using Cortana or Windows Search.
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Command Prompt and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Type sfc /scannow command and press Enter key.
<br />
<br />4. Let the command complete and then reboot the machine. 
<br />
<br />If issue still persists, perform clean boot:

    <title>Mail keeps adding spurious images after I send - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keepingup51257  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail keeps adding spurious images after I send</h2>
                    <p>When I reply to an email, if it contained a link to a website (such as a company website that is referenced in the signature) Windows Mail seems to look on that site and selects a random jpg or img
 file from that page if it finds one, or selects an area of text on the page and makes a png image from it. It then attaches that image to the outgoing mail secretly; it doesn't show in the Outbox, nor even in the Sent Mail folder unless I deliberately refresh
 it later. It's rather like the way Facebook attaches an image if you include a link in one of your postings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The annoying thing is that the image may bear no relationship to the topic of the email, or the file my be unreadable by the recipient (especiaslly if its a png file) or it may be rejected by their
 firewall because it contains an image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on? Why does it do this and can I turn off this "undocumented feature"?</p>

            <p>I'm getting a better understanding of what is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the original company emails concerned, included some embedded images in the signature, as either jpg or png files (such as the Facebook Logo). When Mail replied to the mails, with the text of that original mail included, it needed to embed
 the images in the quoted text so it renamed them and then re-attached them as separate attachments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The senders were unaware that their company's standard signatures included images, and didn't understand the issue anyway; also they were unable to open the images so assumed that they probably contained viruses (indeed, one such company blocked the emails
 in its own firewall).</p>

    <title>Windows XP Support Has Ended - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael irwin 769  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP Support Has Ended</h2>
                    <p>After 13 years of generous support from Microsoft, this very popular and perhaps the most reliable operating system ever developed has officially retired. Many diehard XP users may find it difficult to part waves from one of Microsoft's most beloved and
 reliable operating system. For those true and devoted users who can't seem to pry themselves away from XP right away, there is some hope to continue using Windows XP for at least a little while longer. Since security software is gone forever by Microsoft with
 XP, it is suggested that users should try downloading a good anti-virus along with a reputable firewall. The built-in Windows Firewall may no longer function properly or if at all since XP itself is now non-supported. I'm not 100% clear on that however with
 the Windows Firewall, but it is a good idea to download a good firewall program online anyway for a greater piece of mind. Perhaps an anti-malware alongside may help reduce some problems with bad stuff attacking your XP equipment too.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; Of course, bear in mind that these things to help continue the running of Windows XP will not by any means last forever. In fact over time, it will get to a point when this operating system will begin to crumble. And the protective software that once spared
 XP may no longer have the power to strive on as new threats with viral and malicious software will be able to counteract these once effective security apparatuses. Upgrading to Windows 7, or Windows 8.1 may soon become a no option for those who wish to continue
 utilizing Microsoft Windows operating system products.</p>

            <p>I am a WinXP lover also. Built a new machine for Win7. I am still trying to get use to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Today while surfing the net I saw an article about Linux being like XP. </p>
<p>&nbsp;I have tried Ubuntu in the past. It was crazy and very hard to use being adept with XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;But this OS that the article was referring to was called 'Zorin' So I went to the site. It is a Linux OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I saved 2 copies,to their own folders, one 32bit and one 64bit. Printed out the install instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Followed the instructions and installed Zorin to this machine to dual boot with Win7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Surprisingly the install worked and also surprisingly Zorin is not half bad. I will mess around with it to see if it is a viable option to Windows OSes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Am using Firefox for the browser. I am use to Firefox anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Main thing to get/install the Zorin OS is to have a DVD burner and some blank DVD s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;You will download the OS to a folder then click on the finished download and it will prompt you to burn to DVD. Once that is done you reboot machine to the DVD player and follow instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;It is a lot like xp and win7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Any change in operating systems are not for some one who is not adept in doing so. Nor does not have anyway to recover from a bad install. So to them, if you do install Linux, do it as a dual boot configuration first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Note: I am still waiting for Microsoft to come out with a new OS mainly designed for DESKTOP PCs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Once that is a fact then I will go by the reviews to see if I want to use it.</p>

            Zorin is good. But I bet it can't run Photoshop Elements and CS6. But it is better than dumb down 7. If I can no longer use XP than I will have to cut back my computer using. Maybe enjoy life more. I rather use a Chromebook or MacPro. Gates needs to realize
 people like XP. He should make a XP2 version. But don't make it work like 3 clicks 7. Then everybody can be happy. But that definitely won't happen. He's od now and has no innovation. He's not a driven like Steve Jobs was. He only wants to save the world and
 waste money. He's a old softie now. Oh well. I still like XP.<br />

            <p>People should beware responders posting personal views and falsely representing them as fact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is something that is verifiably factual...</p>
<p>MSE is still supported on XP until July 14, 2015. Apparently the decision to extend MSE's life was taken
<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/mmpc/archive/2014/01/15/microsoft-antimalware-support-for-windows-xp.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
"To help organizations complete their migrations"</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said that, you should read this Wiki if you want to continue with MSE.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki/mse-protect_start/microsoft-security-essentials-452160-on-windows-xp/1328d67a-5720-4481-8662-e52a49a11a22">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki/mse-protect_start/microsoft-security-essentials-452160-on-windows-xp/1328d67a-5720-4481-8662-e52a49a11a22</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not believe that the functionality of any inherent XP software (firewall included) is affected by end of life policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not fact that Windows 7 interface is ugly, that is just personal opinion. All Windows versions, including XP, are customizable to make them not ugly if that is the user's perception. The same applies to sound effects and fonts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not fact that Explorer's functionality is any different in Windows 7 as compared with XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is fact that the structure of folders in a user's profile changed with Vista and this change has been perpetuated up to and including Windows 8. It is my personal opinion (i.e. not fact), that the new folder structure is better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not necessarily fact that XP is faster than Windows 7. It depends on what you measure. There is research on that here...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2355706,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2355706,00.asp</a></p>
<p>...and other places too (use Google).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not fact that it takes more clicks to do things on Windows 7. That depends on how you setup (customize) Windows 7 and how you setup (customize) Windows XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Shadow" will probably berate me for being an XP basher and a Microsoft lover but before he does he ought to read my contributions in the MSE Wiki mentioned above.</p>

            <p>Do what you can to lessen your risk. Use a decent antivirus (i.e. not Norton or McAfee). MSE will still provide updates for XP for another year at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back up your files <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">frequently</span>. That's good practice on any OS, but especially for one that's not getting updates. If you do get hit with something, if your files are backed up you can at least minimize the harm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be careful on the web and opening emails. I don't recommend using an XP machine on the internet these days, but if that's all you have, you should at least be careful about where you go. And use a browser that's still being updated. The last version of Internet
 Explorer for XP is 8, which is a few years old. Use Firefox and Chrome for browsing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ot if you're feeling adventurous you could try Linux. Ubuntu is a good distribution for someone new to Linux. I'd read up on it a little before making the jump, though.</p>

            Hi Snowy,
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Windows Media Player
<br />
<br />Click the links below to download the 3 troubleshooters for Windows Media player
<br />
<br />Then run each one individually, once that is done, check whether WMP is working correctly:
<br />

<br /><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_wmpdvd10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_wmpdvd10</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />Freezing system in general
<br />Open Task Manager (Ctrl + Shift + Esc)
<br />Is your RAM, CPU or Disk overly busy when your system is unresponsive?
<br />
<br />
<br />3. 
<br />Windows Update
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />Go to Update and Security - Windows Updates
<br />What update(s) are showing as pending on your system?

            Hi Snowy11, 1709 is no longer the latest version of Windows 10, 1803 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete and possibly fix a lot of the issues you are having  . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<p>Hey all!</p>
<p>This is a pretty old thread, which makes it hard to give you the great support these forums are known for.</p>
<p>As for your connection issues, Xbox Live is currently experiencing a disruption of service as seen on the
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Live Status page</a>. I'm afraid your best course of action at the moment is to keep checking that page to see when the service is back up and running and then try logging in again.</p>
<p>If you continue to have issues after that, please feel free to create a new thread so that we can help get to the bottom of your issue!</p>
<p>Thanks! :D</p>

<p>I had the same problem when I used Windows (Start), Search, to find Regedit.exe.
</p>
<p>I right clicked Regedit and saw via properties that it was trying to run a Windows XP Regedit.exe file buried deeply in my files. This Windows XP Regedit.exe file will not run on Windows 7, so I located the Win XP folder/file and removed it from my computer.
</p>
<p>Now Windows (Start), Search, finds the correct Regedit.exe file in C:\Windows and runs it.</p>
