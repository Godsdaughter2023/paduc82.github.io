<h2>            surface pen doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    Hi, I have a Surface Pro 3, core i5, 256 gig. Lately, I've noticed that my surface pen is not working so well. While the top purple button works perfectly, the pen does not write. I've unpaired and re-paired, I've taken the battery out and put it back
 it (it was put in correctly to begin with), I've changed batteries, I've restarted many many times, I've updated everything that needs to be updated. And still it doesn't work. What do I do?

            Unfortunately, I am in South Sudan and nobody has a Surface here, and obv no Microsoft store here. Pen works sometimes and doesn't work sometimes. It's extremely random.

            Yep, tried that with several new batteries, unfortunately, it did not resolve the issue. Mainly, it's just extremely random and I don't quite understand how or why it goes off.

<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Vista Answers Forum!</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you using the quick launch to open application?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is this happening only with desktop icons?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Since when are you facing this issue? Do you remember any recent software or hardware changes made on your computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Steps I would suggest are:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>If it was working fine before then you can perform System restore. Restore the computer to earlier time when it was working fine. To restore the computer successfully follow these
 steps;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, type system restore, right click on System Restore, and click "Run as administrator".</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>ii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Choose the correct date when the system was working fine and follow the instructions on the wizard to complete the process</span></p>
<p>
<span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/9f6d755a-74bb-4a7d-a625-d762dd8e79e51033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/9f6d755a-74bb-4a7d-a625-d762dd8e79e51033.msp<span>x</span></a></span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>If the issue is related only to Microsoft Word application then it would be better suited in the Microsoft
 Word Application community. Please visit the link below to find a community that will offer the support you request</span></p>

    <title>Quick Assist does not connect&#59; mutual waiting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> psiax  say:</h3>
<h2>            Quick Assist does not connect&#59; mutual waiting</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to help someone using Quick Assist.&nbsp; We both have Windows 10.&nbsp; As the assistor, I am able to create the 6-digit security code and as the one requesting help, she is able to enter it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, that is as far as we can get.&nbsp; W<span>e both just get spinning dots with messages to the effect each computer is waiting for the other.&nbsp; After 5 minutes or so an error finally appears.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Two observations:</p>
<p>1. When I get to choose "Take Control" vs. "View", the only option available is "Take Control"..."View" is grayed out.</p>
<p>2. Also, her computer settings had the "Allow remote assistance" checkbox turned off, but she has since turned it on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be appreciated.&nbsp; Generally a search for "troubleshoot Quick Access", articles about "how to troubleshoot using Quick Access" appear.&nbsp; In this case I need to "troubleshoot the troubleshooter" as it were.&nbsp; Are there any articles available
 to diagnose Quick Access itself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

</p><p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much. Your response is very quick. My problem is solved now. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that iPhone and Sony mobile could be paired with PC wirelessly. Likewise, iPhone and Sony Mobile could be paired with Bose Headphones wirelessly. But the Bose Headphone was not getting paired with the PC wirelessly&nbsp;even after doing everything possible
 and trying every suggested solution. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, as a trial, with the USB charging cable for the Bose Headphones, I connected the Headphone to the PC and kept the Headphone in "ready to pair"&nbsp;mode. With this, the Bose Headphones appeared in the Bluetooth devices (&nbsp;this was not happening in wireless
 mode&nbsp;) on the PC. I could immediately pair the headphones with the PC. It is working now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards</p>

<h2>            Unable to purchase Skype credit on my PC.</h2>
                    <p>I'm unable to purchase Skype credit on my PC. The options to purchase either £10 or £20 credit, but the buttons do not react. Recently, I purchased credit on my iPad, but payment went through iTunes and was not credited to Skype account, therefore I want
 to avoid this option. Unable to contact Skype for help. Who can help?</p>

            <p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p><br />
I understand that you’re unable to use the dymo label writer twin turbo software due to incompatibility issue . I will try to help you with this.</p>
<p><br />
Since Windows 8 is a new release there may not be programs designed for Windows 8. You can install it in Windows 8 using the compatibility mode. Follow the steps.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;a) Enter the Start screen<br />
b) Press Windows key + C on your keyboard to show the Charms bar (If you have a touchscreen: Touch the right edge of your screen and slide your finger to the center of the screen to show the Charms bar)<br />
c) Search for Troubleshooting, Click Settings in the right column.<br />
d) Click Troubleshooting. Click Run programs made for previous versions of Windows<br />
e) Click Next, select Not Listed. Click Next<br />
f) Click Browse and select the installer that you want to install using the link above.<br />
g) Click Next, click Troubleshoot program<br />
h) Check The program worked in earlier versions of Windows but won't install or run now box<br />
i) Click Next, select the last known working operating system for this driver (probably Window 7)<br />
j) Click Next.</p>

    <title>Can you change your IP to a specific IP address&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nuke2121  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can you change your IP to a specific IP address&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I work for a small automotive dealership. We use a repair program online called Mitchell. Up until recently, we were able to use this program at our homes to help work on our personal vehicles. Recently, when myself and other coworkers try to log into the
 website, it claims we are not using the current static IP address. Our boss realized this new change with the online program requires the shop to have a static IP address and the website only allows our username/password to be used with that specific IP address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand this is probable a new change to prevent shops from sharing their information with another shop. But that is obviously not what we are doing. As of right now if we work on our vehicles at home, we have to print out the entire breakdown procedure
 at work then take it home with us. This is very wasteful, especially on a big project.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what led me here. I am wondering if there is a way to temporary mask my IP address and be able to tell the website I am using my work IP address so my coworkers and I can work on our projects at home with our laptops open VS using up all the company
 paper and killing trees. Each IP address added to an account is $130 a month. Obviously not something any of us can afford just to work on our own vehicles.</p>

            AC Delco tech connect has such a program,but Mitchell hasn't cought up to that type of technology...A shop IP address is standard business practice these days,dought if 1 out a 100 wouldn't have one.A web site for a shop is cheap,try contacting youre suppliers
 for site assistance.also,youre oil/petro supplier,if its up to standards,will gladly pay for all above,all they require is their logo somewhere on web site...Get a copy of MTD modern tire dealer,tons of support companies are listed AC Delco Snap on,etc..Get
 after youre oil distribute folks or parts jobber,they all cover the shop internet costs,plus a ton of other areas.....

    <title>Windows 10 is a nightmare&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> no_sprecken  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 is a nightmare&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Major rant ahead. I have had issues with the Windows 10 upgrade since nearly day one. My system is not old (purchased in 2013) and in addition to this, I received SEVERAL prompts, messages, etc. from Microsoft reminding me to download this&nbsp;travesty because
 my system WAS FULLY COMPATIBLE with&nbsp;the upgrade&nbsp;as well as Windows Update <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
AUTOMATICALLY</span> downloading this piece of&nbsp;schmit onto my system. I finally gave in and upgraded only to render&nbsp;myself into an angry, anxiety ridden&nbsp;mess because I've had to fix major errors in my system since.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work full time and am an online student as well, so to have to take time and fix system instabilities has made me nearly have a nervous breakdown. I have contacted Microsoft directly and when they couldn't resolve my issues with basic troubleshooting,
 I paid $149 to have them go into deeper diagnostics. At one point I was told that my hard drive was the problem and needed to be replaced. I said NO, that is NOT the problem - the problem is the Windows 10 upgrade. I asked to speak to a manager and I complained
 loudly. He promised to assist me some more. I was then finally told that my system was not compatible with Windows 10. What?! Wasn't I just recently constantly bombarded with messages, alerts, etc. telling me that my system was ABSOLUTELY COMPATIBLE and that
 I needed to upgrade this entire time up until I upgraded? </p>
<p>
</p><p>What is&nbsp;more disturbing&nbsp;is that I see more diagnostics going on right here in this FREE forum than what I received after I PAID to get help. I don't recall that they ever ONCE looked at the crash dump files to see exactly what was going on or what drivers
 may be causing issues. I updated a couple drivers on my own over the course of a few weeks which temporarily solved my problems until Windows Updates were installed. My initial problem was the DPC WATCHDOG VIOLATION which sent my computer into the endless
 system freeze, then blue screen, then forced reboot - continuous - and I couldn't stay on my computer for more than 3 minutes before it would freeze.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this last Windows Update, my computer was sent into that vicious cycle again. I got frustrated and tried to reset but couldn't because I got the blue screen with error WDF VIOLATION. Then I tried to revert back to Windows 8.1 but couldn't because I
 got the blue screen again with the WDF VIOLATION. So now, I can't reset, I can't revert, I have a pile of junk computer that used to be great and it wasn't cheap!!! And here, I have Microsoft saying that my computer isn't compatible and that I shouldn't have
 upgraded. Oh, really? Hmm. Nice. They went to my pc manufacturer website, which is HP, and ran a test and this said that my model computer wasn't tested for compatibility with Windows 10. In basic terms, they said that I should have checked this out BEFORE
 I had upgraded. Oh really? Well, then&nbsp;why would you say that my computer is fully compatible?&nbsp;Also, instead, why not send an&nbsp;alert for me to CHECK&nbsp;and verify with my manufacturer FIRST instead of making the claim that you (Microsoft) know that my computer
 is fully compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At present, I have to get a recovery disk from HP and wait for it in the mail (tomorrow it is supposed to arrive), save all my files etc, wipe everything and reinstall Windows 8 and start all over. I'll lose all my custom additions that I paid for with my
 initial computer purchase so I'll have to hunt down everything and try to get it all back. I am so angry, disappointed, a mess, nauseous .... I have no time to fix all the garbage that Microsoft is throwing out at us. And then, when you ask them for help,
 they don't seem to know ANYTHING or how to do any diagnostics. Also, my original Windows 8 upgraded to Windows 8.1 without my consent and I had problems with the Windows Update screwing up in that as well! I was forced into that upgrade and it was a bugger
 too! However, at least my computer would STAY ON and I could actually use it! </p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft tech did some changes on my computer (changed and/or disabled some drivers etc) so now my computer will at least stay on, but I have lost my HP Support Assistant, my screen is all screwed up and stretched because&nbsp;it can only be in a weird resolution
 because of the AMD&nbsp;display driver I think, some applications and options don't work, and who knows what else. I don't even want to know because it might be my ticket to the mental institution. I hate my computer now. It used to be so beautiful and sharp, now
 it is horrible. I really don't want to do a recovery disk, I want a whole new computer and try to forget this nightmare. It's made me all emotional and given me a mean streak. And I'm a nice person lol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am just wondering if anyone has had this extreme trouble also. It's&nbsp;disgraceful and I can't believe that a major manufacturer can wreck people's machines like this without some offer of compensation or REAL help. This is absolutely unacceptable!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely disappointed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I&nbsp;truly believe&nbsp;that my system would work with Windows 10 if they would have stepped through any troublesome drivers, chipsets, etc., but as far as I could see as they worked on my computer remotely, they did not bring up any dump files or anything
 that showed errors or system errors. It seemed as if the "incompatible" explanation was the same as the "hard drive failure" explanation - in other words, it was just a guess without merit. Sad.</p>

            Hello, I too belief it is a nightmare.&nbsp; I have spent days and days on tech support getting it to even load, then it would crash on the few times that it did load.&nbsp; Each time a new person would tell me don't worry Dennis it will work.&nbsp; PURE ****.&nbsp; Finally
 on the 12th or maybe 13th time, seriously I counted till 10 tries and gave up counting, &nbsp;a nice young man got it on.&nbsp; Then it wants to install drivers that crash it.&nbsp; They have made this so you can't turn off downloads!!!!!&nbsp; HOW STUPID is that?&nbsp; So finally
 this morning it worked, I got my antivirus on, got my email setup with the help of my companies IT and then a popup said that a driver was installed and needed to restart.&nbsp; GUESS what, it crashed again.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have learned after hours on the phone with India,
 of course no Americans, to do a safe mode, then I disable the driver and restart,&nbsp; it wouldn't open, try &nbsp;again it wouldn't open , then it opened and looked bizarre, no p

            <p>Yes,similar problems. Windows 10 is a joke. It was released before any problems were worked out. I just did an upgrade, which created a new mirrored identity. All my files were gone.&nbsp; MS said I would have to take it to a&nbsp; MS repair center. The one they recommended
 was a 7.5 hour drive. Or I would have to subscribe to their tech repair service. As it turns out they couldn't even recognize the alternative identity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10 is incompatible with many programs. Many scanner/printer software does not work with it. And the techs at MS are buffoons! I was hung up on twice, routed to the wrong department, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stay away from MS 10 at all costs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

            <p>Wait to you have 200 customers with their PC failing after the pushed windows 10 updates... I had a lawyer that lost a case due to the computer spending an unannounced 3 hours updating, happened 30 min before she was due in court and was just about to printout
 the brief. And many other problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has become the most arrogant company on the planet. &nbsp; Hope a large group of people get together and sue them for the lost time....</p>

            <p>I seriously wonder how many people suffer anxiety attacks, high blood pressure, nervous breakdowns because of the stress caused by windows 10. When I was first force fed Windows 10, I thought I would at least try to make it work. After I managed to kill
 Cortana and shut off Bing, I thought maybe I could handle it, so I didn't downgrade back to Windows 7 while I still had time.</p>
<p>Stupid mistake.&nbsp;Ever since the upgrade I have not been to function productively at my work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't make my way through the clutter on my screen to find what I'm looking for.
</p>
<p>I have been working on computers since before DOS. WE used to assemble them ourselves, configure, control cards, hard disks, all that. But now I am completely at a loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am constantly having to go to their unhelpful help screens to find out how to deal with some minor change in the way the program does things. For instance, I wanted to look through photos without waiting a half hour to display the thumbnails, so after
 consulting their webpage, I found how to toggle on the preview pane. Then today I wanted to toggle it off. So I searched that, and couldn't find it. On their help page, they ask if the help was actually helpful. However, the only possible response is YES.
 You cannot say NO, you help is NOT helpful, in fact it sucks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after a long struggle to log in, I finally have the privilege adding my voice to the multitudes who have gone before me and say that Windows tend really, really, really, really .... really really sucks!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strong recommendation.. go back to XP or 7.. Do NOT upgrade until you substantial improvement.<br />

            Wow, my problems with it are starting to look petty. But if anyone can tell me how to stop the system assuming what I want to do instead of waiting until I tell it I would be happy. For example I start selecting files because i want to move them somewhere
 and after I have selected maybe 8 or 9 the system copies all of them right there in the folder they are already in. Who would even want to do that? And just now I moved my mouse pointer in some way that told the computer I want to shut down everything I was
 doing.&nbsp;

            <p>So sorry folks are still having problems. I finally ripped the program out of my computer, well, a nice tech person did.&nbsp; I also had them remove any contact with 10 so it won't try and sabotage me.&nbsp; It took over one of our computers at work and downloaded
 on its own accord [??]&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate what MS has become, arrogant and imposing their will on our needs.&nbsp; Jeez.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I must say that I had to purchase a new computer that had 10 on it and no issues at all.&nbsp; I think that really they just want to force folks into buying a new PC, the sales are down on them, so how better to force us to upgrade to a new computer&nbsp;than by making
 a program which they force on us that doesn't work on what 35% or more older computers??&nbsp; They have some serious making up to do.&nbsp; I lost perhaps 40-50 hours of work time just trying to get the stupid thing to work on my&nbsp; three year old computer before I just
 gave up, well, actually, windows 10 killed the computer.&nbsp; They wanted me to drive somewhere over two hours away to fix it.&nbsp; So, now it has 8.1 back on it, and just sits on the shelf, I have no need for this computer now, it is waiting for my wife's old vista
 to die.&nbsp;&nbsp; good luck, d&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I installed Windows 10 on two machines. &nbsp;One is a five year old desktop Dell and the other, a two year old Toshiba laptop. &nbsp;Both of these received the message of compatibility with Windows 10 from Microsoft, so I upgraded them. The lesser disaster was with
 the older desktop, much worse on the newer laptop. &nbsp;Although I am not particularly "tech" savvy, I am a mid-range capable user of computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main problem with both machines is freezes and slowdowns. &nbsp;When typing text, most times there is a terrible lag and loss of characters typed which requires going back to re-enter the text. &nbsp;On both machines there is the constant straining of fans and
 motors "breathing heavy" as if the machine is about to have a coronary. &nbsp;Whether doing email or responding on a website blog, this same thing constantly occurs. &nbsp;At times the opposite happens, everything goes quiet and into a near comatose state. &nbsp;It's as
 if all of the drivers and software wiring in Windows 10 is either underdeveloped or poorly developed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned above, my biggest Windows 10 disaster was with my newer laptop. &nbsp;After installing the system into the machine, I couldn't get my WiFi to work. &nbsp;I tried over and over to no avail. &nbsp;Once plugged into ethernet, no problem. &nbsp;But a laptop is meant
 for mobile use without wires so, dopey me, I did a full wipe out and reinstall. &nbsp;Little did I know that this required me to forgo all of the Toshiba installed items along with some apps I had bought and paid for. &nbsp;It seemed as though I had no other option
 and hit "enter" to do the deed. &nbsp;Now what I have is a half naked laptop with problems and a desktop with the same problems. &nbsp;Windows 10 is a big fat flop in my view! &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not possible to opt out of windows update. The Windows 10 operating system is designed to receive and install updates whenever they are offered. This is done because the updates will help to keep the computer in a good shape and in a optimally working
 condition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Dear thanks for the reply,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Preeti you might be working on Microsoft forum, and you dont deserve my rant i will leave at that,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why you repeated their line&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This is done because the updates will help to keep the computer in a good shape and in a optimally working condition</span>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>In view Upadtes are one size fit all. And it does not fit me, so you are telling me, it fit you or not, but its good for me. It make no sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and you probably from india, that's mean you know about the metered connection things, so this claim of you, that window updates are good for me, make no sense</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although &nbsp;i dont have metered connection that's not my concern. My problem is updates are one size fit all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although i already install Linux on my second machine. now i am searching for few software which i normally use on this machine. slowly slowly i will move on, cause i am literally done with Microsoft telling what good for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if I cant find good software. I will move on to mac, although i think mac is not good investment for me, but i use my machine for work. So its pretty important for me, that i am in complete control of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and its kinda weird, i like window 8, I hated the metro get rid of in few hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and i like Window 10 as well. But microsoft want to be my granny, i already got one granny i dont need other one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish you luck</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing against you.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype Number No Longer Working</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I live in AU but I have (or rather, had) a US Skype number, which I mostly use for people to call me.</p>
<p>On 1 March 2018 my credit expired and I've just logged in to reactivate it, however it seems that my number no longer exists.</p>
<p>I've tried to get a new number and it's giving me a different number to the one I had previously.</p>
<p>Obviously I would like my old number back, how do I do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you</p>

    <title>how to get headshots&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pryingtuna85649  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to get headshots&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Does anyone have any tips for learning how to get headshots better?&nbsp; I got hung up on one of the Undead Nightmare challenges with getting (if I remember correctly) 5 headshots in 8 seconds with the sniper rifle and without using deadeye.&nbsp; The reticule is
 so small and the zombies seem to move right as I pull the trigger.&nbsp; I don't have problems with headshots in FPS (and usually prefer sniper rifles)...but in RDR it's miserable to me.&nbsp; Does anyone have any advice?</p>

<p>For that particular challenge you can just do execution kills. Just throw some bait or find a random event that have a bunch of zombies hurdled up together and just run in the middle of them pressing just RT. You'll have a quick cut scene of you putting
 the barrel to the head and shooting. Of-course have a sniper out. Execution only work in Single-player.</p>
<p>Generally getting headshots with normal weapons (hand gun, rifle, shotgun.) is easy. Just snap-to target and just move RS up a little. Unless you like using expert aim.
</p>
<p>Snipers always have to use expert aim and treated like in every FPS. Some advice that I give people (who sometimes calls me stupid) is use the Rolling Block Rifle and not the Carcano. The Rolling Block has better damage and better accuracy over the Carcano
 from my experiences. But people seem to think since you unlock the Carcano after the Rolling Block means that it's better.

<h2>            configuring  DHCP for local area connection</h2>
                    <p>I can not enable the DHCP for local area connection. I've tried by troubleshooting and trying to fix it as administrator, but it didn't work. I also tried to manually enable DHCP by clicking the option 'obtain ip address and dns server automatically' but
 every time after I apply this option and come out of it the changes reverted to a static ip. How can I fix this? I can not share my laptop's&nbsp;network&nbsp;with my other devices.&nbsp;</p>

            It's likely due to the limitations of IP in the DHCP server. Better you can contact the network administrator or IT support to resolve it.

<h2>            error message &#43; 0x080010108</h2>
                    <p>In Windows Live Photo Gallery, I get an error message:&nbsp; "An error is preventing the photo or video from being displayed.&nbsp; Error Code:&nbsp; 0x80010108."&nbsp; What does this mean?&nbsp; I have an flower icon showing instead of my actual photo.&nbsp; How can I convert back to
 my original photo.&nbsp; I have gone into Control Panel and checked off "show hidden files".&nbsp; What else can be done?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
