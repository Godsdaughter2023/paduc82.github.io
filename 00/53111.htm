            <p>Hello, there are a couple different ways to utilize the coloring pages (Activity Packs).&nbsp; My assumption here is that you are presently inside of an Artwork and need help returning to the Gallery.&nbsp; Please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.&nbsp; For starters,
 Windows 8 has a feature called “edgy.” It takes a bit of getting used to, but once you get the hang of it it’s quite nice.&nbsp; Just swipe down from the top of your screen and the menus will appear. If you are using a mouse you can right click.&nbsp; This will expose
 the AppBar.&nbsp; From there, click the 'Back' button in the top-left corner.&nbsp; That will return you to the Gallery, wherein you can select a new Activity Pack to paint.</p>

<h3> fifthinflight  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intermittent crashes&#47;freezes during start up, Windows 7&#58; Home Premium.</h2>
                    I have a brand new Asus U30A notebook and have had issues with start up right out of the box.&nbsp; Sometimes it will freeze on a black screen after the "Starting Windows" page and other times it will give me the "did not shut down properly" page and provide
 the option for launch repair.&nbsp; I have run that utility several times with no effect.&nbsp; Other times it starts up without any problems.&nbsp; Once Windows is loaded, there are no issues.&nbsp; Unfortunately I'm serving in the Peace Corps in Cameroon so sending it back
 to Asus for repair is not really an option.&nbsp; Which also makes getting current system updates a bit difficult.&nbsp; Is this a common issue within Windows or does it sound like a hardware problem?&nbsp; Thanks.

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1. </strong><br />
In this scenario you can always perform a start up repair which usually fixes the startup issues automatically.<br />
Follow the articles for help on startup repair.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7</a></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2.</strong><br />
These issues are normally caused by the bad driver files. I would also ask you to update all the hardware drivers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer to the articles below for additional information.<br />
<strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsg/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsg/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3.</strong></div>
<div>
<div>Please check whether you face the same issue while working in the safe mode.<br />
a. Restart your computer.<br />
b. When the computer starts you will see your computer's hardware being listed. When you see this information start to gently&nbsp; tap the F8 key on your keyboard repeatedly until you are presented with the Windows&nbsp;7 Advanced Boot Options screen.<br />
c. Using the arrow keys, select the Safe Mode option you want.<br />
d. Then press the enter key on your keyboard to boot into Windows 7 Safe Mode with Networking.<br />
e. When Windows starts, use Internet explorer and check if the issue still persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For additonal information refer to the articles below.</div>
<div><strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></div>

&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue does not exist in Safe Mode perform Clean Boot troubleshooting to find the root cause of&nbsp;the issue.<br />

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> When the troubleshooting is over do not forget to reset the computer to normal startup. Follow the step 7 in the above article.</div>

<h2>            Mouse and keyboard support</h2>
                    Hello! Today i bought a microsoft all in one media keyboard for xbox one s, and I'm very disappointed...it just works like a gamepad, i even can't change the language...Trackpad is dead...so is there a chance that ms will give us plausibility to use mouse
 and keyboard like on pc? For example, i have a pc in my living room, and i use it for games and internet browsing, why i can't do the same in my bedroom with xbox and keybord? Maybe at least full keyboard and mouse support for ms edge?

<h2>            System recovery stuck on initiallizing partition Toshiba Satellite A305 with Vista O&#47;S HELP&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>My system crashed a while back. I have repeatedly tried running the system recovery both from the partition and then from the disk ordered directly from Toshiba. The system will run the recovery VERY slowly (usually taking upwards of 20 minutes just to get
 to the point where I am asked how I want to restore the system. I have tried all the available options (customizing the size of the partition, returning to out of box state, etc) only to get to the next step where it begins "initiallizing partition" and it
 gets permanently hung up in this screen.</p>
<p>Knowing that the previous screens took a very long time to load from the disk, I even let it run all night and it never progresses any further! Please help! I just want to get it all working like it did when I first got it! I have had plenty of computer
 issues through the years and usually been able to fix them with little or no help, but I've never seen a computer get so consistently hung up running its own system recovery.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any answers for me! I will happily provide any additional computer-related details if you need them to help diagnose the problem!</p>
<p>I thank anyone who is willing to help in advance!</p>

<p>Hi Liz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might be that the main reason why your Enhances Storage Filter Driver status shows degraded is because of the fact that you are having an issue with updating Windows as what you have stated on your post. The Enhanced Storage Filter Driver is a kernel
 service of Windows and gets updated along with the the Operating System. First, we need to troubleshoot your issue regarding the Windows Update. Kindly visit the link provided here for the update troubleshooter:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows
 Update Troubleshooter.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After a successful Windows update restarts your computer, the system services should have been restarted as well freshly updated. Should in any case the Enhanced Storage Filter Driver still shows degraded, you can follow the steps provided below to restore
 the default startup configuration for this kernel service:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows button</strong><strong> + R</strong>.</li><li>Launch the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> by typing <strong>CMD </strong>and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Type the following commands:
<ul>
<li><em>sc config EhStorClass start= boot</em></li><li><em>sc start EhStorClass</em></li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Close </strong>the Command Prompt and <strong>Restart </strong>the computer.</li></ol>
<p>

            Give this a try, open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy
<br />Scroll down to bottom
<br />Select Background apps
<br />Toggle off 'Let apps run in the background' - you can also scroll down to Edge and toggle off that specifically.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting Edge:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: powershell
<br />Right click PowerShell then click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the prompt, type: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose}
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />When complete, exit PowerShell, restart your computer then check if Edge is working again.

<p>Thanks to all - those of you that kept coming back to hardware/heat were way ahead of me, but you were right.&nbsp; Finally got down and dirty, the plastic part that holds the main processor heat sink clamps had broken, allowing the heat sink to pull away from
 the processor.</p>
<p>A new heat sink retainer clip, a little grease, and we're back in business.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks to all - every comment helps.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Kenneth, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s solve your concern.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue could be because of incompatible or corrupted drivers on the computer. Please follow the below steps to resolve the issue:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open the Device Manager.</span></li></ol>
<ol>
<li><span>Tab once, then go down with the arrow keys to the list of unknown devices. It should say Touchpad on at least one item.</span></li><li><span>Open up the properties for the Touchpad device, and try to install a driver from
<strong>local disk</strong> (do not search online, that won’t help).</span></li><li><span>Choose <strong>USB input device</strong> as the driver, do not use the apple driver just yet. After the installation is finished, your touchpad will work.</span></li><li><span>After installing the USB driver, you can perform the same steps, but pick the Apple driver. After the installation is complete, your touchpad will work as expected.</span></li></ol>

            I had to step away for quite sometime out of sheer frustration with Microsoft.&nbsp; My PC worked perfectly with Windows 7 and with the "upgrade" to Windows 10, I have lost many features.&nbsp; I have tried every offered suggestion regarding my now useless touch
 pad with no success.&nbsp; Now I have to carry my mouse around everywhere I go to use my PC.&nbsp; I'll ask again, how can I get my touchpad to work as it did prior to the so-called upgrade to Windows 10?

            <p>Recovery your Computer (Windows) by using the Manufacture's "Recovery Partition" or
<br />
contact the PC manufacture&nbsp; (see support links included below) and order recovery media.</p>
<p><br />
Note: Activation is not required when using the recovery partition or recovery media but you will need to re-install all your applications.</p>
<p><br />
Also backup your documents to external media (if possible) before you start the recovery process.</p>
<p><br />
Once completed your PC will be effectively back to the state when you first purchased it and turned it on for the 1st time.</p>
<p><br />
To access the Recovery Partition, start your computer and then pressing the appropriate function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12, DEL or Tab key. Check the list below or your User's manual for your make and model.</p>

            No. There is no specific list of words, but any words you use have to follow the&nbsp;<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/codeofconduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Code of Conduct.</a>&nbsp;Since that word can be considered offensive and controversial,
 it is not allowed even if you things it's okay.

            There is a difference between friendly trash talk, and trash talk that can be offensive... comments such as "come at me bro" are not considered offensive by Live, as it can be seen as a friendly challenge, say, in Mortal Kombat, or Battlefield. Saying
 comments that refer to racial or ethnic offenses are not something that is tolerated by Xbox.

            Surely you can understand why you got reported and then suspended for using a term that is racially charged? I get that you didn't mean it in that way, but you have to be careful about the language you use on Xbox Live, especially when you're not amongst
 friends.

            Xbox live dose not allow trash talking if you are doing it to be disrespectfully. Using the words you did that is why you got the strike. Not all people see things the same way.as where you think it is harmless fun, may not be to others. just take the
 strike as a warning and be careful what you say. because the next time it may be more than a strike. I know because I have friends on my friends list that got communication banned for 3 months. So just be careful

            If you called someone a "meanie" or "butthead" or any simple name like that and they got offended (no matter what people will be) and they reported you, you'd get a suspension. Xbox Live is meant to be a "safe space" so it's best to just turn your mic
 off unless you're in a party.

            Obviously the&nbsp; person who&nbsp; you said that to didn't find it very friendly which is why they reported it. As the word sounds like the hard R word. That would be classed as offensive as the code of conduct clearly states you cant use words that look like
 or sound like offensive words

 help would be appreciated. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

I screenshot the note when it was on top of a white background, but it is actually transparent even though it's supposed to show the text of the sticky note and the yellow background.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi hacktech,<br />
<br />
Thanks for using the Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
I suggest uninstalling and reinstalling the Live Messenger program.<br />
You should be able to do that from the Programs menu in the Control Panel.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, you can try using the System File Checker to find corrupt or missing Vista files that may be causing the issue.<br />
Here's how:</span></p>

<h2>            How is my &#34;device at risk&#34; for a silly forced Windows 10 update not installing itself properly&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My device should be at risk if&nbsp;<strong>I </strong>forced my computer to install or upload or update or download something wrong. Not if an automated update imports itself incorrectly? How can Microsoft engineer something so faulty that MY device is "at risk"
 for IT installing incorrectly????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not to mention if you copy and paste the threatening "error" message in its fancy red font "<strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">Your device is at risk because it's out of date and missing important security and quality updates. Let's get you back on track
 so Windows can run more securely. Select this button to get going</span></strong>". Yes, scary to see that isn't it? Rushing to the internet to fix the "problem" by installing something your computer doesn't need, aren't you?&nbsp; Use your heads. Google this exact
 same message, copy and paste, and see that THOUSANDS of people on several sites and this one have the same issue. Can Microsoft REALLY make money if we ALL are running devices that are about to BREAK because of ITS update? No one thought to simply ask HOW
 your device is "at risk"? So *I* will ask. HOW is my device at risk???? What is the "risk"? Why do *I* have to do fancy stuff and install random software to FIX MICROSOFT'S issue?? No one thought to get compensation, or at least an explanation???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last time something forced itself into my computer and without my permission or knowing, and then my device became "at risk" IT WAS A MALWARE VIRUS. Not a Microsoft UPDATE for 3D effects!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when the update first tried to install itself, I didn't even know that it was, until I turned my computer off, got some beauty sleep, and woke up to another bright beautiful day, and then saw "Getting your device ready, do not turn off" and waiting for
 it to install.God knows what, and then just dealing with it, and then restarting my computer, and then getting on with my day before I see a pesky notification saying, "Updates didn't install." And then my computer slows down, and then I go to This PC in File
 Explorer, and see that this PHANTOM update is trying itself AGAIN NOT PERMITTED and SUCKING UP a DOZEN GB. So I go to Updates and Security in Settings and click on "see what's new in this update" as it installs (without my permission) and it's some NONSENSE
 about "3D effects, and adding contacts to toolbar/desktop." THAT'S IT. THAT'S what's forcing itself and using my GB?! And THEN it fails OVER AND OVER for mysterious reasons, and then it asks me "Pending Updates: Countdown to 'GOODNESS': Pick a time to restart
 your device." And it fails. And does the whole entire demonic process again of mysteriously installing, mysteriously devouring my GB, and mysteriously failing,&nbsp;and asking me to try again. It does this honestly about 10 times! Until this morning, when it finally
 did...something...and gave me this "error message" about my device being at risk. THREATENING me to install the stupidness! For "3D effects." My computer is at risk because it didn't properly install 3D effects???
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>MICROSOFT Get yourself together before I buy LINUX OR MAC. LIKE A NORMAL PERSON. Your a multi BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY. You don't need to FORCE AND THREATEN people to install FAULTY software for more money, do you????&nbsp;</p>

            I don't see much in the way of a question(s) there.
<br />
<br />The message you are seeing is typically MS, it is very generic. They lump "new features" (like 3d) and security updates together when they trigger this one generic message.
<br />
<br />So no, a failed "3d feature" update is not likely to cause security issues. But the message does not indicate if any other updates, specifically security updates failed or were not tried because of the failed update.  You have to look in Update History to find out if there are any other failed or outstanding updates.
<br />
<br />The rest of your posting is your "high" opinion of MS programming. This is not the place to express that. No one who matters at MS will see it here.  A better place to do that is post using the Windows Feedback Hub

<br />How do I give feedback on Microsoft Office?:
<br />.
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-do-i-give-feedback-on-microsoft-office-2b102d44-b43f-4dd2-9ff4-23cf144cfb11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-do...</a>
<br />.
<br />This is MS "official" documentation with links to appropriate UserVoice and "Answers" forums. 
<br />.
<br />********
<br />.
<br />Feedback is a quality control SUPPLEMENT to MS "telemetry" (aka spyware) which MS use to reduce impact of update problems.  
<br />.
<br />&lt;snip <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-how-microsoft-used-ai-to-speed-up-its-april-2018-update-roll-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-how-mi...</a> &gt;
<br />.
<br />But Microsoft insists its combination of telemetry data and artificial intelligence (AI) actually made this update both "safe and fast", allowing it to identify problems early and block updates to hardware it will cause problems for. 
<br />...
<br />Our AI approach has enabled us to quickly spot issues during deployment of a feature update
<br />,,,
<br />We immediately blocked all PCs that could be impacted by this issue from being updated, and communicated to customers within 24 hours, including an initial work around.
<br />....
<br />&lt;/snip&gt;

</p><p>1. I have used Feedback Hub before. I'm not wasting my time. I want to share dissent with frustrated users who want answers now. Microsoft needs to face its faults.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Yes, a "failed 3D effect update" indeed. I don't know who you are and why you have quoted that as if it's nonsensical. But it is nonsensical. But that's what the update is, something about people who want to use some video making app can now use 3D. Something
 stupid and useless along those lines is the crux of the irritating features update. You can clearly and easily confirm that by simply clicking on See What's New In This Update. Maybe you're tired or you're not using your head, but it's a readily available
 link and you seem to have missed it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. It did fail. That's what the message from Microsoft itself has said. It failed to update itself, so now my device is at "risk." Regardless, I want to know what the risk is. And all you've done is provided a critique of my post, rather than provide a useful
 answer. As usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Lastly, How is my device at risk if I do not "fix" and install this useless forced update? And if something happens to my device, who do I sue? Because it is not MY fault that my device is now "at risk" because of THEIR update, one that I did NOT ask for!

            Deepak, I am having the same issue as Troy, and like him, there are no untrusted publishers listed, so your fix is not a fix, and I am still unable to install a very important piece of software from Samsung. What's up with this? Do I need to uninstall
 Windows 10 and maybe wait six months to try it again, if ever?

            Contact Samsung. &nbsp;They know about the MS security issue and were very helpful getting me a new driver I could install. &nbsp; I suspect the cause is expired certs, but that is going to happen anytime an upgrade makes people upgrade drivers that might have been
 available for a while. &nbsp; I'm sure they will re-sign everything on their website eventually, but lets face it, that is a LOT of busy work when you have that many devices. &nbsp;You'd think there would be a way to get around this. &nbsp;MS is dead wrong that these failures
 show up in IE Internet Options as an untrusted publisher.

            Thanks, a2, it helps to know that Samsung is aware of this and working to fix it. I had actually found a workaround, which was to temporarily disable another security setting, but you are correct, MS is just blowing smoke with that silly IE suggestion.
 I am all in favor of security, but when it prevents me from installing software that I know is safe, and does not have a simple bypass after a warning, then it has gone too far. I really hope MS does something about that quickly, because it seems the problem
 is widespread, and it WILL drive people back to WIN 7 or 8, myself included.

    <title>Facing issues with Cardreaders after installing 1703 &#47; W10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rob vdo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Facing issues with Cardreaders after installing 1703 &#47; W10 Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work for a computer company and we are using OPK kits for imaging our desktop computers.</p>
<p>At the moment, we are still rolling out W10 1607.1 since the Creators Update (1703 and also the recently released 1703.1) has a nasty issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been tested and confirmed on multiple systems here, different mainboards, and it is with both W10 Home and Professional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the issue:<br />
We put an SD card into a cardreader. Either a desktop with built-in cardreader or any other internal cardreader we tested it with (several brands) all have the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use "Eject USB storage" from the task bar, as shown below, I get an Code 47 error in the Device Manager.</p>
<p>Now, with the 1607 or older versions, once you remove the SD card, the error disappears (because then you remove the hardware from the computer) but not in this case. Here it persists even after you remove the SD card. Re-inserting the card does nothing,
 it doesn't show up again.<br />
<br />
In short: It seems this Eject option disables the cardreader rather than ejects the SD card. Also, deleting the driver and reinstalling it won't work until you reboot the system. Then the SD card/cardreader can be accessed again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Funny enough, if you eject the SD card through the Windows Explorer by right clicking the drive and then "Eject" all works fine and you can re-insert the card with it correctly showing up again.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>(By the way, doing this with normal USB sticks in normal USB headers works just fine so it's not a general USB thing either.)</em></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I would actually be pretty amazed if I were the first to actually notice this, older hits when looking for this issue are
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/windows-10-disables-sd-card-reader-instead-of/7322a0c6-8c6a-46a7-822a-807a939765a0">
This link</a> but as stated there, the troubleshooter can't fix it, other drivers don't solve the issue (hard to find by the way for such generic devices) either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what I am missing here? Or maybe this is actually a problem with the built-in Windows driver? In that case, I would appreciate it if someone has a 1703(.1) compatible driver to remedy this issue.
</p>
<p>Thank you all for reading and any suggestions you can give me.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Rob</p>

<p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a lot of possible reasons why this issue is happening. Hardware compatibility issues with the latest version of Windows, corrupted system files, incorrect registry keys, and outdated drivers that still doesn't have any latest working updates with
 Creators Update are only a few of these reasons. We can say that your issue is unusual because at times, the cardreaders or other devices that receives error code 47 will totally fail to work if there are really no available working drivers after Creators
 Update. In your case, it still worked after you have done the said steps. Most of the external card readers supports plug and play so ejecting the device and doing a plug and replug will actually reinstall its built-in driver for the device. Different from
 you since you have computers which have the card readers built-in inside the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend you to run the Microsoft Easy Fix for this issue you are encountering. Kindly visit the link provided here and look for "Find and fix problems with devices and hardware":

<p>Done testing.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Tried to add the 1607 drivers through DISM to the 1703 installation since Windows won't allow downgrading through device manager.</p>
<p>That actually was able to allow me to downgrade to the (unsigned) older drivers to see if that made a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Didn't work, but that's not a bad thing, got that off my list.</p>
<p>Then I tried another card reader (different brand) and that actually worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Failing cardreader was a LogiLink CR0012, the working one a Recom RC-DR-A3, both USB2.0 models)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So: It seems the Creators Update, apart from i.e. the Intel “Clover Trail” CPU's, also has a more limited support for well, amongst others, cardreaders.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Not an issue to most system builders, just a matter of finding the right (read: compatible) card reader or drivers to remedy it.</p>
<p>Finding generic USB drivers is quite the challenge for these low budget cardreaders. If you happen to know, do share, please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is, with this whole ordeal, that computer cases we use with built-in cardreaders
<strong>also</strong> experience this, and therefore it is quite undesirable to preinstall these machines with the Creators Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's not the only thing ofcourse: Also, units in the field (read: our end users) who get this update pushed through the Windows Update service, suddenly end up having this issue.<br />
<br />
I just hope Microsoft will somehow update this in the Fall Update (or sooner!) so this issue gets solved.
</p>
<p>It would be nice to see that things works again with a broader spectrum of cardreaders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can always advise people to use the Eject through Windows Explorer as a workaround, it's just not desirable. Yes the cardreaders work, and repeated safe removal and re-inserting too through this method, but as I see it, why does it has to be different
 from the 'safe removal' option through the task bar? Must be some unintended bug of some kind in regards to some types of (older?) cardreaders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading and if there's any more things I can try, don't hesitate to let me know. Thanks in advance!</p>

    <title>Cannot connect to school network share and cannot see other devices on - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot connect to school network share and cannot see other devices on home network.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a laptop running Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit. I have no problems connecting to my home network. I also have no problems connecting to my college network while on campus. However, I am having problems related to my network drive on my college network
 as well as seeing other devices on my home network. I have the following information to aid with suggestions:</p>
<p>laptop specs: HP Pavilion dv6-1264ca Artist Edition 2, AMD Turion X2 Ultra dual-core ZM-82 @ 2.20 GHz / core, 4.00 GB RAM, 500 GB hard drive</p>
<p>dual booting Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit and Ubuntu 10.10, using GRUB bootloader. Windows is my preferred OS.</p>
<p>500 GB hard drive: 30 GB for Windows, 25 GB for Ubuntu, rest is "storage" for documents, music, pictures, etc...</p>
<p>I have disabled some Windows services, which may affect certain Windows functionality.</p>
<p>I have two different scenarios here and I would appreciate both to hopefully be fixed.</p>
<p>I will start with my home network. I use a D-Link DIR-625 Rangebooster N wireless router. There are four computers (all connect with wireless N), an XBOX 360 (wireless G), and two iPod touch devices (both second gen models on wireless G) on the network.
 The computers are as follows: a Mac, my laptop, a desktop running Windows XP (either Media Center or Home, I don't remember), and a laptop running Ubuntu 8.10. There is an HP Color LaserJet printer attached to the desktop with XP. The other laptop (running
 Ubuntu 8.10), the XP desktop, and the Mac can all see each other, and they can all print using that printer (the printer is shared on the network via the XP desktop). My Windows 7 installation cannot see any network devices other than the router. Internet
 access is fine.</p>
<p>The second scenario is when I use my laptop at school. I attend Algonquin College in Ottawa and they allow mapping of your network drive to your laptop to access school documents saved on the school network from your laptop. The share is located at \\algshare\home,
 but when I try to map the drive to my laptop (and enter my credentials), it refuses to connect after several credentials pop-ups, citing the path as invalid (which I know it is not). I can see other laptops on the college network while I am on campus (which
 adds to the confusion of my first problem) and I have internet access at college, but I can not access my shared drive on-campus using my laptop.</p>
<p>Does anybody have any suggestions (services, registry settings, network settings, etc...) that might explain my problems? Thanks in advance</p>
<p>EDIT: forgot some info. The printer is an HP Color LaserJet 1600 (forgot the model number). Both my home network and the college network are treated by Windows as home networks. HomeGroup is disabled (I have no need for it, or so I think). And my Ubuntu
 10.10 is the 64 bit version.</p>

<p><span>Hi Benjamin,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure that the Network discovery is turned on in Windows 7 computer.&nbsp;</span><span>Network
 discovery is a</span><span>network</span><span> setting that affects whether your computer
 can find other computers and devices on the network and whether other computers on the network can find your computer.</span></p>
<span>To turn on network discovery in&nbsp;<span>Windows&nbsp;7</span></span><span><span>,
 follow the steps below:</span></span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open Advanced sharing settings
 by clicking the </span></span><span><span>Start</span></span><span><span> button, and then clicking
</span></span><span><span>Control Panel</span></span><span><strong><span>.</span></strong></span><span><span>
 In the search box, type </span></span><span><span>network</span></span><span><span>, click&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Network
 and Sharing Center</span></span><span><span>, and then, in the left pane, click</span></span><span><span>Change
 advanced sharing settings</span></span><span><strong><span>.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click the chevron to expand the&nbsp;
<span><span>Home or Work&nbsp; </span></span>network profile.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select the options to turn on network
 discovery.</span></p>
<span>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click on Save changes and Exit.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Restart the computer and check if it helps you access the network device and map the network drive in your
 school network. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also access the link below and follow the steps to network the computer running different version of
 Windows and check if it helps you fix the home network issue and if you can access the network devices.</span></span></p>
