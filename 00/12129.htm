I have a similar problem. Since the installation of the latest MS update, all my emails prior to 17 May 2018 have vanished. The number in my inbox shows as 60, but only 12 are showing.

            Hi Pete
<br />
<br />Sorry, there is no Excel equivalent to the Word feature for customizing Keyboard shortcuts. 
<br />
<br />It may be possible with a 3rd party utility, but Microsoft does not provide us a way to do that . . .

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DNS server not found error message means the user’s Internet service is not available or currently inaccessible via the Internet. In order to resolve the said error you must first establish whether your own Internet service or a specific server is unavailable.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If one website is unavailable while all other websites are still accessible, that website’s server is malfunctioning or undergoing maintenance. Other ways to resolve this issue is to flush your DNS by following these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.To open the Command Prompt, press Win + R and type cmd .</p>
<p>2.Type ipconfig /flushdns . Wait for the command to process and then restart your computer.</p>
<p>3.Test the connection again. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem still persists, you can also delete cookies, other site plug-in data and also clear browsing data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<br />
Of course it works. &lt;grin&gt;<br />
<br />
You made a sheet visible when clicking a hyperlink. </p>
<p>Now you want to make a sheet hidden when you click a hyperlink.<br />
<br />
You don't have to determine the sheet (you are on it)<br />
Each sheet has its own module (a class module). It (the sheet) is referenced in code with the "Me" variable.<br />
So, in each sheet you want to hide, in the sheet module you add...<br />
<br />
'---<br />
Private Sub Worksheet_FollowHyperlink(ByVal Target As Hyperlink)<br />
Me.Visible = xlSheetHidden<br />
End Sub<br />

re:&nbsp; make sheet visible, so hyperlink to it functions<br />
<br />
The code goes in the table of contents worksheet code module. It get the name of the sheet, removes any single apostrophes, makes that sheet visible and the hyperlink does its thing...<br />
'---<br />
Private Sub Worksheet_FollowHyperlink(ByVal Target As Hyperlink)<br />

<h3> wwoods  say:</h3>
<h2>            Visio 2010 Format Painter Error&#58; Unexpected End of File</h2>
                    
<p>With a shape selected, whenever I select the format painter and click on another shape, I receive an error that reads:</p>
<p>"An error (1) occurred during the action Format Painter.&nbsp; Unexpected end of File"</p>
<p>This is very frustrating and wastes a lot of time.</p>
<p>I found that if I select some text within a text shape and select Format Painter, it will paint the format on another piece of text within the same text shape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Format Painter is a fundamental Office tool and within my other Office 2010 applications I have no problems.&nbsp; However, within Visio its not working like it should.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My version is MS Visio Professional 2010 Version 14.0.4760.1000 32 bit</p>
<p>Does anyone know how this can be fixed?</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

            <p>I just recently got Visio 2010 after having used Visio 2000 in the past. Very disappointed that I have to go through this to get a basic function to work. Issue was identified in Sept. 2010 and I just bought the program and no patch that fixes this issue??
 Not very good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For all others having this same issue the fix seems to work fine. Thank you nezzle!!!</p>

What's worse is I have this issue in version 2013, but I can't do the workaround because like JDub1971 I don't have an XML/VDX option, just .vsd and .vsdx. I tried even saving it as a stencil .vssx and still have this issue. Can we call it a bug and issue a
 fix for it yet, MS?<br />

<h2>            E72 mysterious firmware update message</h2>
                    
<p><span>When I check Nokia website I get the following message:</span></p>
<p><span><span>Latest available software for&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span><span>Nokia E72</span></span><span>, product code&nbsp;</span><span><span>0589139</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>But I'm already running </span></p>
<p><span>022.007 on my phone, updated through OTA. (This update destroyed the media player's ability to play MPEG-4 audio files, by the way)</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>This makes no sense. Did the Northern European model (Finnish, in fact) somehow get updated with UK software or something?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Can anyone explain this?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Also, Nokia should change the specs for this phone as the web site still claims the media player plays MPEG-4 audio. It does not anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Totally agree - I cannot play any MPEG-4 files. When I view the file information, the MPEG-4's bitrate is completely wrong. This appears to be the problem. At least, that is what I have deduced so far. I hard reset, and tried to encode the file at a lower
 bitrate - the problem continues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone found a way to get around this MPEG problem?</p>

The "can I update" page on the Nokia site only shows what's available for the phone using Nokia Software Updater (NSU). The update to V022.007 was released as an over-the-air patch (FOTA), not via NSU, which is why that page is telling you that only V021.024
 is available. NSU is not aware of what has been released as FOTA updates.

<p>Now, that's really confusing. Nokia should mention this on the "can I update" page.</p>

<p>Actually I updated to 022.007 via OVI Suite and not via FOTA.</p>
<p>The fact is that Nokia seems to have done a step behind after releasing this patch: in fact,&nbsp; after a while this release&nbsp; has been no more avaliable and those who haven't been fast to upgrade, seem to have "lost the train" so far.</p>
<p>For the MP4 files, I noticed the following : if you record in high quality with the embedded recorder, it saves the files with the&nbsp;MP4 extension, but...as you go to&nbsp;play them (after shutting tha player down and on again)&nbsp; the audio player-recorder can't
 view them&nbsp;in it's gallery of playable files&nbsp;. You have to search them via file explorerr, and clicking on them, instead of the audio player starts the real player and plays them ok.</p>
<p>If you rename them with mp3 extension, you find them in the&nbsp;audio player/recorder gallery, and it can play them as welll.</p>
<p>In windows, WMP can't play them if still with MP3 extension (unknown format...), so you have to rename back with the originalò&nbsp;MP4 extension to get WMP recognize and play tham all&nbsp;correctly&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Excel 2016 for Mac hang when performing advanced filtering - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel 2016 for Mac hang when performing advanced filtering</h2>
                    <p>Hello - I am getting nowhere with Tech Support so I am hoping that someone here can help me. &nbsp;I have a workbook in Excel 2016 for Mac with ~126000 rows and when I do Advanced Filter - unique values only, it hangs every time. &nbsp;Activity monitor says that Excel
 is not hung but rather working, but it just sits there. &nbsp;It's also only using 1 core of my CPU (I am using a Mac Pro 6-core) which is odd. &nbsp;Can anyone tell me if this is something I can fix, or is it just a bug in Excel?</p>
<p>

            I don't know if it is a bug or not. Excel 2016 will only use one processor core. That's a good bit of data. How long are you waiting for the filter to happen?<br />

            <p>huh. &nbsp;Thanks Bob. &nbsp;It was taking 10+ minutes to filter 126,000 rows. &nbsp;It's really not that big a file (2MB). &nbsp;Why is Excel only using one core? &nbsp;That seems bizarre to me.</p>

            <p>wow that's unbelievable that software that has 2016 on it would only use one core. &nbsp;I have a pretty loaded machine: Mac Pro (late 2013) 3.5GHz 6-core Intel Xeon E5 with 16GB of RAM and 250GB flash internal drive. &nbsp;That drive is only for the OS and applications;
 &nbsp;I have 5TB of external local storage plus probably the same in cloud storage. &nbsp;In short, I am certain that it is not my computer running out of resources. &nbsp;When it doing it filtering, Excel is using a paltry 226MB of RAM and is maxxing out 1 core (100% on
 the activity monitor) with 33-34 threads. &nbsp;In contrast, I have data mining software that routinely uses 400+% of my processing power and 7+ GB of ram when analyzing files in excess of 1GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the link. &nbsp;Pretty unbelievable for software in the age of big data.</p>

<h2>            Sorting an unknown Range</h2>
                    <div>I have a situation where I will be importing multiple worksheets from a mainframe computer where the mainframe programmer spaced out the data into every other row for readability online. However, in Excel it would be best to eliminate the blank rows.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>From what I can see, the best method is to select the range and sort it after defining my header rows.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>That works great until I want to automate via VBA.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is what I attempted which does not work :(</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set r = Range("a1")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LastRow = Cells(Rows.count, "a").End(xlUp).row</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Maybe a slightly simpler sort routine. This assumes the sheet to sort is the active one. I've used resize(,4) like your code because I assume it's the rows that are unknown and not the columns. If you don't know the columns we can fix that.</p>

<h2>            WORD&#58; can a drop down list is a form be colors&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an old form that I am upgrading in WORD&nbsp; Office 365 Home on my laptop.</p>
<p>I have a section that is a red box for not ready, yellow for almost ready and green for ready.&nbsp; it is a great visual to have the block of color.&nbsp; I would like to have this as a drop down choice in the form instead of someone having to copy and past or format
 the cell to a color.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can a drop down be a choice of colors?</p>
<p>

            <p>hello---sorry for the lateness of reply.&nbsp; I was on PTO last week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using the legacy Active X I think. I ended up setting the colors as check boxes and each box was a different color.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My initial intent was to have one drop down list and the answers in the list&nbsp; (not the cell, but each answer choice in the dropdown) I wanted to make a different color.&nbsp; for example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>if the question cell&nbsp;was "Overall--what is the current risk of the project?", in the answer cell I wanted to have three dropdown choices--red, yellow, and green.&nbsp; So I wanted to change the cell color depending on the answer, not make the cell one permanent
 color.</p>

            <p>I would suggest content controls rather than activeX controls, and use an onexit macro stored in the ThisDocument module of the document, to process the answer cell based on the selection. Save the document as macro enabled e.g.</p>

    <title>A terrible experience with customer service for Microsoft Office - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denised_1984  say:</h3>
<h2>            A terrible experience with customer service for Microsoft Office</h2>
                    <p>Its hard to even know where to begin with this entire debauchery.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I previous purchased Microsoft Office University (good for 2 PC's), and had it installed and activated on 2 computers.&nbsp; We purchased another computer, and I needed to install Office on it.&nbsp; So I purchased Microsoft Office 365 Personal (good for 1 PC)&nbsp;on
 the same Microsoft account, assuming that this would an additional subscription for my 3rd computer.&nbsp; However, this resulted in my University Account being converted into a 365 Personal account,&nbsp; and I was unable to download it on my new computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this is where it begins (June 18, 2014)......</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I called tech support and explained the situation, tech support and accounts and billing transferred me back and forth several times, each saying it was the other departments issue.&nbsp; Tech support ended up assisting me (finally), but either didn't understand,
 or didn't listen to what my problem was because they deactivated the existing subscriptions on my 2 computers to download it onto the newly purchased computer via "LogmeIN"&nbsp; This wouldn't have been a problem if this is what I was asking for, however, I specifically
 requested to maintain my subscriptions with the previous 2 computers (case # 1251063513).&nbsp; When he reassured me it would not create an issue and my subscriptions had not been deactivated, I decided to trust his judgement and move on, as I had already spent
 around 2 hours dealing with this issue.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>A few hours later, I logged onto my computer, and my office subscription had been canceled on the 2 computers.&nbsp; I called customer service back again, for support.&nbsp; And these were (the highlight of) my experiences:</p>
<p>1. I was once again transferred back and forth between accounts and billing and tech support, each saying it was the others issue.&nbsp; I was disconnected, and when I called back, I had to wait 1.5 hours for a call back to speak with a customer service rep.</p>
<p>2. A man who was assisting me with trying to separate out the accounts was asking very intrusive questions about my personal life, and made me feel like the focus of the conversation was hitting on me vs fixing my problem.&nbsp; This man also was attempting to
 charge me for Office University again (that I purchased 9 months ago), explaining to me that I had a 4 year subscription for Office 365 Personal that I needed to pay for.&nbsp; After attempting to explain SEVERAL times what the actual issue was, I requested to
 speak to a manager.&nbsp; I was put in touch with an individual named Mike C. who was NOT a manager.&nbsp; He was in the process of trying to sort out what the actual problem was (He was informed that I needed a refund??) when we got disconnected.&nbsp; I did not get a call
 back after being disconnected (even tho they took my phone number to do so) and received an email basically stating if my problem was not addressed, I would have to call customer service back again, and start all over, AGAIN.&nbsp; (The email I received had this
 in the subject line: <span>SRX1251135080ID - Sales &amp; Billing and case #1251135080 maybe?)</span></p>
<p><span>3. After that conversation I called customer service back, and immediately requested either to speak to Mike C or a manager.&nbsp; I was transferred to X-Box customer service, who stated there was no possible way I could have been transferred to them, and
 they had no way to transfer me back to Microsoft Office customer service.&nbsp; I therefore had to hang up and start over, again.</span></p>
<p><span>4. </span>I was disconnected several time without any calls back, no case numbers were ever recorded.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>5. The last individual I spoke with sent my issue to the escalation team (Case # 1251139857) and assured me I would either received contact from them within 2-3 days, or she would personally follow up.&nbsp; She also listened to my complaint regarding the treatment
 I had received and stated she would document it so it could be addressed.&nbsp; 6 days later (June 24, 2014), I heard nothing</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first telephone call on June 18, 2014 to tech support was at 1130.&nbsp; I hung up with the last individual at about 2100.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today (June 24, 2014)&nbsp;I spoke with Margaret, who was extremely helpful, friendly, and&nbsp;attentive to&nbsp;my issue.&nbsp; She listened to my complaints,&nbsp;and did what she could to addressed my issue, but&nbsp;because it has been directed to the escalation team, she was unable
 to resolve my issue at this time.&nbsp; She&nbsp;reflagged the case,&nbsp;and spoke to her manager to attempt to get what she could resolved.&nbsp; She also said that a lot of the people I spoke with did not document our interaction, and there were no case numbers to reference
 for the issues.&nbsp; I am to wait 24 hours for a return call from the escalation department, and call back if I do not hear anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am extremely frustrated, first with the negative treatment.&nbsp; Secondly, I am appalled there is no formal avenue of complaint to address the issues that I&nbsp;have had.&nbsp;Outside of this forum, how am I supposed to get these customer service complaints addressed?&nbsp;In
 addition to this, how is Microsoft as a company going to improve major issues such as these if there is no review process in place?&nbsp;I strongly feel that a lot of my frustration was related to&nbsp;language barriers, as several of the individuals I spoke with were
 foreign, and I felt they did not take the time to try and understand and communicate effectively.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this post can address some of these issues, as I am sure I am not the only person who has experienced this kind of treatment with Microsoft Office customer service department.&nbsp;

            <p>I HAVE SPENT MORE HOURS ONLINE AND ON THE PHONE WITH MICROSOFT&nbsp;AND BACK AND FORTH ON THE PHONE, ONLINE, AND TO BEST BUY&nbsp;GEEK SQUAD,&nbsp;TRYING TO KEEP THIS RIDICULOUS OFFICE 365 INSTALLED ON MY COMPUTER that I am literally going from a 4.0 to zero's.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine months
 I have been trying to move to my "new" computer from my windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent my summer (along with classes) fixing the piece of sh$%^&amp; and now two weeks into my semester the program just UNINSTALLED ITSELF AGAIN!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;I was so happy that finally I could use
 my computer for my final semester of college but silly me, what was I thinking-Oh it's installed and perfect? Not the case. NOPE!&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't have time to spend 3 hours doing a "logmein" rescue where the tech just says, Oh so sorry, sorry, here is your support
 ID.&nbsp; WHY give me a support ID when I have yet (since Christmas) been able to go longer than one week without dealing with this uninstalling issue.&nbsp; WTF!!!&nbsp; I just want a refund and I will stick with my ten year old computer and office 2010 and be done with
 it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for nothing but headache, after headache.&nbsp; Now a project (A VERY IMPORTANT SENIOR YEAR CAPSTONE PROJECT) is basically a blank sheet of paper.&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the problem&gt;Microsoft???&nbsp; ALL I DO IS BASH YOU GUYS most of the time because I am so angry.
 NINE hours again today.&nbsp; A technician called me back after spending several hours on the phone (I had to go to work), and leaves a message, In his Indian accent, "I will be closing the case, I assume that since you did not answer the phone the issue is resolved.
 NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ITS NOT.&nbsp; I have a job, school, and my fulltime unpaid job with Microsoft so I missed the call.&nbsp; The case # is 1261437799.&nbsp;&nbsp; PLEASE JUST GIVE ME A REFUND ON MY FOUR YEAR ADVANCE PAYMENT -and the useless apps I bought)&nbsp;I CANNOT AND WILL NOT
 DEAL WITH YOUR COMPANY ANY LONGER.</p>
<p>Karen Curry</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give up!!! You will never get help. I speak from experience, daily since Christmas.&nbsp; Microsoft is too cheap to pay a living wage so they outsource to&nbsp;India.&nbsp; Its bad enough the issues with the programs and devices, but trying to speak fluent English with
 someone is nearly impossible.&nbsp; So the 3 hour call turns into 6!!!!</p>

            <p>We paid $149 for the Microsoft Assure Tech Support Plan. We didin't need it for six months, but when we finally called for an issue with Outlook Mail Merge, here's what happened:</p>
<p>DAY 1: an agent who clearly didn't know what she was doing fiddled with my computer for a while, then said she had to refer the problem up to their experts for research. I was given an appointment for the specialist to call me between 1 and 3 pm my time
 the following day. I stayed home from work and sat by the phone. At 2:30, a man called and said the specialist was not available "some reason." He promised that I would get a call the following day (a Saturday) again between 1 and 3. Again I waited. No call
 came. At 5 pm I called them and demanded a pro-rata refund on my service because I didn't want to do business wuth them anymore.&nbsp;</p>

 he said :"company policy" did not permit a refund after six months. Would I please accept a call from a service specialist the next day between 1 and 3? I told him no and hung up.</p>

            I don't have to use Microsoft so I am lucky I guess but they have lost me as a customer from now on. I make decisions for our family business, roughly. I was going to use a personal copy of&nbsp;Microsoft on my personal computer at home&nbsp;for one spread sheet
 because I have one&nbsp;client that&nbsp;communicates&nbsp;to us through a excel spreadsheet. I can convert everything from openOffice, but sometimes a few formulas don't export well so I have to go back in and change a few. It's actually very seldom. I decided to give Microsoft
 a chance and purchase the office 365 after my trial cause I did like the product pretty well. After my purchasing experience, I will never by anything again. What company on the Internet needs 4-6 hours to process an order. The poor guy at customer service
 was not at fault really, it was a system by design. I can't even cancel the order and pay with a new card unless I wait the 4-6 hours. REALLY? There is no decline or fraud holds on the card. I verified all the

<p>I had normal experience most of the time with Microsoft products, except when I had time (I thought I did) to finally recover my outlook email. When in 1 hour of forth and back, I finally got to verification and invitation to the link, I got told "session
 expired" in 1-2 seconds of trying to recover (I was hoping to) my email. People plan things for days they can spend their valuable time on technical and other fixes; it is frustrating...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand security reasons are very important and I appreciate all the precautions, and at the same time, when the issue is not resolved, the Team must provide customers with other options and work persistently until the issue is resolved. This would
 be a quality service then. I have had wonderful experience today with McAfee customer and technical support and suggest for other companies to learn how they manage problems solving processes. I also talked to individuals with accent and they were very polite,
 knowledgeable, and most importantly, willing to use different options. Flexibility as much as important as security.

            Your experience reflects mine to the T. Had purchased Office 365 Personal for my new computer. Had Office 365 University installed on two of my other computers. I had only used 2 years of a 4-year subscription. After purchasing Office 365 Personal, I received
 an email informing me that I had converted my Office 365 University subscription to Office 365 Personal. Now I cannot install Office 365 Personal and am getting error messages that I have tried to install too many times. I had no intention of converting a
 subscription with 2 more years remaining to a one-year subscription. After reading your post I know it will take me hours, days, even weeks to resolve this with Microsoft. I wonder if they realize how much pain they cause....

<h2>            Cannot make Skype-to-Skype calls from a Chromebook &#40;but can sent text messages and receive calls&#41;</h2>
                    <p>When I try to initiate a Skype voice or video call from a Samsung Chromebook (Samsung Chromebook 3, 11.6", 4GB RAM, 16GB eMMC, XE500C13), the call drops immediately with the message that the contact is not reachable. The contact immediately receives the
 message that a call was missed (even though the call did not come through). The contact can receive calls from other systems just fine. And text messages from the same Chromebook go through without any problem. And the same contact&nbsp;can initiate a voice or
 video call back to the very Chromebook and it all works fine. Nobody is on anybody's blocked list. Any idea what is going on here? Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. If this helps, when I try calling the Echo / Sound Test Service (from the Chromebook), I get the same message: "Echo / Sound Test Service is not reachable".</p>

            I think I figured it out. I use the Circle Home device for kids, so it looks like it blocks outgoing Skype calls. Once I removed the device from managed devices, it started working. I will follow up with Circle Home to see what's going on.

<h2>            Complex sign in problem, or maybe not so complex, I don&#39;t know&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My Skype account is la************ under the name James ************. I got signed out somehow and when I tried to sign back in my password wouldn't work, so I changed the password. Still can't sign in. I don't know what the problem is.<br />
<br />
I have another account I haven't used in 10+ years on the same email, which seems to work, like Skype is getting confused and not signing into my real account but the old one. I see that some of my contacts from my real account are still there, but on this
 old account I'm missing other contacts..</p>
<p>
</p><p>My old account signs in under ******************. But the account I actually use is signed in under just l***********, but it doesn't work!<br />
<br />
Can somebody help me out here? I have urgent work to do in a few days so if I can't resolve this, I'm going to have a serious problem.</p>

    <title>How to reset Outlook to add meetings to the correct calendar - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to reset Outlook to add meetings to the correct calendar</h2>
                    <p>I recently picked up a client and he wanted me to link to his O365 email. I did so and, brilliantly, MS Office on my desktop decided that should be my primary account. I set my main email to be primary again. I changed my profiles in each calendar/notes/etc
 display to start with my own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem now is that I just accepted a meeting somebody sent me. When I try to add it to my calendar, it's not only defaulting to the wrong calendar. I don't see a way to change the calendar on the appointment pop-up. It seems to be defaulting to the
 client's and not my main calendar, with no ribbon item to switch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get those invites to add to the correct calendar?</p>

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />What you're describing is Outlook saving to the "default" calendar set for the profile which is not governed by the default email account but rather by the "data file" set as the default for the profile done by going to 
<br />
<br />File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab
<br />
<br />The default email account and default data file set for the Outlook profile are mutually exclusive - setting one does not impact the setting of the other.

<h2>            Right click menu disabled for queries and macros</h2>
                    <p>In Access, I have no right click menu for queries or macros. The top left Views button is greyed out. If I view a query, I can then right click on the top bar and get to design view from there. But if I SaveAs a query, it doesn't save.&nbsp; Macros are completely
 inaccessible because I can't even open them (clicking on them makes them run).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tables, forms, reports and modules all work fine, with the right click menu functioning as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens on every database, even a blank one, on all eight machines in the building. We are running Access 2016 (Office Professional Plus) on Windows 7. I have repaired and reinstalled, all updates are installed.</p>

<p>Yes, Access is fully up to date. In fact it updated this morning and I have checked that the issue is still there. It's like the right click menu is simply missing, as I get a blank box displayed instead of the menu. Maybe I'm missing a file? I can't find
 out where the menus are stored.<br />

<p>Thanks Karen_E for your prompt reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype on iOS is version 8.16 which is the latest on the App Store. The device is an iPhone 5s running iOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype on the Mac is version 8.16.0.4 and this is the latest version of Skype. It does not allow a message to be deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The online web version of Skype does not allow a message to be deleted - it does not show any message history (well, I cannot see any history).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, Skype is unusable on my smart phone now, for this contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can help!</p>
<p><br />

<p>Thank you for the response and additional details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting a certain message is only application to the messages you sent. You can delete the message that your friends sent by removing the entire chat conversation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Skype for Mac, right-click the contact who sent you the multiple emoticons then select
<strong>delete conversation.</strong> However, as previously stated, the delete message will only appear on the device where you remove the message, it will not affect the messages on the different device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to isolate the Skype application on your iOS, uninstall Skype then check if there's an available update for your iOS version, once the updates has been installed, restart your iOS phone then reinstall Skype and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know if the issue persists. I'll wait for your update.</p>

<p>Hi Karen_E, thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To summarise this issue so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that it appears Skype does not handle receiving large messages very well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the latest iOS version, receiving a large message of 900+ emojis means that the contact can no longer be communicated with. The "send" button (icon) disappears and the message history is unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting the iOS application and reinstalling from the App store will restore the message history from the cloud, complete with the long messages that cause the issue described above. When Skype is reinstalled on iOS, the message history reappears and the
 contact cannot be communicated with, because the "send" icon disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the latest Mac version, receiving a message of 900+ emojis causes the program to respond slowly when scrolling the message history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have suggested a workaround of deleting the message history. However I cannot do this - the message history needs to be retained. In addition, there is no export feature to allow the message history to be saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I suggest that this needs to be raised as a bug in Skype because, sending a long message of 900+ emojis causes Skype on iOS to no longer allow IM communication with the contact. It appears impossible to be able to communicate with them again because
 the "send" icon no longer appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other options I can try, to get Skype to work again on my iOS phone, for this contact?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for your help with this,</p>
<p>
</p>

<p>
</p><p>There is no other&nbsp; option but to delete the message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was the 900+ emojis sent intentionally to begin with?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried opening your Skype account&nbsp;from a desktop pc to check if you can open it or send a message to the same contact from there?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Mark_N13,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, I appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could I suggest you have a look at the thread above - we seem to be going round and round!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You said:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span>There is no other option but to delete the message.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But we have already established there is no way to delete a message, only the complete conversation. I cannot delete the conversation because I must retain the history with this contact. It must not be deleted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that on iOS, the latest Skype app stops working with a contact who has sent you a message containing 900+ emojis. It is no longer possible to reply or send a message to that contact. This is the problem. Removing and reinstalling the latest
 Skype app on iOS does not fix the problem because the "problem message" comes back from the cloud and the Skype app still prevents you from talking to that contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the problem. It appears to be a bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you mind reading the thread above and then seeing if you can report this as a bug, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks very much,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rty</p>

<p>Hello Sergei_P,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error is that the "send" button (icon) disappears completely in the UI.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On the latest iOS version of&nbsp;Skype (8.16), receiving a large message of 900+ emojis means that the contact can no longer be communicated with. You cannot reply to that contact. The "send" button (icon) disappears and
 the message history with that contact is unresponsive.</span></p>
<p>This was on the iPhone 5s. The details are above in this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>That's the exact error.</span></p>
<p>

<p>Yes I confirm the user did not remove me from their contacts and did not block me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I consider this is a bug because when the user sent me a large message of Emojis (900+), I was not able to reply to the user. The send icon on my Skype app disappeared and my app became unresponsive. I restarted my phone and I reinstalled the latest Skype
 app. The problem persisted. This was on iOS on iPhone 5s.</p>
