<h2>            Windows 10 can&#39;t update system reserved partition&#59; my system reserved partition is empty.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to eliminate the freezing up problem with Windows 10.&nbsp; Recently noticed a key update KB3176938 has not been loaded to my system.&nbsp; In the settings, tried to update but got the message "Can't update the system reserved partition."&nbsp; OK, so poked around
 in Microsoft and found where the system reserved partition was; unfortunately, when I look at properties of this partition (it's an NFTS) it seems the partition is empty.&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; Tried to use the disc error check and the optimize drive tools under properties
 but neither worked.&nbsp; Help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell XPS 8700 with an i7 processor and 24gb of RAM.&nbsp; The C: drive is a solid state Samsung 840 Pro 256gb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you must be tired of this freezing problem, but thanks for you help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BAB</p>

<p>Current version is 1803.&nbsp; Perhaps the "fix the Win 10 freezing" support forum I was reading was, like, outdated.</p>

<p>Thanks very much for your time, Pedro.&nbsp; I used the internal program to check and repair updates and it found and fixed some problems, but this didn't help, the update (which is the 1803 version) still won't load and I'm still getting the same error message
 concerning the system reserved partition.&nbsp; For this reason I'm reluctant to try downloading the update to 1803 and loading through a USB, as I'm suspecting the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should add that I'm apparently still using 1709, and have received updates for that version recently.&nbsp; The last was
</p>
<p>on August 16th.&nbsp; In the image you can see 1803 has failed and is waiting download.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6cf27660-4d1f-4fc0-bf31-f5af0cb8ac61?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6cf27660-4d1f-4fc0-bf31-f5af0cb8ac61?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I suspect there is insufficient space in the system reserved partition......</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ad541b0-f683-4da0-9733-181107674205?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ad541b0-f683-4da0-9733-181107674205?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I right click and view the properties of system reserve it shows zero info in the partition.....</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59e9b892-7298-4d65-b104-fdcb7a5226f7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/59e9b892-7298-4d65-b104-fdcb7a5226f7?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm confused as to how to proceed.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you, and I noticed this advice but couldn't use it.&nbsp; Yes, the 1803 version is not loading, but the update mechanism(s) are still working as I'm still receiving updates for the 1709 version, the latest on August 16 of this year.&nbsp; So I suspect the size
 of the system reserved partition is insufficient to accommodate the 1803 update.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That would seem the case when viewing the system partition in disk management.....</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c8ff87c-e455-49bb-9c94-c3ea2178ab4c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9c8ff87c-e455-49bb-9c94-c3ea2178ab4c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when right clicking of the system reserve and opening properties, there is no "volume" tab and it is stated that the system reserve has nothing in it, which is certainly not correct.&nbsp; Also, the partition is listed as NFTS, not GPT or MBR.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm confused.&nbsp; I know you can't help with that, but maybe you can figure out why I can't increase the size of the system reserve partition :).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks much!</p>

<p>Can I just expand the partition in Disk Management?&nbsp; By the way, the other problem I persistently have is Win 10 freezing.&nbsp; It does this 3 or 4 times a day.&nbsp; While typing this on my desktop it froze, I shut off the computer with a long press on the start
 button, waited until the monitor shut down, then restarted the computer.&nbsp; Ordinarily this reboots the machine and lets me start over again, but this time nothing happened.&nbsp; I unplugged the computer for a minute and retried and the same thing happened.....no
 response.&nbsp; I'm seriously thinking of buying a MAC.</p>

            Ok I understand, that partition you mention is the one reserved for Windows, you should not interfere with the updates, but if you want to free space in the other partitions you can check these links.

Be sure to check with your System Maker's Support, on-line documentation and&nbsp;drivers,
<br />
and ask in their forums&nbsp;(if any) where there would be others with the same model&nbsp;if a built-in
<br />
WebCam&nbsp;or the actual WebCam Maker if a separate device. Links to HP&nbsp;Support below.<br />

<br />
Troubleshooting methods if needed :<br />
<br />
Troubleshoot camera connection problems<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Troubleshoot-camera-connection-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Troubleshoot-camera-connection-problems</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You probably need to reload the camera drivers&nbsp;and any camera control software (usually included<br />
with the drivers and&nbsp;installed at the same time).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Logon as Admin.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Imaging - write down make and model of camera - double click<br />
on it and on driver's tab get version. Now click Update Drivers (which may not do anything as MS<br />
is far behind certifying drivers). The RIGHT CLICK on the camera - UNINSTALL - REBOOT - this<br />
will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and download the latest camera driver and other related camera<br />
software (if no newer get the same ones).<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to them and RIGHT CLICK - RUN AS ADMIN - reboot after each driver.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers.<br />
<span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
<span>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
</span><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
</span><span><br />
Then leave windows updates on however stop it from loading drivers which are often older than the<br />
ones you have installed. If Updates suggests a driver then HIDE it and look manually to see if their<br />
really is a newer one (at both system maker and device maker's sites).<br />

    <title>Windows Update preparing&#47;running during active hours - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ms_allergy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update preparing&#47;running during active hours</h2>
                    <p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is a followup to the original question <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/windows-update-preparingrunning-during-active/aacb0cc2-f9ab-43ef-a698-6500363c17c2">
here</a>, which has since been locked for inactivity. From that thread:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>"1) Background processes related to Windows Update were affecting my computer performance during my active hours."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There was no clear resolution or followup to the original thread, although it appears Windows now schedules restarts outside of active hours.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Unfortunately I still have performance issues, during active hours. Occasionally the entire system freezes - I have turned off the option that makes the screen turn off and can see an incorrect date and time in the bottom right corner. After I perform a
 hard reset Windows starts installing updates. I look at the event logs which always seem to have windows updates in the last entries. Specifically the last event logged is "The start type of the Windows Modules Installer service was changed from demand start
 to auto start", and the preceding dozen entries are the same/reverse message or sourced from WindowsUpdateClient.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I am unlucky the system will start updating while I am using it. I wouldn't care except when performance gets bogged down and gets in the way of my work. I want to say ten or twelve times in the past year I have had very slow system performance where
 I would wait minutes on end to open a folder on the hard drive or to render a web page in Google Chrome. Each time I open the task manager to find 99% disk usage by the Windows Modules Installer Service. I took a screenshot today but unfortunately the task
 manager window is obscured by the active hours window which suddenly popped up after a couple minutes of waiting.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What can I do to prevent this from happening in the future?</p>

<div>Good morning Aditya_Roy,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your response. First I followed steps from the article "Tips to improve PC performance":</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Make sure you have the latest updates for Windows and device drivers</div>
<div>This is not applicable to my situation, as the only time I have performance problems is while Windows downloads updates.</div>
<div>2. Restart your PC and open only the apps you need</div>
<div>I tried this previously and one of two things happens: either the PC restarts and the performance problems continue, or the PC doesn't finish restarting until the update is complete.</div>
<div>3. Check memory and memory usage</div>
<div>I have checked memory usage, which is usually under 60% with other apps running. If I close other apps it goes below 30%. I wasn't able to pull up the task manager on Tuesday since performance was restored by the time the window came up. During previous
 instances memory usage was fine.</div>
<div>4. Check for low disk space and make some room</div>
<div>I have 215 gigabytes of free disk space on my primary drive.</div>
<div>5. Restore your PC from a system restore point</div>
<div>This is not applicable to my situation.</div>
<div>6. Disable unnecessary startup programs</div>
<div>I didn't find any unnecessary startup programs.</div>
<div>7. Check for and remove viruses and malware</div>
<div>I use Windows Security, and a virus &amp; threat protection scan with the most recent definitions returned no threats.</div>
<div>8. Check for corrupted Windows system files</div>
<div>Neither DISM or SFC found any corruption or integrity violations.</div>
<div>9. Adjust the appearance and performance of Windows</div>
<div>I let Windows adjust the visual effects for best performance, but this did not help on Monday and Tuesday so I changed it back to "Let Windows decide" on Wednesday.</div>
<div>10. Pause OneDrive syncing</div>
<div>I had previously uninstalled OneDrive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately on Tuesday system performance dropped as described previously. The computer wasn't continually slow this time, it seemed that performance dropped at random for 3-5 minutes at a time throughout the day. Then, at about 4:55PM a little popup
 appeared at the bottom right saying an update was ready and would be installed around midnight unless I wanted a different time. I was fine with that and logged off the computer well before midnight, leaving it on the lock screen to finish updating overnight.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Wednesday morning I came in to find the system frozen on the lock screen with the clock set just before midnight. I also came in to find that other computers had no internet access - our internet service provider said there was an outage that morning.
 I did a power cycle and Windows spent about an hour installing updates before it would let me log in.</div>

                    <p>So I have figured how to download pics, that works.&nbsp; But in Windows 7 I could physically change the date the photo was taken and I have yet to figure out the pathway to achieve that in Windows 10.&nbsp; Is it possible? Please shed some light on this subject.&nbsp;
 That is how I like my photos categorized and would love it if someone could point me in the right direction.</p>

<br />6. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            Hi  basilorjwan
<br />
<br />Is your camera working and the Camera App is not working?
<br />
<br />If so:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App, go to Apps
<br />
<br />Find the Camera App in the list of App and click that
<br />
<br />Choose 'Advanced Options' - Reset
<br />
<br />
<br />If your Camera itself is not working, what is the Make and Exact Model of your laptop/PC - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing . .

                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated my ASUS T200TA to Windows 10, and after a few minutes I noticed my wifi signal dropped out.&nbsp; I checked my network settings in Device Manager and the Broadcom 802.11 abgn Wireless SDIO adapter had the yellow ! on it, so I checked online for new
 drivers, and there were none.&nbsp; I checked the ASUS support website, and yet again there were no drivers for it.&nbsp; Has anyone else had this issue?&nbsp; Does anyone know where I can get the updated driver to work with the ASUS T200TA.&nbsp; I have already reverted back
 to Windows 8.1, and I can upgrade again, and I would like to, but I want to know that my wifi will work when I do upgrade.&nbsp; Thanks to anyone who can help.</p>

</p><p>Hi Gville,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which security software is installed in the system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might arise due to firewall from the security software blocking the connection, so I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Run the network troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>W</em></strong>” keys from the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” in the search bar and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>c) In the “<strong><em>Troubleshooting</em></strong>” window, click on “<strong><em>View</em></strong>
<strong><em>All</em></strong>” on the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click on “<strong><em>Network adapter</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>e) Click on “<strong><em>Advanced</em></strong>” and then click on “<strong><em>Run</em></strong>
<strong><em>as</em></strong> <strong><em>Administrator</em></strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>f) Click “<strong><em>Next</em></strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></p>
<p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Disable (<strong>preferably uninstall</strong>) the security software (if any) installed in the system and check if the issue is reproduced.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong><em>Disclaimer: </em></strong></span><em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software.

            I am running McAfee Security Suite from AT&amp;T (my internet provider).&nbsp; I have already reverted back to Windows 8.1 because I could not get a signal on WI-FI.&nbsp; It actually would not even register there were any Wi-Fi signals to connect to, even my phone
 as a hot spot.&nbsp; I don't believe the McAfee was the issue, and when I contacted ASUS tech support they said it was a driver issue (not having an updated driver) yet according to running the update driver I had the most current driver (for 8.1).&nbsp; They had me
 check on the ASUS Support website for an update to the driver for Windows 10, and there is no update yet.&nbsp;

            <p>I have the Asus X205, which has the same Wifi adapter. Since upgrading to Windows 10, sometimes, but not every time, when I return from Sleep Mode, the Wifi adapter is not 'started', and doesn't even show in Device Manager. Restarting the X205 resolves this
 problem. If you search the internet, no driver for Windows 10 can be found, and when you remove the current driver (5.93.103.8), Windows Update just installs it again. On some devices, driver version 5.93.103.4 is installed, and in some cases, installing 5.93.103.8
 has resolved the problem. You can find the newer version on several driver-sites, such as this one: http://www.pcpitstop.com/libraries/driver/detail.asp?driver=Broadcom~802.11abgn~Wireless~SDIO~Adapter~</p>
<p>The manufucturer (Broadcom) does not supply (Windows) drivers on it's website (thet do have Linux drivers for download, though), you always have to obtain them from the computer manufacturer. I guess we'll just have to wait until Broadcom releases a Windows
 10 driver, and Asus posts it on it's website. In my larger notebook, I have a Quallcomm Wifi adapter, and that does have a Windows 10 driver. Some manufacturers are quicker than others to release new drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, my brother also has a T200, which he has upgraded to Windows 10, and he doesn't have any problems with the Wifi adapter, so maybe the problem is not the driver, but an installed program or device.</p>

            I have been having a similar problem with my ASUS T100TA.&nbsp; About once per day, the Wireless SDIO adapter fails to start (code 10), usually when waking from sleep.&nbsp; Restarting the computer has solved this all but two times (in these cases, a second restart
 solved the problem).&nbsp; I am looking forward to this being solved, as it is very inconvenient...

    <title>System Image Restore Failed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulkev  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Image Restore Failed</h2>
                    <p>My computer is an Asus Transformer Book TX300CA. It came with Windows 8 64bit. I updated this on the MS Store to Windows 8.1. The OS is installed on a 128GB SSD. I successfully created a System Image (after updating to Windows 8.1) on a 500GB HDD in the
 keyboard dock and also on a portable external 500GB USB3 HDD (WD My Passport Ultra). I wanted to be&nbsp;able to use these images in case of disaster, so I could recover the C drive, without having to reinstall Windows 8.1, which takes 5 hours!&nbsp;I wanted to test
 them out. I followed the standard procedure. Both System Images were seen by the recovery program. The first concern was at the screen with a check box next to the comment "Format and repartition disks. Select this to delete any existing partitions and reformat
 all disks on this computer to match the layout of the system image". The box was greyed out, so it could not be selected. At the bottom of the dialog box it said: "If you're unable to select an option above (which I was), installing the drivers for the disks
 you are restoring to might solve the problem." There were then two boxes that could be selected (they were not greyed out)&nbsp;"Install drivers..." and "Advanced..." I tried ignoring this and clicked on Next and the process seemed to continue fine. But then, at
 the end, after clicking on finish, a box immediately came up saying "The system image restore failed. Error details: The processor architecture or OS version of Windows Recovery Environment is not the same as that of the computer that was backed up. For example,
 a backup of an Vista x64-based computer can be recovered only by using an Vista x64 based version of Windows Recovery". The same thing happened when trying to restore using both System Images. The system images and the attempted restore were both made on the
 Asus TX300 within Windows 8.1. Is the Windows Recovery Environment within Windows 8.1 64 bit not itself a Windows 8.1 64 bit version? Does it need upgrading and if so how? Or is the failure anything to do with a driver needing to be installed at the earlier
 stage with the greyed out option? If so what driver and how should it be done (I know clicking on the "Install drivers..." button leads to the System 32 folder, which has a mass of driver related files in the Driver folder and DriverRepository folder, but
 wouldn't have a&nbsp;clue where to go in it). </p>
<p>I have tried contacting Asus tech support, but they haven't been able to resolve the problem. I have looked through all kinds of things on the internet, but found nothing to match this problem. I hope someone out there can help. Many thanks in anticipation.</p>

            Did you make a Windows 8.1 recovery flash drive?&nbsp; If you did, are you booting it in the UEFI mode and not Legacy?<br />
<br />
The box to which you refer will be greyed out in certain circumstances.&nbsp; You should still be able to select which drives you may want not formatted, such a Flash Drive if you booted using one, and any drives not involved in the re-imaging process.<br />

            <p>Hi Saltgrass,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your very prompt reply and the time and effort you took to make it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have made a Windows 8 recovery flash drive with the preinstalled recovery partition copied to it, so I should be able to recover to the factory preset condition if necessary.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For the system image recovery on Windows 8.1,&nbsp;I have not made a Windows 8.1 recovery flash drive. I have tried the restore by accessing the Recovery Environment by pressing the F9 key at start up. (The computer has the UEFI type of BIOS. I think it would
 need changes to be made to the settings to enable booting form a flash drive - I would need very clear instructions to dare to do this!). In the dialog box with the "Format and repartition disks" box that is greyed out&nbsp;so it&nbsp;cannot be selected, the "Exclude
 disks..." button is also greyed out and so cannot be selected.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can you make any sense of the error details and whether this indicates something that should be done?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope you might have some further ideas and look forward to your reply, if possible, with great interest.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p><br />

In order to restore an image, you will have to boot into the Recovery Environment outside of the install, so you will need an 8.1 Recovery Flash drive, but not necessarily the image from the Recovery Partition copied to it.<br />
<br />
If that drive is present during boot, you can select to boot to it from within Windows 8.1 or the recovery environment if the system will not let you access it otherwise.&nbsp; The<i> Use a Device
</i>option if for this purpose.&nbsp; It will even allow you to boot into the bios.&nbsp; Sometimes it is hard to get into the bios or Boot Device Menu because of a bios setting that handles the fast startup process.<br />
<br />
And again, even if the reformat check box is not accessible, you can still designate which drives you do not want formatted, like the flash drive you boot to.<br />

            <p>Hi Saltgrass,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. I feel it has been very helpful. Sorry I have been a long time getting back to you. I thought I'd accidentally deleted the thread, but Tadasha Mishra kindly directed me back to it.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I created a Recovery flash drive in Windows 8.1 (without copying the Recovery partition) as you suggested. Entering
 the Recovery Environment at startup using the F9 key gave me the option "Use a Device", allowing me to boot from the recovery drive. I selected the Restore System Image option. SUre enough, this time the&nbsp;"Format and repartition disks"&nbsp;&nbsp;box was not greyed out
 (although the "Exclude disks..." button was, but&nbsp;when I ticked the "Format and repartition disks" box, then the "Exclude disks.." button became active). However I left the box unticked as I have read that it does not need to be selected. Things were looking
 good. However, sadly, after clicking on "Finish"&nbsp;then "Yes", the same box came up, saying "The system image restore failed. Error details: The processor architecture or OS version of Windows Recovery Environment is not the same as that of the computer that
 was backed up. For example, a backup of an Vista x64-based computer can be recovered only by using an Vista x64 based version of Windows Recovery". This is even though the system image and recovery USB flash drive were created on Windows 8.1 on the same computer,
 which is the one the recovery is&nbsp; trying to be made to!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I did then go back and repeat the process, but this time I ticked the "Format and repartition disks" box and
 selected to exclude the USB flash drive from the restore process, using the "Exclude disks..." button. The restore process seemed to start for a few seconds, with a box coming up saying that the restore may take hours and&nbsp;a progress bar started to move, but
 then the same error message came up. Sadly it then became clear that the system restore process did start momentarily, as when I tried to restart the computer (without the recovery drive attached), it wouldn't restart. It went straight into the UEFI interface.
 Part of the C drive has obviously been overwritten, making the OS inoperable. Oh dear!. When I tried to restart with the Windows 8.1 recovery drive attached, it did boot from it, so&nbsp;I can still access the system image to try to recover from it. So if only
 I could overcome this error problem I could hopefully restore the C drive.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Then&nbsp;I tried booting with my Windows 8 recovery drive, with the Recovery partition copied, and tried to restore
 the factory default image, but after clicking on Rest Your PC, the message came up "Unable to reset your PC. A required drive partition is missing", suggesting there is a problem with the recovery partition!
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So now it seems that getting rid of this error message "The system image restore failed"&nbsp;so I can restore from
 the system image is my only hope!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Any ideas for how I can do this or anything else appropriate would be very much appreciated. I did
 find this&nbsp;idea from LukeDukewf, which I thought was very interesting, but I can't see that there's&nbsp;anything I could do now to apply it.</span></p>

            You are in an area where I have a problem suggestion options because I do not want you to loose your install.&nbsp; Since you have a recovery drive from Windows 8 with the recovery partition copied to it, you should be able to use reset the drive.<br />
<br />
I have seen image recoveries with the number error and I ended up cleaning the drive with Diskpart and it worked.&nbsp; But this would remove your large recovery partition with the recovery image.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have seen the version error when trying to recover an 8.0 image with an 8.1 recovery drive.&nbsp; But the bottom line should be, if you are recovering an 8.1 image, you would need to boot to the 8.1 recovery drive.&nbsp; If you only have the OS drive, the flash drive,
 and the external drive with the image, the recovery should give you the option of not formatting the flash and OS drives.&nbsp; You of course, would not check the OS drive since you need it redone.&nbsp; I do check the flash drive so it does not get overwritten.&nbsp; The
 external drive with the Backup Image is automatically excluded from the formatting.<br />
<br />
Another poster seemed to have the same situation you do.&nbsp; No matter what they tried, there were greeted by some type of error message.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have done many image restores and can usually get around those by changing the Recovery Media, or using the original install
 media, or cleaning the OS drive with diskpart prior to starting the re-imaging.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I would even get a new hard drive and try using it for testing.&nbsp; Make sure and get one at least as large as the old one.&nbsp; But otherwise, all I can say is an 8.1 image should be recoverable to the OS drive using an 8.1 recovery media you made.&nbsp; If it is showing
 the version error, you are either mixing 8 and 8.1 or possibly trying to use the Legacy boot version of the recovery flash drive to recover a UEFI install.....<br />

<p>Sorry I did not see your response until now.&nbsp; The image in the Recovery partition is a Windows 8 image, and whether you system will recover that image I can not tell.&nbsp; The OEM systems are set up in so many different configurations, there is no way to keep
 track of each one.&nbsp; And the Windows 8.1 update made that process even more complicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To tell whether you are using an 8 or 8.1 recovery flash drive, I would suggest labeling them.&nbsp; If you did not do that, then check the dates on some files to see which ones are the latest.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the dock is concerned, I would have to think ASUS set up the system to
<em>Reset</em> in a configuration with the dock connected, since the Recovery image in located there.&nbsp; If you created a System Image Backup, it does not usually include the large Recovery partition, so it would not be recreated anyway.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Resetting your system is not the same as re-imaging.&nbsp; But the message about a partition missing, to me, seems to be related to the recovery media looking for a specific configuration.&nbsp; I have not been able to pin down what exactly is being checked, but it
 might be a reference to some specific setting on the current install being referenced from the recovery drive.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the KB number or the details of the update in question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have installed Windows Updates prior to this issue, you can revert your PC before the update installed. To do so, you can refer to the section Restore from System Restore point provided in the link below</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you have installed Windows 10 Anniversary Update you cannot perform the above. You will have re-configure and re-sync the account with your mail app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information helps</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            The info you privided does not tell me how to go back before the Anniversary update. &nbsp; Sooo, I will format my hard drive and reinstall Win 10. &nbsp;That will fix this poor excuse for an OS update.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
Thanks for posting. I understand that you want to delete duplicate photos in Photo Gallery. To further isolate the issue, I would like to ask some questions first:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you remember any changes made on your computer/Photo Gallery prior to the issue?</li><li>Are the photos imported from an external device? If so, does the issue happened after importing?</li><li>Can you see the duplicates through Windows Explorer?</li><li>Does it happen to all of the photos? If not, is it specific to a file type or photos on a specific folder?</li><li>What is the version of your Photo Gallery? To check, press ALT + F in Photo Gallery then click About Photo Gallery.</li></ul>
<p>We'll wait for your response.</p>
<p><br />
Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

            <p>I'm also interested in your response to this question. </p>
<p>I have made a terrible mess of my photos because I have made copies into different subfolders and then have made changes and/or used some photos to make slideshows in moviemaker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have imported old photos scanned with current dates although they were taken in pre-digital times.</p>
<p>I have added people tags and subject tags but not in a very organized way, and&nbsp;have also made copies that were then edited for use in collages and slideshows.</p>
<p>Now that I have a better idea of the way tagging and movie maker works I want to go back and organize the original database of photos better.</p>
<p>But my problem is that I have several copies of&nbsp;many photos and there is no easy way to view them side by side but also see what tags they have and also what folder they are each in so as to delete superfluous duplicates.
</p>
<p>Isn't there a way you can view by filename but at the same time see the folder location on the right hand side in the tag and caption pane?</p>
<p>are there any photo management programs that can help locate and organize duplicates?</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hi Sardelitsa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for participating here. I understand that you are having issues with your duplicated photos. I understand that you are finding an easy way on how to organize your photos and one of the ways you thought was to view by filename and see the location
 on the <em>Tag and caption pane</em>. However, there is no location information written on the tag and caption pane. There are two possible ways that I can suggest for you to somehow get a similar presentation of your photos:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Grouping by folder</u>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>View</strong> tab.</li><li>Under<strong> Arrange list</strong> select <strong>Folder</strong></li></ol>
<p>Now that it was arranged by folder, you can now easily see duplicated photos and on what folder it does belong. You can directly delete the photo to organize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Grouping by none</u>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>All photos and videos</strong> on the navigation pane on the left.</li><li>Right-click on the interface where the photos are shown then select <strong>Sort by</strong>. Choose
<strong>File name</strong> afterwards.</li><li>Now you will see all the photos and the duplicated ones are shown side-by-side. To get the location of the photo, you have to right-click then select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Should you have other questions, feel free to reply back.</p>
<p><br />
Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

==================================<br />
Yes it is possible, you could copy the photos to <br />
CD / DVD / Memory Card / Flash Drive, etc. <br />
<br />
(It is important to have a backup anyway just in <br />
case your hard drive fails.)<br />
<br />
Caution...be absolutely 100% positive that your<br />
photos are transferred and safe on the external <br />
media before deleting anything. <br />
<br />
FWIW...external USB hard drives are an excellent <br />
way to archive important personal files. You can<br />
simply drag/drop files from one drive to the other.<br />
<br />
Personally, I back up my personal files on two <br />
separate external hard drives and on DVDs. It <br />
is good insurance. <br />
<br />
If you need additional info...please post your <br />
version of Windows .<br />

            <p>I have just imported pictures from my Samsung III to one drive windows picture gallery. I want to leave "some" pictures on my phone for viewing. But I am only given 2 options: delete from phone after transferring or leave them all there. I want to be able
 to use the ones imported but I DON'T want to erase ALL of them from my phone. Is there a way to save some and permanently remove the rest to the gallery. ALso, how do I delete unwanted photos from the gallery. There seems to be no delete option.</p>

<h2>            CBS &#47; CSI errors resulting in Windows Update failure 80070490</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Using Vista 32bit : I've encountered error 80070490 when trying to run Windows Update.</p>
<p>I've tried a few basic things first : restart, system restore etc, but no joy.</p>
<p>I tried to run the MS Fix It tool, but I cannot get this to work, because it won't install Powershell..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MS article for this error&nbsp; <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-vista/Windows-Update-error-80070490" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-vista/Windows-Update-error-80070490</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;suggested &nbsp;I run the System Update Readiness Tool, which I have done. Whilst this hasn't solved the problem, the log file does contain information on CSI and CBS errors.</p>
<p>The contents of the CheckSUR.log are below. </p>

<p>---------</p>
<p>The same article also suggested a Windows repair, but when I try to follow the advice in the article, I cannot perform an 'Upgrade', so that was a dead end.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found another article,&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2509997" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2509997</a> and I've&nbsp;tried SFC.exe (Method 3) but this reported no issues.
</p>
<p>I'm only slightly technical, and the rest of the article looks a bit daunting, so I thought I'd post the log files and see if anybody has some advice, as I couldn't find another question in the forums that was the same issue as mine (and on Vista)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help..</p>

<p>Here is MS information about uninstalling Service Packs.</p>
<p>Method 1 or 3&nbsp;are the methods to use, Method 2 would not be possible as System Restore would be too far back for Restore Points for SP2 installation to reverse it that way.</p>
<p>And I&nbsp;have never had to use Method 3.</p>

<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration-line: underline">The windows XP SP3</span>&nbsp;
<span style="font-weight: bold">boots up fine every time</span>. <span style="font-weight: bold">
Works fine, once booted</span>. <span style="font-weight: bold">I can connect to the internet, play games, watch movies, run development software and nothing wrong happens</span>. But upon shutdown, sometimes (actually, often) this
<span style="font-weight: bold">BAD_POOL_CALLER</span> error pops up.<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>I tried windows xp updates. The windows is absolutely up-to-date now. </li><li>I tried updating the hardware drivers. All drivers are now up-to-date.</li></ol>
<br />
But still upon shut down I can get the BSOD with the bad pool caller.<br />
<br />
By the way, earlier no error like this used to pop up. So, I doubt it, if it's a hardware problem. But still welcome any of your suggestions. (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Also, I have another OS installed and no errors like this pop up on that side
 ! )</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration-line: underline">I tried looking up on the internet</span>, even asked people on IRC, etc but most people encountered errors like this upon windows installation or during the start up.
<span style="font-weight: bold">Unlike me</span>, where <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
I only get this error upon SHUT DOWN.</span><br />
<br />
Thank you very much,<br />

<p>Hello Allen,<br />
<br />
There may be several reasons why this error may appear. One of which may be due to a system file corruption. Before we try to download and install the missing file, we suggest that you run the
<strong>Windows Update troubleshooter</strong> to scan for any file corruptions. Kindly click on this

<h3> galileo06  say:</h3>
<h2>            Desktop doesn&#39;t want to work. Can&#39;t click anything yet everything there.</h2>
                    Can't Click on anything that is on the Desktop, yet all icons and background images are there and run through their desktop image slideshow program (windows 7 appearance settings). I just can click on anything that is on the desktop along with the "stop
 doing what your doing" sound microsoft has created.<br />
<br />
I turned my computer on today and everything seemed to be working fine. Some 20 minutes in, all of a sudden all my open programs minimize and I figure i must have menu+d'd it and had myself go to the desktop. The background image and the icons are all there,
 I just can't click anything. Neither left nor right click buttons work, when I physically click the mouse button nothing happens other than the critical stop sound plays out. The taskbar works well and i can go through the start menu and all work, just the
 desktop. It not only one of the most agravating things in the world to not know what is wrong, but also time consuming. Hopefully there is nothing wrong with the hardware nor software, just some small glich.<br />
I have tried ctrl+alt+deleting and opened task manager yet none of those steps worked, logging of doesnt work either...

<p>Hi HDKDK,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May I know <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3195481/how-to-check-the-version-of-skype-for-business-2016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Yes, but we had to figure it out ourselves.</p>
<p>It is the Office .1710 that was the problem.</p>
<p>So we had to go back to a former Office version and have set it to update on a 6 months basis, in order not to get the new version pushed.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to install the game in windows compatibility mode and check if it works:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Make older programs run in this version of Windows</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to try installing the latest patch for Diablo 2. For more information contact Blizzard support site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a href="http://us.blizzard.com/support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://us.blizzard.com/support/</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue persists I would also suggest you to download the latest graphic card drivers from the manufacturer’s website and install it on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Java based application not scaling properly</h2>
                    <p>I use a java app that is required grading software for my school. It does not scale properly. &nbsp;The program is extremely tiny. It seems that it is not using the system scaling information. The screen shot I have included is quite enlarged from its original
 size on the screen; but you can see how the fonts are quite small compared to the title bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good points, Jelu. I did not supply enough information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key difference between then and now is the display--I have used it previously with Win10. I'm using a UHD display now. And in my searches, that seems to be an important factor with Java apps. On my old monitor (and on others, say those at work) it displays
 just fine; but none of those are UHD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actions prior? I installed the applications that I use. such as OneNote, Wunderlist, Opera. I have altered the view settings to scale up 300% on 3840x2160 resolution (native).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win10 info</p>
<p>Current version: 1703</p>
<p>Build: 15063.540</p>

<p>The developers of the software (Powerschool Group LLC) &nbsp;have not allowed for this Windows 10 UI Scaling, you should get the college to contact the developers and get them to provide a patch to fix this issue . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>As can be seen from your screenshot, some of the UI components on the Window are scaling and some are not.

<h2>            Windows BSOD - Inaccessible Boot Device</h2>
                    <p>Ever since December after a windows update, any time I re-boot I get a BSOD&nbsp; - Inaccessible Boot Device, and have to go back to a restore point. Currently my update log shows KB4054517 failed (0x80070643 on 12/12/17, Cum update on 1/5/18 filed then succeeded,
 and all future updates through Cum update KB4056887 on Jan 19th succeeded. Windows runs fine with no errors, but having had to go back to a restore point 6 times in the past 6 weeks, if I reboot I will get the same BSOD and have to restore again. Any suggestions
 on how to fix the inaccessible boot device error I keep getting??</p>

<p>Hi Lewis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Inaccessible Boot Device error that you received may indicate that the system has lost access to the system partition. This can be due to corrupted system files or components. To troubleshoot this error, we suggest that you follow the methods provided

</p><p>Thank you for the reply. I have been falling back to restore points ever since the error occurred. However, I don't know for sure which update caused the problem and I'm not sure what would happen if I just uninstalled all of the updates that I see in the
 log going back to 11/14/2017. I do know that an update on 12/12/2017 says it failed to install, but when I researched this a while ago I found articles that said it probably did install even though it says it failed. All other updates have succeeded.</p>
<p>I don't have restore points that go back to before the 12/12 update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you think it is a good idea to uninstall all of the updates going back to 11/14/2017 and see if the BSOD - inaccessible boot device still occurs. And what would happen when all subsequent updates try and load?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be safe, To be safe, I think I should build a new system with a clean version of Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are your views?</p>

<p>KB4058258 successfully installed on my PC on 2/1/2018. I tried rebooting after. While I didn't get BSOD, the restart took me to my lock screen but couldn't get mouse control or open the box to put in my password. I had to shut down physically. When I powered
 on, I received a Windows did not load properly error, and had to go back to a restore point. After reading your email yesterday, I tried again but the same thing happened.</p>
<p>In reviewing my install history, two updates failed with error 0x80070643 - 12/12/2017 (KB 4054517) and 1/29 (KB4056892(3). NOTE: KB4056892(2) had successfully installed the previous day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the Inaccessible Boot Device seems to be solved, I still have to recover the same way. Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>Greatly appreciate your help.</p>

                    My Windows 10 laptop computer says "Getting Windows Ready. &nbsp;Do not turn your computer off"- it's been doing this for hours. &nbsp;It started doing this when I was getting ready to shut it down and it went to restart instead and has been stuck with this message

            <p>I've been looking around the web and evidently it looks like Microsoft has released a new system update patch.&nbsp; It has no visible features, only under the hood stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too tried to shut down my laptop and got hit with this.&nbsp; It's been a really long time and no progress yet past the "Getting Windows ready" screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just going to wait this out and pray my laptop works again later.&nbsp; I wish Microsoft hadn't done this.&nbsp; I wasn't experiencing any issues at all up till now.&nbsp; Also, they could of had some kind of information screen explaining that the update will take
 XX time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any more information about this issue, please do post to this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** UPDATE ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>After about 45 minutes I now have my laptop back.&nbsp; The update finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My advice to everyone is just wait this one out for as long as your computer needs.&nbsp; Pulling the plug in the middle of an update could really seriously damage something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I think my desktop is going to do the same thing.. darn.</p>

            I believe I have finally resolved this problem. There was a file that accumulated uninstalled updates called CBSpersist.log that grew each time windows install failed.&nbsp; At the end it was over 200 GB and the windows segment of my 500 GB hd was over 200
 GB leaving no room.&nbsp; I installed a second HD and the Tech found the file, removed it, and I am back to a system file less than 1 GB.&nbsp;
