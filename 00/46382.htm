            I too am experiencing the same problem.&nbsp; I had windows 8 and updated to 8.1 and since I did the update the software doesn't work.<br />
I just tried everything that this post said and the issue was not resolved.<br />
I tried running Autodesk Inventor Pro. 2014 with every option possible and the same error code came up.
<br />
Error Code 0xc0000142<br />
I also tried completely removing and reloading Autodesk Inventor Pro. 2014 and it did nothing.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Anniversary Edition update error 0x80070002 - 0x20007 - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thecynicalmonk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Edition update error 0x80070002 - 0x20007 - impossible to update&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've mentioned specific aspects of this issue in a couple of other posts, but I am now so frustrated and thoroughly hacked off with Microsoft's Update service regarding the Anniversary Edition that I thought I'd join all the problems together in one post
 to see whether anyone else is having the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems, in my case at least, that it is IMPOSSIBLE to install the Windows 10 Anniversary Edition update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Asus Transformer Book -&nbsp;https://www.asus.com/2-in-1-PCs/ASUS_Transformer_Book_T100TAF/specifications/ - the system drive contains only 32GB but it also has additional storage of 500GB in a drive located in the keyboard area.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first problem I have encountered is that the "normal" upgrade option for the Anniversary Edition, namely the special update tool from Microsoft, tells me that there is not enough space to carry out the anniversary update (16Gb needed). I have only around
 14 GB free on the C drive even after deleting unnecessary files and programs (which I have spent a whole day doing, so PLEASE don't tell me to free up space on my C drive, I have tried this and the most I can get is 14GB free for the update, which is not enough).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand this. When Microsoft decided to bring out Windows 8, and its successor, Windows 10, it was with the intention of becoming a major player in the touch-screen and tablet market. Now, I think most people know that touchscreen devices often
 tend to have much more limited storage space and other resources, and for this reason the new versions of Windows were made lighter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why do I need 16GB free when in fact a lot of those files end up being overwritten anyway?</p>
<p>
</p><p>But back to the problem. The logical solution is to try and create some sort of external media installation device, either with an ISO or USB flash drive, to do the update. I have tried both, using the media creation tool, and every time the update grinds
 to a halt at 95% and then restores the old version of Windows. After rebooting I get the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>0x80070002 - 0x20007</p>
<p>The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during INSTALL_DRIVERS operation&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/436be7c5-cb25-4b30-9e04-34f4e3c9c8cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/436be7c5-cb25-4b30-9e04-34f4e3c9c8cb" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked this up in the official Microsoft forums, and the "solutions" seem to be 1) Disabling / uninstalling antivirus software (have tried both, makes no difference, 2) Disconnecting all USB drives (impossible in my case as I need the USB device to
 perform the update!), and 3) Perform a clean boot to correct driver issues (again, made no difference whatsoever).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even when I rerun the USB flash device (or ISO, have tried both, as well as the special Microsoft Anniversary Edition Update Tool) and tell the installation to save nothing and overwrite everything, the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now I've noticed that no more updates are being downloaded to my PC via Windows Update. I imagine this is because the current version installed has gone as far as it can, and all future updates will be for the Anniversary Edition, which it seems I cannot
 install. In other words, in terms of updates, my computer has ground to a halt and cannot be updated any further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be other people out there who've had these problems - does anyone know of a solution? I am at my wits' end here!</p>

<p>Thank you Lawrence, I know this already. What surprises me is that I managed to upgrade the same machine from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 using its internal 500GB drive for storage during installation. I don't understand why it isn't possible to do the same
 with the Anniversary Update. What Microsoft are saying to me, in effect, is that a machine that works perfectly with Windows 10 cannot have the update and I must buy another one because of defects in their updating system.</p>

<p>Hi Lawrence, thanks for your replies.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what you're saying in this last reply exactly but I'd like to address what you said in your first reply.</p>
<p>You mentioned (I think) moving free space from my internal D drive into the C partition in order to provide the necessary space in C, then running the updater tool. Am I correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked this up and from what I can tell the only way to create a volume that spans over more than one hard drive is to have both drives completely empty and unformatted. This would be impossible in my case as obviously, the first drive is the system
 drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I on the right track here? And if I have a 500GB internal drive, is there any way to "steal" some of that free space and add it to the C drive without having to first completely erase the C drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, hooray, and I'll give it a try. If not, then I'm back to square one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>as you see the partitions have dark and light blue portions. The dark portions are what is used and the light is free space.&nbsp; Like id can reduce the size of the second larger partition and make unallocated space. then move the partition to the right to put
 the unallocated space in front of the partition.&nbsp; then I can move the little partitions to the right an this moves th unallocated space next to the system partition</p>

<p>Thanks for your help with this Lawrence. I can feel I'm getting closer.</p>
<p>I've installed the software you suggested but I'm not really sure what you mean by "move" partitions and how to get the unallocated space into the correct drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the screenshot below you can see the drives I have in the PC in question. The one marked "D: Data" is the 500GB internal drive. I have split 10GB from this and you can see it in green on the right (when it's totally unallocated the software doesn't give
 me the option to move it).</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2803878c-b3de-4dcc-af8c-4fa4e616c1bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2803878c-b3de-4dcc-af8c-4fa4e616c1bc" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on this new partition of 10GB and select "move / resize" options appear but don't let me choose the C: drive "Chipp" as destination.</p>
<p>What I need to do is fool the computer into thinking that the 10GB partition I have created on the right of "D: Data" is part of the C: drive "Chipp".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do &nbsp;you think this will work? And if so - could you tell me how to do it using this software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>The E; 10GB partition is not on the same disk as the C: partition so you can not move it to be next to the C: partition You need to change the location of the Operating System to disk 2.</p>

<p>Thanks for all your help with this Lawrence but the whole point of this computer is to be able to use it as a tablet as well as a mini laptop. You have the system disk (25GB) in the screen, which can be detached from the keyboard and used as a tablet, and
 the 500GB storage disk in the keyboard is there for files and so on. I know what you mean about using the larger drive as a system disk but that would defeat the object of a tablet-laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, I've been managing fine with the 25GB system disk until now. It's only this damned update that's screwing things up. I don't see why I should have to completely change my setup just because Microsoft can't bring out a proper fully functioning update
 patch. If I wanted to be a slave to the manufacturer of my computer, I'd have bought a Mac instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been talking to others about the whole upgrade problem I'm having and it seems that my computer has other problems (it won't reset for instance). With each day that passes the whole thing becomes more and more complex and mysterious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I would like to offer some hope here.&nbsp;For anyone reading all this, and especially if you have Anniversary Edition update problems caused by lack of storage space, I would like to share this with you, which may be of help:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Make sure all your drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>For storage limit issue, Media Creation Tool does have a feature to use USB Drive for extra storage.&nbsp; Here are the instructions and link to it below.</p>
<p><span><span><strong><span><span>If you have at least 8 GB of free space</span></span></strong><span>, you can run the Media Creation Tool on the Software Download Center to install the Anniversary Update:</span></span></span><br />
</p>

<li><span><span>Go to&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a><span>.</span></li><li><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Download tool now</strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<strong>Run</strong>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(You need to be on an administrator account to run the tool.)</span></li><li><span>When you‚Äôre asked ‚ÄúWhat do you want to do?‚Äù, select&nbsp;<strong>Upgrade this PC now</strong>.</span></li><li><span>The tool will then walk you through the rest of the installation process.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When asked, make sure to select&nbsp;<strong>Keep personal files and apps</strong>&nbsp;to prevent losing any of your data.</span></li><li><span><span><span>Windows Setup will start, and you may get a message that says,&nbsp;<strong>‚ÄúWindows needs more space‚Äù.</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>If so, attach an external drive for additiona

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Bluetooth gets stuck &#34;connecting&#34; every time, for any device. What gives&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I am unable to connect any Bluetooth device to my computer. The strange thing is, however, that Bluetooth is technically working, meaning that my computer searches and finds the devices I would like to connect to and identifies them by name (for
 example, My Headphones and Xbox Wireless Controller). The problem is that once I select an item to connect to - which is indeed in pairing mode - my Windows Bluetooth settings display "Connecting" with the dots that slide across while it is connecting, however
 it never connects. It is important to note that it does NOT "fail" to connect - it simply stays forever on "Connecting" without ever actually connecting or failing to connect. This issue also didn't always happen - it's only been recently, although I can't
 pinpoint a definite time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is not any one specific type of device that causes this: it happens with every single Bluetooth device that I try and connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some troubleshooting I've done:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Power cycled bluetooth</p>
<p>- Ran the Bluetooth troubleshooter, which says 'fixed' a problem but really it just turns Bluetooth on and changes nothing.</p>
<p>- Disabled and re-enabled Bluetooth Radio in Device Manager.</p>
<p>- Uninstalled Bluetooth Radio and re-installed in Device Manager.</p>
<p>- Checked for driver updates.</p>
<p>- Manually re-installed Bluetooth drivers.</p>
<p>- Created a secondary local admin Windows login account (experiences the same problem).</p>
<p>- Tried to connect by sending a Bluetooth file to my Bluetooth device (has worked in the past, but does not connect currently).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, the only thing left that I can think of is to do a clean Windows installation, which is something that I desperately want to avoid at all costs right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has this problem happened before and are there recommended troubleshooting steps that I haven't already listed? The Bluetooth Radio is clearly working because it finds devices in pairing mode, it just gets stuck while connecting to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any assistance or recommendations. I really need to solve this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It did not work. Even a ‚Äúclean‚Äù install fresh start did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I ended up having to do was a full disk erase and start entirely from scratch, running Windows installation on boot from a USB ISO image, and doing a completely clean and fresh Windows installation on a fully wiped disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For whatever the reason, this fixed whatever problem Bluetooth was having and it is now working perfectly on my new Windows installation. I‚Äôm not sure what the difference between the ‚Äúclean‚Äù install option in Windows is versus a complete hard disk wipe and
 install from scratch via an ISO on computer boot, but it solved whatever snag Bluetooth was hitting. This leads me to believe it was some sort of core Windows operating file buried deep in the system that was missing or corrupted in some way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            Headphones won&#39;t work in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original title: audio playback device not working&nbsp; specifically with headphones</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having a weird problem with my audio for weeks now. &nbsp;My laptop is maybe 3 months old and I have had this problem since the beginning. I am running Windows 10 and the audio sporadically works with the headphones. &nbsp;80% of the time I plug in my headphones and
 they do not work, while the speakers do. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have checked the "playback devices" and I can see levels of audio working but can't hear through the headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Yes the headphones work I have tried them on different devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The really weird part is this...... if I go to playback devices and test it, go to "configure" and test that, or test the windows sounds I can hear it through the headphones and then I can click on a video and get it to work. &nbsp;If I pause or the video
 crashes (I am also having a Flash problem) I lose the audio. I then have to go back to clicking "test" in one of these three locations several times before the audio starts working again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. I have tried trouble shooting and using everything that I can find online. &nbsp;This includes choosing "Show disabled devices" (none show up) and disabling and re -enabling the headphones/speakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. I have all the latest drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions that are outside the standard googled solutions that come up would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;What is the make and model of the printer?<br />
2.&nbsp;How long have you been facing this issue?<br />
3.&nbsp;Did you make any recent hardware or software changes on your computer prior to this issue?<br />
4.&nbsp;What exactly happens when you try to print? Do you get any error message?</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs try these:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Try running the printer troubleshooter and check.<br />
Refer: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help/printer-problems-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help/printer-problems-in-windows</a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Uninstall and re-install the printer drivers. Uninstall the printer drivers from Programs and Features and then restart the computer. This should install the proper driver for it or you may also try downloading the drivers from manufacturer‚Äôs
 website and install it.<br />

<h2>            Why would computers be invented in a way that we can&#39;t get &#34;Overwritten&#34; Files back&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Recently back on November 5th (2018), I was exporting a video in "HitFilm Express 2017."
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<p>When I clicked on "Export," I've immediately realized I forgot to watch the video in case if for any mistakes left in the video. So I canceled the export and went back to check my files. I remembered when I was in "<strong>This PC</strong>," it was
<strong>32.4GB</strong>, but after I've canceled the export, this time it went up to
<strong>50.2GB</strong><strong>!</strong> (I knew that wasn't a good sign.)</p>
<p>So I went to the folder I always use for my videos, and almost all my videos &amp; pictures
<strong>disappeared</strong> except the ones that were from the project I saved from when I was editing my video!</p>
<p>A few minutes later, I downloaded "<strong>Recuva</strong>" to try to restore my files, but it didn't work. The next day I tried again and still never worked. But when I saw some other file's name from the folder, it said an error message "This file was
 overwritten."</p>
<p>So that means my files may have accidentally overwritten due to the software. "HitFilm Express 2017" is now old and no longer supported from "HitFilm."</p>
<p><span>Also, I think this same issue <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
happened to me over a year ago (back in July 2017)! I was exporting a picture and canceled the export because I've immediately realized I was accidentally exporting to many "Frames" of the picture to my "Pictures" PC folder, and it's supposed to be one frame.
 When I went back to "Pictures" to delete all the frames, all my pictures are GONE.</span></span></p>
<p>Now I never had "File History" on before my videos &amp; pictures went missing, and I don't know if it will be worth to use a "Forensic Software."</p>
<p>I have just two questions. Is it possible to restore overwritten files on "Hard Disk Drive?" And why are computers are invented like this?</p>
<p>Anyway, if this doesn't make sense or if you have (any) questions, let me know.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            Hi George.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I've never found a way to recover overwritten files.  I understand there are forensics methods but they are extremely expensive because essentially you're renting time in a lab of the quality that works for the FBI or intelligence agencies.  
<br />
<br />The way to avoid this is to have real-time backups like Google Drive Backup which let's you choose your User folders to sync in real time to their cloud @ 15gb free, or OneDrive which is just catching up with allowing folder sync and now allows us to sync in real time Desktop, Documents and Pictures folders @ 5gb Free.  I have personally had all my User folders moved into OneDrive for ten years without problems or ever any file loss.  
<br />
<br />File History, Windows file and Image backup are dysfunctional and can lose files as I have seen repeatedly over 10 years in forums daily. I suggest the safest and most reliable method which is to sort your files into their User Folders (Documents, Desktop, Pictures, Downloads, etc) and periodically copy or drag them to external or another hard drive,  then have one other Cloud backup so your files are safe from fire and theft and easily accessible via the internet just like email.
<br />
<br />Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  In the latest version in OneDrive Settings' AutoSave tab you can sync Desktop, Documents and/or Pictures folders to OneDrive in real time.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br /> Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>.  Some like to move their User folders off of C to another partition to keep the image smaller.  If you image C with the files included then you can also mount the image and extract the files separately, so it serves as both a Windows and a file backup.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thank you for replying! Unfortunately, I never had a USB external drive connected to my computer before my files overwrote. But the thing here is I
<strong>NEVER</strong> knew about "<strong>Overwritten Files.</strong>" No one told me about this.</p>
<p>Now I know what to do for now on to avoid this issue, but my question is, why would they invent hard drives like that?</p>
<p>They need to change hard drives and make them safer for files. So even whether they get deleted, overwritten or corrupted, it will (actually) still be in the "<strong>Hard Drive.</strong>"</p>
<p>For example, like a "USB External Drive." Once you connect it, you can turn on "<strong>File History</strong>" or "<strong>Time Machine.</strong>" So that when files get corrupt, you can go back to previous (like backup) to get back the original files. I
 think they should make "Hard Drives" do the same (again, to restore original deleted or overwritten files, but without having to require using "<strong>USB External Drives.</strong>"</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Anyway, again, if this doesn't make sense or if you have (any) questions, let me know.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Thank you for replying and thanks for the advice!</p>

    <title>Task Manager, Notepad not working since Windows Update 7&#47;14&#47;10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Task Manager, Notepad not working since Windows Update 7&#47;14&#47;10</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My computer has been free of viruses/spyware/problems since I purchased it with Windows 7 pre-loaded. After installing this most recent update and letting the computer reboot, I opened notepad to continue working on a document. Notepad opened fine, however,
 when I clicked Open from the File menu I received an error telling me that there was not enough memory running to complete this operation, and to close other programs first. (I would copy and paste the error here, if I could).</p>
<p>Incredulous, as I run a minimum of background applications (Volume control, a couple Toshiba and NVIDIA driver utilites), I right clicked the Taskbar to open Task Manager, intending to see what was causing the problem. Task Manager never opened. After about
 2-3 minutes, I pressed CTRL-ALT-DEL. The menu showed up, and I clicked Task Manager. The desktop reappeared, but no Task manager.</p>
<p>Today, I tried a system restore to before the update. Notepad, Task Manager, everything worked as it should. I would have waited until the next update and kept my computer like that, but Windows Update kept pestering me, so I made a restore point and installed
 the update. Afterward, I tried everything again. Notepad won't open files. Task Manager won't open at all.</p>
<p>I am certain I do not have malware on this machine. I am certain this is not a case of there being too many programs running - there weren't too many before, and there aren't now. I am pretty sure this started around the exact same time as&nbsp; the most recent
 update. If this is a problem affecting others I want Microsoft to know, if not I would be most appreciative of any help figuring out how the update went wrong.</p>
<p>Thank you. :)</p>

<h2>            Unable to install bulk Windows Updates</h2>
                    <p>After a major refresh (back to the beginning) my computer <strong>will only install 131 MS updates</strong>, and i know there are over 100 more, they evidently downloaded but did NOT install. In view updates they show failed, and in installed updates they
 are nowhere to be found. So does this mean <strong>"they were downloaded, but NOT installed?"</strong> &nbsp;Because I keep checking for updates because I<strong> know they are NOT
</strong>installed, and it keeps saying there are none. To download over 100 updates one by one is ridiculous, if that can even be done. After the refresh it downloaded
<strong>1.5GB of MS updates and half failed</strong>. I did NOT have a choice on my restore date a mouse driver crashed, so the refresh was major. And the next day it downloaded 100 more.
<strong>"Do I have to download these one by one?"if so, I'm switching to Apple.</strong></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen a number of your posts concerning this issue, so I spent the evening reloading a two year old image of a fresh Win 8 installation that had never had Windows Updates run....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mostly just out of curiosity I guess... and the fact you mentioned 200+ updates which seemed WAY too many to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were 109 updates for my machine. After installing them in GROUPS, I again checked for more Windows Updates, and there were 18 more... A couple less than your total actually. And after checking again, there are no more...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your total of 131 is probably correct.... I think the reason you have a discrepensy in your numbers is because a lot of the first ones failed, and redownloaded again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go to my Installed Updates page, it lists 137, even though I only downloaded 127...</p>
<p>This is because some of the updates are "Rollups" that have more than one update in the package.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if I mentioned this to you in another thread or not, but DON'T try to do all of the updates at once... It SHOULD work, but depending on the actual updates, they can actually interfere with each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Especially if .Net Framework updates are included. .Net 3.5 in particular. This issue has been coming up a lot on the forum, and I got kind of tired of repeatedly typing it over, so I wrote down some notes...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is just my opinion, so for what it's worth, here it is.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I just did a test of installing 109 Windows Updates in groups. All&nbsp;Groups continued the installation process even though they were supposedly finished, and the RESTART was showing...
</p>
<p>You need to run Taskmanager to see this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did thirteen .Net Framework 3.5.1 updates that totaled 206mb. For at least 20 minutes after the RESTART appeared several process continued to run.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I have an app that displays any internet activity, I was able to notice that the Windows Installer would repeatedly run, and when it ran, it would trigger a download of some type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two of the other processes that run are Windows Module Installer and Windows Module Installer Worker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Win 7 these are called "mscorsvrs", and after installing a .Net Framework update there are sometimes as many as three that take turns running. The best I can describe their function is that they are some type of Compiler.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though the installation is supposedly complete according to Windows Update, it is not. Not until these processes finish..</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the source of a lot of issues with Windows Updates failing... Over the years I have noticed countless occasions in which a update failed after these process started running... Right in the middle of the rest of the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the sequence I used to install 109 Updates @ 1.22gb on a machine in which Windows Update had never been run...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Group #1... Windows Defender and Malicious Software Removal Tool @ 128 mb... Then Reboot</p>
<p>
</p><p>Group #2... Misc. graphics, internet explorer, ActiveX&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>(The top seven updates in the list before the .Net start)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7 @ 188mb...&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Reboot</p>
<p>
</p><p>Group #3... .Net Framework 3.5.1...&nbsp; 13 @ 105mb...&nbsp; It took nearly 20 minutes for the CPU to go to zero before rebooting, as mentioned previously...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Group #4...&nbsp; .Net Framework 4.5...&nbsp;&nbsp; 11 @ 162mb...&nbsp;&nbsp; It took about 45 seconds for the CPU to zero before reboot, even though rebooting was not required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Group #5...&nbsp; Security Updates...&nbsp;&nbsp; 45 @ 105mb...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, reboot only after CPU zero's</p>
<p>
</p><p>Group #6...&nbsp; Important Updates..&nbsp; 30 @ 419mb...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, reboot only after CPU zero's</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing the first 109, I checked for New Updates and 18 were found @ 579mb. None were .Net Framework.... All were successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually did this process twice to verify it would repeat, and with no failures... It was successful both times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... I have 1.01gb of Windows Updates to be "Cleaned Up"... This doesn't&nbsp;mean they failed. What is being cleaned up is the old files that were replaced, and the left over installer packages that are no longer needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind of like your TEMP folder where a lot of programs store installation files... After they are a week old, Disk Cleanup will allow you to delete them...</p>

<h2>            This app can&#39;t be activated by the Built-in Administrator</h2>
                    <p>After the latest Windows 10 update, things have really been stuffed. Trying to do simple things like open Network Settings and even open a .png or .pdf file and I get this error:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a940dea-7aaa-40f6-adb7-ae2ca006619d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a940dea-7aaa-40f6-adb7-ae2ca006619d" /></a></p>
<p>I'm logged in with a local account (not a Microsoft account) that is an Administrator on this machine so why they **** am I seeing this message? I might role back the most recent update as things have not worked well since.</p>

<div>Microsoft cannot create themes for every single country out there. But, it does allow for custom themes, which can be a lot better than what stock themes Windows 7 comes with. Do a search with Google and find some that meet your needs. I am sure there
 are more than a few for Greece and Turkey.</div>

<p>The charge appears to be for a Skype number. Based off the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. That Skype number is clearly stated in the information you provided. </p>
<p>2. The current purchase/renewal rate for a 50% discounted Skype number is $39 a year. One of the older 50% discounted rates was $29.94 a year. This means this is an ongoing, once a year renewal that you signed up for, in the past.</p>
<p>3. If you check your <a href="https://secure.skype.com/wallet/account/orders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
purchase history</a>&nbsp;in <a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
my account</a>, for the month the purchase took place, it should verify that the renewal is for a Skype number.*<br />
</p>
<p>Check the <a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/main-page?page=onlineNumber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype number</a>&nbsp;settings in <a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
my account</a>. It should be there*. If you no longer want that subscription, you can click on settings, the choose the option to cancel the Skype number.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>*If you see no trace of the Skype number in your account and the related charges, the Skype number is linked to another account. This means one of two things.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>This is usually the case:</em></p>
<p>1. You have multiple accounts, you may or may not be aware of, and are not signed into that proper account when checking
<a href="https://go.skype.com/myaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">my account</a>. Be aware that signing in with your Skype name vs. your email address and vice versa, may bring you to a different account. You can use this
<a href="https://go.skype.com/account.diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
account diagnostic</a>&nbsp;link to see what different accounts you own.</p>
<p><em>This is less likely, yet possible.</em></p>
<p>2. The Skype number is attached to another person's account (friend, family member,etc.) with your credit card details which you might have approved in the past or is fraudulent use of your card.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to my friend on Windows 10 Edition</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying to connect to my friend's world in Minecraft Windows 10 Edition. We've made sure our versions were the same and up to date and&nbsp;we made sure that the world is online, but if either one of us tries to connect to the other it says "Connecting to multiplayer game" but then after like 30 seconds it says "Unable to conect to world". We've tried connecting by joining through the multiplayer tab&nbsp;of the menu that pops up after you press play, and through invites to game. We've looked online to see if anyone has a solution to the problem, but we couldn't find anything. Any solutions?</p>

            <p>Update: I've deduced that I'm the problem. We had one of our friends try to join a world hosted by my friend and one hosted by me. He&nbsp;was able to connect to my friend but not me.&nbsp;Don't know how to fix it still, but at least I know the part of the problem.</p>

            Yes, I can turn on my device, this issue occurred 25th of November around 10:30 am. The screen is just black and white but when I boot up the laptop there is colour right up until I log in, then it just turns that colour.

<h2>            How do I restore lost desktop icons</h2>
                    <p>So, I just booted my computer a few hours ago and pretty much all of my desktop icons are gone. I have tried the explorer.exe fix, the Show hidden files and drives fix and none work. Theres only Recycle Bin, Adobe Reader X, Audacity, Google Chrome, HP Support
 Assistant, McAfee Total Protection, Office, Notepad++, paint.net, Screencast-O-Matic, Skype, Snapfish, Steam, Toontown Rewritten, TP-LINK Wireless Configuration Utility and WinRAR left on my desktop. Any solutions? I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium Service
 Pack 1 64-bit with a AMD A6-6310 APU with AMD Radeon R4 Graphics 1.80 GHz processor. Manufactured by Hewlett Packard. Thanks for reading</p>

            <p>In-Place upgrade through media creation tool would also download an ISO first(hidden) and then upgrade. It should be around 4 GB-the same size as that of an ISO.</p>
<p>Also, updating via windows update would be of less size, around 3.5 GB</p>

<p>Hello there! </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My current operating system on my desktop computer is windows 8.1 pro. That Windowsversion was not pre-intalled on my desktop. The first version of Windows that was preinstalled when i bought my desktop was Windows Vista.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found out that Windows has with the time not&nbsp;being adapted to all kinds of desktop and components&nbsp;trademark. And that's what the tech of Windows have forgotten in their own programs. The companies has created the mainboard and components program them
 with their own particularity. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of the actual mainboard has a function called UEFI others don't. Its has a great influence on how the mainboard and the other components will accept the general programming of Windows at the start witch is creating the appearance of the blue error screen
 when the people boot their desktop. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Some internal pilot of a desktop component won't accept the general programming that come with Windows and will litterally destroy some of the program files of Windows replacing them by their own who are not compatible with the general programming of Windows
 version and that&nbsp;is what's&nbsp;responsable of most of the problem's people encounter with their computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's 3 kind of booting on a desktop computers. Some have a GPT booting, some a Uefi booting and finally some have a&nbsp;MBR booting at the start. It is written in the spec book when you bought a new desktop computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most people do not read these spec when they buy a new desktop computer. And that's what brings&nbsp;most of the problems people have with their own desktop computer&nbsp;with their own components and their version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Windows does not give in is own program the choice by asking questions about the computer booting or other main components inside people computers . And the firm do not always respect the spec of windows programming in the program they build for their
 components witch&nbsp;are&nbsp;creating these problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to answer your your questions i have solved that problem by using two method. I have used media creation tools of Windows to download the general&nbsp;ISO version of Windows 8.1 pro. And another tool to mount the ISO file on a flash drive who gave me the
 opportunity to choose what kind of programming was more suitable to the kind of desktop computer i was having
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This tool is called Rufus. The instructions that i have found on the technet Microsoft librairies help me in the task of avoiding the blue screen and the error 50 for witch i ask for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And finally last night&nbsp;i ran into a programming problem with one of the component who was to old in my desktop computer witch was the graphic card and that result in a blue screen error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The repair function of Windows version help me&nbsp;reset the computer to the basic state when i have programmed it with the version i use actually. And everything came back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this is answering all of your questions about th problem that i have encountered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if i may, i would like to suggest to you and all the people of Microsoft to have a special look to what i have written. I am sure&nbsp;in the futur that&nbsp;it will help you avoids all the claims you are getting about new version of Windows.</p>
<p>

    <title>Xbox One 1708 controller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicoleashley1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One 1708 controller</h2>
                    I have now bought 2 of the 1708 controllers and have been having the same issue. The left analog stick has been double scrolling and it makes it very hard to even do anything on my console. It's incredibly annoying. I have also asked 3 other people if
 they have had the same issues with this generation of the controller and they did too. It is now nearly impossible to find the 1696 version (that I've never had issues with) so now I have to have the 1708. I'm wondering if anyone else has had this issue. I
 have done every trick I know to see if it fixes it and none of them worked. I'm getting to the point where I'm going to a buy a PS4 instead.&nbsp;
