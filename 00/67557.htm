<p>Well you should select "Change Settings for all Users" in photo above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might not run in admin mode, it was only a suggestion. Or if it did in admin mode, you would probably get the pop up security box on start up to select YES to allow it to run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Task Scheduler, There are 5 tabs to set it up. You may&nbsp;need to set them all up. Different apps and services need to be set differently.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have to also take ownership of the file to run and add yourself in the list with full permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are tutorials on web for creating tasks.</p>

    <title>USB Device Priority on Startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ed bowen  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Device Priority on Startup</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, my keyboard seems to be fairly unresponsive on startup for less than a minute or so. The input is really sluggish and any keys I press take about 5-10 seconds to actually do anything. After this point, Windows makes the "USB device connected" sound
 and all is fine after this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the below troubleshooting steps so far:</p>
<p>- Flashed firmware of the keyboard</p>
<p>- Updated drivers</p>
<p>- Updated Windows</p>
<p>- Unplug all other USB devices on startup apart from my mouse and keyboard</p>
<p>- Checked CPU/RAM/Disk usage on startup and these are around 50% or less</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an internal USB header which connects my water cooler and PSU monitoring but the keyboard is plugged into the rear I/O and therefore bypassing the USB headers and going straight to the motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a feeling that it is booting my other USB devices first and I was wondering if there is a way to increase my keyboard's priority on startup or the order in which USB devices are loaded? I couldn't find anything about this on the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 if that makes a difference at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance! Let me know if you need any more info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ed</p>

<p>Hi Johann,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me. I tried verifier and it gave the attached results following a BSOD:</p>
<p>https://1drv.ms/f/s!Arzz3I80-myphiyBKClpm5Zu4dHU</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also uploaded my MEMORY.DMP as my PC has randomly done bugchecks a few times when my PC is idle at the login page and thought that it may be related.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly enough, when I tried verifier and had to put my PC in safe mode to reset the program, the keyboard issue didn't occur... Would it be worth rebuilding my machine to see if it resolves the problem? Obviously I would like to avoid this if possible
 as it is pretty lengthy but I would be happy to try it if needed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help so far!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ed</p>

            Hi wetsidetkd,<br />
<div>
<p>
<span>Click on the "Tools" menu and choose "Effects" form the drop-down menu. You will see a list of possible effects appear in the middle of the screen.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Find the rotate effect that you want, either "Rotate 90," "Rotate 180" or "Rotate 270." The rotate effects will rotate the video file counterclockwise. Click and
 drag the rotate effect over the video file, then drop it.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Click on the "File" menu and choose "Publish Movie" or "Save Movie File" depending on your version of the Movie Maker
<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_7172468_rotate-clip-windows-media-player.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span><span>software</span></span></span></a>. Choose where you want to publish the file, and the quality you want to publish it at. When the progress
 bar finished, the movie is now rotated and you can double-click the file to play it in Windows Media Player.</span></p>
hope this helps<br />

<h2>            Banned from making purchases</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p><p>I've just been given a 'Risk' purchasing ban. Apparently I purchased too much in too short a time span after a long break where I didn't buy much. I've been told by online support there's "no more support they can give me". So apparently I have to just accept that my account I've had for 10+&nbsp;years is now useless and I&nbsp;won't be able to purchase anything for me or my kids anymore? Once my Gold subscription runs out I&nbsp;guess I&nbsp;won't be able to access the hundreds of games I've purchased any more?&nbsp;How is that for treating a loyal customer?!&nbsp;Online support has been useless. Anyone here who can help?</p>

  <p>Thanks, done that already, been told several times nothing more can be done. Seems&nbsp;I'm all out of options. Pretty ridiculous that these decisions happen without discussion, without explanation. Absolutely terrible customer service. Thousands of pounds and multiple consoles later it seems my time as an Xbox/Microsoft customer is coming to a close.</p> 
 </blockquote> <p>My issue is now solved. My advice to anyone who encounters this is not to give up - After working through 6 different support staff/tickets/phone calls I&nbsp;finally found one who seemed to know what to do. Janine R. solved my issue for me. She's awesome.</p>

<p>As I understand the issue, you are keep getting blue screen of death on the computer with error code SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED_M.
Please let me know if this is not correct.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<span>
<div>You've reached the right forum for your question. We are here to help fix your issue and guide you in the right direction.</div>
<div><strong>Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps I may need a few more information to understand the issue better.<br />
</strong>1. When exactly you get blue screen of death?<br />
2. Did you make any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?<br />
3. Are you able to boot to the computer normally?<br />
<div>
<div><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span><span><br />
</span><span><strong>Step 1:
</strong></span><span><br />
I would suggest you to boot the computer into safe mode and try to perform a virus scan. Check if the issue occurs in Safe Mode or not.<br />
<br />
</span><span><strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong></span><span><br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a><span><br />
<br />
</span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong></span><span><strong>
</strong><br />
If the issue is fixed in safe mode, then I would suggest you to perform clean boot and remove the program that is causing the issue.<br />
<br />
</span><span><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong></span><span><br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span><br />
<br />
</span><span><strong>Note:</strong></span><span> Follow
</span><span>step 3
</span><span>from the clean boot article KB929135 to reset the computer to
</span><span>normal mode.<br />
</span></div>
<div><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span><span><strong>
</strong><br />
If the issue persists you may scan the computer for virus using Microsoft Safety Scanner.<br />
<br />
Microsoft Safety Scanner will help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.<br />
<br />
The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove virus, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.<br />
<br />
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a><span><br />
<br />
</span><span><strong>Note:</strong>
</span><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety
 Scanner again.<br />
<br />
</span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></span><span> If you run the virus scan the program
 that is infected with virus will get deleted. So you have to reinstall the program. Also if the files and folders are affected with virus then they might even get deleted.</span></div>
<div><span><strong>Method 3:</strong></span><span><br />
If the issue is not resolved I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link and check.<br />

            <b>&nbsp;These crashes were caused by memory corruption (probably a driver).&nbsp; Please run these two tests to verify your memory and find which driver is causing the problem. &nbsp;</b><br />
<i><br />
*Dont forget to upload any further DMP files (especially those when verifier is running)</i><br />
<u><br />
*If you are overclocking anything reset to default before running these tests.<br />
In other words STOP!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; If you dont know what this means you probably arent<br />
</u><br />
<b><br />
1-Memtest.</b><br />
<br />
*Download a copy of Memtest86 and burn the ISO to a CD using Iso Recorder or another ISO burning program. http://www.memtest.org &nbsp;<br />
<br />
*Boot from the CD, and leave it running for at least 5 or 6 passes.<br />
<br />
*Just remember, any time Memtest reports errors, it can be either bad RAM or a bad motherboard slot.<br />
<br />
*Test the sticks individually, and if you find a good one, test it in all slots.<br />
<br />
Any errors are indicative of a memory problem.<br />
<br />
If a known good stick fails in a motherboard slot it is probably the slot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><br />
2-Driver verifier<br />
</b><br />
Using Driver Verifier is an iffy proposition. Most times it'll crash and it'll tell you what the driver is.<br />
<br />
*But sometimes it'll crash and won't tell you the driver.<br />
<br />
*Other times it'll crash before you can log in to Windows. If you can't get to Safe Mode, then you'll have to resort to offline editing of the registry to disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
*I'd suggest that you first backup your data and then make sure you've got access to another computer so you can contact us if problems arise.<br />
<br />
*Then make a System Restore point (so you can restore the system using the Vista/Win7 Startup Repair feature).<br />
<br />
*In Windows 7 you can make a Startup Repair disk by going to Start....All Programs...Maintenance...Create a System Repair Disc - with Windows Vista you'll have to use your installation disk or the "Repair your computer" option at the top of the Safe Mode menu
 .<br />
<br />
Then, here's the procedure:<br />
- Go to Start and type in "verifier" (without the quotes) and press Enter<br />
- Select "Create custom settings (for code developers)" and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Select individual settings from a full list" and click "Next"<br />
- Select everything EXCEPT FOR "Low Resource Simulation" and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Select driver names from a list" and click "Next"<br />
*Then select all drivers NOT provided by Microsoft and click "Next"<br />
- Select "Finish" on the next page.<br />
<br />
*Reboot the system and wait for it to crash to the Blue Screen.<br />
<br />
*Continue to use your system normally, and if you know what causes the crash, do that repeatedly. The objective here is to get the system to crash because Driver Verifier is stressing the drivers out. If it doesn't crash for you, then let it run for at least
 36 hours of continuous operation.<br />
<br />
*If you can't get into Windows because it crashes too soon, try it in Safe Mode.<br />
*If you can't get into Safe Mode, try using System Restore from your installation DVD to set the system back to the previous restore point that you created.<br />

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the <strong>AutoPlay </strong>feature is what your looking for. You can enable this feature by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On your keyboard, press <strong>Windows + I</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Devices</strong>.</li><li>On the left pane, click <strong>AutoPlay</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>AutoPlay</strong>, toggle On the slider under <strong>Use AutoPlay for all media and devices</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the slider is already toggled on, but the Photo app is still not automatically launched, you need to apply additional settings.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Follow steps 1-4 above.</li><li>Under <strong>Choose AutoPlay defaults</strong>.</li><li>Click the drop-down under <strong>Removable drive</strong>, and choose <strong>
Open folder to view files (File Explorer)</strong>.</li><li>Click the drop-down under <strong>Memory card</strong>, and choose <strong>Import photos and videos (Photos)</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>It should look like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/60f3a9ee-4aee-42ae-b3ae-377f3ada2254?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/60f3a9ee-4aee-42ae-b3ae-377f3ada2254?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: By following the procedure above, every time you're going to plug in an external device to your PC (not just your webcam), Photos app will launch automatically.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have additional questions, or if the issue persists after the troubleshooting steps above, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Cannot Click Any Items Except Desktop.</h2>
                    <p>Hi there. I have a Lenovo Yoga 2 running Windows 10 and for some reason, I cannot click on any of the programs opened, and can only interact with the desktop. This was the same deal with my Dell Inspiron.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have restarted the computer several times, and it seems to not help. It is the current build I am using.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The keyboard shortcuts still work, but when I try to click on them, it just acts like there is nothing there.</p>
<p>I also cannot click the taskbar either, which is a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help me?</p>

            <p>Hi RannyUS,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the model number of the mouse?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Does the issue occur with all applications or any particular application?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>How long have you been facing this issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the methods listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check if the issue still persists.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in
<b>Step 7</b> in the above KB article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>I would also suggest you to update the mouse drivers and check if that fixes the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download and install the latest drivers for Windows 7 and check if that fixes the issue.</p>

    <title>Unauthorised payments - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danielhockley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unauthorised payments</h2>
                    <p>i am beyond desperate, a young child has used my bank card to buy points - 148 purchases in 11 days. Microsoft say i cannot have a refund even though it was unauthorised, they hsve paid back 1 of thr 148 and say i can only claim for a refund once in 365
 days, even though these are all part of the same unauthorised event.</p>
<p>The support staff start by saying they will get it sorted then after 30 mins say they cant help as it is up to the recund team. You cannot speak to the refund team, you have to e mail but they dont answer the question they just give a standard policy answer.
 I have been told i cannot complain about the whole process instead i have to put it on here. My bank have told me microsoft are liable and have told me speak to the complaints dept (there isnt one).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have lost a lot of money and am in a desperate situation, please will somebody help.</p>

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately refund decisions are based on Microsoft's refund policies and a review of the account requesting the refund. Customer support at any level cannot assist you when it comes to refunds as that is handled by a dedicated refund team. Apologies,
 but you will need to go back to your bank and request chargebacks for the other transactions. Your payment method was used without your consent and therefore is essentially fraud, so a fraud claim with your bank is what needs to be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox has parental and security features to prevent&nbsp;situations like this. An adult account can require child accounts to ask the adult account for permission anytime they want to buy something from the Store or there is a 6-digit passkey you can set on the
 account the child uses to prevent the child from making unauthorized purchases. I'll provide support links explaining security for making purchases:</p>

<p>Hello&nbsp; Daniel,</p>

</p><p>We recommend reply to the denial email again let them know that the refund given wasn't for all the charges only one. Keep at the email, due to this is the only way to contact the refund team.</p>

            My bank say they cannot help unless i agree to prosecute my 12 year old son. Obviously as much as i feel like doing it under the circumstances i do not want my child to have a criminal record. The bank therefore say they cannot help.

    <title>Persistent problem to remove recovery partition of windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Persistent problem to remove recovery partition of windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an ASUS X205T Netbook that is running out of space on the C: drive (20.9 GB), &amp; of which cannot be altered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I backed up the original recovery drive to a USB drive so that I could end up deleting the original recovery drive, which happens to sit on a separate partition of the C: drive. This would give me another 8 GB of space on the C: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that upon using the Command Prompt with Admin priv's.; CHKDSK with either one of the "delete partition", or "delete volume" commands is telling me that it is not permitted for anyone to have access/privilege to delete the partition/volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have heard that deleting the recovery partition could possibly feed back upon and corrupt the entire C: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, none of my personal files are on C: They are on a microSD Card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on this pickle would be deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aleks.</p>

            <p>Hello Ashish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was in disk management-as administrator, I right clicked the recovery partition and only had one option: "help". The help opened a browser tab showing the general ways of handling disk management-no help for my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still on the help page, I clicked on "shrink volume", which told me to right click the partition in disk management &amp; click "shrink volume", but when I right clicked the partition, the only option was "help", the same one that I had before-no help there
 for my problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I phoned an ASUS tech support who told me that ASUS does not allow deletion of the recovery partition on my model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, online I heard there was a way to force the deletion, even when it is not allowed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope somebody can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aleks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have been totally unsuccessful while using Google's search engine to look for 3rd party solutions.</p>
<p>

</p><p>It would be nice if someone knows and could share a good keyword that works for me on google, or if someone who knows how to go about the process that is needed here could help me out.</p>

            I found Easeus Partition master free and it does delete the partition but it causes a bluescreen right after and I needed to boot from the recovery USB stick I created with ASUS Backtracker. I've tried it twice so far. &nbsp; I still have not been able to successfully
 remove the recovery partition.&nbsp;&nbsp; What was really interesting is if you search for backtracker it shows an option to remove that partition after copying that partition to a usb stick.&nbsp; But it says its not there for windows 8/8.1... and the explanation doesn't
 make sense.&nbsp; I also tried Diskpart, but it keeps saying the partition is in use and refuses to continue.&nbsp; If anyone figures out how to remove it please let us know.&nbsp; Maybe i will contact the easus folks to find out why it bluescreens after removing the partition.&nbsp;

            <p>I decided to install Win 10 from the app reminder on my pc and the unit froze near the end of the install,only showing the "BIOS" screen. From BIOS nothing worked to get me out of the BIOS screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up sending the unit to ASUS for repair. </p>
<p>Upon return, I took no chances and went to the Microsoft store were I bought the unit to have them install Win 10 for me.
</p>
<p>So far no problems running Win 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But, I still have the problem of the recovery partition taking up space on my limited space on the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C drive. If anyone can help in the future, it will be greatly appreciated.</p>

            I worked with the easus PM folks and they said the install needed that partition.&nbsp; So I bit the bullet this morning, recovered the thing with the usb recovery stick I had created then I ran the windows 10 upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp; To my surprise after the upgrade was
 done I had 15 GB free.&nbsp; Seems it wiped the recovery partition during the upgrade.&nbsp; I did have to put in another usb stick so that the upgrade could work.&nbsp; I haven't looked to see what it moved over there yet.&nbsp; But I am a happy camper.&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure you use that
 Asus Backtracker app to copy your recovery partition to an 8GB stick before you do anything... YaHoo..

<h2>            Unable to accept ToU or change parental account</h2>
                    Ok so up until now I didn't even know that there was a parent account attached to my account I forgot I put it in at the beginning of making my account. It's been a few years and I've never needed the password til now but the problem is I have no clue
 what the password is. I have the email and I no that it's mine but I'm almost 100% sure that the email doesn't even exist anymore because I ha some problems with it and abandoned the email. (Dumb part to do since it was connected to my account as a parent
 I guess) but basically the email is most likely not recoverable as I've filled out the form to recover it and the security question is wrong even though I no I entered the right answer for it. I also can't email it so I'm assuming the email is gone and can't
 be recovered. I've spent about a day now trying to change my account cuz when I signed up wasn't 18 but I'm almost 20 now and thought it automatically changed your account when you turn 18. Now i figured out how to change me over to a

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
You will need to first gain access to the&nbsp;<span>parental</span>&nbsp;account in order for you to be able to successfully agree to the terms and conditions. You won't be able to change the parental e-mail without being able to login to the prior e-mail
 that's listed.<br />
<br />
Since you're 18 now you should be able to promote your account from a child to an adult after you're able to agree to the updated terms on the parental account. You should be able to do so by following the directions&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/online-privacy-and-safety/online-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.
 Please remember that this is not something that is done automatically, you need to initiate this process, and it can only be done after agreeing to the latest terms.<br />
<br />
The&nbsp;<span>parent</span>&nbsp;must agree to the new terms first and then you can login to your own account and accept them. If you don't have access to the&nbsp;<span>parental</span>&nbsp;account you will need to try to reset the password found&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://account.live.com/resetpassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.
 If that doesn't work try to&nbsp;fill out the Microsoft Account Recovery form found&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
If you're unable to either of those things then you may be out of luck. You can try to&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact phone support</a></strong>&nbsp;and see if they are able to assist you in
 some way.<br />
<br />
Further information in regards to the new terms of service agreement update can be found&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-security/terms-of-use-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>So in other words since I don't no the password to the email that doesn't exist I'm basicaly screwed. 6 years of owning this account with Xbox and never had a problem. first time I have a problem and I lose my account and wasted 6 years of my time working
 on it. Woo hoo I dont know I've talked to 13 people now with the exact same problem as me and all were getting for help is you have to no the password. Call support has been no help as they have no clue what there doing I got this answer 6 times on the phone
 even though I told her it can't be done "you'll need the password to the parental account if you want to accept terms of use" but I can't give a password to an email that doesn't exist anymore. The parental account isn't even an account lets just say that.
 It's nothing I'm suppose to be entering a password to an account that doesn't exist? How am I suppose to do that? But from asking around and looking for 2 fricken days I've come to the conclusion either they lift the parental accounts or whoever is having
 a problem is losing there account. Cuz there IS NO WAY AROUND THIS XBOX. YOU JUST KEEP GIVING US THE SAME RESPONSES OVER AND OVER THAT DIDNT FIX THE SITUATION 2 YEARS SO HOW WILL IT FIX IT NOW? WE OBVIOUSLY CANT ACCESS THE PARENTAL ACCOUNT AND CHANGE OURSELVES
 TO ADULTS IF YOU WANT US TO BE ABLE TO ACCEPT TERMS TO DO IT WHICH WE CANT DO BECUASE WERE ADULT CHILDREN. Seriously just lift adult accounts this is pointless you've got thousands of people *** over this yet do nothing for 2 years. So the 5 months I have
 left and 20 bucks in points I have and 10k gamer score is just lose BECUASE of a stupid feature you thought helped.

<p>Yup that's where I'm at I just called again as they told me to call back and they had the same solutions that don't work. They want me to enter a password to an account that doesn't exist. Worst part is the security question I need to answer to get that
 account back for me is an obvious question and I no it's right but it's still wrong. And the password for the email has to be right because I've only used 3 passwords in my life. And although I've tried everything even emailed it to see if messages go threw
 and I get errors bak saying "the email you are trying to message is unavailable" I've had friend try twice to he gets same thing so not only can I not access the email nothing can even other games I've used the email on can't connect to it. So I feel the email
 is definitely locked or disabled. I even ha to change an email logging into one game because it was "un-verified" and "can't gain access to the account". I just don't see why Xbox can't release a patch so once your 18 or an adult in your region just changes
 your account. Cuz if this is the case I've lost about $300 in downloadable games $150 in map packs and DLC 4 months of live and 10k gamer points just gone down the drain. I've had it for 6 years and never had this problem til the recent terms of use came out.
 And what I think the people tryin to help don't understand is we CANT access the parent account. So we CANT change ourselves to adult accounts to accept terms. It's like a never ending circle of crap. Can't access live without accepting terms, can't accept
 terms without parent. Can't access parent account without password. Can't change from child to adult without accepting terms. And here we are back at the beginning of the circle. Just get rid of child accounts and make it changeable in family settings. Cuz
 what Xbox is basicaly saying is if your a child you need a parent and when you grow up if the email you use to sign up ever got hacked taken down or simply forgot the info to( let's be honest guys everyone forgot there info at least once) is basically lost
 or gone forever. I understand "I should have enabled adult before this problem accoured" but I don't even know I was a child account. I didn't no there was such a thing to be honest. I thought that was for family settings and you could just disable and enable
 whenever you wanted. And I thought I'd never need to use family settings and now I'm stuck as an adult child with a large amount of money sitting in the account in games and dlc and even some movies and music that I can't access because of an email that doesn't
 exist -_- I dont know I feel they should just remove the parent account from Xbox and stay with the family settings I mean that was the point of the settings was it not? And icant even turn them off even tho they are off without access to live which I can't
 do without the password to my non existent account lol. But yea if anyone at all comes up with a solution cuz again tried webite and account management just errors out on it and anything else requires terms acceptance and then I'm back in the crap circle of
 fail again.</p>

<p>Yea I called again an best help I've had so far waiting in an email right now to fill out a form or something to see if I can get the account back. The girl I talked to was very friendly helped a lot and actually understood my problem lol. But there's still

<p>So, i'm having a similar problem to this. However the parent e-mail and everything belongs to an ex-boyfriend. Who legally can have no contact with me. SO not only can I not message him and ask him to help me reset the password and everything, this also
 means unless I somehow figure out a way to fix this, the year of gold I got for christmas is down the drain, as are the DLC's i've bought on xbox. Any ideas anyone?</p>

<p>soo ive had multiple problems and the main thing that ticks me off is how when im creating the adult account to finally set everything up to fix my account it lets me go through all the sign up forum then says right after registration even after microsoft
 sends me a email i still can not access the account or create it and if so created why is it not letting me open it up ? and also im on the webpage trying to fix the account problem and i get a error everytime i hit my account to go and fix the settings there
 because i know to go from child to promote to adult its in my account under settings and i have yet to see to any good conclusion other then loosing my gold account and the DLCs i bought .
</p>
<p>P.S. I HIGHLY THINK YOU MICROSOFT CREATURES NEED TO ADD INTO THE PARENTAL CONTROL ACCOUNTS OR SIMPLY DELETE THEM AFTER A UPDATE ON XBOX LIVE WITCH SHOULD PROMOTE ANY CHILD ACCOUNTS TO ADULT BUT NEEDING A PASSWORD AT MINIMUM.
