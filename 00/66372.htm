            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you having issues with all attachments or a select few such as Word documents, etc..?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word go to File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View, and then uncheck Enable Protected View for files originating from Outlook.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Excel go to File &gt; Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings &gt; Protected View, and then uncheck Enabled Protected View for files originating from the Internet.

<p>A paperclip icon rests next to the email’s subject. And when you open the email, you see a generic photo thumbnail or a message saying, “Download Message and Pictures.”</p>
<p>The Mail app doesn’t download the files until you specifically give it the command. Instead, the Mail app places shows generic thumbnails — placeholders for attached folders — along the email’s top edge.</p>
<p>You can save the file either of two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click the attached file’s generic thumbnail icon. When the thumbnail shows a miniature of the attached file, right-click it and choose Save.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Right-click the attached file and choose Download from the pop-up menu. When the download completes, the generic thumbnails fill in with photos representing the newly downloaded files.</p>
</li><li>
<p>File Explorer’s Save As window appears, shown here, ready for you to save the file in your Documents folder. To save it someplace else, choose any folder listed along the Save As window’s left edge. Or, click the words This PC, also
 on the window’s left edge, and begin browsing to the folder that should receive the file.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Saving the file inside one of your four main folders — Documents, Pictures, Videos, or Music — is the easiest way to ensure you’ll be able to find it later. When you choose a folder, you see a list of existing folders where you can stash
 your new file.</p>
<p>To create a new folder inside your currently viewed folder, click the New Folder button from the menu along the folder’s top and, when the new folder appears, type in a name for the folder.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the Save button in the Save As window’s bottom-right corner.</p>
<p>The Mail app saves the file in the folder of your choosing.</p>

<h2>            Project CARS 2 vehicle unstable in a straight line in wet weather</h2>
                    <p>I am having a problem with Project CARS 2 in the Porsche manufacturer drives Porsche 935 77. After a lap on the Hockenheim Historic track during the race in wet weather, the car tends try and spin out all of a sudden and lose control. I do not know whether
 it's the setup but I think there's another bug in Project CARS 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my setup, I have all tyre compounds on wet. I have the front tyre pressures on 1.41 bar and rear tyre pressures on 1.30 bar.</p>
<p>I have the brake pressure on 80%, brake bias on 57.0/43.0 and the front duct opening on 55% and the rear duct opening on 40%. I have the downforce on 5.00 and the longitudinal weight bias on 34.0/66.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the caster angle, I have it on 6.7 deg (Both left and right), front camber angle on -0.7 deg (both left and right) and 0.0 deg on the rear (Both front and right).&nbsp; For the ride height, I have it on 75mm (for the Front left and right) and 80mm (For the
 rear left and right). I have the spring rate on 110 N/mm for both sides at the front and 140 N/mm on both sides of the rear. I have the steering ratio at 11:5:1, front and rear toe-in angle at 0.0 deg, front anti-roll bar at 120 N/m, and rear anti-roll bar
 at 100 N/mm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the bump stop on 20mm for both sides on the front and the rear, front slow bump at 5700/m/s on both sides of the front and 5800/m/s at the rear. I have the front slow rebound at 9700/m/s on both sides of the front and 11500/m/s on both sides on the
 rear. I have the fast bump at 3100/m/s on both sides of the front and 2900/m/s on both sides of the rear. I have the fast rebound on 4700/m/s on both sides of the front and 6000/m/s on both sides of the rear. I have the bump transition on 420N at the front
 and 415N at the rear. And I have the rebound transition at -640N at the front and -1150N at the rear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the fuel load at 44L, boost pressure at 100%, Air restrictor at 55.10, Radiator opening at 20%, engine braking at 2. For gearing, I don't really care because I mostly worry about handling as much as speed. For ECU, I have traction control at 20% and
 ABS Strength on 78%. For the differential, I have the spool on, geared LSD on, bias ratio power on 1:0:1, bias ratio coast on 1:0:1, clutch LSD off, preload on 100N-m, 6 clutches, power ramp on 65 deg, coast ramp on 55 deg, Viscous LSD off, Viscous lock on
 300 N-m, and ratcheting off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what I should have the setup at? I've done everything I could to improve the setup, but I think that the tyres are the main problem in wet weather.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading.</p>

            Hi! Unforuntately I can't provide any tips regarding this myself as I don't play the game, but in case no other experienced players will see this and respond, I'd recommend to either post this in the games/developers officials forums or in the subreddit
 where the chance of others who might be able to help seeing this will be bigger.

<p>Hi, I don't play Project Cars 2, but I do play Forza Motorsport 7. It sounds like you could just be
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaplaning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
hydroplaning</a>.</p>
<p>Check to see if you are driving over any puddles, or bodies of water when you spin out.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is the case, and not a bug in the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just had a thought, and that thought is that you try different cars on this track, simply because different cars handle differently, and therefore you might find a car that won't spin out in these conditions.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Google domain websites will not load on my laptop. I have tried it on Firefox, I.E. and Google Chrome and none of them will load it. At first I thought it was a problem with the DNS sever but I've tried changing it and that did absolutely nothing. I do not
 believe it is a problem with Google but something with my laptop. I have Windows 8.1</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are unable to view Websites By Google Inc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you connected to a domain network?</li><li>Are you using a wired or wireless connection to connect to the internet?</li><li>Does the issue with different device using the same internet connection? </li><li>What is the exact error message you get while trying to access these websites?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you have tried changing DNS settings and you were still unable to view those websites, I suggest you to follow the steps below and see if it helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Reset Internet Explorer </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to refer to the article below for more information on Resetting Internet Explorer settings:</p>

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/923737</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We
 recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature. Resetting Internet Explorer isn't reversible, and all previous settings are lost after reset.</p>

</p><p>The file/service that is unable to start is the inbuilt Cryptographic Services service failed to initialize the Catalog Database. The ESENT error was: -1011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either a corrupt database, malware, or a severe OS corruption (perhaps HD)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to do a repair install from the win 7 dvd.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are dozens of other problems not as important but they would also be helped by a repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In October your HD started throwing bad blocks and they have been getting more frequent daily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In late November the HD started corrupting the NTFS file system</p>
<p>
</p><p>So at this point you may have a failing HD and you would have to do a clean install of windows on it so that sounds like the best idea for the plan</p>

<h2>            Chessmaster Grandmaster Edition - Ubisoft</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have been using Chessmaster-Grandmaster Edition for close to 10 years, and found it to be one of the best chess games that I tried.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after updating to Windows 10, Chessmaster is no longer working properly:
<br />
Login, graphics, and sound seem to be working correctly, but the TIME CONTROLS ARE NOT! The time lapse between a mouse click and the actual board move is exceedingly long. Same comments apply to the game data base update.</p>
<p>I realize that this is a relatively old application, but it worked well for years.</p>
<p>I uninstalled and reinstalled it, I tried to see if the compatibility for older versions would work (Vista, Windows 7 etc…) but the symptoms persist.</p>
<p>Is there a recommended solution?</p>
<p />

<p>I had the exact same issue as you've described it. In my case, the game worked fine for awhile after I upgraded to Windows 10, but somewhere along the way, after an update I'm assuming?, the problem you described came into existence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in order to pin down the problem, I opened "Task Manager," and while I 'played' the game, I watched for any processes with unusually heavy CPU usage. What I found was that, when the "TIME CONTROLS" lagged and disappeared from the screen, Windows' "Antimalware
 Service Executable" and its sub-processes would spike in CPU usage. Like a 30-40% increase. Once the CPU spike subsided to "normal" levels, I would once again could make a move in the game. Likewise, the game clock would be back on the screen and running normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, armed with the knowledge that there was a conflict with 'Windows Defender,' I took the shotgun approach and added a bunch of "process" exclusions on all the Chessmaster executables found typically in this location:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Chessmaster Grandmaster Edition\</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The executable names are:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Chessmaster.exe</em></p>
<p><em>game.exe</em></p>
<p><em>gu.exe</em></p>
<p><em>TheKing333.exe</em></p>
<p><em>TheKing350.exe</em></p>
<p><em>TheKing350_64.exe</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>To make these exclusions, you need to go to <strong>"Windows Defender Security Settings" -&gt; "Virus &amp; threat protection" -&gt; "Virus &amp; threat protection settings" -&gt; "Exclusions" -&gt; "Add or remove exclusions" -&gt; "Add an exclusion" -&gt; "Process" -&gt;
</strong>and from there add the full path to the executable. Example:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Chessmaster Grandmaster Edition\Chessmaster.exe&nbsp; &nbsp;</em> &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>or</strong></p>
<p><em>C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Chessmaster Grandmaster Edition\game.exe</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I, also, "allow an app..." all of these executables listed above in "Windows Defender Firewall."</p>
<p>You can find all of that under: <strong>"Control Panel" -&gt; "Windows Defender Firewall" -&gt; "Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall" -&gt; "Change settings" -&gt; "Allow another app..." -&gt; "Browse" -&gt;
</strong>-select the executable from the list above- -&gt; -click-<strong> "Open" -&gt;
</strong>then<strong> "Add"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>From there, you can check public and private, as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, yeah, I took a lazy shotgun approach to the problem, but it worked. The game runs as normal, now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure you could narrow down the problem to a single executable, I'm thinking maybe just game.exe? Then, you would only to make one process exclusion or firewall exception, and maybe not even both of those are needed, as well? I'm too lazy to do of that,
 so yeah, shotgun approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just remember, the more exclusions you make, whether to the firewall or the anti-malware software, the more your computer is at risk to exploits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Oh... </p>
<p>
</p><p>PS - It, also, never hurts to run Chessmaster as "Administrator" when you play. Of course, that is -right click- on the Chessmaster icon and -left click- "Run as administrator".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>the game works fine but has no sound. i have searched the internet for a solution and have tried everything but nothing seems to work. all sounds on my pc work fine. every game works fine discord and ts work fine but minecraft has no sound. i have uninstalled

<p>thanks for the reply. somehow i fixed it but im not sure how. it seems that in order for sound to work minecraft must be the first application launched when i turn on my pc.
</p>
<p>if i launch another app first weather its a game or discord, basically anything that uses sound then the sound wont work in minecraft. but if i launch mincraft first and leave it running the sound works.
</p>
<p>i have no idea where the problem could be but it seems my system just doesnt like minecraft. having a lot of issues with it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            HP Pavillion x360 Problems</h2>
                    <p>Since getting my new laptop, I've encountered two really annoying problems with it that I can't find any solutions to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Opening up folders causes immediate problems. The program will freeze and say Not Working, and it'll stay like that for a couple of minutes before the entire taskbar refreshes and the program closes out. Even after this, the folder application will continue
 to freeze and close down by itself, for a number of times, so I can't browse through any of my things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The touchpad will randomly have problems. Usually it occurs when typing; the touchpad will stop working and I have to double click to get the mouse to move anywhere. This problem only stops when I go into the touchpad settings and reset the device. Just
 like the folders problem, it isn't a complete fix because after awhile the touchpad will again start having the same problem. Sometimes I'll go days without encountering this problem, other times it happens every half hour or so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last HP laptop was so good it lasted me a full five years and I want this one to be the same. Any solutions you can offer me?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />I recommend using SFC. During the analysis carried out by SFC on the files of the system, it will check the versions of each one of them and in case it finds one that has been overwritten or is damaged, the tool itself will proceed to recover a good version of that file to replace it. It is a tool based on the command prompt that offers several commands to perform these tasks of file analysis and recovery.
<br />
<br />Check this link, it is to run (Scannow and Dism) that are used to repair Windows system files.

<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

<h2>            Upgrade to Windows 10 Resulted in &#34;Password Amnesia&#34; -- Locked me out of my own computer</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday, I upgraded my fully updated Windows 8.1 computer to Windows 10.&nbsp; Everything went fine, full installation, many restarts, etc.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the final restart,&nbsp;I was presented with my login, with my (empty) profile picture, my name right below that, and my Microsoft account name (my Hotmail address) right below that..&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I normally logged in with a 4-digit PIN.&nbsp; I tried.&nbsp; It did not work.&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried again.&nbsp; It did not work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I went to log in with my Microsoft account and password.&nbsp; It failed too. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The message I got was: &nbsp;"That password is incorrect.&nbsp; Make sure you're using the password for your Microsoft account.&nbsp; You can always reset it at account.live.com/password/reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking it was a simple fix, I went and changed my Microsoft password.&nbsp; That worked on my Windows Phone and it worked on my Surface running Windows 8.1.&nbsp; But it had no effect on the laptop running Windows 10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went back and tried just about every prior password I had for the last few years.&nbsp; I write them all down and keep them, so I did, indeed, have them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried the PIN again, and it said my PIN was no longer valid because the Microsoft account password had been changed -- when you finish reading this inquiry, you will realize this was very odd.&nbsp; True, but odd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I changed my Microsoft account password two more times.&nbsp; Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realized I had two-step security, so maybe that was it.&nbsp; So, I deactivated two-step security, changed the Microsoft account password again (without two-step security).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I spent 2 hours, 51 minutes and 22 seconds on the phone with Microsoft support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing, and amazingly not even a suggestion, other than come to this community site to ask for help.&nbsp; Could have saved those 3 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I ask for a solution.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the only Administrator on the computer.&nbsp; There is one guest user account, which I went on to confirm that Windows 10 loaded and is functional.&nbsp; The only apparent problem (and it is a significant one) is that the password and by Microsoft account seem

            <p>Hi Ted,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description we understand that you are not able to login to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to know&nbsp;more information on this issue to assist you better:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If you get other Sign In options on the logon screen?</p>
<p>2. Did you restart the computer after resetting the password for the Microsoft account?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>As you don't see a picture on the login screen, try to login without any password leaving it black and hit enter at the login screen&nbsp;and check if you can see the desktop screen. You may also check the Network icon to see if the computer is connected
 to the Internet.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>We would suggest you to restart the computer and then try to login with the new Microsoft Account password that you have created to assist you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I had the same issue when I rebooted this morning after upgrading last night. I work with it for a couple hours and finally got logged in. Here is what worked for me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reboot. At startup press F8 several time to enter some repair/troubleshooting options and select advanced options, troubleshoot, advanced options, then select system restore. I only had 2 points to restore to so I selected the earliest. After the
 reboot you should be able to use the previous working password to log in. Hope this works for you guys also!</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. The login options are PIN and Password. As noted in original post, PIN useless, and Password sending me into perpetual circles.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Yes. Multiple times with multiple Microsoft account password changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to internet, yes. That was part of why I logged on on the guest user (local password) account. This was to confirm multiple aspects of functionality, including connectivity. Connected.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that my mouse is being detected as both a mouse and a game controller for some reason. This is causing an issue with several Unity engine games that I play in that the mouse doesn't work properly in the game menus. I'd like to be
 able to disable the game controller portion without disabling the mouse itself. Since MadCatz is under new ownership, they don't offer support for my mouse anymore so I thought I'd ask here.</p>

<p>Hello TorQueMoD,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue could possibly caused by a bug between the game and mouse. Have you tried removing extra/other peripheral devices plugged in to your computer? Also, some users had suggested that downloading and installing the firmware 1.24 for Rat Pro X may help
 solve the said issue and check if there's an option inside the game to disable controllers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, it would be best to contact the game developer and manufacturer of your mouse to further address the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

2TB ; MBR = <strong>1863.02 GB</strong> ;&nbsp;GPT = <strong>1862.89 GB</strong><br />
While using 1TB HDD. MBR = <strong>931.54 GB</strong> ; GPT <strong>931.42 GB</strong><br />
So, GPT and MBR will shown different capacity in Disk Management.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Do you have a friend by chance that has the same game? That way you can check to see if it is your xbox and/or the game. It maybe your system having trouble reading the data on your disc.
</p>
<p>I would also try clearing your system cache and re installing patches for that game. It could be that a patch was corrupted somehow on your system.

<h3> anarchist86ed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updates stuck, can&#39;t shut down without holding power button. Triples start up time.</h2>
                    <p>This has been a problem for a couple of days, but last night I couldn't shut down. My computer got stuck in an update loop. Installing 2 of 4 updates. I waited and waited but it never finished. I had to hold my power button to shut down. I installed the
 latest .net framework today manually, it had been failing, but it didn't fix the problem. The updates hang forever and of course I can't stop the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is as far as updates will get then they won't go any further. Trying to restart results in a configuring windows loop that never ends, have to hold power button. Then on restart it'll get to certain point, say welcome, then restart again after which
 it goes to configuring again but starts up normally. Needless to say I'm displeased and nothing I've tried has helped. The update troubleshooter won't even start.</p>

<strong>Turbo Tax is talking non-sense. Microsoft does not develop Turbo Tax, they developer are responsible for the update mechanism in the product. If it does not work, the only option is to try reinstalling in compatibility mode or find an alternative Tax

<h2>            &#38;quot&#59;Disconnected from Xbox Live&#38;quot&#59; - only when playing multiplayer-type scenarios</h2>
                    
<p>So, I'm not sure if this is the same as everyone else's. I get "Disconnected from Xbox Live" (not signed out) randomly when playing online. Seems to stop occurring around 0100 CST (GMT +5) only to pick up again in the morning.</p>
<p>I ONLY get disconnected when online interacting with other users (multiplayer, Destiny, online co-op). I don't get disconnected if I'm watching Netflix, playing solo campaign, etc.</p>
<p>I tried this across multiple games: Halo 4, Reach, MW2, MW3, BOPs I, BOPs II, Ghost, MoH, etc and the result is always the same. Usually within 5-15 min I get disconnected. There's the rare occasion I might get close to an hour in. This is really annoying.
 Basically I have a Gold account that I can't use for the purpose I have it.</p>

<p>What Country/State/Province do you live in?</p>
<p>WI/USA</p>
<p>Modem brand &amp; model number:</p>
<p>UBEE DDW 365 (Charter supplied, can't change settings)</p>
<p>Router brand &amp; model number:</p>
<p>None - problem persists when all networking equipment is bypassed</p>
<p>How many consoles do you have connected to this router?</p>
<p>1 Xbox 360 (modem not router)</p>
<p>Wired or wireless (for each console):</p>
<p>Wired</p>
<p><span>If Wireless, are you using a white or black external adapter, or an internal (Xbox 360S) adapter?</span></p>
<p>Things you have tried:</p>
<p>*Cleared System Cache 3 times in a row</p>
<p>*Deleted and re-downloaded profile</p>
<p>*Deleted and re-downloaded game content</p>

<p>Is UPnP Enabled? Yes/no/Unknown</p>
<p>Unknown</p>

<p>Do you have a NAT error? If so, what is your NAT type?</p>
<p>No, and Open</p>

            <p>Hey there, WieldableRat! I am very sorry to see that you've been getting disconnected from your multiplayer games. I did a bit of digging and believe that I found the solution, though!<br /><br />Looks like we do have this model of your Ubee on our Networking Hardware Information forums. I linked you directly to the Overview of that device so that is covers basically everything. We have a couple of known issues with that device, and one sounds an awful lot like the issue you're running into! If you scroll all the way down to the bottom of that post, you'll see the list of known issues, one of them being:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>This device's firewall settings can cause many online gaming issues with either Xbox model.&nbsp; If you are experiencing online multiplayer issues we recommend s</span><span>etting IPv4 Firewall Protection to Low to help resolve.<br /></span></li>
</ul>
<p>Since you are having issues only with multiplayer, we may need to change this setting.<br /><br />Now, I completely recognize that you can't change the settings. It looks like the gateway address for your specific device is <a href="http://192.168.44.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">192.168.44.1</a>. You can always click that link to see if it will bring you to the login page for the Ubee device. If it does, try the log in information that the Overview page for it supplies. Never hurts to try. Then you can determine which version of the firmware you have by seeing if you've got the Ubee logo at the top center of the screen (older firmware) or if it more toward the top left of the screen (newer firmware).<br /><br />If you are still unable to log in, my next suggestion is to contact Charter and have them turn down this setting in your gateway. You can make sure they follow the exact steps in the firewall section of this device to make sure your Xbox functions as intended.<br /><br />Hopefully th
        </p>

<p>Ok. So. Charter Business apparently doesn't let us set modem(router)/firewall configs. I called and they said nothing is restricted and basically all ports are forwarded so it's our/my responsibility past the router to set up firewall rules, etc.</p>
<p>I can't access the modem(router) control page. What's weirder, I logged on earlier today, and got a notice about my NAT being restricted. This is the first time this has happened. It's always been open before.</p>
<p>I called because of this and asked if there had been any sort of DOS due to too many requests / excessive overhead, etc or a filter had been put in place for any particular reason. Their response was "by default, you have zero of anything enabled that would
 restrict your connection."</p>
<p>I've noticed that on my PS3 through a switch, router, then the modem, has never been disconnected. So I'm not sure what this is. It seems to have only been happening in the last month or so that I get continuously disconnected from XBL if I try to play online
 on any game.</p>
<p>I also asked, just to make sure that the following ports (from the support page) were forwarded:</p>
<p>Port 88 (UDP) </p>
<p>Port 3074 (UDP and TCP) </p>
<p>Port 53 (UDP and TCP) </p>
<p>Port 80 (TCP) </p>
<p>*** *** charged me $15 (because apparently businesses can't moderate their own *** modems) and the problem has still persisted.</p>
<p>I know XBL was rolling out another 150k server clusters (350k to 500k) and I'm seriously wondering if ya'll dun goofed somewhere to put it in layman's terms.</p>

            <p>Hey, WieldableRat! Thanks so much for the response, and sorry to see that you still aren't resolved.<br /><br />I'm sorry for any confusion that might have happened, but it's not your ports that need to be forwarded. That device's known issue with the symptoms that you are showing is specifically the firewall settings&nbsp;<em>within</em> that device. I'm more familiar with the residential firmware on that device, but I really cannot imagine they would have it so different from that.<br /><br />To address your Playstation connecting, that is because they are completely different computers with different hardware. The Xbox loves having its network connections to be as simple as possible. While it is considered to be a "smart" device, its networking pathways need to be as simple as possible. Additionally, if you have had your 360 console plugged into the router that is connecting to the Ubee device, and that device isn't set up for it to be in bridge mode (modem mode only, with no router capabili

<p>360 is plugged directly into the Ubee. I removed it from the internal network.</p>
<p>Ubee is not in Bridge mode. Charter said there are no firewall rules enabled on it. They (firewall) are my responsibility to erect between my network(s) and the Ubee.</p>
<p>What's weird to me, and was reaffirmed after a bit of testing. I'll get the "Disconnected from Xbox Live" message and sometimes won't get the "[username] signed out of Xbox Live". Conversely, if I physically interrupt the connection (unplug ethernet cable)
 I always get the "[username] signed out of Xbox Live" message instead of the disconnected one.</p>
<p>In fact, sometimes when I'm "Disconnected from Xbox Live" it doesn't even sign out my username or show on the popup menu or dashboard that I need to sign in to live. I can still access my friends lists and such. It's almost like I'm getting disconnected
 from the game server part of live. If I'm in a party or private chat that doesn't get disbanded or ended when I get the disconnected message.</p>

            <p>Thanks for that update,&nbsp;WieldableRat! It seems like it might be faster if we get you connected up with a Connectivity Specialist at our call centers to help you get these settings changed with Charter.<br /><br />Please call 800-469-9269 and follow the prompts to get to a Connectivity Specialist. Once you get a hold of someone, please make sure they can work directly with you and Charter so that they can make sure those settings are set up optimally for your Xbox 360.<br /><br />I am sorry that I couldn't get you resolved personally; however, I do hope our Connectivity Specialist will be able to get you all sorted out. You may even reference this post to help them so they don't take you through the basics again. ;)<br /><br />Feel free to keep me updated on the situation! And if you do run into any other issues, please do make a new post so we can help you out there. :D</p>

<p>Will do. I did have one question though (under the assumption you work for MS/XBL).</p>
<p>Is there a possibility XBones have some sort of priority on the game servers?</p>
<p>I've noticed if I play around 0200-0700 CST in the wee hours of the night/morning that I have minimal connectivity issues. It seems to occur more often during "primetime" hours when most people would be off work / after dinner gaming.</p>
<p>I'm only bringing this up because I was mentioning this to a buddy of mine in town and he said he hasn't had hardly any connectivity issues with his XBone.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the delayed response, Wieldable! I'm not aware of any priority like that. Every home network is unique in the way it's set up, which makes every Xbox One connect differently to game servers. The way the games themselves let you connect up is different, too. It could be possible that you are farther away from the node that your neighborhood connects to and the load during peak times is more. These would be questions for Charter, though. :)<br /><br />Feel free to keep me updated on the situation when you call support, too! You've got a unique connection set up, and I am interested in how this turns out. :D</p>

<p>"Every home network is unique in the way it's set up"</p>
<p>FWIW, I don't have the Xbox on my home network anymore. It's straight into the modem. I also QoS'd/throttled my home network to 75% of my bandwidth cap so there'd always be free overhead.</p>
<p>Between my buddy and I... I think we logged about 40 hours on Destiny F/St/Sn/M and spent about 3 hours in total in lost time getting dropped. Drops happened randomly at all hours of the night and day. I did notice if I got into Crucible on Destiny or a
 Strike Playlist rather than open world I never got dropped out of those. Random drops out of Multiplayer on COD: Ghosts too.</p>
<p>I did notice once or twice when we'd get reconnected we would get a notification about a strict NAT. Sign out, sign back in. Back to open.</p>
<p>So I guess where do I go from here?</p>
<p>I'm not sure what I need to ask Charter to look into in all this.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One refuses to connect to internet</h2>
                    <p>My Xbox One refuses to connect to the internet, stating that it has detected a wireless network hardware issue. I use a wired connection, but the console refuses to recognize that there is a wired connection. Furthermore, the console was working great yesterday. Can anyone help me?</p>
