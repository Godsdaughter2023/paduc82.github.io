<h2>            Unable to access work email with Outlook RT on Windows RT 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Outlook RT will not connect to our work Exchange Server. &nbsp;The W8 Mail can access my work email and have been using since the start.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also the &nbsp;W8.1&nbsp;Mail app connects with no problem. I have&nbsp;tried using the Exchange Active Synch service and I keep getting
 the error message "The Server cannot be found". I am using the same server I have configured in the W8.1 Mail app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appreciate any clarification and direction on this issue.</p>

Hi I'm having the same problem and have tried it from both my Surface RT devices running 8.1 .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
What is frustrating is that outlook appears to be in a loop on both devices where it won't let me do anything else with it&nbsp;until it connects to the account...which it won't do.&nbsp; How can I master reset outlook?&nbsp; If I try to uninstall it, it takes me to the desktop
 uninstall screen and tells me there are no programs installed because it's not .exe.&nbsp; Help!&nbsp; I use the same settings in the windows 8.1&nbsp;mail app and it works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
please see clipping of messages below:</p>

I've tried deleting the .ost file but it makes no difference and creates another one.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>

Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>I had the same problem as <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f1f0102d-f58f-4c15-bc5e-107d0aebb1a3">
<font color="#0072c6">NeilBerrill</font></a>. To resolve it I went to the "MAIL" settings in the Control Panel via the RT Desktop and deleted the mail account. This stopped the loop situation. I then tried to set up my credentials with the Active Synch options
 with no luck. Then I submitted the original Question.</p>

            <p>Don't set it up as an ActiveSync account but a regular Exchange account. These server settings are different from an ActiveSync account.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If your company has only published to ActiveSync to the outside world and not Outlook Anywhere and AutoDiscover, you will not be able to use Outlook. This works the same as the "regular" Outlook on Windows 8 and not as on your phone.</p>

            Hi Evea:<br />
<br />
Hmmm...&nbsp; You "cannot" be working on a .docx file with built-in macros, because a .docx cannot contain Macros (not allowed to, Word will remove them on opening the file).<br />
<br />
The message "Error! Reference source not found" is a standard broken cross reference.&nbsp; What it means is that the paragraph that was the source for the cross reference has either been deleted or moved.&nbsp; This often happens when people are using tracked changes.<br />
<br />
All you need to do is re-make the cross reference.<br />
<br />
If you have been typing into the area where the cross reference field is, then it will delete what you type every time the cross reference is updated, which it will be every time you print.<br />
<br />
To fix this, copy what you have typed, and paste it into TextEdit.&nbsp; Hit Command + Shift + T in TextEdit to strip the formatting, then copy it and paste it back into the Word document, OUTSIDE (either before or after) the REF field.&nbsp; The key is that you should
 not type inside fields, because Word will generate their content and delete yours.<br />
<br />
To make this easier, turn on Word&gt;Preferences&gt;View&gt;Field Shading to "Always".&nbsp; That was, things like TOC and cross references sow as grey shading so you will not type over them.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<h2>            Excel spreadsheets in Powerpoint</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Excel Spreadsheet inserted into my Powerpoint slide, but Powerpoint wont let me adjust the size of the selection shown, how do I fix this? Every time I double click the spreadsheet and drag the black outline to make the selection shown bigger,
 it adjusts to the size I want but as soon as I click out of the spreadsheet and back into Powerpoint, it reverts to original.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Hi James,<br />
<br />
If you would like to make the inserted Excel spreadsheet display larger, I suggest you ensure you have follow the steps below to insert a Excel spreadsheet via Insert&gt; Object&gt; Create from file in PowerPoint 2016.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b4a21e22-9c7a-40c8-81c2-5da0fdcd5f1c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b4a21e22-9c7a-40c8-81c2-5da0fdcd5f1c?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
In this case, you can drag the display page and adjust the size as you want in PowerPoint 2016.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d971136f-8203-4c9a-a1c8-a6833fe2f9e5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d971136f-8203-4c9a-a1c8-a6833fe2f9e5?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
If this is not your scenario, to better understand your situation and help you, please provide detailed steps and related screenshots about how you insert an Excel spreadsheet in PowerPoint 2016 and encounter the issue.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yoga

    <title>Remove extra printers from Word 2010 printers list - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Remove extra printers from Word 2010 printers list</h2>
                    Hello all,<br />
is there a way to remove some of the extra printers that appear in the printers list? I have installed 4 printers(corporate environment) but i only want to use 2 in MS Word. Also keep in mind that i do not want to remove them from the windows, only from the
 list of printers in Word 2010.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,<br />
Dionisis.<br />

            <p>One would think there might be a Registry key that contains the list of printers shown in Word's Print dialog, but investigation of this matter has been inconclusive. Although there are Registry entries at
<strong><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows<br />
NT\CurrentVersion\Print\Printers </span></strong><span>and
</span><strong><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows<br />
NT\CurrentVersion\Print\Printers</span></strong><span>, these list the printers installed in Windows, which will be those shown in the Printers folder, and those should be the same as those listed in
 Word. The list does <strong>not</strong> however, include printers on the network, only those locally installed.</span></p>

<h3> lark1000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 365 desktop, IMAP on multiple computers, unread email not always syncing</h2>
                    Thought it would be best to start as a new topic since my last post had changed so much.&nbsp; But I just set up a new single email address at work using IMAP and on Outlook 365 desktop.&nbsp; I know when a message is read, it will show as read on all computers.&nbsp;
 When a message is read and then marked back to being unread, it doesnt always sync to the other computers as unread.&nbsp; It does sometimes and on some computers but not all the time.&nbsp; I cant really find a pattern either.&nbsp; Just some messages will and on some computers,
 and some messages wont.&nbsp; What might be causing this?

<p>Hi lark1000,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand based on your description, after you mark the messages to unread, the status sometimes doesn’t sync between all of your devices, right? In this situation, I suggest you check whether the read/unread status is synced to the web mail app. If
 so, please select the Inbox of your IMAP account and click update folder under the Send/Receive tab and check if the read/unread status will be synced.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, you can also try to re-add your account to Outlook and see if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Huni</p>

<p>I just went through a bunch of trouble shooting ideas to narrow things down.&nbsp; I also set up the email through my Androids preinstalled email app.&nbsp; Everything syncs perfectly through the webmail interface the way it should.&nbsp; So it looks to be strictly a desktop
 Outlook problem now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of the 4 computers using Outlook on this one email account, they seem to all be doing the same thing with each other and I still cant see a pattern.&nbsp; Most of the time, if a message is marked read or unread on Outlook, is carries down to the webmail.&nbsp; But
 if the message is marked as read or unread on webmail, it will not carry over to outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did notice a few times, some other messages would sync perfectly in both directions.&nbsp; This was rare though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other thoughts?&nbsp; Im not sure what else to try</p>

<p>I do have the Help/Contact Support option where it gives me a window to type out the details.&nbsp; I will give that a shot also, thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also yesterday, I tried trouble shooting again.&nbsp; I closed Outlook on all the computers except for one in case they were somehow interfering with each other.&nbsp; All the same problems still happen...When a message is marked as unread in Outlook or webmail, everything
 carrys over.&nbsp; When marked as read in Outlook, it carrys over to webmail but does not carry over when marked as read in webmail to outlook.&nbsp; Using a separate IMAP email program or app other than Outlook, everything works exactly as it should.</p>

<p>I did contact support and I think I have some answers.&nbsp; They were saying that in order for the read/unread message thing to sync, our Microsoft account needs to be converted to an exchange account which is a monthly fee.&nbsp; They said to also check with our
 email provider first because they may be able to set that up for us.&nbsp; I have an email out to them now and waiting to hear back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind of hate to hear that they charge for this, I remember this being one of the main purposes of using IMAP instead of POP.&nbsp; My email client on my phone will do it and Im guessing Firefox Thunderbird may also do what I need.&nbsp; Im guessing there are other
 clients out there too that also may.&nbsp; If it comes down to where we will have to pay a monthly fee for this ability, we are going to have to look into another client</p>

            Try performing a soft reset and see if the problem persists... If not back up your data and perform a hard reset. If it still doesn't rectify the issue, take it to the nearest Nokia care.

<p>The resets can not Rollback the Firmware version.. In fact you can not do that any other way.. but did the Resets resolve the problem you are facing...? Did you check if the touchscreen issue is solved or not ?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a subscription to Office 365 Business Premium. I want to "learn" how to do two things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Create a "form" that can be embedded on my website that will allow customers to submit information. Ideally, customers would mouse click a button which would open up a "form", then enter the information onto this form. Preferably, with the option for
 customers to digitally sign the form and then send to an email address as a .pdf attachment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Allow customers physically sitting in my office to use a mobile device (Android Tablet provided by my office) to digitally submit the same information in .pdf format, not necessarily by visiting my website, but perhaps a similar "form" accessible on an
 inner office network. </p>

            Hello Kevin,
<br />
<br />My name is Parmi, I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting your question. I'll be happy to help. 
<br />
<br />I think you are referring to Microsoft Forms which is available with O365. I believe both your questions will be answered in below article. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://sharepointlibrarian.com/2018/03/26/embed-quizzes-and-or-results-in-sharepoint-using-microsoft-forms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sharepointlibrarian.com/2018/03/26/embe...</a>

Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br />the article shows how to embed the form in your SharePoint site.Regarding the mobile app access, all O365 applications can be easily access and used via mobile/tablet devices. As long as you share the form with them to respond to the From and they have the link to open the Form, they can open in their Mobile devices as well. 
<br />
<br />Please let me know if, you have any other queries. 
<br />
<br />Regards,

<p>Good morning Parmi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the type and complexity of the information I'd like to collect isn't possible using the "Forms" App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to allow any customer visiting my website the ability to "fill out" a form, even customers that aren't part of my "intranet", such as customers who do an internet search and find my business website while at home.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I have never used Infopath and do not at present own / have Infopath 2013. It sounds like Infopath used to be Microsoft's solution to what I'm trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been suggested that Powerapps, and other new products are to be the new solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, I have zero knowledge / familiarity with exactly "how" these newer applications are to accomplish this.&nbsp; I do intend to dive in and become familiar with these new applications, however, I'm hoping someone with an advanced familiarity can give
 me the "quick" step-by-step of the KEY pieces of knowledge needed to accomplish my task.</p>

            Hi Kevin,
<br />
<br />Thanks for your response. Yes, PowerApps is the replacement of InfoPath. Unfortunately  the steps you are looking for is very deep and I would recommend you post your requirement at the TechNet and/or at PowerApps community. There more of the Advanced users who use the product will be able to help you better.

1. Open the 'NoteBook view' doc. 


2. Save as .rtf. 


2. Close and open (this step may be unnecessary). 


3. Select All, Copy. 


4. Switch to (eg) print layout view. 


5. New. 


6. Paste. 


7. Save and close. 


8. Wail "Thank You Bill" 10 times.

            There is nothing you can do. Unfortunately [AFAIK] Microsoft doesn't document this, but once a Notebook document always a Notebook document... The same is true of Publishing Layout documents. Although you can [but IMHO

            I see your point but I think your missing mine.&nbsp; I realize I could format the entire spreadsheet to stop this behavior (whatever you prefer to call it) but I want to alter the Default behavior.&nbsp; i.e. the behavior of the Default format or "General" format.&nbsp;
 In general format this "auto-correction" does occur.&nbsp; Any entry with a leading zero in an spreadsheet the leading zero is striped off and the entry is converted to a number.&nbsp; If I didn't want the leading zero I wouldn't type it.&nbsp; If I bothered to type it I
 want it to stay put and for it to be treated as "text." i.e. I want the leading zero to be equivalent to the override apostrophe and for the presence of these to keep these "auto-conversions" to not take place simply because I edit the cell and I definitely
 don't want this conversion to take place without warning.&nbsp; I do not want to have to disable all error checking or to have to format the entire spreadsheet as text either.&nbsp; I want this behavior of the default or General format.&nbsp; If I enter a number without
 the leading zero I do want it to be a number in the General format.&nbsp; I also want to be continued to be warned about my leading zero making that cell be interpreted as text, I just don't want the automatic striping of the leading zero and the conversion to
 interpretation as a number. <br />
<br />
In order for this behavior to be implemented I would think I would need the enable error checking and auto correction to be separated as two distinct options.&nbsp; What I originally was trying to indicate.&nbsp; I want to continue to be warned I just don't want automatic
 and silent changes made.&nbsp; This is one of the most aggravating aspects of using Excel.<br />

            Well, I found an apparent work around , but I stand by the assertion that data processing systems should never silently discard information.<br />
<br />
The solution seems to be when opening an imported worksheet with the default "General" format, to format the entire spreadsheet as "Text."&nbsp; Then and only then will you be able to prevent this discarding of leading zeros and automatic conversion to the cell
 being interpreted and stored as a number upon editing or selecting a cell for editing.&nbsp; And it will still warn you that a number has been formatted as text.&nbsp; This is what I was looking for but its a lot of trouble to go to on every spreadsheet where I don't
 want to see this happen.<br />
<br />
I would really like to see a option to stop this behavior of Excel.&nbsp; Maybe this is what some people want but just this same from my point of view it is a bug or at least a "feature" that you should be able to turn off completely.&nbsp; From my point of view a leading
 zero is a strong indicator that this should be interpreted as text, because if it wasn't significant, why would I put it there?<br />

                    Chase Mobile for Windows Phone was announced several days ago, but I can't find it anywhere. Where is it? Or if it's not out in Marketplace, when will it be? It certainly is about time.

            <p>Thanks guys, I found it through a link on a blog yesterday. Downloaded it, ran it and already made two deposits.</p>
<p>I love Windows Phone but IMO these are the types of practical, real world apps it needs in order to attract users of Android and iPhone &nbsp;when their contracts with carriers run out and its time to upgrade or replace their phone&nbsp;. But they need to appear a
 lot sooner in the Marketplace.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            iCloud Calendar and Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Outlook 2016 for my Email and calendars. I have two accounts for my calendars: "School" (Exchange) and "Private" (iCloud).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, all calendar invitations are automatically posted to my school calendar in Outlook (and on my iPhone) regardless if they were sent to my school or private email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, I would like to have invitations sent to my private Email account routed to my private calendar and invitations sent to my school Email account routed to my school calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried playing around with the settings in Outlook, but it didn't work for me so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under <strong>Account Settings &gt; Email Accounts</strong> my private email account is already set to default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under <strong>Account Settings &gt; Data Files</strong> my school email account is set to default and I can't change it to any other, or I will receive an error message (see picture). I don't know if it might have anything to do with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? Thanks,</p>
<p>Nico</p>

<p>You can't set reminders for other people reliably or automatically.&nbsp; You can send an email to others when a reminder in your Outlook fires. See

<h2>            Outlook 2010 - hotmail connector - outlook.com &#40;for domains&#41;</h2>
                    I have been having issues with the sync process with outlook 2010 and outlook.com via the hotmail connector. It seems to be that every time I try to move a folder in outlook, Then perform a send/receive I get the following errors:

<div>Task '[*** Email address is removed for privacy ***]' reported error (0x8004102A) : 'Error with Send/Receive. &nbsp;There was an error synchronizing your folder hierarchy. Error : 80041003.'</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also get a notice at the bottom of outlook 2010, a connectivity error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To correct this I always have to redownload my mail which takes about an hour.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have performed these suggested methods to correct the problem without any luck:</div>
<div>- uninstalled and reinstalled the outlook connector application</div>
<div>- repaired my office 2010 installation</div>
<div>- removed/disabled all add-ins in outlook 2010, re-enabling the outlook connector add-ins</div>
<div>- created new profiles for outlook 2010</div>
<div>- turned off all firewalls/virus scanners</div>
<div>- Tried moving my .ost file to another folder and creating a copied version back into the original:&nbsp;AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook</div>
<div>- tried a different computer. fresh installation of office/hotmail connector&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I always get the same errors and can consistently trigger the issue when moving a folder. I feel like the error is on the outlook.com side and I do not know what to do to correct my problems. The only way I can successfully move a folder is to do it via
 the online interface for outlook.com.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions how to move folders successfully inside outlook 2010?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>[Edit]</div>
<div>I have additionally attempted the following:</div>
<div>Created a new account within my domain.</div>
<div>Performed a full sync to outlook of my account that exhibits errors in order to get the latest content.</div>
<div>Performed an export of my corrupt account to a pst file</div>
<div>Added the newly created account into outlook.</div>
<div>Performed an import of the backup pst file into the new account.</div>
<div>Performed a send/receive</div>
<div>After all mail was uploaded, I moved folders around, multiple/single at a time and performed test send/receives. No errors occurred moving folders within the new account.&nbsp;</div>
<div>* So I have ruled out content being the issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I still feel there is something corrupt with my original account. How can I get this looked at or repaired?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            I have added the account back in several times. It will redownload all my information, but will not correct the issue. The next time I try to move a folder it throws the same errors and the only way to use my mail again is to redownload it all (remove
 and add back in the account)

            If anyone else runs into this issue, good luck getting help from Microsoft. I participated in 3 chat sessions, a phone call, and was finally told to post to this forum and a Microsoft professional could help solve my issue. The only response from them
 was to remove and add back in the account. Which was originally stated as the only solution to continue use of outlook with my connected outlook.com account. But did not solve the underlying issue that moving a folder in outlook would put outlook into error
 state - requiring the removal/adding back in the account from within outlook.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>If you are the owner of the live domain and you can afford a minute of downtime with your email address, this is how I was able to get around my "corrupt outlook.com database" issue (for lack of better description, I believe this was the problem).</div>
<div><br />
<div>The fix was to move my mail from the corrupt account into a new account of the same name. It would be nice if one of the "Professionals" could have run some scans on my outlook.com database (or whatever method they use to store my email/calendar data)
 and correct the problem themselves.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To do this:</div>
<div>Perform a send/receive on your active account in outlook.</div>
<div>Verify that everything has been downloaded locally before proceeding further. (* I performed this action on 2 different computers in order to have 2 separate backups of my mail)</div>
<div>I then removed the accounts from the send/receive group in order to save my data locally. I did not want the deletion of the account to somehow wipe my data if an accidental send/receive occurred.</div>
<div>Log into your account and make note of any rules or blocked/allowed senders you may want to keep.</div>
<div>Also verify you have not received any new mail since you last performed send/receive. If you have, turn the send/receive back on and re-sync your mail, then continue on. (I performed this initial few steps late at night to minimize the amount of new mail
 I may have received while in limbo of an account existing)</div>
<div>Once you are confident you have the latest copy of your email downloaded. Log into the domain and delete your account. Then Re-create your same account. You will want to do this quickly in order to keep from missing any important emails.</div>
<div>Once your new account is recreated, log into the web interface with your new credentials and continue to perform the required setup prompts.</div>
<div>You can now start to import all your email/calendar events/Contacts from your backups into your newly created account.</div>
<div>If you are lucky, the easiest way to do this is:</div>
<div>In outlook view your old account and perform an export to a pst file.</div>
<div>Once the export has finished you can add in your new account to outlook and perform an import from that file you just created.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Once you hit send/receive your mail, calendars, and contacts will start to sync back to outlook.com.</div>
<div>This process will take a very long time if you have a lot of mail.</div>
<div>After you get everything pushed to outlook.com you can add back in your rules, blocked senders, allowed senders, etc. (I would wait until you verify all your mail is fully restored in case you have to delete it and start again just to make it easier to
 find any new mail you received since the backup process)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Issues I ran into:</div>
<div>Performing a mass send/receive to upload my initial seed always seems to be a hit and miss. I let it run the first time around. At one point outlook locked up and I had to restart the send/receive process again. When it finally finished I noticed, as I
 was looking through my folders to verify my mail was fully uploaded, that not all my mail uploaded correctly. Many of my mail folders were empty on outlook.com. I attempted some repairs on my new ost file and a few other things and was never able to force
 those missing items to push to outlook.com</div>
<div>I deleted every folder and email from outlook.com, excluding any new mail since I performed the initial backup, and started over. I even removed and added back in my new account to outlook for good measure.</div>
<div>This time, like times before, I opened the exported pst file in outlook and performed a copy from the backup file to the new account a folder or 2 at a time. You can perform a move, but make sure you have a backup copy of your export pst file in case you
 have to do a round 3...100. I performed a send/receive/verification between each copy. I tried not to upload more than 300 emails at a time. It seems to be faster that way.</div>
<div>You can manually copy your calendars/events as well.</div>
<div>This is a very tedious way to get your mail pushed back to outlook.com but it does work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also had an issue during the account recreation step. It appears that outlook.com doesn't actually delete your account but rather they inactivate it. So during the creation step if you try to use the same password you will get an account creation error
 with poor description as to why it failed. So just use a new password.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>It may be possible to just perform a backup of your account, delete all mail and folders, then restore the data back. But the majority of the time, as I have experienced, is spent pushing data back to outlook.com which is the same for both efforts. Also,
 I didn't want to worry about new mail getting sorted into a missing folder or lost by accident nor did I want to chance having this alternate way fail and still having to fall back to the new account creation method.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since performing these steps I am able to perform all actions in outlook including moving folders and the original error has gone away. I feel sorry for those that my run into this issue with a standard outlook.com address or one created with the same
 name as their favorite account( a gmail account or whatever). If this happens to them there is no process that I know of to delete and recreate those types of accounts and Microsoft doesn't seem to have the ability to troubleshoot their own services effectively.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hopefully this will be useful to someone.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>I used to stand by Microsoft in defense but I am afraid that I will never back them again. This whole month has been one thing after another with them. Of course there have been other issues in the past few years but it is really beating me to death as of
 late.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running into this same problem more or less. I have never created my account through Outlook on my local computer so this fix doesn't apply to me. I have tried uninstalling, chat and phone support, and online posting. 2 weeks ago my MS Suite somehow
 just stopped working and every time I tried to get it resolved they were not offering help. Instead they tried to get me to REPURCHASE IT!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I used to back them but now they are nothing but a sham. They do not care about their products nor their customers. I have lost way too much time trying to overcome issue after issue and my business has suffered because of their incompetence. I hope
 and pray Mozilla or Google or ANYONE develops the tools like access to match so I can leave them behind and, in my dream of dreams, watch their sham filled criminal company fall to pieces.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS, you should be ashamed with what you have become and I hope you get what is coming to you soon. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Why does my recent saved draft messages not showing up in my Drafts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simondarragh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does my recent saved draft messages not showing up in my Drafts folder&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Several times owing to unreliable connections I have been unable to send long&nbsp;messages that I have just written and am told to try again later. However the message I wrote has by then disappeared. But every time I write a message it is saved - so a prompt
 in the corner tells me - in the 'saved drafts' folder. But when I look in the drafts folder I find that the only messages it contains are ones written six months or more ago. None of my messages written in the last few months have appeared in this folder,
 even though every time I write a message I am told that the draft has been saved.</p>
<p>With the old system I was able to set it up so as to be really sure of saving a draft; with the 'new improved' system (which nobody asked for and nobody wants) I am told that drafts are saved, but it isn't true. I wish you would give us back our old hotmail;
 it wasn't perfect but it was a lot better than the current unusable mess!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            error message &#39;there is insufficient memory or disc space - word cannot display required font</h2>
                    I have microsoft office 365. i keep getting the error message&nbsp;<strong>'there is insufficient memory or disc space - word cannot display required font</strong>' when i open word documents (not all of them but quite a few of them). Initially i went on line
 to see if i could solve this myself but to no avail. so i contacted Microsoft help on 7th Feb - chatted to
<strong>Ferds</strong> online and he accessed my computer. He could not solve the problem and gave me a case number. He promised that someone from technical support level two would phone me - they never did. chatted on line with
<strong>Leslie G</strong> first thing this morning (8th Feb) and gave her my case number. She could not solve issue and said someone from technical support level two would phone me&nbsp;within two hours. They never did. Chatted on line in afternoon to
<strong>Lorena L </strong>- who also promised someone would phone me. She tried to solve issue with online repair - I needed to restart computer so she gave me a rejoin link, but unfortunately her actions did not do anything and the rejoin link now put me through
 to <strong>Kenneth F.</strong> I gave him my case number and he promised me&nbsp;someone from technical support level two would phone me&nbsp;within two hours. You guessed it - they never did. Does anyone have any advice on how i can get a person from&nbsp;&nbsp;technical support
 level two&nbsp;to phone me?&nbsp;

<h3> joshlevy87  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office install hangs up at &#34;We&#39;re wrapping things up&#34; screen</h2>
                    I'm installing an upgrade from Office Professional 2010 to Office 365 Professional Plus. Both the original and upgrade are 64-bit versions. The upgrade installs and gets to a screen saying "You can use Office now" and "We're wrapping things up" with a
 progress bar. But the progress bar hangs up roughly 80-90% into the progress. I can get into Office. But I don't have all the same abilities yet, like certain Add-Ins to Excel. I had the same thing when I upgraded from my home computer, but after about 30-45
 minutes, it eventually finished wrapping things up and I was able to use Office with full functionality. But this is on my work computer, and it's been stuck for a good 2 hours now. Any suggestions? The OS is the same as the OS on my home computer, Windows
 7 Ultimate. And I'm really uneasy with restarting or interrupting any type of installation. I appreciate any assistance. Thanks!

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p><span>Thanks for posting in Microsoft Community. As I understand you want to import Outlook address book data into Outlook 2010. Let me help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Was the Windows operating system upgraded from Windows XP to Windows 7 or did you copy the Outlook Express files from a old computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you have the access to the old computer and had copied the Outlook express files from there, then you may<span>&nbsp;
</span>export the address book data as .csv format and then import the same in Outlook 2010.</span></p>
<p>To export to other address book formats:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>In the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Address Book</span><span>, point to
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Export</span><span> on the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">File</span><span> menu, and then click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Other Address Book</span><span>. </span></li><li><span>Click the address book or file type you want to export to, and then click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Export</span><span>. </span></li></ol>
<p><span>Or if you have Office Outlook installed on the other computer you may import the&nbsp;Address book data into Outlook as .PST format and then import it into the Outlook on the other Computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook Express .dbx files will not store contacts, it only stores the emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contacts in Outlook Express are saved in Windows Address Book (.wab) file, refer the link below to know on how to
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/286116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/286116</a>
</p>
<p>(In Outlook 2010 you need to click on file, open to go to import and export option.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    I have no idea why my Microsoft account has been closed! It has to be for personal reasons! If a Microsoft Agent is suffering from delusion and has personal problems that affect his or her judgement in closing a Microsoft&nbsp; Account can they be sued for
 the problems they have caused? If not, can Microsoft be held libel for hiring these people in the first place!

            <p>Hi Konrad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our related team has told me that they can't find any account related to this transaction via the information you provided. As a result, they need to know whether you have another Office 365 tenant which might generated this transaction information.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, via checking the domain you provided, our related team has found that the card binding with this domain last four number isn't *33* but *59* （here, I removed 2 numbers for protecting your privacy).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, please provide another Office 365 tenant information and last four numbers of the card which happens the transaction in the private message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alan</p>
