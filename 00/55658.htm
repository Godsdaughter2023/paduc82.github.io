<h2>            After Windows 10 update, Password wont work, locked out</h2>
                    After the most recent windows 10 automatic &nbsp;update my laptop password would not work, and after trying it several times my laptop will now not boot up, I'm locked out. when I attempt to log on all I get is a blue box labeled Password/Unlock Key with a
 8 digit alpha numeric/ "Unlock Key Hint Number"&nbsp; and I tried entering the number and just about everything else that seemed logical, nothing works- please someone, I need help the laptop is relatively new and expensive, but now out of warranty and&nbsp;after buying
 5 computers, &nbsp;Dell computer is of no help, In the interest of good customer relations, It seems to me that both Dell and&nbsp;Microsoft should live up to their product, and the grief that&nbsp;windows 10 has caused and help get this resolved.

<p>Jonjo900,</p>
<p>It sounds to me like you are referring to pressing down on the mouse wheel. This is a function of the wheel on your mouse. In order to turn it off, simply press the wheel again and it turns the option off.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

            <p>Hi Muhammad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to download the drivers for previous Windows Operating System and then try installing it in compatibility mode and check if it helps. This is just a work around till the compatible drivers are available in the market.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may download the drivers from the following Dell website.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/product-support/product/inspiron-14-intel-n4050/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19/product-support/product/inspiron-14-intel-n4050/drivers</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the following Microsoft Help article to install the driver in compatibility mode.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</a>
</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The steps for Windows 8.1 applies to Windows 10 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply with the status of the issue so that we can help you better.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have upgrated my Dell İnspiron 14 N4050 to new windows 10. I also have installed ssd disk for fast using visual studio community IDE . Everything was fine in first time. After three-four times laptop has started working unstable. For example I cannot click
 unexpectedly during my web search than it is going normal. Another example my wifi sometimes connected correctly but sometimes can't connect the network.(the same network).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third example; my device manager show me some of devices not recognize but I click upgrade than it is ok. Also serial bus driver is ok but sometimes it could not be recognize unexpetedly. Final example amd graphic card not work correctly with intel &nbsp;cause
 very slowly boot and black screen on booting. So disabling amd card solve problem temporarily.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So I tweeted the dell and here is the answer;</p>
<p>So dell pass the buck to microsoft for supporting and no schedule or certain date for new windows 10 drivers. I try to wait and use this unstable system :)</p>

            <p>Hi boraozkhan&nbsp;and muhammad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same model Dell Inspiron N4050 with Intel HD3000 and AMD Radeon 7450.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried almost everything under the sun to get Windows 10 working.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there is no support for 1st and 2nd gen Intel drivers like HD3000. It is mentioned on Intel website and they don't intend to do anything about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AMD has no support for switchable graphics either for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither does Dell support Windows 10 for N4050.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you will have to roll back to Windows 8 or Windows 7 like I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try to give the new AMD Crimson drivers or the leschat Catalyst driver a try to see. I havent tried those yet since I am happy with Win 7 for now.</p>

<h2>            No speaker sound on my surface Go</h2>
                    <p>So, I purchased this surface go a little over 30 days ago and I am already having problems.&nbsp; I wanted to play youtube but there isn't any sound.&nbsp; I read that I need to check to see if there is sound when plugging in headset and there is.&nbsp; So this means that
 there is something wrong with my device???&nbsp; if so, how sneaky.&nbsp; My warranty I believe is up.&nbsp; I purchased it in late August 2018 and well, it's first week in October.&nbsp; I can't return device because...here's the rub....I'm overseas and there's isn't a store
 here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to do troubleshooting but with no luck.&nbsp; &nbsp;I need some help please.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing your concern with us. For us to be able to narrow down its root cause, can you please provide us the following questions below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>May we know which browser are you using?</li><li>Have you tried to use a different web browser?&nbsp;</li><li>Have you also tried to clear cache and cookies on your browser?</li><li>Were there any recent changes made on your device prior to this issue?</li><li>Can you please confirm to us if you see the volume button on YouTube videos?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that you've adjusted volume levels in the right places. You can control the volume in several places:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Volume button:</strong>&nbsp;Press the volume button on your Surface to adjust the volume up or down.</li><li><strong>Keyboard:</strong>&nbsp;If your Surface Typing Cover or keyboard has volume keys, press the volume-down, volume-up, or mute key.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In most cases, downloading and installing the latest update for Windows and Surface will fix the issue. To do this, run the&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/surfacerepairuwp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</strong></a>.&nbsp;<span>This
 tool will guide you through series of steps that will help you to validate your Surface device functionality.</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If running the toolkit doesn't help, try running the automated troubleshooters:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>To troubleshoot output sound, go to&nbsp;<strong>Start&nbsp;</strong>, select&nbsp;<strong>Settings &gt; Sound &gt; select Troubleshoot&nbsp;</strong>under the<strong>&nbsp;Sound&nbsp;</strong>section, and then follow the on-screen instructions.</li><li>To troubleshoot input sound, go to&nbsp;<strong>Start&nbsp;</strong>, select&nbsp;<strong>Settings &gt; Sound &gt;&nbsp;</strong>select&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshoot&nbsp;</strong>under the<strong>&nbsp;Input&nbsp;</strong>section, and then follow the on-screen instructions.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists after running the automated sound troubleshooter, perform a two-button shutdown reset:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press and hold the power button until the screen turns off (about 10 seconds), then release the power button.</p>
<p>2. Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Microsoft logo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to have this issue even after performing the above steps, please reply to this thread. The system will notify me so I can get back to you and provide you more answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Remote Desktop Users&#34; group missing from Windows 8 Pro &#40;upgrade from Windows 8&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I bought a brand-new machine that came pre-loaded with Windows 8 x64.&nbsp; I moved up to Windows 8 Pro using the Windows 8 Pro Pack&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/feature-packs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/feature-packs</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;After
 moving up to Pro, I noticed that the local group "Remote Desktop Users" is not present as I would expect it to be on the Pro version.&nbsp; This group *does* exist on a different machine that I have at work that had Windows 8 Pro installed from scratch. Is this
 a bug in the "move up to Pro" process?&nbsp; I'm wanting to use that group to allow non-administrator users to connect to the new machine via Remote Desktop Connection.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps related to this, when I go into System Properties -&gt; Remote, I have "Allow remote connections to this computer" selected, but the "Select Users..." button is disabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any information or workarounds.</p>

            <p>mstsc.exe is the Remote Desktop Connection client.&nbsp; I'm talking about the ability of Windows 8 Pro to serve as a Remote Desktop host.&nbsp; Here's the scenario:</p>
<p>Computer "A", was running Windows 8, moved up to Windows 8 Pro via the Windows 8 Pro Pack.&nbsp; Have one local administrative user ("Dad") and one local standard user ("Son").&nbsp; Enabled "Allow remote connections to this computer".&nbsp; User "Dad" can run mstsc.exe
 on computer "B" (on the same network as "A") and log in to "A" no problem.&nbsp; There appears to be no way to allow user "Son" to do the same without making him also an administrator on computer "A".&nbsp; I surmise that this is due to the absence of the "Remote Desktop
 Users" local group (SID [S-1-5-32-555]) on computer "A".&nbsp; I also surmise that this is a bug in the "move up to Pro" process.</p>
<p>All of this works fine on computer "C", which came with Windows 8 Pro out of the box.&nbsp; Just not on computer "A", the only difference being that it was upgraded from regular Windows 8 to Windows 8 Pro via the Pro Pack.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have the same problem for some users who I purchased pro packs for, and in fact wanted to connect them to the Windows |Server Essentials 2012 system.&nbsp; The setup of the WSE 2012 software fails because it can't find the Remote Desktop Users group.&nbsp; Re-creating
 that group doesn't work either because the software looks for the group SID.&nbsp; MS need to investigate the issue and post a fix, because there are several other threads on the forums regarding this issue.</p>
<p>Thanks.<br />
Andrew.</p>

            <p>Me too! One of the primary reasons for purchasing Windows 8 Pro Pack was precisely because I wanted to be able to use Remote Desktop to access all of the Windows 8 users remotely (including all the local accounts). And&nbsp;it doesn't work for anybody other than
 my administrator account! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Likewise I would like a proper MS fix, rather than trying to work out what to do myself.</p>

            <p>If you save all your data (just in case), find all your App installers (and Keys/PIDs), then go to Settings, PC Settings, General. There you will find "Refresh your PC without affecting your files" Run it.</p>
<p>It will take a while, and after close to an hour (maybe less on faster PCs) it will tell you that it failed and nothing was changed. However, if you check the Groups now and Chek the remote settings tab in System Properties, you'll find that it's fixed.
 I realize it's counterintuitive, but it WORKED for me. You will have to reinstall all your apps though. . . .</p>

            I too have suffered from the woes of the Microsoft Windows 8 Pro upgrade process but have discovered a solution (maybe more of a work around). Dell sent me a XPS 12 loaded with Windows 8 standard rather than the requested Windows 8 Pro. They were nice
 enough to send me a commercial upgrade key to Windows 8 Pro w/Media Center. Like others I used the add windows features wizard, entered the install key and upgraded to Windows 8 Pro(or so I thought).&nbsp;After a couple of failed attempts to use the connect computer
 wizard to join the Server 2012 Essentials domain, I was able to add the machine to the domain&nbsp; manually, but the server apps ran very slowly and final refused to run at all.&nbsp; I looked at the disk management of the machine.&nbsp; It was a mess with two different
 recovery partitions and several other duplicate partitions.&nbsp; I called Dell and he sent me the steps to completely reinstall the OS.&nbsp; I did that, upgraded again and still could not make the wizard work.&nbsp; Reinstalled one more time, upgraded to Pro again and
 the stopped to take a look.&nbsp; It turns out that the Microsoft upgrade process does not install 8 default groups that are installed if you get a machine with Windows 8 Pro installed from the manufacturer.&nbsp; Among those groups is the "Remote Desktop Users" group
 which is necessary for the successful completion of the Server 2012 Essentials connect computer wizard.&nbsp; I saw a suggestion from this blog, supposedly from Microsoft, to run a Windows 8 "Refresh".&nbsp; With the upgrade in place and nothing to lose I did that.&nbsp;
 It asked for the original disk, which I inserted in attached DVD drive (You may have to download a demo of Windows 8 Pro to get this if you do not have a reinstall disk).&nbsp; When the refresh completed, it had reinstalled 6 of the 8 missing groups, including
 the remote desktop users group.&nbsp; I was still missing the Cryptographic Operators group and the Hyper-V Administrators group.&nbsp; Since I was not in a FIPS environment nor concerned with Hyper-V, I decided to take a chance.&nbsp; The Server 2012 Essentials connect
 computer wizard ran flawlessly.&nbsp; I was able to add the machine to the domain, the desk top launch pad installed but the Lync connect app did not install. The Server Apps (Eclipse and ACT) are running well.&nbsp; The Windows 8 Pro upgrade process is definitely broken
 and hopefully will be fixed soon. As I said, this is probably classed as a workaround and may be old info, but it worked for me.&nbsp; Good Luck!<br />

<h2>            Without Internet</h2>
                    
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Now I personally do not have internet, but I do bring my Xbox One to a friends house to update it occasionally. I have noticed when I'm playing at home without Wi-Fi I do not receive any achievements for whatever I may have done,
 but when I hook it up to the internet I get spammed with achievements left and right. Wouldn't it be nice for a few things not to require internet connection, it is nice to see the little achievement notification as soon as you get the achievement. That achievement
 bar to see who out of your friends got the most achievements in a certain amount of time, like the past few days or a week, well if you wanna cheat start playing your xbox offline for a bit, then you'll be in first place. There should be some sort of update
 to fix that. Another thing, customization offline. There really isn't any customization offline, you can't change the colors or your home screen, you can't customize your avatar, you can't change your background, you really can't do anything offline. In my
 opinion I think Microsoft would get a lot more buyers for the xbox one if they at least tried to give the people without internet a little life support. Not everything has to include internet Microsoft, lol I would like to look at my screenshots and game clips
 without having to connect to the internet. Just because some of us have an xbox one doesn't mean all of us can afford internet.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>You actually got your life support when MS reversed its policies and actually allowed people who are offline to play the console.</p>
<p>As far as the achievements, they are synced to the Cloud. &nbsp;You can only accumulate so many offline achievements before you'll be required to connect online and "unlock" them. &nbsp;This was done to cut down on the amount of gamerscore cheaters that were present
 on the Xbox 360.</p>
<p>Lastly, and not to sound jerk-ish, but it's 2015.... according to the UN, Internet access is a human right. &nbsp;To me, personally, having Internet access in my house would trump owning a 400 dollar video game console every time.</p>

<p>I get that, but the OP mentioned that he/she takes his/her One to a friend's house to update it. &nbsp;Now, I don't know how far away this friend lives, but it does sound like Internet is available within his/her area.</p>

<p>Take to your friends house more often. Plug in and play real board games while it updates. I can understand having to pick and choose cable/internet/phone bundle when money is tight.

    <title>Windows 10 Activation After Hardware Change - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthewpierobon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Activation After Hardware Change</h2>
                    Before I upgraded the motherboard (and other parts) on my PC, I guess I didn't sync my local account with my Microsoft account so I cannot activate Windows through a digital license. When I use the troubleshooter and sign in with my Microsoft account I
 can see the PC I am using listed, but when I check the box and click on the Activate button it says "Unable to activate Windows... Try again later". Am I pretty much screwed now that I've already change my hardware without doing this beforehand?

<br />
<br />Select Skype, click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type:

            Hi Ross.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Download and install the latest Power driver from the Lenovo Support Downloads web page for you exact model or Serial Number on sticker on PC.  While there also compare the drivers for chipset, BIOS, Sound, Display, USB, Network LAN and wireless, and all others with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  
<br />
<br />The error is also covered here:  <a href="https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-Yoga-Series-Notebooks/RunDLL-C-ProgramData-Lenovo-IMController-Plugins/td-p/3516822" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-Yoga-Series...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Connectivity issues &#40;bad ones&#41;</h2>
                    

<p>I have a Netgear WRN2000 router and a Xbox 360 S(the newest one). Previously my old(first gen) xbox 360 worked just fine with the router. I have reset and reformatted my router several times. But my Xbox consistently gives me errors,
 from netflix not loading (or ever) to not being able to connect to xbox live(and it doesn’t give me an error code) My connection always has 3 out of 4 bars and I cant hardwire my system do to the length of cable needed. My computer both PC and Mac work wireless
 perfectly with the router. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hey there Schrolls ! Sorry to hear you are having these frustrating connectivity issues. Please give this a try:</p>
<p>Make sure wireless is working</p>
<p>Which wireless option are you using?</p>
<p>Built-in Wi-Fi (Xbox 360 S console) &nbsp; </p>
<p>An external wireless adapter</p>
<p>Built-in Wi-Fi (Xbox 360 S console) &nbsp; </p>
<p>Let's make sure your wireless hardware is working. Here's how: &nbsp; </p>
<p>Press the Guide button on your controller.</p>
<p>Go to Settings, and then select System Settings.</p>
<p>Select Network Settings, and then select the name of your wireless network.</p>
<p>If prompted, enter your wireless password (if required), and then select Test Xbox LIVE Connection. If you receive a connection error, scroll to the bottom of this page and click No.</p>
<p>Note If your are prompted to connect an Xbox 360 Wireless Networking Adapter, then the internal Wi-Fi is not working and the console needs repair. Start the repair process online
</p>
<p>External wireless adapter</p>
<p>Attach your Xbox 360 Wireless Networking Adapter to the back of your console. Learn how
</p>
<p>Note If you have a Kinect sensor and an original Xbox 360 console, use the wireless adapter extension cable to plug the wireless adapter into a USB port on the front of the console. Learn how
</p>
<p>If a network cable is connected to the back of your console, unplug it.</p>
<p>Check the light on the wireless networking adapter:</p>
<p>Green light? You're ready for the next solution. Click No at the bottom of this page.</p>
<p>No green light? Send me a massage.</p>
<p>Not work give this a try:</p>
<p>Reset the network settings</p>
<p>Reset the network settings on your Xbox 360 console to the defaults. Here's how: &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using an external Xbox 360 Wireless Networking Adapter, unplug the adapter from your console.</p>
<p>Press the Guide button on your controller, go to Settings, and then select System Settings.</p>
<p>Select Network Settings.</p>
<p>Select the name of your wireless network.</p>
<p>Select Configure Network.</p>
<p>On the Additional Settings tab, select Restore to Factory Defaults. When prompted, select Yes, Restore to Factory Defaults.</p>
<p>Note &nbsp;This resets the console's network settings only, and not other settings.</p>
<p>Turn off the console.</p>
<p>Plug the wireless networking adapter back into the USB port (if you're using one).</p>
<p>Turn on the console.</p>
<p>Is it still not working:</p>
<p>Restart your network hardware</p>
<p>Turn off your Xbox 360 console and your modem and router.</p>
<p>Wait 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Turn on your modem and wait a minute.</p>
<p>Turn on the next piece of hardware (for example, your router) and wait another minute.</p>
<p>Turn on your console.</p>
<p>Press the Guide button on your controller, go to Settings, and then select System Settings.</p>
<p>Select Network Settings.</p>
<p>Select your wireless network name.</p>
<p>Note &nbsp;If you do not see your wireless network, select Advanced Options. Then select Specify Unlisted Network and enter your wireless network name. Next you'll be prompted to choose the security type.</p>
<p>Enter your wireless network password.</p>
<p>If this solution worked, your console will connect to Xbox LIVE.</p>
<p>Hope this helped. Good luck.</p>

<h2>            Someone signed into my account</h2>
                    <p>So yesterday I tried to open rocket league but I couldn't. There was a notification that said I was already signed in to another console. I just thought my internet was screwing up like it always does. Then after about 30 seconds rocket league opened. I immediately noticed something was wrong when i saw that&nbsp;my car had default wheels on. I then proceeded to check my inventory and all that was there were items that weren't worth hardly anything. So I submitted a request on the rocket league website asking if there was anything they could do. They responded telling me that they couldn't do much about it, but&nbsp;they did tell&nbsp;me I had completed&nbsp;3 trades where I gave someone something&nbsp;and they gave me nothing, and they told me the gamertag of the person I "traded" with. I've&nbsp;never traded with anyone like that before. Then I realized the notification wasn't a problem with my internet and somehow someone was able to log in to my account.

            <p>Yes, absolutely.</p><p><br /></p><p>In case there's confusion, the Bluetooth part in the controller is only for connecting it to a Windows PC. Bluetooth is not used on the Xbox One S, as the console does not actually have a Bluetooth chip.</p><p><br /></p><p>The Xbox One S controller still connects to the console with the same wireless protocol as any standard Xbox One controller.</p><p><br /></p><p>It even works vice versa!&nbsp;You can also connect a regular Xbox One controller to an Xbox One S.<br /></p>

    <title>Black screen after boot in Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martinrinman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black screen after boot in Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Some background story:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've been testing Windows 8 Release Preview since a few months back, it has been working GREAT. Never had any issues.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So today I eagerly bought and installed Windows 8 Pro and everything was fine for about an hour. I started to update a lot of native Modern Apps (xbox music, Photos, weather and such) and that worked well.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then I moved on and started to install my old desktop apps, small programs like dropbox, Ccleaner, Winzip, Winamp and stuff like that.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After installing those programs, which I've had before on the Release Preview,&nbsp; I got this really weird issue where the computer (an Acer Predator with a Nvidia card) started to get error messages, where it said it had to restart because of the issues.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And this happened after about 2 minutes every time after that I had logged in to Win 8.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So then I figured it had to be one of the apps that messed everything up, so I tried to do a System Restore, and choose a restore point from an hour earlire, when I installed the update for the windows apps. The System Restore took a really long time considering
 I had barely installed anything or made any changes to the overall system. <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After the System restore was finished the computer just showed the black screen right after the blue windows 8 logo appears after boot.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can NOT go into Safe mode (I've tried hitting F8 and SHIFT´F8 several times).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I can get to the Bios Boot mode if I press F12.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>At the black screen I can see the cursor and the black screen which flickers between really black and a bit less black :S.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anyone?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've never had any issues like this before either with Windows 7 or 8, so right now I'm really disappointed as I just bought win 8 after testing it out for several months.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Martin<br />

            Hi! <br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
Yes the display turns black after booting. <br />
<br />
I bought Win 8 Pro via the upgrade advisor, so I haven't got an installation DVD or anything to put on a USB. I Did only get the file called WIndows8-Setup.exe.<br />
<br />
So how do I proceed putting the installation disk on a USB?<br />
<br />

            I found this in another post about getting the ISO on USB:<br />
<br />
<p>Hi</p>
<p>Go through the steps in the Upgrade Assistant and when you see the Install Now screen, you will see 3 options.</p>
<p><em><strong>Install by creating media.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Install later.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Select the Install by creating media option.</em></p>
<p>On the next screen, you will see 2 options.</p>
<p><em><strong>USB Flash Drive.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>ISO File.</strong></em></p>
<p>Select the <strong>ISO file</strong> option and click the <strong>Save</strong> button.</p>
<p>Download the ISO file to your <strong>Desktop</strong>.</p>
<p>You can then burn the ISO as an image using your favorite burning software.</p>
<p>This will give you the install DVD for Windows 8.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>_________________</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But as I went through the above steps and downloaded Win8 Pro to a USB, I did that on a different computer from the one I've been trying to install Win 8 on, so it became a 32bit Win 8 Pro version instead of a 64bit version which I need.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So how do I obtain a 64bit version to download??</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And no, I can't obviously download it on the correct computer as everything on that one is broken now.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />

            Hi Martin,
<div>I'm experimenting the same problem with my installation of windows 8:</div>
<div><br />
<div>after I boot up, the screen turn blank,</div>
<div><br />
<div>I manage to make the computer into working again pressing the power button to make the computer into sleep mode and later turn it on.</div>
<div><br />
<div>currently is the only way that I have to get into the PC, but it seems to me that is something related with the video card driver.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Someone ones how to fix the issue for sure?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks,</div>

            Hi Martín.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Thanks a lot.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It works. I just purchased the windows 8 pro. After installed and reboot the screen turn black. So I hate when this happens. So I did your procedures press the power to put the computer to sleep and press it again after couple of minutes and it works.
 I work all night on my laptop to get some work but I got so frustrate when the screen turn black. &nbsp;thanks a million for tour tip.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think is the video card like you say. ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5000 Series I might be not compatible with windows 8, drivers aren't available yet. Wow. This sucks.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi David &amp; Carlos!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about your issues as well. Unfortunately your solution didn't work for me.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went a head and tried my own solution and reinstalled Windows 7. I&nbsp; chose the installation where you keep all your files.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first that didn't work either, I still got the black screen after booting. But now I could go in to Safe mode at least but nothing worked there either, only the Safe Mode text in the corners.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So nothing worked again. So I reinstalled Windows 7 again but this time I chose the installation where you delete everything from C: and now I have a functioning Windows 7 at least.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I'm gonna try to install Windows 8 again, but this time I'm gonna do a clean install.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wish me luck! haha</p>

<p>Now I'm back&nbsp;on Windows 8. </p>

<p>Before I installed it though, I did a USB backup copy of the Windows 8 ISO, the correct 64-bit version.</p>

            Hey Martin&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>How are you? I think I find the problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have CS6 Dreamweaver in my laptop and every time I click on the icon to open it, guess what happen black screen again.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So what I did is. I uninstalled CS6 Dreamweaver and installed back again. And it works. Finally.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did this with all my software re-installed everything in my new windows 8 pro laptop and now is running fine finally.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Good news I restart many times jus to make sure it will not show the black screen and it works.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this new idea works for you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Best regards&nbsp;</div>

            Hi Carlos!<br />
<br />
THanks for your reply. <br />
<br />
I didn't have Dreamweaver when I was experiencing problems. <br />
<br />
Win 8 had been running good now for a few days, but ysterday I experienced a small issue, the same that started my issues at first.<br />
<br />
I got an error message sayign that something Went wrong :(. and that the computer had to be restarted, and then after restart, after about&nbsp; 2 min it crashed again and wanted to do a restart.
<br />
<br />
These errors came after I had installed Avast which is really weird coz I've always used Avast, even during the time I had the Release Preview, with no errors like these.
<br />
<br />
So I uninstalled Avast and it seems to be working ok now. <br />
<br />
I find this really weird as&nbsp; I never had any issues like this with the Release Preview.
<br />

            Hi JIMB_372,<br /><br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor here to help you.<br />You can upgrade to Windows 10 1809 using Windows Update Assistant. You have to download it from : <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=799445" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=799445</a> then run and follow on screen instructions.

            Hi JimB_372
<br />
<br />You can install version 1809 using the method below, or wait approx. 3 weeks, when version 1903 will be released, which would mean you could skip 1809 altogether . . .
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Install Version 1809:
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade .
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />Wait for version 1903
<br />
<br />Keep a watch on this page, and when you see the May 2019 Feature Update appear there, you can click 'Update Now' to go straight to 1903 . . .
<br />

            Hi  JimB_372
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Due to failed attempts it is probably an incompatible driver or software on your PC.
<br />I would recommend doing a clean direct install to 1809 version.
<br />Seems like it might be a lot of work but you will find it will be easier than keep troubleshooting and you get a fresh PC.
<br />See link by Greg on how to do a clean install.
<br />Let me know if you have further questions.

            Thanks for all of the replies.&nbsp; Reply 1 procedure did nothing.&nbsp; For reply 2, I am creating the ISO but do not have time now to install.&nbsp; I will probably wait for 1903 to be rolled out as my computer has been functioning flawlessly with 1803 and I am loath
 to risk messing up something, inadvertently, that is not broken. The process referenced in reply 3, while thorough, seems way to involved and fraught with danger.&nbsp; Your help and knowledge has been appreciated.

            I am still running 1709 on one of my computers and the rest 1803.
<br />You don't have to update and sometimes recommend you don't :)

<h2>            Skype Multiple Accounts - Not recognizing known good PW - Microsoft Acct</h2>
                    <p>I'm attempting to access my Skype account on the Android app.&nbsp; It won't recognize my password despite clearly having just reset it online from the exact Skype name (and Microsoft acct).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if I login using the same gmail email that's associated with the account, it logs into another Skype account (the one I'd like to delete).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then go to change PW and it brings up (switches to) the Microsoft account and Skype account that I want to use and keep! (does this online, not on Skype web application).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I play along &amp; change that password but it still is not recognized by Android app when attempting to log into this same preferred original account by Skype ID.&nbsp; I can log into the bogus unwanted account on the Android app by gmail &amp; that same just updated
 PW, but not the acct. I want, also with same Microsoft PW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You see the runaround I'm stuck in?&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            how to delete retail demo offline content PC 3&#47;15&#47;16</h2>
                    <p>I have tried all the fixes in the other older strings from last year. Even PC search does not come up with this program...just 3 files called retaildemo and are only KB in size not 137MB. I was going to delete the files but left them till I can get rid of
 the program. I simply don't understand how it can be this well hidden. Or what the reason is for hiding it. I installed 10 last year and had issues but resolved them all and this machine had never run better...until a massive update on 3/12/2016. Now I have
 screen freeze and CPU shut downs. SFC/scannow comes up clean. I have run everything else I can think of. This RetailDemo thing has me stumped. Not often I get defeated like this. How the heck do I get rid of this thing.
