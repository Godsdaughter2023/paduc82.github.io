    <title>Mail merge letters into groups - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mail merge letters into groups</h2>
                    <p>I have a list of 500 school students in excel in column headings of name and school.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then have a letter temple to allow each student to receive an individual letter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then mail merge and pass each school a list of letters to pass onto the student addressed to in the letter. Usually done by email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Traditionally, I have simply mail merged all letters into one big document (file) of 500 letters, sorted by school. Then I extracted out each set of school letters into their own document to email onto schools. Usually PDF them first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: Is there a way I can skip the manual tedious procedure of extracting out the 100 or so schools? Ideally, at mail merge stage, instead of creating one document of 500 letters, it creates 100 documents (ie. 100 schools) and in each document there
 are the letters only for that particular school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope I explained that OK. </p>
<p>Cheers<br />

<p>I&nbsp; would suggest that you use the Merge to Individual Documents facility on my Merge Tools Add-in.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8559522c-063d-47c8-abfa-81ee9af1a6c2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8559522c-063d-47c8-abfa-81ee9af1a6c2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>With that facility, you can create a separate pdf file for each student and when you use it, if you select the School Name as the first of the fields to provide the file name of each document that is created (you would need to select a second field that
 would relate to an individual student), then, you can easily select the documents created for the students at each school using the File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Merge Tools Add-in is contained in the MERGE TOOLS ADD-IN.zip file that
 you can download from the following page of my One Drive:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://bit.ly/1hduSCB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>http://bit.ly/1hduSCB</span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span><span>Extract the files from the archive and read the:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>“READ ME –
</span></span><span><span>Setting up and using the Merge Tools Add-in</span></span><span><span>.docx
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>to see how to install and use the various tools.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Using those tools, it is possible to perform the following types of merge that cannot be done with Mail Merge “out-of-the-box”:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merge to e-mail messages either with or without attachments, with the documents created by the merge being sent as either Word or PDF attachments or as the body of the e-mail message.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merge to individual documents in either Word or PDF format with the filenames being supplied by the data in one of the fields in the data source</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Many to One type merges, which can be used for creating documents such as invoices where there are multiple records in the data source that have common data in one of the fields</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging to a document that will include a chart that is unique to each record in the data source</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging a document with Content Controls</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging a document that contains Legacy FormFields</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Duplex Merges</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Merging to a printer that will collate and staple the output created from each record in the data source.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The requirements for using the system are:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>The mail merge main document must be of the Letters type, though that does not mean that the output cannot be sent as an e-mail message where relevant.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For the Many To One, Merge with Attachments and Merge to Individual Docs utilities, the data source may be either a table or query in an Access database, or in the form of an
 Excel worksheet and that worksheet must be the first sheet in the Excel workbook. If the data is on some other sheet, you can easily move that sheet so that it is the first sheet in the workbook by clicking on the sheet tab and dragging it to the left.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For the Chart Merge utility, see the Mail Merging with Charts document that is included in the Merge Tools Add-in Zip file for additional requirements for the data source for use with that utility</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For a data source in the form of an Excel worksheet, the field names must be in the first row of the worksheet and there must be a field name in all of the cells in that row
 that are within the range of columns that contain the data.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>●<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>For both types of data source, the field names must contain only alphanumeric characters (No @,#,$,%,&amp;,(,), etc) and the field names must not start with a numeric character
 (0-9). <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The&nbsp;number of characters in the field names, including spaces, must not be more than 40</span></span></span></span></p>
<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></span>

<h2>            Delete outlook.com alias and create new account</h2>
                    I had an email alias setup on my account.&nbsp; I want&nbsp;the alias&nbsp;to be it's own email account. After I deleted the alias from my account,&nbsp;I tried creating a new account&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;old alias name&nbsp;and it tells me that the name already exists.&nbsp; How long does it
 take for the systems to release before I can create a new account with that name?

    <title>Bing Ads FINAL URL Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bing Ads FINAL URL Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Dear all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With new recent feature from Microsoft Bing. &nbsp;regarding FINAL URL's I have a question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me if there is a way to migrate/move existing ads destinations URL's to Final URL's field without deleting and creating new ads?<br />
<br />
I have a lot of them, and one by one will take me ages, in Bing editor, when I'm updating Ads it creates new one instead of updating Final URL field. &nbsp;in existing ad copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone dealt with this issue already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help and thank you in advance for your time.</p>

<p><span>Good Morning, and Happy Tuesday, Vitalij!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your question! The current method of upgrading Destination URLs to Final URLs with Bing Ads Editor is the best and easiest&nbsp;option available.
 However,&nbsp;in&nbsp;order for the update to apply to existing ad copies instead of creating new ones, an Ad ID column must be present in your spreadsheet.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is a step-by-step process in&nbsp;<a href="https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)">this</span></a>&nbsp;article, under the sub-section

    <title>Phone Scam &#40;Eventvwr&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wng11  say:</h3>
<h2>            Phone Scam &#40;Eventvwr&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I didn't know that phone scams like this still happen but I just received one today and am making a post to share with everyone since the approach was slightly different than normal. It especially comes as a surprise to me since I had just recently bought
 a surface pro 4 and seems to just coincide with my purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received a call from (770) 784-5620, caller ID Grigsby Shelene- the heavily accented man claimed he was from Microsoft and proceeded to tell me that my computer's IP address had been linked to a series of "illegal activities" and that he was on the phone
 with me to show me how I can stop that- that authorities would be contacted if illegal activities continues to happen from my IP address. He asks if I know of such activities and proceeds to rush me to hit the Windows button + R and type in eventvwr.exe&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is when I decided to ask him how he managed to link my computer to my phone number- which he rudely tells me, we have a server that tells us and we got your phone number from it. At this point, I question what my IP address was, whether he can give
 me any means of identifying my particular device- since he's supposed to know and he asks me to pull out a pen and paper (I didn't- though I probably should have so I can share it) to write down a series of numbers and letters. He claims such a number is my
 computer's serial number and it identifies my computer with Microsoft. It's at this point that I hang up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Microsoft customer support and they confirmed that something like this shouldn't happen and that if I had the time, to share my experience on the forums. I noticed that the majority of people who report this scam is told they have a virus- but my
 encounter is very different from those and I wanted the community to know. Hopefully this helps someone who's concerned!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had the same call. &nbsp;I felt it was a scam right off. &nbsp;There was a lot of background static on the call my call id showed the call was coming from California (310) 659-0786. &nbsp;I asked for her name and call return info and she said with an indian accent, "
 my name is Amber Shelton" (or she could have said Shalene) "and I can be reached at (302) 482-8155 ext 3235." &nbsp;I have not attempted to research the number. &nbsp; I suspect they are trying to gain access to my computer as she wanted me to access the computer and
 go to a website. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running an older version of windows and I am using google as my browser. &nbsp;Lately Google says they are no longer supporting my version with updates. &nbsp; Can anyone tell me how I can correct this problem without buying a new operating system and still use
 google? &nbsp;Ugh!</p>

 encounter is very different from those and I wanted the community to know. Hopefully this helps someone who's concerned!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>I had the same call. &nbsp;I felt it was a scam right off. &nbsp;There was a lot of background static on the call my call id showed the call was coming from California (310) 659-0786. &nbsp;I asked for her name and call return info and she said with an indian accent, "
 my name is Amber Shelton" (or she could have said Shalene) "and I can be reached at (302) 482-8155 ext 3235." &nbsp;I have not attempted to research the number. &nbsp; I suspect they are trying to gain access to my computer as she wanted me to access the computer and
 go to a website. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running an older version of windows and I am using google as my browser. &nbsp;Lately Google says they are no longer supporting my version with updates. &nbsp; Can anyone tell me how I can correct this problem without buying a new operating system and still use
 google? &nbsp;Ugh!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>It depends upon how old your "older" version of Windows is. &nbsp;Microsoft doesn't support anything older than Windows 7, so you may be out of luck and a computer. &nbsp;You can try Mozilla Firefox for a browser, but it's odd Chrome is having a problem with your
 computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might try eBay, you can get a desktop there for a reasonable amount and eBay guarantees you will like the product. &nbsp;Sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way these goons are calling with numbers now, masked by "UNKNOWN." &nbsp;I usually will mess with them and rather than hit &lt;Windows Key&gt; + &lt;R&gt;, I key what they tell me into a browser and then tell them Windows 10 won't allow me to run it. &nbsp;Yeah, I know
 it's kind of a lie, but they're lying to me too, telling me they're from Microsoft and probably don't know Windows 10 or if I even have it! &nbsp;They're always at a total loss! &nbsp;"oh . . . sorry" they say and say good-bye. &nbsp;(he-he) &nbsp; ;-)</p>

<h3> cliftonmcneill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovery Nightmare</h2>
                    I create an account for my xbox 1, security measures changed while I was away from gaming for a few months. When I came back on I needed a verification code I did not have. I needed to go to my email account that I had created for this xbox account. I
 couldn't remember my password, so I requested a new one. In order to verify my account it wanted another email account to sent it to. I gave my old and true account and reset my password. Now Microsoft want an additional verification to text me with an old
 phone number I no longer use. Instead I must give info regarding this account that I used soley for gaming. I have composed no messaged, I have received only junk mail I guess. Anywho...it says I have not provided enough info to recover this email account.
 I have spent hours and hours trying to get this account back as I have sunk 100's of hours into a video game that needs me to verify my account. I tried about 6 months ago and gave up. I am trying again as Destiny has come out with awe

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its a web of trust.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>there is no consolidate view of application or tools which MICROSOFT has certified as compatible with IE11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, ALL MS Products are designed and built to work with other MS Products. To keep your MS products installed on your computer, run Windows updates regularly (one a month).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you encounter problems using IE11, then it is most probably a problem caused by a third-party addon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some third-party addons for IE are updated automatically, but for the most part you need to manually check with the vendor for updates from their website.</p>
<p>

    <title>How to Share Master Category List - Shared Calendar - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to Share Master Category List - Shared Calendar</h2>
                    <p>I've read several threads that ask a similar question, but none provided a solution. I'm hoping someone out there can offer resolution that doesn't require:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) purchase of a separate non-Microsoft add-in<br />
b) manual entry of the categories on every profile accessing the calendar</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is this: I created a shared calendar with a very extensive master list of color-coded categories. I shared this calendar. When the two Reviewers open the calendar (they are set to Reviewers and already have "Full Details" available) the calendar
 they are viewing has the details of events, but none of them are color-coded/categorized the way they appear on the calendar I own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already tried updating the data file to update the color categories on all the machines, including my own. All this did was create overlap in the color categories already situated on the main calendar I own. For example, instead of having just the category
 I designated to the event, it now had my custom category/color plus things like "Birthday," "Personal," or "Business" that shared the same color. I spent hours going through and fixing the horrendous mess this supposed fix created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This calendar is meant to be shared with everyone at a company. Dozens of people will have access, so updating each profile with the color-coded master category list manually is not an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference, every profile attempting to access the shared calendar and its color-coded events is using Microsoft Office 2010. I'd greatly appreciate any guidance anyone can offer on how to get everyone the calendar is shared with using the same Master
 Category list I have set up.<br />

    <title>Key for Slingplayer for Windows Mobile 6.5 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Key for Slingplayer for Windows Mobile 6.5</h2>
                    I am trying to reinstall my Slingplayer for Windows Mobile 6.5 which was purchased from Microsoft via my mobile phone.&nbsp; When I try to install the Slingplayer it asks for my key which I never received (the software loaded directly to my phone from the Microsoft
 website after I entered my credit card information). How can I get a copy of my key for Slingplayer?

            <p>I started with Sling and they said to contact Microsoft.&nbsp; The following is from their support web site:</p>
<p><em>You can retrieve your product registration key for most versions of SlingPlayer.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>You are using SlingPlayer for Windows Phone that you purchased from the Windows Mobile Marketplace.</strong> Use the account info that you use with Windows Mobile Marketplace.</em></p>

            That information is probably true if you had purchased and were trying to use slingplayer on a phone that runs the windows phone 7 os, but it doesn't apply or even make sense for a windows mobile device.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You need to contact the support desk and speak or chat with a real support person to see if you can get a license key for the old windows mobile version of slingplayer.<br />

            <p>Sadly, you are stuck between the proverbial rock and hard place. Microsoft issued several warnings by email to&nbsp;impacted users' Live ID email addresses&nbsp;prior to the shutdown
 of the Marketplace that software purchased from the market would be inaccessible for new downloads/installs after the market was shutdown.&nbsp; They recommended you installed all purchased apps before then, and not hard reset the phone afterwards, since further
 installations would be impossible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below&nbsp;is a copy of the email I was sent on March 8th, and April 9th, 2012. (Two more followed on May 2nd and May 21st,
 identical except the market&nbsp;closing date was pushed out to May 17th and then May 22nd, respectively.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Dear Windows Mobile 6.x customer:
</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Microsoft is discontinuing the Windows Marketplace for Mobile service for Windows Mobile 6.x. Please review the details below to familiarize yourself with the changes:</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Windows Mobile 6.x Marketplace Service To Be Discontinued</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Beginning May 9, 2012, the Windows Mobile 6.x Marketplace service will no longer be available. Starting on this date, you will no longer be able to browse, buy or download
 applications directly on your Windows Mobile 6.x phone using the Windows Mobile 6.x Marketplace application and service.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Applications and games acquired from the Windows Mobile 6.x Marketplace service installed on your Windows Mobile 6.x phone will continue to work after the service is
 discontinued on May 9, 2012. However, additional downloads of these applications and games from the Windows Mobile 6.x Marketplace service will no longer be available.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Take Action</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Microsoft recommends you review the applications or games installed on your Windows Mobile 6.x phone and install any available updates in advance of the Windows Mobile
 6.x Marketplace service shut-down on May 9, 2012.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Please note: All phone data, including applications acquired through the Windows Mobile 6.x Marketplace service, data and user-specific settings, will be deleted from
 your Windows Mobile 6.x phone in the event that your phone is wiped or "hard reset." Any data on a removable storage card, if present, will also be deleted if your phone is wiped or "hard reset".</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Windows Mobile applications and games that are compatible with Windows Mobile 6.x may still be available directly from their developers or via third-party marketplaces.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for your continued support of Windows Phone.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>-The Windows Phone Team</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly, I think your only option is to throw yourself on the mercy of Sling, and try to convince them that you are a valid owner of the WinMo version, and see if they'll issue
 you a key for the older (now unsupported) version.&nbsp; Finding the email receipt from the purchase in your Live ID email account might help establish&nbsp;that you&nbsp;legitimately purchased the product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MS did not save copies of the Marketplace software, and is unlikely to be able to help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>

            <p>Thanks for both of your responses and suggestions today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>In response to ToddAllcock:</u>&nbsp; I didn't need the software, only to have it activated and I have proof of purchase by a credit card statement (Sling also confirmed they were aware of my order verbally).&nbsp; Seems to me that even if Microsoft is not supporting
 the software, at least they could provide some means to reactivate, especially since I never got one with the original purchase.&nbsp; Of course I also received the notification of no further support for Windows Mobile but what good does it do if you have phone
 problems that require reinstallation of applications after they stopped support?&nbsp; I've been on the Sling support line twice about the problem and if they were interested in helping me by providing a key for an older version they would have then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>In response to Resourceful:</u> I&nbsp;downloaded and installed the slingplayer for Windows Mobile before I started the hunt for the key.&nbsp; Since it asks if you want to purchase it and tells you how many days are left on the trial every time you start it I
 realized that I needed to get it authorized.&nbsp; I agree that they should authorize the trial to never run out as one solution but I'm not optimistic since they basically cut me off by saying the software is no longer supported (see the end of their support chat
 with Ryan above at 4:08)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again thanks to both of you for the thoughts.&nbsp; I'm looking into other althernatives.</p>

<p><br />
Understood.&nbsp; I agree that Microsoft's handling of this was absolutely terrible.&nbsp; I remember being livid when reading the first email, simply because as a long time Windows Mobile user and fan, I knew it was an absolute rarity that a user didn't have to hard
 reset his WinMo periodically for a variety of issues.&nbsp; Every WinMo device that ever bought an app from the Market&nbsp;became a ticking time-bomb when that Marketplace closed!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Microsoft's WinMo Market was a complete screw-up from the beginning.&nbsp; The biggest issue was the security (or lack of it.)&nbsp; MS used a "security by stupidity" model- the apps themselves had zero security and didn't use activation keys or any
 other&nbsp;sort of encryption.&nbsp; The entire security model was based on the idea that the end-user didn't have access to, (and therefore couldn't distribute illegally) the .cab installer files&nbsp;the apps used.&nbsp; When you installed an app from the Marketplace,&nbsp;the Marketplace&nbsp;app
 dowloaded the .cab to the device, ran it to install it, then deleted the .cab so you couldn't copy it to your PC or any other device.&nbsp; That was the
<strong>entire</strong> security model.&nbsp; It took some folks about 15 minutes after the Market first launched to figure this out, and all anyone had to do to backup their Marketplace purchases was to soft reset the device while the app was installing, before
 the Marketplace app could erase the .cab.&nbsp; There were even hacked versions of the Marketplace app floating around that automatically rebooted the device at the appropriate time preventing the erasure.&nbsp; (The .cab was in a temp folder, so you just had to copy
 it someplace "safe" before re-running the Market app, which would delete the&nbsp;copy in the temp folder upon the next launch of the app.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of this&nbsp;ridiculously insecure&nbsp;"security" model, MS couldn't just throw a copy of every .cab you bought and/or downloaded into your Skydrive when shutting down the Market&nbsp;(like it did with your MyPhone data when they shut down MyPhone) because they'd
 essentially be releasing unprotected copies of developers' commercial software into the "wild".&nbsp; Instead, they took the easy route- a few warning emails telling you to enjoy your last downloads, because you'll never see them again&nbsp;when you need them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If MS cared to have thought this through, they should planned for this with developers ahead of time, and&nbsp;arranged for a "proof of purchase" document of some sort with unique ID codes&nbsp;that end-users could redeem for the developer's non-Market version of
 the apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like the old saying goes, "fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame&nbsp;on me!"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After MS' inept handling of the WinMo Market shutdown, I've made it a personal policy not to purchase any apps costing more than a buck or two from the WP7 Market.&nbsp; Here
 we have history repeating itself, where my WP7 app purchases are only stored in the Marketplace, and I have no ability to keep a "safe" copy on my own PC or Skydrive for installation on future devices, or my existing device after a hard reset.&nbsp; There are already
 several apps (thankfully all free so far, in my case) that I once downloaded, but can no longer access because they were no longer available in the Market for whatever reason after I changed devices or hard reset.&nbsp; I've even lost functionality from existing
 apps.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certainly Sling is under no obligation to provide you with a registration&nbsp;key, but you might try a nicely worded email to&nbsp;someone as far up the food chain at Sling as you can find,&nbsp;explaining the situation, with an attached scan of&nbsp;your credit card statement,
 and ask&nbsp;them if they can't&nbsp;provide you with a free key, could they, in the interest of customer service, at least offer one at a reduced cost.&nbsp; (From Sling's POV, they made less money on you than a "real" customer, since they had to pay MS a 30% commission
 for Market sales.&nbsp; When someone buys the app directly from Sling, Sling collects the whole $30.&nbsp; From a Market purchase, they only collect $21.)&nbsp; Given the choice of collecting a few bucks form a user of an old unsupported app, or no money at all, a savvy
 company might be willing to deal, particularly since you are obviously a customer of Sling hardware, and might take rejection as a good reason to look&nbsp;to a competitor&nbsp;next time you need to upgrade your remote TV streaming hardware. (A fact you might politely
 point out in your email.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make no mistake from my suggestion- I'm not fobbing off blame on the app developers like Sling for this situation.&nbsp; This is all squarely the fault of Microsoft, who gave the middle finger to the users&nbsp;of their prior mobile platform.&nbsp; I'm just being pragmatic,
 since MS won't lift a finger to help you. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certainly&nbsp;Microsoft shouldn't be expected to operate services for a depreciated software platform&nbsp;like WinMo forever, but&nbsp;they didn't&nbsp;kill it as a consumer platform until late 2010.&nbsp; The body wasn't even cold yet, and many people (including myself) are still
 under&nbsp;the two- or three-year cellular contracts they bought their last WinMo device under, while&nbsp;those devices'&nbsp;ecosystem is&nbsp;utterly destroyed&nbsp;around us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And amidst all of this dismantling of the WinMo (and Kin!) ecosystems,&nbsp;MS wonders why Windows Phone 7 wasn't&nbsp;more successful out of the gate.&nbsp; Maybe some folks are waiting to see if the support for the new&nbsp;Windows Phones&nbsp;will be as fickle as it was for&nbsp;MS'
 prior mobile OSes.&nbsp;(And, judging by the fact that no WP7 device will be elligible for an upgrade to WP8, maybe it will be.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to have ranted a bit, but I can't play out a scenario in my head where MS could've handled the end of Windows Mobile worse than they did, except perhaps to have sent killer robots back into the past to eliminate the parents of everyone involved in&nbsp;WinMo's
 development!&nbsp; ;)</p>

                    I have a list of numbered references in my document ([1], [2]..). Now I have cross referenced each of these references. When I &nbsp;right click and change the numbering of a reference and press F9, the cross-referene gets updated. But now I want to sort my
 list so I select the entire list and sort it alphabetically. Now when I select cross-reference and click F9 it says - "Error! Reference source not found.". How do I solve this?

            This issue has been reported with Word 2013 and possibly older Ribbon versions. I think it may not&nbsp; happen in Word 2003 and earlier. If you would not lose critical content/formatting by doing so, you might try saving the document in Word 97-2003 *.doc
 format, doing the sort and updating, then resaving as *.docx.

I am unsure where you got your figures but for Hotmail (now outlook.com)&nbsp; the free mailbox size is 5 gigs and the paid version is 10 gigs.&nbsp;

Dear Neil_S,<br />
<br />
Thank you for responding.&nbsp; My 20GB figure was given over the phone when I called to update my credit card info.<br />
<br />
Regardless, my question is still not answered.&nbsp; Whether I have 2, 5,10 or 20 GB of "available" storage, I want to know how much I am currently "using"?&nbsp; No one is able to tell me.&nbsp; It used to be viewable in Hotmail, before Outlook.com took over.&nbsp; Simple question.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Live Mail contacts can be exported to either a CSV file or a VCF file. If you’re exporting multiple contacts, it is recommended to export it to a CSV file. If you’re exporting one or two contacts, you can export it to a VCF file. Unfortunately, we
 have no option to export Windows Live Mail contacts by categories. You can use the following articles as a reference on how to export and import Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/14031/windows-live-mail-import-export-email-contacts-calendars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Import and export email, contacts, and calendars with Windows Live Mail</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/980534/export-windows-live-mail-email--contacts--and-calendar-data-to-outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Export Windows Live Mail email, contacts, and calendar data to Outlook</a></strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If you want to remove some of the exported contacts, you can edit the CSV file by following the instructions under the
<strong>Edit a .csv file of contacts</strong> section in this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-or-edit-csv-files-to-import-into-outlook-4518d70d-8fe9-46ad-94fa-1494247193c7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.</p>

                    When trying to update Microsoft Essential i got this error&nbsp; Error Code 0x802400 saying that i am not connected but I am connected.&nbsp;
<div>The last thing I did was inserting a flash memory to my Laptop then the screen was black and white squares. I restarted my&nbsp;PC&nbsp;And updated my Microsoft essential i got an error. Then I thought i may got a virus from the flash memory Then full scan on my&nbsp;PC&nbsp;twice
 and got 4 severe viruses(I dont remember their names) I deleted them the second scan found no virus. But I am unable to update my antivirus.&nbsp;Lately&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;uninstall or install any programs or antivirus.</div>

<p>Unfortunately none of the suggested solutions worked. I think I will have to reset. I cant even add an account as that command is also not working. I can't run any command or use windows+R as that throws up an error too.</p>

            <p>Hi...I give you a 50-50% chance that a 'Reset' will work...I know if you change the user account it will fix it but that is not a great solution...</p>
<p>I did my brothers computer a couple weeks ago with similar issues with the 'start menu'&nbsp; I had to do a 'Clean install' which would be the 'Custom Install' option</p>
<p>You could also try a 'Re-install' by running the ISO using the 'Setup' option </p>

                    <p>I've just upgraded to the latest version of Excel 2013 64-bit (on Windows 7) and I've found a bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">When Excel loads, instead of reading the registry value HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\15.0\Common\UI Theme to get the selected UI Theme, it writes 0 to it, resetting the theme to white for all Office applications.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">The fault can be reproduced by :</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><ol>
<li><span>Setting the UI theme to another value from another Office application.</span></li><li><span>Opening Registry Editor and observing the registry value.</span></li><li><span>Opening Excel - it opens with the white UI theme.</span></li><li><span>Refreshing Registry Editor - the value is reset to 0.</span></li></ol>
<p class="contentStandard">I haven't tried this on another installation yet, but might find time to do this tomorrow. My previous version was probably about a year old, so this might not be a new bug.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">It looks like someone wrote the value to the registry instead of reading from it.</p>

<p>In fact, it was quite another problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the upgrade, Office was connected to my domain account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the upgrade, Office tried to connect to my Microsoft account with an incorrect password (Office was installed on the machine before I joined the domain).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behaviour (storing the UI theme with the Office user account) is documented, but not intuitive.</p>

<h3> rpay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Formula - Calculate Only to Certain Amount &#40;Figure Ceiling&#41;</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I a have a two tiered calculation that I am looking to do. The number applies a certain percentage up to a certain base amount and then applies a different one to anything past that. For example: $10-200 applies 0.1% for each dollar added and anything
 past $200 applies at 0.2%. If a certain dollar figure is input, I need to find the right amount added.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have done this before with a single tier/surcharge rate, but never with two. I have set up two tables for the data and have a third to add them together.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The upper table I have functioning properly with a sumif function added to make sure negative numbers are excluded, but the lower table still needs work. For example, if I had a dollar figure of $300, it is applying 0.1% on the whole $300, not just the
 first $200. When added with the 0.2% on the $100 past that, it is far too high.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I set up a limit on the one table so it only calculates to amount?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>
                </div>

<br />
There are many ways.&nbsp; Two simple ways, assuming the amount (e.g. $300) is in A1:<br />
<br />
=A1*0.1% + MAX(0,A1-200)*0.1%<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
=MIN(200,A1)*0.1% + MAX(0,A1-200)*0.2%<br />
<br />
In the first formula, note that the second 0.1% is 0.2%-0.1%; that is, the difference between the two pecentage rates.<br />
<br />
Whatever formula you use, you probably want to round to the penny.&nbsp; For example:<br />
<br />
=ROUND(MIN(200,A1)*0.1% + MAX(0,A1-200)*0.2%, 2)<br />
<br />
Formatting to 2 decimal places alone rounds the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
displayed</span> value, but not the underlying <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
actual</span> value.&nbsp; Leaving the actual value unrounded might cause problems later on, e.g. with sums of columns of such values.<br />
<br />
PS:&nbsp; Note that this will charge $0.01 to amounts as low as $5.&nbsp; Do you really need to limit the 0.1% rate to $10 or more arbitrarily.&nbsp; Or did you choose $10 as a lower limit simply because 10*0.1% is 0.01?<br />

    <title>Outlook not sending bulk emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iwal45  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook not sending bulk emails</h2>
                    I have two computers running Office 2010.&nbsp; In the one computer Outlook will send bulk emails from a Word merge.&nbsp; On the other computer Outlook gives the message that it doesn't recognize the email addresses. I'm not sure if something is configured differently
 in Outlook in the computer that gives the error message.&nbsp; I am using the same Access query via a Word merge process&nbsp;on both computers to do bulk emails.&nbsp;It &nbsp;works in one and not in the other. &nbsp;Any help greatly appreciated.

<p>
</p><p>The email type is IMAP. Tried creating a new profile.&nbsp; Followed the wizard in a new sample mail merge,&nbsp; Same result.&nbsp; The message that is displayed in a pop up box is: Check Names.&nbsp; Microsoft does not recognize the email addresses.&nbsp; No suggestions.</p>
<p>If I copy the email addresses to an Excel document and save it and use that document as the source document for the email merge, Outlook sends the emails.&nbsp; I may have to resort to that method in the short term until a solution is discovered.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Also followed Doug Robins post and down loaded his add-on, but had same results.&nbsp; I am a novice at doing this so I may be missing something.&nbsp; I appreciate everyone's time and effort</p>
