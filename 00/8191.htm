<h2>            Windows does not require a password after wake up from sleep</h2>
                    <p>Hey!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any one else noticed this security flaw?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened a few times now, I put the PC to 'sleep' and the next day (like 8 hours later and normally when I get a calendar reminder) the PC wakes up and logs straight in to the desktop - no password needed and without me toughing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UPDATE: I have narrowed this down to one setting (Sign-in options -&gt; Require sign-in), if this is set to anything other than 'Every Time' then you are never asked to enter a password after you wake the PC from sleep.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Envy, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of the Windows 10 Technical Preview. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Have you set any password on the account?</p>
<p>2. Which build is currently installed on the computer?</p>
<p>3. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to putting the computer to sleep?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Build 10162</strong> is the latest build from us. If you have not updated to the latest build then I would request you to do so and check if you find that flaw.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also request you to check the Event Viewer logs to find anything suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>a:</strong> Press <strong>Windows key +X.</strong></p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: Then click <strong>Event Viewer. </strong></p>
<p><strong>c:</strong> Then click <strong>Windows logs</strong> and then <strong>
System.</strong></p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Jessen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick response :o)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes the PC is password protected using a Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently using build 10162</p>
<p>
</p><p>No changes were made to the PC before it was put to sleep. Also worth mentioning that any other time&nbsp;the PC is put to sleep and woken (up at my request) it&nbsp;insists on a password or PIN entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had a look thru the Event viewer but can not see any obvious anomalies.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I do not have an Ethernet adaptor :o) ... only a wireless one (I have a hybrid laptop/ tablet)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides I have no issue with the PC waking up to display reminders etc, the issue I have is it going straight to the desktop bypassing security/ passwords etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On windows 8.1 the PC would wake up at the login screen and display the reminder, then after about 30 seconds go back to sleep.</p>

            <p>Hey Max!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have just raised a feedback on this, but also have more to add...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would appear that, in my opinion, the reminder is not the issue. I have just put the computer to sleep using both the power button on the PC and the start menu. In both cases when you wake the PC it goes straight to the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I select sleep from the start menu when I wake the pc it goes straight to the desktop and the start menu is still open but does not work. I have to click the start button to get it to disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also left the PC for 30 mins between each attempt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone else replicate this, or is it just me :o/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed this build (10162) from the ISO on an external drive. I original upgraded from 8.1 but there were so many problems (including not being able to access the internet) so I thought I would start a fresh :o)</p>

    <title>Nokia Music manager just isn&#39;t very good - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> planetf1---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Music manager just isn&#39;t very good</h2>
                    I have ~4000 music tracks in AAC format uner iTunes management.<br />
<br />
I also have a 2Gb card in my Nokia N80, so figured I'd use it to store some music except that on attempting to use NMM<br />
a) The interface is very clunky<br />
b) There is no way to "allocate" a fixed amount of storage for the sync - it only looks at free space<br />
c) It doesn't understand iTunes playlists<br />
d) Every attempt at syncing caused NMM to exit<br />
<br />
Is NMM a serious piece of software?<br />
<br />
As an alternative I found an excellent piece of software called iTunes sync which does all of this &amp; more. This is the kind of quality I'd expect from Nokia, not the (sorry) rubbish that NMM appears to be.<br />
<br />
Is there a plan to make NMM usable for iTunes users?

<br />
It just doesn't work very well unfortunately, and I'd love something that worked with iTunes.<br />

Where did you get this 'itunes sync' from?<br />

It's *very* good. Ok not perfect (aac+ conversion would be good) but it does the job IMO. It is also FREE.<br />

NMM - what is that all about!

    <title>Mouse acting strange in Outlook since release1802 Build 9029.2167 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mouse acting strange in Outlook since release1802 Build 9029.2167 Click to run.</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the latest release version 1802 Build 9029.2167 Click to run, I have been getting weird things happening with my mouse. After I got the new release clicking links in emails stopped working. I tracked down a fix for that where you change this reg key:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changed its Default string value to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>htmlfile</p>
<p>
</p><p>After re-booting the PC that got links back working again, however I have also noticed that it randomly seems to double-click when I only single click. I don't know if it's office or the mouse, but I noticed it since this new version installed so I think
 it's an issue in Outlook. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's particualrly annoying when you do a drag of multiple emails from the inbox to a saved folder and instead of doing the drag it opens all the emails I have selected to drag. It gets old VERY quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please could you look into this as it's driving me mad!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also noticed a command windows flashes up and disappers every now and again.&nbsp; The screen disappears too quickly to see what the command window is running but I know we had this before in a previous release of Office 2016 and I cannot remember what
 a) caused it and b) what the fix was.</p>

<h2>            When sending emails a pop up appear. Error message&#58; &#34;This content cannot be displayed in a frame...&#34;</h2>
                    Original Title: How do I get rid of box that pops up when I try to send or reply to email in Outlook? When I try to send a message a box pops up with a red cross saying 'this content cannot be displayed in a frame'<br />
<br />
I can access my email account and received messages but when I try to reply or send a message a box immediately pops up with a red cross in the corner saying 'This content cannot be displayed in a frame.&nbsp; To help protect security of information you enter into
 this website the publisher of this content does not allow it to be displayed in a frame.'&nbsp;&nbsp; It also says 'what you can&nbsp; try' which when clicked opens a new page which says ' something went wrong and we can't sign you in at this moment.&nbsp; Please try again later.'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I can sign in though.&nbsp;&nbsp; I found a reply to another forum member and did everything suggested - resetting Explorer 9,&nbsp; clearing history, disabling pop-ups, etc. but the problem persists.&nbsp; Can anyone please help me?&nbsp; Rena

            Hi, Vivien M.&nbsp; thank you for responding.&nbsp; I do not have the problem on a tablet running Android.&nbsp; That is working normally so it is only when I try to respond by either clicking reply on a received message or create a new message form and start to type
 the recipient address that the box pops up with the offending message.&nbsp; I assume therefor it is perhaps an Explorer 9 settings problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I read and followd the steps posted to another person yesterday by reloading Explorer 9 and blocking add-ons&nbsp; etc. but
 the problem remains.&nbsp;

            Other Insiders have reported the same problem and I don't think there is a solution for this, but have you tried removing the Pin, restarting your system, then assigning a Pin again?

<p>Hi Martin,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have never used the Kindle Fire but I do use a program called Shareit on my Windows Phone and my Surface Booh2 as well as my Surface Pro4. It is an amazing program for transferring files and photos, I would not use another since I found this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can get it for your phone in the Windows Phone store and for your Kindle, it can be found here (I believe).</p>
<p><a href="http://shareit-download.net/shareit-for-kindlefire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://shareit-download.net/shareit-for-kindlefire/</a></p>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if there is any function that allows me to calculate PERCENTILE of all positive and negative numbers, but treating all numbers as positive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I can create a new sheet within the workbook, and convert all negative to positive, but by doing that I am increasing a file size massively (as I have over 15000 of readings per column, and there are 30 columns)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any function for that ???</p>

            If you use the ABS function it will turn a negative number into a positive.

    <title>In Excel 2010 images aspect ratio is locked and do not move or resize - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> forgedanvil  say:</h3>
<h2>            In Excel 2010 images aspect ratio is locked and do not move or resize with cells, opening up in Excel 2013 the images change size &#40;aspect ratio&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a company logo placed in the top left corner of over 30 worksheets in a *.xlsm Excel 2010 file. All worksheets are set at 100% zoom.&nbsp;Each sheet has slightly different row heights and column widths. All logo images have properties with aspect ratio
 locked and do not move or size with cells. Opening up in 2007, 2010 everything is fine, the images do not resize and as I move&nbsp;through each worksheet&nbsp;the logo image is always in the same place.&nbsp;If the file is saved as .xls and opened up in Excel 2003 or 2002
 there are also no issues with the images resizing.</p>
<p>When opening this file in Excel 2013 all images are resized based on the column width and row heights of each worksheet. When moving through each worksheet all logos are not the same.</p>
<p>I have attempted to resize all logo images in Excel 2013 and position them in the exactly the same X-Y position across all worksheets. Again, all images are have their aspect ratios locked and set to do not move or size with cells. Work well in Excel 2013
 if I close and re-open the workbook. However when opening in Excel 2010 all images aspect ratios are changed!</p>
<p>This behaviour in Excel 2013 is not the same as previous version and should be the same as previous versions. As our company uses many different version of Excel (2002, 2003, 2007, 2010 and 2013) we need this behaviour to be the same across all versions
 or t least 2007 through 2013.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>The image format is a .jpg file</p>

<p>The workbook contains macros. The image&nbsp;was inserted using ribbon Insert &gt; Picture (for the first image) then copy and paste across each worksheet.</p>

            <p>It was probably a good idea that you came in to answer the posed question, as there has been a lot of publicity in certain quarters of late trying to tell people that Microsoft included a 'keylogger' that captures keystrokes and&nbsp;gains the information one
 types&nbsp;in Windows Technical Preview. A lot of people even on the ##windows channel on IRC were coming into the channel and saying the same thing, whilst others were of course refuting it and endeavouring to explain the situation. Certain people were literally
 freaking out left, right and centre.</p>

    <title>Bluetooth driver changed from one that worked to one that does not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raobennett  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth driver changed from one that worked to one that does not work now by Windows 10 TP 9926 automatically &#40;without asking first&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10 Technical Preview 9926 on a mid-2011 iMac with BootCamp. &nbsp;I had some problems with Bad_Pool_Header error and Driver_Verifier_IOManager_Violation error. &nbsp;Those errors were solved with a Refresh of the OS. &nbsp;However, now my blue boot
 menu is gone. &nbsp;I no longer have the choice of starting the Preview, Rolling Back, or selecting the choice for troubleshooting. &nbsp;That's kind of frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, what's worse is that while in an admin account just after the Refresh, the OS loaded a Bluetooth extension all by itself. &nbsp;I saw the icon in the System Tray on the right. &nbsp;Seconds later, before I could do anything, the Bluetooth mouse and the Bluetooth
 keyboard stopped working. &nbsp;THEY WERE WORKING JUST FINE BEFORE; WHY DID THE OS ESSENTIALLY BREAK THEM?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, of course, I cannot control the computer at all. &nbsp;There is no way to input anything now. &nbsp;What can I do to get my mouse and keyboard working again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I am on an iMac, I do have access to OS X and the BOOTCAMP volume. &nbsp;If correcting what happened is a matter of finding the right file and putting in the right directory in the BOOTCAMP volume, then I can easily do that. &nbsp;Is that possible?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the frustration, but please be rest assured that I am here to assist you with your concern and guide you in the right direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to very unique as Refreshing the Operating System has removed required services from Boot Camp.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the Boot Camp partition removed completely?</li><li>Are you able to use the mouse and the keyboard when on MAC Operating system?</li></ol>
<p>One way to retain the Windows 10 is to install Windows 8.1 Operating System on the Boot Camp, update the device drivers and then upgrade to Windows 10. But, since this issue seems to be more complicated, it will need a better level of expertise to work on
 the issue. I suggest you to please post this question with the detailed issue description in the TechNet forums link as given below for better assistance.

</p><p>Answers</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;The Boot Camp partition is still there and everything that is supposed to be there for the OS is there, except any Apple drivers from Boot Camp. &nbsp;I can boot up Windows 10 Technical Preview 9926 to the point of the clock in the bottom left corner and
 the restart/shut down button on the right bottom corner. &nbsp;Clicking this desktop gets one to the login screen in the normal case. &nbsp;I can't get there, because the drivers that the OS now has don't work with the Bluetooth keyboard and Bluetooth mouse. &nbsp;I am completely
 cut off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;Oh yes. &nbsp;I can use the mouse and the keyboard on the OS X side. &nbsp;(I would have mentioned that if I could not.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will follow your advice and post my problem in the TechNet forum.</p>

            I gave up trying to fix my Refreshed version of Windows 10 TP 9926 on the iMac. &nbsp;I couldn't find any solution short of erasing the existing BOOTCAMP partition, downloading new Boot Camp drivers with the Boot Camp Assistant on the Mac side, partitioning
 new space for a BOOTCAMP volume, and installing the 64-bit version of Windows 10 TP 9926. &nbsp;I will have to install some software for my wireless printer, some browsers, and Office 2013 Professional, but that should be pretty easy compared to what I have gone
 through these last 2 days.

<h2>            Changing display name is not working in Sharepoint Online</h2>
                    
<p>hello,</p>
<p>we have a user who wanted his display name changed. we have synchronized setup, so i changed his display name in ad onprem. after dirsyncing the new display name could be seen in exchange and skype online, but in sharepoint we still see the old display name.
 in his onedrive alle the files is showing the old display name as creator/owner but the new display name is shown in about me/profile in the upper left corner. when i as tenant administrator open his sharepoint profile the display name shows the new value.
 pleas see attached screendump.</p>
<p>i have tried with powershell for sharepoint online , but set-spouser command doesn't provide access to the same attributes as set-spuser on our old onprem sharepoint used to.
</p>
<p>it is important to be able to change display names as users get married or divorced or they just want to use or hide a middle name.</p>
<p>can you help us, please.</p>

<p>I have just logged on to OneDrive as the affected user, and today the name in the left menu is shown correctly. Maybe it just took some time to replicate between your servers. Or maybe you fixed it somehow?</p>

<h2>            Is Windows Update an accident waiting to happen&#63;</h2>
                    <p>There's been lots of concern expressed on this forum about the enforced update policy that MS is introducing for non-security updates/features and the likelihood of forced updates causing business users real problems if the update/feature bricks or cripples
 their systems.&nbsp; See the article in the following link:</p>

</p><p>http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/opinion/software/microsoft-cloaks-the-details-of-windows-10-updates-3620244/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will the imposition of forced non-security updates/features (and a lack of information about what updates actually contain) deter you from migrating to Win 10?

    <title>Account locked after Microsoft failed to provide security code - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Account locked after Microsoft failed to provide security code</h2>
                    <p>I decided to change my account password. I use phone as a two-step verification so i was said that verification code will be sent to my number. After waiting for some time i tried to repeat the process but message didn't arrive the second time. Fed up i
 changed phone number. The verification code arrived in the matter of seconds. I entered it and was informed that for my account is locked for 30 days without explanation why. Funny thing is that moments later i received a message to my first number telling
 me that "someone is replacing blah blah blah". So it's obvious that i can receive messages to both numbers but Microsoft is technically unable to send a message. Big surprise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know why something as trivial as changing password is turned into spy thriller and what purpose does this 30 day lock down serve. Also why would i want to return to Microsoft after this circus?</p>

<p>My understanding is the 30 day waiting period can<strong> not </strong>be waived.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What should I know about the 30-day waiting period?</strong></p>
<p>Even when you choose to delete your out-of-date security info, MS don't fully remove it for 30 days. This waiting period helps to deter hackers from updating your security info and gaining access to your account without your knowledge.
</p>
<p>After 30 days, the user of the account will be able to access the security settings and update his/her preferred information.</p>
<p><strong>But the waiting period doesn't mean you're locked out of your Microsoft account.

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>in mucking around with fonts on my mac I may have accidentally deleted some Microsoft fonts. I've got them all back out of trash and kept them in a special folder on my desktop. I'm wondering where I should put them?</p>

            <p>That's strange. May be you don't have Administrator's privileges in your user account?</p>

            <p>There's a folder for that:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>YourHardDisk</em>/Library/Fonts/Microsoft. You may need to use the Finder's
<em>Go</em>&nbsp;in the main menu bar. If you don't see the Library folder, press Option before selecting
<em>Go </em>in the menu bar. Note there is one user library (<em>YourHomeFolder</em>/Library) and another at the top level of the hard disk, which is the one you want.</li></ul>
<p>Otherwise, you can always run the Office installer and do a Custom install to install just the Office fonts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note 1: As a matter of fact, you can drop the fonts in any of those two library folders. If you place them in a user library, they'll be available only to that user. If you drop then in the top-level library, they'll be available to any user of the computer.
 However, it's better to keep them in their original Microsoft folder, which also makes them available to all users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note 2: You can double click on them and the Font Book application will open and let you decide where you want them installed (for all users or for the current user). But this does not allow for adding them to a folder (namely, "Microsoft").</p>

    <title>Outlook 2016 Contacts - Several Folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yok33  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2016 Contacts - Several Folders</h2>
                    <p>In my Outlook 2016, when I go into the People (contacts) view, it shows that I have SEVERAL different contact folders.&nbsp; Of which I would only like to keep and use two of them.&nbsp; So my questions are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How do I remove the unwanted folders from showing up in my Outlook 2016 People?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Is there a way to designate the first desired contact fold that I would like to use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. How do you set up Outlook 2016 so that when I am typing in the "To:" of an email it will automatically finish the address if it finds it in my People (Contacts) Folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please let me know as soon as someone can.&nbsp; I am getting very frustrated with Outlook due to these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you ahead of time,</p>

<br />1. How do I remove the unwanted folders from showing up in my Outlook 2016 People?
<br />
<br />2. Is there a way to designate the first desired contact fold that I would like to use?
<br />
<br />3. How do you set up Outlook 2016 so that when I am typing in the "To:" of an email it will automatically finish the address if it finds it in my People (Contacts) Folder?
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Re: #1 - How many different email accounts are configured in this profile and do the contact folders you're referring to belong to individual email accounts? If the answer to the latter question is yes, then the answer to your question is "You can't remove the folders" since those would be standard Outlook folders that cannot be deleted. This would be applicable if you have multiple Outlook.com/Exchange accounts configured in the profile.
<br />
<br />Re: #2 - you need to set the data file containing the desired contact folder as the "default data file" for the profile 
<br />Go to File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab
<br />
<br />Re: #3 - What you're referring to is the auto-complete cache when entering a value in the To/CC/Bcc field which is completely separate and distinct from your contact folders. The auto-complete cache contains the email addresses of the recipients to whom you have sent messages and does not search any contact folder/address book

<br />
<br />#2 - Also, for the auto complete cache can you tell me where I need to turn it on so that it will work for me?
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />In reverse order to get the easy question out of the way first, info on the auto-complete cache is contained in the following article. Scroll down the page for "How to enable the AutoComplete feature"
<br />
<br />Information about the Outlook AutoComplete list

<br />
<br />Now as far as all your contact folders go, the first suggestion I would make to better follow along is to set your Outlook Navigation Pane to "Full Folder" view by pressing CTRL+6. That will show each data file in your profile and the folders contained in each of them.
<br />
<br />From the screenshots
<br />
<br />#1 - You have several contact folders with the designation "This Computer Only" which means that these are created in the folder tree for an IMAP account. One of those folders named (Contacts - This Computer Only), means that the first email account configured in this profile is an IMAP account. That folder can't be deleted from within Outlook (exception to this will be noted later on)
<br />
<br />#2 - You have countless PST files for &lt;yokum @ npquality......&gt;. Not sure what that's all about or if you need all those files given that they seem to have the same name. A little more explanation regarding that is in order. Aside from that, one of those PST files is set as the "default data file" which is where your default contact/calendar folders are stored 
<br />
<br />#3 - You have a number of iCloud contact folders so that would mean you were or are still using iCloud which would have its own contact folder(s).
<br />
<br />So the real question now becomes, which contact folder(s) do you actually want to keep? Answer to that will dictate what you ultimately have to do but some background info regarding contact/calendar folders is in order
<br />
<br />a) An PST file that has a "Contact" folder in it means that it's from a prior installation where it was previously set as the "default data file" in the profile. That folder cannot be removed from within Outlook. If you need all those PST files, then you will need to keep all the contact folders. (Note: if you're quasi technically inclined, those folders can be removed using a tool called MFCMapi but will leave that for another post)
<br />
<br />b) The first email account configured in an Outlook profile sets the associated data file for that account as the "default data file" which is where the default contact/calendar folders are stored. Every subsequent POP3/Imap account added will not have any contact/calendar folders in the folder tree for that account, instead using the default contact/calendar folders.
<br />
<br />So how to clean this all up...................
<br />
<br />#4 - First decide what you need and don't need in this profile by way of data files
<br />
<br />#5 - You have one PST file set as the default already, so logic would dictate that this is where you would want to keep your contact data. If that's the case, make sure to copy all the contact you want/need from all the other folder to the contact folder in this folder tree. (you can't set the iCloud data file as the default for the profile - that's managed by the iCloud addin)
<br />
<br />#6 - If you don't want any contact folders in your IMAP folder tree and you have everything copied over that you need, then remove the IMAP account from the profile and then re-add it. Since you already have a PST file set as a default data file, the IMAP folder tree won't have any contact folders unless you create them yourself at some point in the future.
<br />
<br />Going to stop here to give you a chance to review all of this and determine the answers to the questions posed regarding what you need and don't need in the existing Outlook profile. Once done, ask any additional questions you may have.

    <title>How to make column headers of structured table refer to a different - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevin-r-a  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to make column headers of structured table refer to a different cell&#63;</h2>
                    I've created structured tables in Excel and would like some of the column headers to update to show the content of cells in a different worksheet. The structured table column headers don't seem to accept any kind of formula, however. Is that just not possible,
 or is there some trick I could use? My goal is to have a template that others can use, where they can enter the names of items in one worksheet and then have structured tables in other worksheets with column headers showing those item names (instead of showing
 "Item 1", "Item 2", etc. for column headers). Any suggestions would be appreciated.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>the column headers of an Excel Table object cannot be formulas, sorry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on your situation you may want to insert a row above the table, use a formula in that row and hide the table header row. You will not be able to use the sort and filter drop-downs with this workaround, though, and if you want to reference the table
 cells with structured referencing, you will still need to use the correct table headers from the hidden row.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi sivakrishnaa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I invite you to soft reset the phone following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the phone&gt;go to settings&gt;date+time&gt;and switch the date+time to manual if it is on automatic</p>
<p>Press and hold the Volume Down Volume down button and Power Power button buttons at the same time until you feel a vibration (about 10–15 seconds). Your phone will restart automatically.
</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<p>• Sometimes your phone will vibrate right away when you press the Volume Down Volume down button and Power Power button buttons—this is probably due to your ringer changing to Vibrate. Wait to release the buttons until a second vibration after 10–15 seconds.
<br />
• If you don't let go of the Volume Down Volume down button and Power Power button buttons right after the vibration at 10–15 seconds, your phone may show a black startup screen and not restart normally. If this happens, just repeat the button combo to try
 again. </p>
<p>(The date and time may be incorrect after soft resetting your phone, which can cause issues when you try to sign in with your Microsoft account. To set the time correctly, go to Settings Settings icon &gt; Date + time.)
</p>
<p>If this does not work, Back up your stuff in settings&gt;back up. You can also connect the phone to your PC and use either file explorer(drag and drop) to save your content&nbsp;or the Windows Phone app to sync some of the contents to the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then reset the phone in settings&gt;reset. Make sure to have a good charge on the phone before you start.</p>

</p><p>I love OneNote and have introduced its use within several companies...yet the lack of a sort feature has been a huge source of contention. The workflows established in most environments require the most recent email to appear at the top of the page. It is
 a huge waste of time for users to scroll to the bottom of each page to review an email. &nbsp;Is this feature in the roadmap?</p>

<h2>            How do I create a pivot table of several columns combined&#63;</h2>
                    I'm trying to create a report of how many times each value in an entire worksheet is repeated.&nbsp; The data does not need to be organized by column or row.&nbsp; I figured out how to do it for one column, but if I try to make a PivotTable for more than one column
 of data it becomes an unintelligible mess.&nbsp; I want to be able to just select the whole range of data and have it give a report of each value and the number of times it was repeated (from 1 to whatever).

    <title>Litigation Hold &#58; hundreds of mailboxes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Litigation Hold &#58; hundreds of mailboxes</h2>
                    
<p>I have a customer who &nbsp;has been migrated &nbsp;to another tenant. &nbsp;When they existed on the original tenant they had litigation hold enabled - so all data upto the migration point is available in the original tenant.</p>
<p>They require all this data to be preserved and exported to external media. &nbsp;Is there a better solution than performing an ediscovery search on each mailbox and exporting to a pst ?</p>
<p>There are several hundered &nbsp;mailboxes</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Martyn Hewitt,<br />
<br />
I understand that you want to migrate all the data that is hold in the previous Office 365 tenant to a new tenant. Based on my research, exporting the data files into PST files using eDiscovery search will be the only way to achieve your requirement. You need
 to run the eDiscovery search for each mailbox one time.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang</p>

            Open System Preferences &gt; Account/ User's &amp; Groups in Lion<br />
Select Login Items.<br />
Delete all Microsoft Database daemons.<br />
When you launch Outlook it will launch the new version.<br />
<br />
The actual file is located here. It should be version 14.2.2<br />
