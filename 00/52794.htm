<p>Uninstall the game, then turn off your wireless connection. Then reinsert disc, and download it. With no wireless connection it should only take 25 min to install. After installation is done, reconnect your wireless connection and allow for updates to finish.
 This should allow you to enter multiplayer without it recycling through the loading period over and over.</p>

<h2>            When using handwriting input, all the words I write are underlined</h2>
                    <p>I'm writing in Word, latest updates, and I was using my stylus to write but everything I wrote with the stylus is underlined. Not red or blue, like ctrl+U underlined. I can't change it using the underline button; the only way I can fix it is by deleting
 the text and retyping it with my keyboard.</p>

<h2>            User names found using run command &#34;control userpasswords2&#34; don&#39;t match my user accounts</h2>
                    Hello, On Computer #4, When I use the run command I get a list of 4 users. A,B,C&nbsp;and Guest.
<br />
When I look into control panel I see 4 users, A,C,D and Guest. <br />
When I go to C\:Users I see B,C,D and Guest.<br />
I'm having problems networking with this computer#4, I get access denied, Check spelling..., error code 0x8007005.<br />
Shouldn't all these accounts match in computer#4?<br />
<br />
On my other 3 computers that can network with each other the run command results, control panel results, and&nbsp; C:\User results all match and are A,C,D and Guest same as is seen in control panel of computer #4.<br />
<br />
I think the problem is in computer #4 and is related to the mismatched user names/accounts. The 4 computers user&nbsp;accounts all match in Control Panel, so the problems not there.
<br />
<br />
Do you think this networking problem is related to the mismatch I describe? How can I remedy this?&nbsp;&nbsp; TIA Don<br />

<br />
I finally figured it out. It was all related to the User names that came up when I ran the "control userpasswords2" command. As I stated in my initial post, the user names in all the control panel&nbsp; user&nbsp;names&nbsp; on all the computers matched. The only mismatch
 I had was within the list of user names in the list found when I ran "control userpasswords2". I went to&nbsp;highlight account "B" after I ran the command, clicked properties,&nbsp;&nbsp;and changed its name to "A". This solved my access denied problem once and for all.
 Apparently it's not enough to have all the accounts match in control panel.<br />

<p>I can't wait for the different kinds of costumes and the co-op. It looks like Volition has really improved on both of these and it seems there's going to be a lot of clothing options available to the player. I love the idea of starting out "at the top",
 instead of working our way up from nothing like in the previous two games. Actually, the GTA series had that same feel &nbsp;so I can't wait to see what they do with this concept.

    <title>Monitors will not wake from sleep mode&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robmass_18  say:</h3>
<h2>            Monitors will not wake from sleep mode&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading to Windows 10 from Windows 7, I have an issue with my computer sleeping. If I make the computer sleep, I can wake it using the keyboard and mouse. I can tell that it's awake because I hear the fan running. However, the computer does not send
 signals to my two monitors to wake in response. When this happens, I have to manually turn off my computer and then turn it back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my device drivers, particularly the one for graphics card, are up to date. I'm not sure what the issue is. As a temporary "fix," I've simply stopped making the computer sleep. But I'd rather not keep doing this. I'm a conservative person, and I like
 to save power when I can.</p>

            <p>Hi support,</p>
<p>My keyboard is set up to allow "wake from sleep."&nbsp; That was not sufficient though, also had to go to bios and enable usb devices to wake from sleep since I have a usb keyboard and mouse.&nbsp; Doing this caused all sorts of problems including BSOD with "driver_power_failure"
 message on one occasion.&nbsp; In all cases though, the graphics card never woke up.&nbsp; This whole waking from sleep situation seems to be a BIG problem with Win 10 making this OS non-viable if it can't be fixed quickly.&nbsp; Also had problems with my external Netgear
 WNA3100 usb&nbsp;wireless adapter not awakening from sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP!</p>

            <p>I have this problem too. &nbsp;But I don't think it's a windows 10 issue. &nbsp;I think it's a bad graphics driver that is being pushed out as an optional update in 'windows update'. &nbsp; Uninstalling and reinstalling the driver does not work, it just keeps putting the
 same bad driver on my machine. &nbsp; Rollback driver does not work either, when the new driver is installed, it kills the old driver files. &nbsp; Restore is also not a viable option, it can't find the old driver. &nbsp;This is one of those situations where it is impossible
 to fix. &nbsp;The driver causing me problems is associated with an external EVGA graphics card. &nbsp;I tried researching on their company website for a solution, no luck. &nbsp;I tried contacting the company. &nbsp;No luck. &nbsp;They are non responsive. &nbsp;This is an EVGA problem.
 Bad software. &nbsp;And it's a Microsoft issue in allowing this driver to be pushed out to the user community through windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now caught in one of those no win situations. &nbsp;I tried fixing the problem using restore. &nbsp;It was taking so long, &nbsp;that my monitors went into sleep mode and will not wake. &nbsp;I have no monitors and have no idea where restore is in its process. &nbsp;I am afraid
 to just turn the computer off. &nbsp;Forced to allow computer to stay on for next 4 or 5 hours, will then just pull the plug. &nbsp;No other option. Reboot. &nbsp;Hope for the best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you EVGA and Microsoft.<br />

<p>This not an Intel or EVGA specific problem. I am having the same issue with a client's system and it has AMD Radeon graphics. My research so far has revealed an interesting trend. Every system that encounters this issue seems to have been upgraded from an
 earlier version of Windows. This includes <strong>new systems</strong> that shipped with Windows 10. While trouble shooting my clients system, I restored Windows to it's original state. During the process, I received a warning that if I proceeded with the
 restore, I would not be able to rollback Windows to it's original version. Curious since it shipped with Win 10. I completed the repairs to my clients system and resolved all issues except the Windows "<em>Dead</em>" Sleep issue. (I confirmed that the original
 installed drivers were still being used.) My guess is that the system drive will need to be wiped and a clean copy of Windows 10 will need to be installed. While researching this issue, I have read many forum and support posts. Roughly 50% either clearly state
 that their OS was upgraded from an earlier version or at least hint at it. Roughly 33% of all posts indicate a new system with this issue. What I am seeing leads me to believe that, with the exception of issues created by user error, this is a Windows upgrade
 problem. This theory makes sense to me as MS has never once introduced a version of Windows that could be upgraded to a new version without serious issues arising. Driver compatibility has always been an issue with new OS versions. That is why competent techs
 will not upgrade an older version of an OS. At the very least, we give the drive a full format and install a clean copy of the newest version.<br />
</p>
<p>My advice is this...</p>
<ul>
<li>Shut off your system. (Press and hold the power button for 3 seconds if the system is frozen.)</li><li>Disconnect the power cord and remove the battery if applicable.</li><li>Hold the power button for 10 seconds to bleed off the stored energy from capacitors.
</li><li>Connect the power cord and reinstall the battery if applicable. </li><li>Start the system and login when it is ready.</li><li>Right-click <strong>Start</strong> and select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>When it opens type: <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>. System File Checker will scan for and repair any problems caused by hard reboots.</li><li>When <strong>SFC</strong> finishes, t<span>ype&nbsp;</span><span><strong>powercfg.exe
 /hibernate off</strong></span><span>, and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span> This will disable hibernation and it should prevent your system from freezing.
<em>(This is a temporary measure to protect your system from further damage by hard reboots.)</em></li><li>Get a clean copy of the full OS, reformat your drive, then install the OS and appropriate drivers.</li><li>You can get your drivers from EVGA at this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.evga.com/support/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Uncheck Latest Drivers">https://www.evga.com/support/download/</a>&nbsp;(Make sure to uncheck
<strong>Latest Drivers</strong> to see a full list of drivers appropriate for the card and/or chipset you have selected.</li></ul>

            <p>Cooler Master does not make CPUs.&nbsp; The device you replaced was the cooling device that is mounted on top of your CPU which is on the main board of your computer.&nbsp; Replacing CPUs is a very rare thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you do have a serious problem.&nbsp; I do not know what is causing this, but I can suggest a first step:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the start globe on the bottom left</p>
<p>Type Disk Cleanup in the text box </p>
<p>Click on Disk cleanup in the popup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will take a while</p>
<p>When a window appears, click on the button there that is labeled System</p>
<p>This will again take a while</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the next window appears, you are going to be presented with a lot of potential options to delete things.&nbsp; Look for very big items that are Gigabytes.&nbsp; Report back here the big items you found and we will try to advise you on what you should click on

    <title>Internet connection extremely slow on Brand new Windows 8 Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Internet connection extremely slow on Brand new Windows 8 Laptop</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have bought a brand new Windows 8 installed laptop few weeks back. From day 1, I am facing the issue of "extremely slow internet connection speed". When I check the speed in Speedtest.net it is good but the streaming/loading the pages is taking ages.<br />
<br />
I am using 5 year old acer laptop (WIN7 installed), it is far better in loading the pages.<br />
<br />
After going through various reviews, I understand that Windows 8 has some bugs which is causing this issue. Now, I repent for my actions (buying Windows 8 laptop!) but can't do anything.<br />
<br />
Please suggest me if I can make any changes in my laptop so that this problem is solved.<br />

            <p>FYI, I had a similar issue.&nbsp; I upgraded my Dell M1530 XPS laptop to Windows 8 from Windows 7.&nbsp; I wiped my hard drive and did a clean install.&nbsp; My network connectivity was very weak.&nbsp; I have an extremely fast home connection so I was surprised when I noticed
 that my connection was very sporadic.&nbsp; My Xbox was downloading hundreds of megabytes in the time it was taking my laptop to download 20-30 megabytes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read a few posts noting how the wireless network driver that Microsoft includes with Windows 8 could be the problem.&nbsp; I'm happy to report that this was the case.&nbsp; Here's what I did to resolve the problem (FYI, I have an Intel 4965AGN wireless adapter in
 my laptop):</p>
<ul>
<li>I went to Intel's site and looked for Windows 8 drivers for my adapter.&nbsp; They do not exist.&nbsp; So I downloaded the 64 bit Windows 7 drivers (I chose the drivers-only package, not the one with all the extra software).</li><li>I opened the device manager in Windows and uninstalled the driver for my network adapter.</li><li>I then ran the Intel drivers executable.&nbsp; It spun for a minute or two and installed.&nbsp; I did *not* check any compatibility checkboxes.</li></ul>
<p>Once I reconnected to the internet my connection was back to normal, very comparable to my Windows 7 experience.&nbsp; I strongly urge anyone who is experiencing similar issues to uninstall the default Windows 8 wireless adapter driver and install the latest
 driver from the adapter's manufacturer.&nbsp; If they don't have Windows 8 drivers, use the latest Windows 7 ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            I really really hope you have gotten this fixed. I really do. I've got the exact same problem. I have done everything.virus scan revealed NOTHING. NOTHING. I've tried every browser I know out there. THEY ARE ALL SLOW. Even things off the Internet are slow.
 FROM DAY ONE. This computer with windows 8 was NEW FROM WALL*MART with Windows 8 installed when I bought it. I believe that I'm pretty much screwed. I don't have the ability to pay for repairs. I'm stuck with a screwed computer. Pretty much screwed. If you
 ever did get this &nbsp;computer fixed, Please tell me about it, and how. &nbsp;It looks like I'm pretty much screwed as of the second I noticed the thing was slow.

            <p>Hey Raju,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've been running into the same problem lately. All of as sudden, my really fast internet speed went down to 3 Mbps. Here's what I did...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I restarted the computer in safe mode with networking and then ran a speed test right when the computer started up ... it was perfect. I opened the task manager to see which services were running and which were stopped, and I took a screen shot. I used the
 computer in safe mode for a little while, running speed tests every 5 or so minutes to make sure it was still good. I left the computer running in safe mode and went on to my regular day (internet wise). I used my wifi on my laptop, phone, media streamer,
 etc... I came back to the computer to run another speed test and it was back down to 3 Mbps. I opened up the task manager again and noticed (when compared to the screen shot) that there was another service running that wasn't before. It was "VaultSvc - Credential
 Manager".&nbsp; I stopped this service and then ran another speed test, and voila, back to normal!
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

</p><blockquote>Hi,<br />
<br />
I have bought a brand new Windows 8 installed laptop few weeks back. From day 1, I am facing the issue of "extremely slow internet connection speed". When I check the speed in Speedtest.net it is good but the streaming/loading the pages is taking ages.<br />
<br />
I am using 5 year old acer laptop (WIN7 installed), it is far better in loading the pages.<br />
<br />
After going through various reviews, I understand that Windows 8 has some bugs which is causing this issue. Now, I repent for my actions (buying Windows 8 laptop!) but can't do anything.<br />
<br />
Please suggest me if I can make any changes in my laptop so that this problem is solved.<br />
<br />
Thanks for understanding my frustration!<br />

Keep in mind that your rated speed of 1.3 Mb/s is Megabit per second and not Mega Byte. you divide that by 8 to get your actual Maximum throughput. which is 162.5 KB/s so at that speed the fastest it would take to download 1GB is 1 hr 40 minutes. but that's
 in a perfect world where there is no slowdown downloading the patch, but I think that patches have got to be the slowest files to download on the net because of so many people trying to download them at once.<br />
<br />
If your router is wireless, make sure no-one else is connecting to it. Even if you changed the default password and are encrypting your connection (do these at the minimum), the older WEP standard is hackable. I personally keep my router as tight as possible,
 going so far as to not transmit my SID and lock out MAC (network card hardware) addresses that I haven't authorized...&nbsp;<br />

If none of these are helpful, stop all downloads/traffic on your network, and test your bandwidth here:&nbsp;<br />

<br />
If you're getting lousy speeds here, too, it's your ISP. Ream them. ; )&nbsp;<br />

            I thought it was a brightness issue after installing windows 10&nbsp; but many techs later, unable to fix the problem and finding out that my model has not been tested with win 10 i had no other choice but to revert back to 8.1 but this issue has not gone away,
 the text is still choppy (parts of the letters are missing ) like if a printer was running out of ink . Went to Dell support and ran the full scan in diagnostics tested and NOTHING&nbsp; wrong Help&nbsp; this is driving me nuts i can barely&nbsp; read what i am&nbsp; writing
 here i click on color calibration and it goes to HELP window saying CAN'T FIND AN ANSWER TO MY QUESTION SO&nbsp; I can't calibrate the color and I cant find a way to adjust brightness&nbsp; help.
<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
<br />
It is not All pages, things like the desktop and home screen are bright and Clear. Pages like this one or things that have prompts are choppy, blotchy
<br />
<br />
Example...................the address box (URL) on this page . <br />
<br />
This is what I see if I&nbsp; highlight the address box......................<br />
<br />
https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/thread/updatethread?threadId=5155666e-fe3e-4f6d-b055-b0cf08a63a8b&amp;editType=EditThreadByOwner&amp;messageId=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000<br />
<br />
the only part of that long URL that I see is.............................microsoft.com<br />
<br />
All that other&nbsp; text is not readable, it is very very faint . It's there its just to faint to read<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I am choosing a Desktop theme, from.... Microsoft DESKTOP THEMES.&nbsp; I just noticed the difference between the little photo above the download is WAY too bright&nbsp; but the one that is installed on Pc,&nbsp; is lovely,&nbsp;&nbsp; right colors not too bright.
<br />
<br />
let me add this is a brand new clean install of 8.<br />
I am having trouble installing a 2 drivers

    <title>I need help&#58; adding a child profile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> superjosh2077  say:</h3>
<h2>            I need help&#58; adding a child profile</h2>
                    
<p>I want to add a profile for my 6-year-old daughter. &nbsp;On the 360, I created a profile for her that was not an Xbox Live account. &nbsp;We let her play around with the avatar and use it to sign in to play some games and watch movies. &nbsp;I want to create a profile
 for her on the One, but it keeps asking for an email address. &nbsp;My Hotmail address is already linked to my Live account, so I can't use it (I'm assuming). &nbsp;I really don't feel comfortable creating an email address for a 6-year-old. &nbsp;Am I missing something?
 &nbsp;I can't seem to find any detailed information when I search, so I'm turning to the forums for help. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<p>Add a new member to your Xbox One family</p>
<p>Overview</p>
<p>Creating a “family” on Xbox One helps you manage privacy and online safety settings for children.</p>
<p>Any adult in the family can add new members to the family. Adults and children in the family have different rights when it comes to managing the family. Learn more about who can manage the family.</p>
<p>To add a family member, follow these steps:</p>
<p>Note To add a new member to your family, you must be signed in to Xbox Live.</p>
<p>1.Press the Menu button on your controller, go to Settings on your console, and then scroll right to the FAMILY section. Select Add to family.</p>
<p>2.Choose who you want to add:</p>
<p>a.If the person you want to add to the family already has an Xbox Live profile saved on the console, select that profile.</p>
<p>b.The person must then sign in with the email address and password for their Microsoft account.</p>
<p>c.Select Add to family again.</p>
<p>d.You should now see the person added to the family.</p>
<p>e<strong>.If the person you’re adding is a child, and you haven’t already associated their account with yours, you’ll need to provide parental consent in order to complete this process.</strong></p>
<p>f.If the person you want to add has an Xbox Live profile, but it’s not saved on the console, skip to step 3. If the person doesn’t have an Xbox Live profile, skip to step 4.</p>
<p>3.If the person you want to add has an Xbox Live profile but has never saved the profile to this console, select Add new and have the person sign in by providing the Microsoft account and password associated with that profile.</p>
<p>4.If the person doesn’t have an Xbox Live profile, click Add new and have the person create an Xbox Live profile. Then, go back to step 2a and complete the process.</p>
<p>Note For information about how to create a new account and profile, see Manage your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>When you return to Settings, you’ll see the new profile under Family.</p>

<p>Please note that Microsoft and Xbox Live comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) regarding online account creation for children under age 13. COPPA requires that prior to gathering personal information from a child (under age 13),
 providers of online services obtain verifiable consent from the child’s parent. The most common method allowed by COPPA for obtaining parental consent is charging a small amount to the parent’s credit card. We charge 50 cents for this verification. These charges
 aren’t refundable.</p>

<p>There is no way round it unfortunatly... as being a parent of 4 myself I have great concerns about our littlens having emails....use an alias of your main email m8 for ya daughter and you can adjust the safty settings as you see fit,as you are the xbla subscription
 holder and the other profiles added are in your family which is at y8ur full control.</p>
<p>ALSO make sure your main paid xbla is made the home xbox so your family members and littlens benefit all the gold.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Settings,bottom left tab,my home xbox..'make this my home xbox' tab and done. :)</p>

<p>Why do you have "create an email for a 6 year old"? Just whip up a free throw away junk email real quick so you can get it out of the way. *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. If she's not signing in to check her email every day after school, then you're not "creating
 an email for a 6 year old". You're solving a problem.</p>

<p>I have a 7 and 4 year old I just added to family and just gave them an outlook Email with there names. It will be a while before they ever need to sign in to read emails and such. Once done the x1 knows they are child accounts and require you to input a
 code to allow inappropriately rated games. It's a pain but works.</p>

<p>your children don't need an email, but the account does, just set up two email addresses with gmail and setup the accounts, and don't give your children access to them, however I would recommend forwarding the emails from them to yours incase MS send anything
 important.</p>

<p>Hi Juan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your interest regarding my post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i was using 7.59 version... and more recently with the 8 version after updating.</p>
<p>both were having the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i guess i have it since the "automatic zoom / faces dectection" has been implemented.</p>
<p>at least for several months / maybe a year.</p>

<p>Hi Juan</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your mail.</p>
<p>yes i tried that too... unfortunately no "automatic zoom" option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is curious is that my brother who is using PC is able to de-activate this option (as far as i remember he told me something like right clic on the video screen &gt; deactivate automatic zoom). But this option doesn't seem to exist on mac... ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the last days, I noticed something more that i wanted to share with you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- when i skype with my parents (mac to mac) : no zoom on video screen... everything is just fine</p>
<p>
</p><p>- when i skype with my parents and my brother (mac - mac - pc) : automatic zoom centered, whatever the faces present in front of the webcam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to further investigate what happens if i &nbsp;skype with &nbsp;my brother only (mac - pc).</p>
<p>i will also try to take a screen shot to show you what happens precisely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help, even if not solved yet ! ;)</p>

<h2>            Still trying to install office 2019 &#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Have purchased office 2019 on the vlsc and am trying to install it on an acer with windows 10. I used to get the error needs iis services and asp net 4.7, after trying a fix recommended by one of your members i can now get to the setup.exe but when i try
 to open it just flashes a window and closes immediately.&nbsp; i also have purchased a windows 10 to use on a different pc but didnt use it, so that is still available for download. &nbsp; my thinking is that the acer has a heavily 'customised' version of windows an
 if i do a fresh install it may help with some of my problems?&nbsp; however, I am not sure which version to download from the vlsc as there are about 50 versions of windows available.&nbsp; Any thoughts?

            Hi Susan
<br />
<br />If you are installing from VLSC, you need to use the Office Deployment tool to get it installed.

    <title>Windows Live Movie Maker- No sound for some videos - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Live Movie Maker- No sound for some videos</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have a problem with windows live movie maker 2011 and my computer is windows 7. For a very long time the movie maker have worked very well but lately when I import videos to make movies out of them, I see th visual but no voice ( not for all videos
 just for some of them). I've thought that maybe it is because of the video when I first observed this problem, but then I've tried a lot more and this problem seems to be increasing. I've read some comments about it, they say it is because of the codecs of
 video's own and I should delete those codecs. But I don't know how to do that because they were talking about movie maker 2012 and mine was windows live 2011.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be very pleased if there is someone to have a solution to this problem.</p>
<p>( Plus: In the options of movie maker there is no sound section or filters section for codecs I don't know where to find those codecs.)</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. First, I would like to apologize for the delay in responding to your post. As for your inquiry of not having an audio in your video, you've mentioned that you're using the 2011 version of Movie Maker. We strongly suggest

<p><span>2. Click on the Display tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.</span></p>
<p><span>3. If your video card driver seems outdated please go to the video card driver manufacturer and see if a newer version is available.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to us. Please note that MKV files are not supported in Movie Maker; thus the reason why you can only see the video and can't hear the audio. To troubleshoot this, you may convert the MKV files to a supported format such as WMV
 and add these video files again to your project then check for any results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <span>It's probably due to the codec contained in your files which can't be recognized by Movie Maker. If you do not mind to go through the hassle, you can
 try to find a proper video, auido codec then Movie Maker would accept you files with perfect video, audio playeback.&nbsp;</span><br />

<p>Its an Early&nbsp;2011 system and hence will have a legacy MBR BIOS. Dell are not likely to provide driver support for it as its out of warranty, However its a desktop tower with overall good hardware and&nbsp;Windows 10 will contain all the necessary drivers inbuilt
 or get them automatically&nbsp;from Windows Update.</p>

            Hi hutchphd, 
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing. 
<br />
<br />What device are you using Skype on? What version of Skype are you using aswell? If the same occurs on the Skype for Web, then it is likely to be a network issue:-

<p>8.39.00.180&nbsp; On Win10Pro PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't use skype for web.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This started immediately when I was forced to update skype last week.&nbsp; &nbsp;It seems that certain contacts are more likely to be difficult to call but statistics are not conclusive&nbsp; (maybe they are Win 7 users??)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I mention that the previous 7.x version skype worked perfectly?????</p>

            If you could please try contacting the same contacts on Skype for Web, by logging into your same account, and telling me if this occurs there as well, it would greatly help in understanding the nature of the problem.

<p>Web Skype worked.&nbsp; But then I tried regular skype and it worked also ( the problem has always been somewhat intermittent as I described).&nbsp; So probably not definitive.</p>
<p>New problem: on-camera indicator light remains lit after terminating communication.&nbsp; Then is not recognized I think.....&nbsp; reconnecting camera (USB) doesn't help........light stays lit .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I mention old skype 7.X worked perfectly?&nbsp;</p>
