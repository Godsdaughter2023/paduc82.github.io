    <title>cannot recover skype password - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            cannot recover skype password</h2>
                    My old skype signup email was *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, where xx was an internal domain.&nbsp; My institution eliminated all internals and no longer allows aliases or .forwards for the xx internal, only yy.edu.&nbsp; I also no longer remember the skype password.&nbsp; As a consequence
 I cannot login to change because that requires the old password.&nbsp; And of course cannot use my old skype signup email to recover, because in a perfect Catch-22, the @xx.yy.edu domain no longer works.&nbsp; The recovery process was a joke - all ended up as self-replicating
 loops that failed even though I provided all requisite information as required.

</p><p>We understand how frustrating it is to fill out the form multiple times and still not able to recover the account. But please be reminded that such form is established in the interest of data and account security. This means that the system will only grant
 access to the person who will be able to pass the verification process. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you on this, let me give you tips on how to pass. This has helped&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;customers. The chances of passing the validation increase if you fill out this form from a computer that was previously used to sign in to that account, and was successful.
 Also, it is much better if you can do this process from a network location (i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network) where a previous sign-in occurred.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be sure to use the information you had associated with the account originally, even if there were recent changes. The 4 basic information (First Name, Last Name, Birthdate and Current/Old Passwords are the best and easiest way to prove your Online Identity)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also, please be reminded that you just need to fill out information that you are just 100% sure and in the best of your knowledge. You don't need to fill out everything but make sure that you have provided enough for you to pass this validation. The
 4 basic information is more than enough to prove your identity - as long as it matches the system's record.</p>

<p>Still not working.&nbsp; I sent a recovery request again on FR 11 Aug and as of this morning 14 Aug no reply.</p>
<p>I followed all of the instructions listed below and was not even granted courtesy of a response this time.</p>
<p>I would - quite frankly - delete the skype account, but you&nbsp; - MS - have linked this hotmail acct with my skype and my read is that I lose this hotmail acct if I delete skype.&nbsp; Why this link??????</p>
<p>This has reached heights of silliness. </p>
<p>Yes yes yes, I understand the security stuff.&nbsp; But please provide me a means or guidance or courtesy of a response for recovering my password on skype so I can log in and use skype.</p>

<h2>            White E51 theme, pls help</h2>
                    Hi fellas,&nbsp;<br />
I was looking for something on nokia's main page, when I came over to the Nokia E51 "How to" page, where all the applications and functions are shown in short videos. The theme of the mobile was a simple, but cool one - white background with silver icons. Does
 somebody know the name of it and where I could download it? Here's a screenshot:&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi205.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fbb19%2fSosica%2fWhiteE51Theme.jpg" />

<p>Nah, that's not the one I'm searching for, but thanks anyways ^^ &nbsp;</p>
<p>I found a few white themes by googling "nokia white theme" or sth like that, but there ain't that specific one I mentioned above. What I'd also like to know is - who's the actual autor of the videos that are showing Nokia E51's functions and guidelines,
 cause I'm pretty sure that he/she knows the name of the theme. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; PS: thanx for the effort, all you who're helping me out with this =P</p>

<p>To be honest mate thats not an actual live screen shot from a handset, and i have access to a lot of themes including most if not all of the default pre installed themes and i have never seen this theme.</p>

<h2>            DKIM - CNAME records at hosting provider &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Dear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recently switched over to Office365 and have our domain (hosted at One.com) added. &nbsp;I now want to enable DKIM on the cotrain.be domain (it's standard enabled on the XXXX.onmicrosoft.com domain but we want it on our XXXX.be domain also). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've entered following cnames at the WebDNS Setting page of our provider (One.com)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Domain:&nbsp; selector1-XXXX-be._domainkey.XXXX.be</p>
<p>Value:&nbsp;selector1-XXXX-be._domainkey.XXXX.onmicrosoft.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>and</p>
<p>
</p><p>Domain:&nbsp; selector2-XXXX-be._domainkey.XXXX.be</p>
<p>Value:&nbsp;selector2-XXXX-be._domainkey.XXXX.onmicrosoft.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've saved my DNS settings and waited already for more than 2 hours, however whenever trying to enable DKIM on XXXX.be, it keeps telling me that I need to add 2 CNAME.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone that can help getting me to setup things right so DKIM can be enabled on our cotrain.be domain in Office365 ?</p>

<p>Hi Marc,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my experience, the two CNAME records you added should be wrong. You need to
<strong>remove your custom domain name</strong> after “selector1” and “selector2” you added in your DNS hoster.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please use the following format for the CNAME records:</p>
<p>Host name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; selector1._domainkey.&lt;domain&gt;</p>
<p>Points to address or value:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; selector1-&lt;domainGUID&gt;._domainkey.&lt;initialDomain&gt;
</p>
<p>TTL:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3600</p>
<p>
</p><p>Host name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; selector2._domainkey.&lt;domain&gt;</p>

</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Here is an example</strong>:</p>

    <title>Restart after installing updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richard berdette  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restart after installing updates</h2>
                    
<p>About a month ago when I installed the recommended updates all seemed ok until I was instructed to restart the computer.While the computer was restarting, after a minute or so, the screen went black and there appeared an error message that stated (Disk read
 error) Hit ctrl alt delete to continue.</p>
<p>That did nothing and as a result I have been attempting to repair what ever happened every since that time.</p>
<p>After several phone sessions with Microsoft Help, I was convinced by them that the only way to fix the problem was to reformat the internal hard drive and restore the system and then get our data files back from Carbonite.</p>
<p>I have been attempring to do that and still have problems when the system restarts.</p>
<p>The monitor goes black when I restart for about one minute now. It used to go black for about 2 1/2 minutes.</p>
<p>I have tried everything I can think of including purchashing and installing Drivehive to install and keep the drivers updated.</p>
<p>The last thing I tried was the purchase and installation of PC Tune-Up which I was told by a salesman would surely fix my problem.</p>
<p>After being on line for almost two hours with the PC Tune-Up Technician last night I was informed that my operating system had major problems that could be repaired but that it would cost me $170 to have them repair it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all I have already spent in time and $&nbsp;attempting to get our system back to where it was before I did what Microsoft suggested I do I am at my wits end and in desperate need of quality technical support.</p>
<p>We have the same basic system on another computer in our LAN and when the recommended update was implemented on that one there was no problem. However that computer is much newer and the XP operating system was installed on it by Dell as opposed to this
 one which has been updated to XP from&nbsp;&nbsp; Win95 and Win98 by us.</p>
<p>Before I spend any more money on attempts to repair our operating system, I would like to know what path would be the best to restore our system security.</p>
<p>I was under the false impression that if I did what Microsoft recommended our system would be protected and kept up to date. I guess that was a false impression on my part.</p>
<p>Any reliable suggestions will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

<p>Are you using Microsoft Security Essentials?&nbsp; This forum is for Microsoft Security Essentials questions only.</p>
<p>If XP is the current system, as I am unable to determine from your post, you want to be here:&nbsp;<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/xprepair/threads?filter=answered" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/xprepair/threads?filter=answered</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you have already asked this question:&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/mseupdate/thread/3cbcbbdd-25d1-45b9-8b18-77ca320ca9c4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>Disk read error control alt detete to try again__This appeared after attempting to reboot as suggested after downloading and instaling the latest security updates on our Dell Dimension 4100 running Win XP sp3</span></a></p>
<p>For all the time spent, you could have done a clean install of XP (or w7), on current hardware, and you would have been done with this issue.&nbsp; And, if you were on W95 or W98, which are 16 and 13 years old, respectively, and you are attempting to restore
 those backups on a XP machine (or whatever combonation of repairs you are attempting) you are doing the wrong thing.</p>
<p>A fresh install of XP, with service packs, on current hardware, will only take a couple of hours.&nbsp; If you backup data was properly stored with some backup facility and program, it should be easily restored.</p>
<p>You have spent far to much time on this, when the proper procedure will easily have you up and running.&nbsp; And, there are no "dream" tools out there that will fix your problem.</p>

            Yes I am using security essentials. That is one of my current concerns. I also have another security system that came with the PC Tune-up and I fear that they may be conflicting. It was installed with the PC Tune_Up last night. I think I should uninstall
 it because we want to still use what ever security system Microsoft provides for us.

<p><span>Also, v<span>erify that you have removed<span>&nbsp;</span>all other<span>&nbsp;</span>real-time
 antimalware products that were ever installed on your PC, including free/trial products that were installed when the PC was purchased (Norton, Symantec, McAfee, TM, AVG, Malwarebytes (paid), etc).<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Then, use the cleanup tools here:<span>&nbsp;

<p>Thank you for your help Doc.</p>
<p>I think I have my hardware stable but the PC Tune-Up technician informed me that my OS needed repair that they could accomplish for $170 which I really didnt want to spend last night. She had located the problem but informed me that a Windows Tech would
 have to do the fix for me and would charge me $170.</p>
<p>I really think I am sending good money after bad at this point.</p>
<p>I did as you suggest to re-install our copy of Win XP from our CD and then all the updates. We have everything back with that one exception of the screen going black when re-booting. We can live with that but a salesman at Tiger Direct convinced me that
 if I purchased and installed PC Tune-Up that would be fixed. However that was not the case. I am hoping that I can find a direction that will be helpful even if it is to live with what we have at the moment. However I will definately remove the PC-Tune-Up
 security so it does not interfer with Microsoft security essentials.</p>
<p>Thank You Doc.</p>

<p>Also, note the following:</p>
<p><strong><span>A well-protected platform consists of:</span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><span>Internet

<p><span>And, nothing is better than having a good backup procedure, and practicing safe surfing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The key here is a&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>good backup system</strong>.&nbsp; If you are XP or above, and you had a good backup, all that would have been needed is to replace the hard drive
 and restore the backup, even if using ASR disks from Windows Backup.&nbsp; I know, as I have done this multiple times.&nbsp; I do not know what you actually did with your system, or what you mean by "false impressions" , but the answer was, is, and will be to always
 have a good backup.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;If "carbonite" failed to properly restore your system, it sounds like they failed you, and you should contact them and complain.</strong></span></p>

<p>I had three backups I think.</p>
<p>I fear I elected to use the wrong one. (Carbonite). I did not know that it contained any thing other than data files.</p>
<p>For some reason, the Microsoft technician did not think there was any way of restoring the system files.</p>
<p>I will go to Seagate website and see if they can check our hard drive.</p>

<p>Richard Berdette,</p>
<p>I had a major problem with a hard drive (on Christmas&nbsp;morning - Bah Humbug) last month on my Dell 8400 XP Pro desktop.&nbsp; I ran Sea Tools and the first scan showed it was okay.&nbsp; I ran a second, detailed scan (don't remember exactly how cause I was just following
 the prompts) because I was comfortable I had problems with the drive and this second scan by Sea Tools found 24 errors.&nbsp; I directed Sea Tools to repair the errors on my Seagate drive and Ckdsk kicked in without me telling it to do so&nbsp;and began running and
 after about an hour and half and several hard restarts the computer booted into Windows.&nbsp; I.E., Sea Tools and Chdsk brought it back from the dead cause it would not even boot up.&nbsp; And yes, I immediately backed up everything to an external hard drive which
 I had failed to do in several months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tell this tale not because I necessarily think you have a bad hard drive (your initial problems regarding a disk read error indicate that as a&nbsp;possibility however) but to suggest you run Seatools again.&nbsp; And if that hard drive is suspect, unless you wish
 to back up any new data that needs saving on a daily basis then you should probably replace the drive.</p>
<p>You've received some good advice in this MSE forum from Dr. Strangelove and mikeyshd but as&nbsp;Doc suggested you&nbsp;probably need to be in the appropriate forum for your operating system.&nbsp; And for what it's worth I do not think I would&nbsp;pay PC Tools to possibly
 do a remote "repair-install" or whatever they think might fix your system. That money could be better spent at a "friendly local computer shop" as mikeyshd suggested should it become necessary.&nbsp; I'm not knocking Best Buy or Office Depot but their techs might
 be more interested in replacing than repairing your computer.</p>

</p>
<p>I have tried editing some of the messages, however it does not seem to have an effect, and also, this occurs with any message I send, regardless of the content or length, whether it is a response or original email.</p>
<p>This problem does not seem to occur when I use the standard Android email app to send email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked through the community and found a few answers that have seemed somewhat helpful as things I can do to get around the problem, but not fix it. For Example, I use my web Browser for the affected account. I am currently trying to re-establish a
 connection with the Desktop app (which I'm personally not a fan of) to see if sending emails via that will work, but even if that does work, I'd rather use my browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I found a post here: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_outlook-mso_other/spam-suspected-error-in-outgoing-mail/baf454b3-b4d5-4d92-90f1-c74d908ba3db regarding doing something with creating a new profile, but this seems
 to refer to if I'm having problems using the desktop app in the first place. The issue started in Webmail, so I don't think it applies. (Plus frankly it seems like a lot of work and I'm just overall hesitant to try it at all, anyway.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I tried emailing myself and it works. It also works if I email myself at a different email address (Although the address is listed in my connected accounts.) I tried emailing another of my accounts that was not connected and it DID NOT seem to work.
</p>
<p>It does seem that emailing from the outlook app works. More to come later if I begin to have issues with this, however, would still like to be able to use webmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second Update: Problem now seems to be occurring with the Outlook desktop app, as well, although a little less often.</p>

<h2>            Lumia Software bugs</h2>
                    <p>Hello microsoft community. Using a windows phone is a great experience and maybe the
<strong>best mobile experience</strong> in my opinion.</p>
<p>Smooth rolling through heavy programs even in a cheap platform. I have to say that is still good in w10. But the mobile experience&nbsp;</p>
<p>that i told before is<strong> for the 8.1 platform</strong> and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
not for 10</span>. I really want to buy 950/XL in the next days but there are so many</p>
<p>videos, reviews that stop me dramatically. I mean what happened? Bugs everywhere. Even the
<strong>software</strong> is in <strong>beta</strong> (<strong>?</strong>)<br />
I really love all your products and I support you in every conversation that I have with friends and even people I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Windows phone is a different way of mobile experience</strong>. <strong>
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Maybe the best of all</span>.</strong> But
<strong>bugs and crashes everywhere.</strong></p>
<p>I am trying to find a blemish on the 950/XL and i can't. From design to platform everything is perfectly crafted (specially the polycarbonate back) and then i stop.
<strong>Software</strong>. Everything in <strong>beta</strong>. What should I do?<br />
Thanks,</p>
<p>Raphael.</p>

<p>You are right. I think now I can understand. Greece... But i believe in Microsoft. Always finds a way to get the things done and usually is going viral. Until then I think we have to wait. But many people say (depending on the conversations that i had) that
 Microsoft has stopped trying. I can see it from the beta releases and the long time that takes to fix some of the bugs and not all. What's your opinion on that?&nbsp;<br />
It would be pleasant to hear from you.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot hpholm<br />

            <p>I purchased a Nokia N8 January 2011. It took Nokia (and Accenture) some years to finish the software. It was great pastime and nerdy fun, following the technicians in Nokia Betalabs and elsewhere, watching the development of new features, help confirm some
 of the bugs in built-in features, and see issues resolved over time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Mobile is currently work in progress, like the N8 were in 2011. It is your decision to step in now, or wait until it is finished regarding the features and apps you expect in a smartphone, in your country and language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please also keep in mind, most of the traffic in vendor forums is from people who have issues. Sony phones break all the time in their forum, Apple devices break all the time in their forum, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best consumer advise is to only purchase what you really need, when you really need it, and confirm it works as expected before handing over the money.</p>
<p>Microsoft and other manufacturers have efficient marketing. Don't let them decide! ;-)</p>

 bluetooth PAN profile like Sonyericsson. in old time i used a software GNUBOX on my Nokia 3230. it was not a very good experience, internet speed was very slow n just can open WAP sites. i'm not sure it will work on S60V5. u better get GPRS/3G connection ur

    <title>Printing Emails from Outlook.com &#47; Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Printing Emails from Outlook.com &#47; Windows 10</h2>
                    For several weeks after installing Windows 10, I was able to print emails using the normal print commands within the Outlook program. However, several days ago this option failed to work. Instead I get a window (Sign In, Microsoft Edge) telling me "Something
 went wrong and we can't sign you in right now. Please try again later." The print preview screen works when printing from other programs or web sites, but not for Outlook.

            <p>There are many other, more robust options for media than WMC that you should consider. VLC for example. While WMC 12 is accessible in the current build, I don't expect it to be maintained in its current form with the addition of separate music and video
 apps, especially since many users don't use it in favor of better options.</p>

<p>I'll admit I haven't used my PC to DVR anything in years so I'm a little behind the times on that, but isn't Kodi (formerly XBMC) a much better option&nbsp;or does it require WMC for that?</p>

            <p>Kodi uses plug-in's to WMC out right, but there are plug-in's to it as well. Problem is that it will not let you record channels such as HBO, SHOW, STARZ, etc. Do to Copyright infringement and so on. Also you will need to find a source for the EPG.</p>

            The fact that WMC allows you to record the protected media from those channels, providing the noted "Copyright infringement and so on", is one of the major deciding factors in dropping WMC.

<h2>            Histograms unclustered to date &#38;&#47;or time</h2>
                    Hi - the graphic visual I wish to display is eluding me...<br />
<br />
Data cols are clustered time stamps &amp; appropriate frequency count; -<br />
<br />
I can display as req with unclustered timestamps - but only as event "dots", not as individual vertical bars wrt time... all attempts to draw the bars from the event(s) dots result in clustering...<br />
<br />
any suggestions please?<br />
<br />
Thank you, bebbspoke.

            Hi Anna,<br />
<br />
Have seldom used the histogram...&nbsp; Office 365 home // or 2016<br />
<br />
I am simply attempting to procure the data as an UNclustered column for which there is no apparent function!?!<br />

            Further investigation implies a histogram is not (by definition) appropriate: -<br />
<br />
The requirement is to create a column (i.e. vertical bar) chart in UNclustered form,<br />

            I believe the problem is that the data as sourced is clustered Date &amp; Time format...<br />
<br />
I would have thought that it should not be necessary to UNcluster the data, but that the chart graphic should be capable of determining that the data is in D &amp; T...<br />
<br />
To UNcluster the sourced data will make the sourced data visually unreadable!<br />

<h2>            Long lost friend..</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if someone can help me. I had a friend around a year ago on Skype and I'm trying to get back into touch.</p>
<p>I don't remember his Skype username, is there a way to access past friends which have been deleted? The only information I have would be his first name and where he's from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            You can search for your friend using Skype Name or mail address (or phone number if phone number was used) with complete accuracy.
<br />
<br />In this case, you can search for your friend using first name and you will get a lot of options. You will have to scroll through the search result and make a judgement whether that person is right or not.

            You should still be able to find that that person in Skype using their first and last name. Persons usually have the same name for their account also known as display name. 
<br />
<br />The issue you will see a lot of users with the same name, so look carefully at the profile picture just to make sure its them and also take note of the location which can help further determine if its them.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2bd306b5-f844-400c-93aa-da054b395bbf?upload=true" />

I actually purchased the Russian Language&nbsp;Pack in 2010 and even have the original receipt with the order confirmation number. The file, however, was lost (alas!)&nbsp;but I need it to reinstall MS Office on my new laptop. How can I have access to the file? I want

 mobile device and all its info (pictures, files and programs) I have been able to download pictures and upload files to the phone but I can not sync with Outlook 2007.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;- I have made sure to uncheck "Enable advanced network functionality"<br />
&nbsp;- I have connected via bluetooth and usb<br />
&nbsp;- I have completed soft resets<br />
&nbsp;- I have completed hard resets<br />
&nbsp;- I have even replaced the phone<br />
&nbsp;- I have run SCANPST on all my outlook files<br />

At this point I am out of options and need help. Any ideas would be welcomed. <br />

            You've probably done this in the past, but maybe not in exactly this order:<br />
<br />
Uninstall Windows Mobile Device Center from your computer.&nbsp; Reboot the computer and then download and install Windows Mobile Device Center to your computer<br />
Turn off/Disable the computer's firewall &amp; antivirus software (for the time being)<br />
Perform a hard (factory) reset of your windows phone.&nbsp; Uncheck "Enable advanced network functionality" on the device.&nbsp; Remove any storage cards<br />
Then attach the phone to the computer and see if you are able to sync<br />

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would need more details to assist you:</p>
<p>Is the computer connected to a domain/network?</p>
<p>Does this issue occur with Outlook 2010 on a single PC or all the PC's connected to the network?</p>
<p>How is the email account setup (POP3/IMAP/MAPI or Exchange Server)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue occurs on multiple computers, then you may also post your question in TechNet forum for Outlook IT Pro mentioned below for better suggestions:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the details and hope the link provided is helpful to you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Changing the font to Courier New in the Composing and reading plain text messages seems to have resolved the issue.</p>

 I try to download something it starts to download and when close to 100%, it changes to Failed - Virus scan failed. &nbsp; It is happening all of the time, with EVERYTHING. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. files and attachments from my email which I know are safe - am using outlook, web and also have desktop client. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2. photographs - have tried my own photos from my sky drive / one drive, &nbsp;have tried images from internet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Even tried microsoft downloads - the systemscanner which I was advised to try. &nbsp; ABSOLUTELY NOTHING &nbsp;can be dowloaded, via any means. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked internet options etc. &nbsp;all settings enable downloads. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find a forum somewhere that was directing people to make a small change in the system registry, and other comments back saying it worked, but I am a bit nervous about doing that, as it wasn't an MS community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLease help. &nbsp; Tks in advance for any solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read something about rootkit removal - but I have no idea if this is the problem. &nbsp;If it was, &nbsp; would it be of any use if I just backed up everything and reset the laptop ACER aspire 5820T, to its factory settings. &nbsp;Would this remove a virus if there
 was one??</p>

<h2>            Delivery Failure 550 5.7.6.4 TenantAttribution&#59; Relay Access Denied</h2>
                    
<p>Good day!</p>
<p>The company is deployed as <strong>Hybrid setup -</strong> <strong>Lotus Domino Server</strong>
<strong>and Note</strong>s client for email communication and <strong>Microsoft EOP</strong> as relay host connector for public domain. This setup works properly and we have only encountered errors and delivery failures related with policies or timeout error.<br />
<br />
Lately, we have experienced multiple cases for<strong> 550 5.7.6.4 Delivery Report</strong> and randomly arises from time to time. I believe the case has been experienced for more than four (4) months and more users experience this kind of problem. I have already
 searched beforehand on the internet and the resolution do not works well with the current environment.
</p>
<p>For added details on EOP:</p>
<p><strong>Inbound Connector:</strong> Only accepts from selected IP addresses</p>
<p><strong>Outbound Connector:</strong> Route email messages through selected smart hosts</p>
<p>I have also configured the public DNS for additional SFP record as per resolution by another report. The temporary solution we are doing right now, we suggest on the end-user to resend and try again at a later point in time. But the solution is seems in-appropriate
 and hoping for long term solution.</p>
<p>I would like to ask for assistance in resolving this case.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi IT OfficeSupport,</p>
<p>Based on my experience and research, the "TenantAttribution; Relay Access Denied" issue might be caused by something related to connectors or any SMTP relay process. Also, you mentioned that trying to resend the emails could be a temporary solution, which
 looks like it may also be related to network factors.</p>
<p>In order to further investigate it, we need more detailed information such as the non-delivery report (NDR) or the affected mail header.

    <title>Can IPhone OWA App save previously used &#39;From&#39; addresses&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andycasey9836  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can IPhone OWA App save previously used &#39;From&#39; addresses&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have been teaching all of my users how to&nbsp;change the "From" address when send mails using this guide:</p>
<p>https://community.office365.com/en-us/w/mobile/owa-for-iphone-and-owa-for-ipad?ss=7df865e7-e502-4fc2-bd0b-20f7d1a0e6d4</p>
<p><em>Dan Park can send messages on behalf of Kim Akers using OWA App on his iPad.&nbsp;Here are the steps one will need to follow in this scenario:</em></p>
<p><em>1. Create&nbsp;a new message</em></p>
<p><em>2. Click on the ... icon on top right hand corner to have a list of available options displayed</em></p>
<p><em>3. Tap on 'show from' to have the 'From' field displayed in the new e-mail message</em></p>
<p><em>4.&nbsp;Tap and hold on 'From' field to have a menu displayed with 'edit, remove, details' options</em></p>
<p><em>5. Tap on 'remove' to delete your own e-mail address</em></p>
<p><em>6. Type in the user name (or his/her e-mail address) who has assigned you appropriate rights, i.e. 'Send As' or 'Send on Behalf' rights</em></p>
<p><em>7. Now&nbsp;compose the message as usual and send it&nbsp;to recipients. They will see that the message has come directly from you (if you had 'Send As' rights assigned to you) or message header will say something like 'Dan Park on behalf of Kim Akers' (if you
 had 'Send on Behalf' rights assigned to you)</em></p>
<p><br />
<strong>The problem with this 7 Step set of instructions is you have to do it every time you want to send an e-mail as a shared mailbox</strong>. something which we have to do on pretty much every mail.</p>
<p>When Office 365 used to allow connections from Apple Mail to Shared Mailboxes there was a two step process:</p>
<p>1. Select "From" field</p>
<p>2. Select address from scroll list.</p>

<p>Is there any way to save a list of From addresses, or cut down the steps&nbsp;significantly?</p>

<p>Hi Andy,</p>
<p>The short answer is no. The from address has to be modified manually every time when we would like to send messages on behalf of someone else using OWA for iPhone app. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>In the meantime, to include this feature further and make our products better for you and others, we welcome and encourage your ideas through

<p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>I have created feature request including clarification on what would be required to make this feature great:<br />
<a href="http://owa.uservoice.com/forums/224789-owa-for-devices-suggestion-box/suggestions/11500011-select-from-a-list-of-previously-used-from-addre" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://owa.uservoice.com/forums/224789-owa-for-devices-suggestion-box/suggestions/11500011-select-from-a-list-of-previously-used-from-addre</a></p>
<p>We need:</p>
<p>- A setting to always show the From address for new mails and replies.<br />
- A way to allow users to select from previously used from addresses.<br />
- A setting to allow the default From address to be the mailbox you are replying from. e.g. If I am in the '*** Email address is removed for privacy ***' mailbox my reply should be sent from 'info.domain.com' and not
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** </p>
<p>I have little confidence this feature will be implemented in any reasonable timeframe, and I have especially as I have been submitting and supporting feature suggestions&nbsp;in O365 for&nbsp;the last year and not seen a single one progressed.&nbsp;This is also not the
 only complaint I receive on a daily basis regarding the OWA App. For example so far
<ul>
<li>Slow to connect </li><li>Terrible to use offline </li><li>Confusing/busy interface </li><li>Doesn't show when new mails arrive in shared mailbox </li><li>Mails missing from threads </li><li>Impossible to find attachments within threads </li><li>Can't edit inline when replying to a list of questions </li><li>no single inbox for all accounts. (including shared mailboxes) </li></ul>
<p>I'm going to have to find another e-mail solution that will work with the built in Apple Mail application.</p>
<p>In the meantime I hope people will vote for this change so it might help someone else in a few years.</p>

<p>My interim solution has been to apply Exchange Kiosk licences to all my Shared Mailboxes and convert them to full mailboxes. This has three distinct disadvantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>We have to pay a £1.30 per month user licence for each e-mail address even though it's not a user.
</li><li>We have to give the password to each user who connects to the mailbox </li><li>Every user will then have the ability to log in to the portal and change the password, and there is no way of restricting this according to my research referenced below.
</li></ol>
<p>The password issue can result in business disruption and with no way of knowing which user performed the change, therefore this solution will not pass our security review later in the year. (nor should it!)</p>
<p>Now I have to look for another solution or inform a board of directors they can't use IPhones anymore because of a compatibility issue and security flaw in O365. At least they will be happy to hear they can delete&nbsp;the OWA App.</p>

<p>hi andy,</p>
<p>thanks for your detailed reply.</p>
<p>regarding “the problem with this 7 step set of instructions is you have to do it every time you want to send an e-mail as a shared mailbox.”, based on my test (owa for iphone/ipad), i don’t need to do all of them every time. i just choose from the drop-down
 to select the address. can you provide some screenshots?</p>
<p>below are my test steps: <br />
1) choose <strong>show from</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=a8938614-3161-47e7-b62f-cdb135060e01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3da8938614-3161-47e7-b62f-cdb135060e01" /></a></p>
<p>2) select from the drop-down to choose the shared mailbox address.</p>
<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d7a3e978-bb01-4ab0-a7c7-a894f94326cc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dd7a3e978-bb01-4ab0-a7c7-a894f94326cc" /></a></p>
<p>note: i need to do these steps for the first time. next time i just need to select from the drop-down to choose the shared mailbox address.</p>
<p>to post the screenshots, please refer to the following steps:</p>
<p>a. click <strong>use rich formatting</strong> to post your reply.<br />
b. click on <strong>insert/edit</strong> media, and then <strong>browse</strong> the picture to upload.<br />
c. click <strong>insert</strong>.<br />

<p>are you sure the accounts you are showing here are not full mail accounts which you have added to the owa app? i can't find a way of adding other accounts but i'm not sure if it's different for the ipad.</p>
<p>the issue here is with shared mailboxes with 'send as' permissions.</p>
<p>i have one full mail account added in owa and that is the only one that appears&nbsp;when you click the dropdown arrow: (i have 5 shared mailboxes accessible through the app)</p>

<p>one good thing i discovered in the owa settings is there is a tick box to always show the 'from' address,&nbsp;so that cuts down a step. :)</p>

<p>hi andy,</p>
<p>yes, the account only has the permission of sending as the shared mailbox.</p>
<p>i did further tests and found that when you give ‘send as’ or ‘send on behalf’ permissions to an account, you need to do the following
<strong>for the first time</strong> to make these email addresses visible in the drop-down on your owa for iphone/ipad.</p>
<p>1) sign in to <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">owa</a> on desktop.<br />
2) create a new email, choose <strong>show from</strong>.</p>
<p>3) remove the primary address.<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=e6718d83-7fa0-4214-8374-64f2fdbd8bc2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3de6718d83-7fa0-4214-8374-64f2fdbd8bc2" /></a><br />
4) type the shared mailbox address which was invisible on owa for iphone/ipad.<br />
5) send the email to whatever recipients.<br />
6) wait for about 5-10 minutes, then you can choose these shared mailbox addresses from the drop-down on owa for iphone/ipad.</p>
<p>i added two new test accounts, one with the ‘send as’ permission and one with the ‘send on behalf’ permission. before i did these steps above, the two addresses were invisible on my owa for iphone like this:
<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=28f643e1-a8c0-49d3-9e3e-4cc7d9c47d40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d28f643e1-a8c0-49d3-9e3e-4cc7d9c47d40" /></a></p>
<p>after i did these steps above, the two addresses are visible like this:<br />
&nbsp;<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=34fe8771-719d-4516-a9ed-ef7d083b9dae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d34fe8771-719d-4516-a9ed-ef7d083b9dae" /></a></p>
<p>note: the two accounts with red arrow are the test accounts, one with the ‘send as’ permission and one with the ‘send on behalf’ permission.
<strong>you only need do these steps once in owa on your desktop. next time you can just choose from the drop-down to select the shared mailbox address on owa for iphone/ipad.</strong></p>

<p>Thanks Violet,</p>
<p>That is an interesting workaround. Given this list is available it should be quite a simple change to the OWA App to allow addresses to be added to it from the App?</p>
<p>Then if the OWA developers could add a checkbox to allow the sending from the shared mailbox address by default we could start to pitch OWA as a serious alternative to Apple Mail.</p>
<p>We have a security review in June, hopefully the app will be improved by then. I will keep it on my phone and check for updates.</p>
<p>Regards, </p>
<p>Andy</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t sync Samsung Omnia with Vista 64</h2>
                    I just bought a new pc with Vista Home Premium 64 bit and I cannot get my Samsung Omnia with Windows 6.1 to sync. I keep getting an error message that Active Sync encountered a problem on the desktop. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Mobile Device Center
 from Microsoft's website&nbsp;and rebooted my phone as well. I did not have this problem with my old XP machine. Any suggestions? WMDC says my device is connected. I am trying to sync with Outlook 2007.

            Greetings Delsvette!&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile Total Access forums!<br />
<br />
Could you please elaborate on the wording of the Error message on ActiveSync on your Mobile Device?&nbsp; Is there a number associated with the Error message?&nbsp;&nbsp; I suspect your problem may be with the advanced network option, which you can disable by going to Start
 &gt; Settings &gt; Connections &gt; USB to PC:<br />
<br />
<strong>1.)</strong> Ensure that the "Active Sync (Sync with Outlook) is select, but then
<br />
<strong>2.)</strong> Disable the sub-option "Enable Faster Data Synchronization" is unchecked.<br />
<br />
Restart your desktop computer, and perform a soft-reset on your Omnia.&nbsp;&nbsp; When both are up &amp; working again, connect them with again with your USB cord and let us know what happens...<br />
<br />
Hopefully your system will be able to sync now.
