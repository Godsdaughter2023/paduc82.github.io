<h2>            CPU Usage always high on my laptop in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    Hi there!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I did a clean install of windows 8.1 with ISO files, and everything was working great for a while.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, suddenly, my CPU is always above 50%. I've already tried doing a cleanboot, and I think it might have something to do with either "Windows Error Reporting", or "Microsoft Windows Search Indexer". I've made a couple of screenshots of taskmanager:</div>

            <p>It's probably the search indexer.&nbsp; To be sure though, try disabling the Windows Search service under Computer Management / Services (press

    <title>Turn off cascading window - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> regislac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turn off cascading window</h2>
                    
<p>Is there a way to turn off cascading window in Windows XP when a new window is opened?<br />
Is there someting is the registry that can prevent that kind of behavior?</p>
<p>Ex.:<br />
&nbsp; Double-click on 'My computer' and on the C drive<br />
&nbsp; Double-click on 'My computer' again.&nbsp; The window is below and right instead of over the first one.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Start 'Calculator'.&nbsp; Leave this one opened and start a new one.</p>
<p>&nbsp; In Internet Explorer, right-click on a link and select 'Open in a new window'.&nbsp; Sometimes the window is over the first one, sometimes it is not.&nbsp; The first window is not maximized but takes the entire screen space.&nbsp; The second&nbsp;window is below and right
 but has the same size of the first one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried many things and it did not worked.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks</p>

            As far as know, the option that you want me to try is only to go to the&nbsp;browser 'Turn off cascading windows' not to really indicate to Windows XP how the position of a new&nbsp;window should be&nbsp;managed.

jit compiler missing or corrupt error the message</span><br />
<br />
I recently drained the battery on my computer and had to run setup three times just to get it to start. Now, the message "Unable to load Jit Compiler: (mscorjit.dll): file may be missing or corrupt. Please check or rerun setup." keeps popping up every time
 I turn on my computer. It is a Windows 7 operating system. Ever since the problem occurred, I am unable to open any program that I have downloaded since first turning on the computer when I received it, nor am I able to download new programs off of the internet
 to replace the ones that I cannot open because the web browser that I had to install via flash drive just to get onto the internet because all other browsers will not open crashes every time, even when trying to download a document. I have returned the computer
 to a previous state twice and still the same problems occur. So my question is how can this be fixed? I need a quick and easy solution because what use is a computer that cannot download, run programs such as Microsoft Office or Internet Explorer, or even
 open a document in Word. I am extremely frustrated by the situation and am desperate for a solution. Please help

<h2>            Mail App for Windows 10&#58; all messages and features are frozen</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a new computer that came with Windows 10. I didn't have any trouble syncing my mailboxes with the Windows 10 app that organizes all your mailboxes under one icon; however, today when I logged in and checked an email the whole system froze.
 I can see that new messages have come in but I can't get them to open and none of the feature inside my outlook mail box are working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried restarting my computer and I have searched for the app in the control panel (which isn't listed) but my mailbox still isn't functioning. I also can't find where I would uninstall this app and then reinstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro - Recovery with bootable USB stick wipes secondary drive</h2>
                    <p><span>Has anyone experienced the following issue when recovering a Windows 10 Pro machine using a Windows 10 bootable USB stick?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer failed to boot after installing the Windows 10 anniversary edition (BCD error).</p>
<p><span>I booted the machine to recover the C:\ drive using a bootable USB stick.</span></p>
<p><span>I repaired the machine by reverting the machine back to an earlier point using system restore.</span></p>
<p><span>I removed the USB stick and booted the machine.</span></p>
<p><span>Upon the machine being repaired and booting up the D:\ drive was&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">wiped</span>, is now labelled as “RECOVERY”, and only contains Windows 10 installation media.</span></p>
<p><span>Upon checking the D:\ drive in Disk Management the drive has been split in two, the first part of the drive taken up by the recovery media and the remainder now as
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">unallocated space</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</p>
<p>I’ve managed to recreate the issue on a Desktop PC running Windows 10 Pro but couldn’t see anything online about this.</p>
<p>Has anybody seen this before or know why this occurs?</p>

</p><p><span>Hello Toby,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We understand the inconvenience you have experienced.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What content is available in secondary drive before recovery?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A recovery drive can help you troubleshoot and fix problems with your PC, even if it won't start. However, it won't impact the other drive partitions data. It’s really not obvious what caused
 this behavior. However, before performing troubleshooting for </span><span>recovery</span><span>, we always recommend to take backup of personal files going into the recovery
 environment using bootable media. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Keep posted if you require further assistance, we're happy to help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            <p>Hello Yashwanth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for the quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before recovery the D:\ drive was just a regular SATA hard drive used to store multimedia for server streaming, there was nothing else on this drive.</p>
<p>There was a third drive configured for recovery, but this was just used to store weekly images of the C:\ drive and was left intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily we keep regular backups but I'm keen to understand the issue here so I can change the backup routine accordingly (ie: not use the D:\ drive for storing data if Windows wipes that drive automatically during recovery).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            I deleted SOMETHING - now my earphones&#47;microphone don&#39;t work&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 8.1 on a Dell. &nbsp;A few weeks ago, I decided to remove programs I rarely/never used, or that I didn't recognize. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I seem to have deleted my sound program!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the website (www.realtek.com) and downloaded a driver. &nbsp;Now my speakers work - hurray! &nbsp;However, when I plug my earphones w/microphone into the audio jack, the sound continues to be routed to my built-in speakers - and I get NOTHING through my
 earphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't have this problem until I deleted whatever I deleted. &nbsp;I have since downloaded and installed the 8.1 update but there has been no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            I cannot see how much power USB devices draw</h2>
                    <div>Windows 10 is not able to show USB power draw in Device Manager. Windows 8 was able to successfully show USB power draw.</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>I have a USB wireless adapter connected to a USB port that, I know from Windows 8, draws 500 mA and a USB flash disk connected to another USB port that draws 100 mA. None of these devices are shown in Device Manager Universal Serial Bus ports consuming so
 many amperes. I can open USB flash disk in File Explorer and I can connect to internet with wireless adapter.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 version is Build 10586.218.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else have the same problem ? Is there a solution to this issue ?&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi Suat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Perform the following steps, as applicable, to troubleshoot USB devices that are not working correctly:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong><span>Power</span></strong><span>: If the USB device operates on battery power,
</span><span>make sure all the power connections are secure and the power cord is connected to a power source.</span></li><li><strong><span>Test the USB connection</span></strong><span>: Sometimes, simply disconnecting and reconnecting the USB device to the computer can solve the problem:</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><ol>
<ol>
<li><span>Disconnect all USB devices from the computer except a USB mouse and keyboard (if in use). This includes hubs, thumb drives, printers, and cameras.</span></li><li><span>With all USB devices disconnected, do one of the following:</span>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>If you have a desktop computer</span></strong><span>, connect the device that is not working correctly to one of the USB ports on the back of the computer (the ports attached directly to the motherboard).</span></li><li><strong><span>If you have a notebook computer</span></strong><span>, connect the device that is not working correctly to a USB port on the notebook. Do not use a USB port replicator (such as a docking station or USB hub).</span></li></ul>
</li></ol>
</ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>What happens when the device is connected?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>The device works correctly</span></strong><span>: The problem is most likely related to power or poor overall system performance.</span></li></ul>
</ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the status.</p>
<p>Regards, </p>
<p>Guru Kiran</p>

            <p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you also for reminding about wireless keyboard and mouse. I have a Microsoft keyboard and mouse combination that is attached to one of the USB2.0 ports. It also used to draw 100 mA in Windows 8 times. In Windows 10, I cannot see how much power is drawn
 by the keyboard-mouse combination receiver&nbsp;from the USB port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the wireless adapter is connected all the time directly to the USB port. No USB&nbsp;hub is used and I do not have one. All USB devices are connected directly to USB ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The USB flash disk is connected only when needed. They do not have power sources. They take their power from the USB ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, this is a desktop computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I already mentioned in my first post, the devices work perfectly. The problem is that I cannot see power draws in the Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I infer from your post, you have Windows 10 installed in your computer. You have checked and you can see power draws in mili-Amperes in Device Manager. You do not have the issue I am having with my computer with Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is my assumption true ? If this is the case, then the problem lies with my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I have answered your questions&nbsp;properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still cannot see power draws from the USB ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be advised.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In order for us to be able to assist you better, we just have a few questions for you:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Were there any changes made to your account prior to the issue?</li><li>When you say "<strong>i log on with it (enterpin) and then it disappearssss</strong>" are you having issues typing keys on your keyboard or the pin is not being accepted?</li><li>Are you getting an error message/code?</li></ol>

<div>No changes.&nbsp; I have a brand new HP laptop with Windows 10.&nbsp; When the system wakes up it asks for a PIN.&nbsp; I am able to type it in (most of the time)&nbsp; Once I am past that I have to use the OnScreen Keyboard. I can go to the control Panel but do not know
 where to specify the manual keyboard. I assume its there somewhere. This is the second HP Pavilion 15.&nbsp; When the first one wouldn't let me type, I assumed it was broken and returned it to Costco..&nbsp; I bought another one.&nbsp; The Costco return policy is generous.&nbsp;
 they take anything back within three months. But there has to be a better solution.&nbsp; Thank you for your interest and thank you for listening to me.
<div>A related question: Is there any documentation on Windows 10?&nbsp; This question should have been answered somewhere within the first three pages of a PDF.</div>
<div>PS.&nbsp; I typed this reply on my Windows 7 laptop.</div>
<div>thanks again,&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe</div>

<p>Darian, Thank you for your patience.</p>
<p>The issue is I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate the OSK and would love to use the keyboard on my laptop. Occasionally on startup I can use the keyboard to enter the Windows PIN and once I do and the system comes up,&nbsp;the On Screen Keyboard is the only data entry device available.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
 am hoping there is a control panel setting somewhere which activates the physical keyboard.</p>

            Hi  Enginner480907 
<br />
<br />This user explains what it means:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/what-does-this-circle-over-the-wifi-symbol-mean/324a1f79-b0ab-4fd9-bbd7-34c32dadfb59">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />The upper left corner has several symbols.  An "*" means available but not connected, the circle MAY mean an open connection (not password protected).

            Sometimes you need to refresh File Explorer to resolve the issue. You could give that a try to see if it works.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Processes tab
<br />Scroll down to Windows Explorer then select it
<br />Click Restart

            Other things you can try too...
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type: 
<br />
<br />netsh int ip reset

<br />Exit the prompt then restart
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down
<br />Click Network adapters
<br />Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />If not, press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network adapters
<br />
<br />Right click your adapter
<br />Click Uninstall
<br />
<br />Exit Device Manager, restart. Windows 10 should detect the network adapter then reinstall it. Check if you can connect and browse.
<br />
<br />also try:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Status
<br />
<br />
<br />Scroll to the bottom then click Network reset.

            Because there are some computers and some computers have not happened, it is difficult to upgrade in situations where the cause cannot be identified.

    <title>windows 7 duplicate folder &#47; clone folder problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> henrygriin  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 7 duplicate folder &#47; clone folder problem</h2>
                    <p>recently I found the duplicate folder problem on my windows 7 64-bit computer, but from a slightly different angle -&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I created a folder in the pictures library, it was secretly cloned in the documents library as well. so, when I created a file in photoshop, for example, and saved it to the desired folder, the file was also cloned to the unwanted copy in the documents
 library.</p>
<p>so I started searching the internet for info and found this:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/windows-7-file-explorer-duplicates-moved-files-but/7e029e21-4976-4f0d-8915-c465f562f43f</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>therefore I cautiously copied my work from the folder in the pictures library to an external drive and proceeded to delete the unwanted clone in the documents library. but deleting the unwanted folder also deleted the original folder, just like the other
 person had described. but in my case, I wasn't copying or moving my original folder between the libraries. the clone files and folders were created by windows. and I haven't ticked a box anywhere that says 'clone this folder' because there just is no such
 box to tick.&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I right-click on the cloned folder and select 'open folder location' then windows shows me the original folder location. so it seems the clone is somewhat a shortcut to the original. a short circuit, more like it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>it seems this issue hasn't seen any answers on any support sites. I was just hoping it might, some day.</p>

            <p>Yep, me too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect I have the same problem but can't find any sensible responses. I have duplicate library&nbsp;folders (i.e. directories shown in Explorer twice) for each of the library categories, they are in effect different views of the same directory, and each has
 a directory of the same name nested within it along with its 'real' contents. Without doubt this is some sort of corruption, either at the profile or at a registry level. Physically getting rid of the libraries doesn't help either - when I recreate them they
 're-duplicate'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice to get some real technical advice from someone at&nbsp;MS&nbsp;who actually knows something about the win7 internals rather than some wild,&nbsp;&nbsp;always wrong sometimes dangerous guesses from (well meaning) users who often have difficulty simply understanding
 the question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been a windows technician since 2.1 back in the 1980's but haven't seen this one before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suppose MS will now ask if I've rebooted the router and the machine!!!!</p>

<p>It is hardly a Microsoft issue (and certainly nothing to do with feedback about the Answers forums) that Hewlett Packard has not produced a Windows 7 driver for its printer -<a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;objectID=c02535920." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;objectID=c02535920.</a>
 This printer is PCL5E compatible so you should be able to use any HP driver that supports PCL5E (though some features of the printer may not be available) or you could adopt the XP driver - see

<p>Whenever you change to a new version of Windows, you need to install<br />
drivers (software that provides the interface between the hardware and<br />
Windows) for printers, scanners, video cards, etc., that have been<br />
written for that new version of Windows.&nbsp; And also note that you need<br />
different drivers for a 32-bit version of Windows and a 64-bit<br />
version.</p>
<p>It's up to the manufacturer of the hardware to write and make<br />
available for download those drivers. Especially if your hardware is<br />
older, it may&nbsp; well be that the manufacturer has decided that it's not<br />
worth his time and effort to develop drivers for hardware that he is<br />
no longer selling. <br />
Check with the manufacturer or on their web site to see if a driver<br />
exists. If it doesn't, you're out of luck. Also check their web sites<br />
in other countries, if there are any; sometimes you can find the<br />
driver you need that way.</p>
<p>So in the future, before you do such an upgrade, be sure that you've<br />
done the appropriate research to find out what drivers don't exist,<br />
and therefore what hardware you will have to replace if you upgrade.</p>

    <title>Computer does not read SD card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> village idiot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer does not read SD card</h2>
                    <p>My computer is a Dell Inspiron N7110. &nbsp;I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 months ago, and up until today, my SD card reader worked fine. &nbsp;As with all others, absolutely nothing happens when I insert my SD card, except occasionally there is a little
 box on my toolbar and when I hover over it, it says "Safely remove hardware and eject Media". &nbsp;When I right click on it, I get the option of going to "Open devices and printers". &nbsp;Going there shows nothing, even though the SD card is inserted. &nbsp;I desperately
 even tried "add a device", and it was not detected. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft MVPs seem to think this is a computer brand problem and or a driver problem. &nbsp;If they would combine all of the posts, they would realize that many brands of computer are listed, and most people have upgraded drivers, as have I, with no effect.<br />
</p>
<p>Please help us Microsoft, or at least tell us that the problem has been reported and that you are working on it!!! &nbsp;We desperately need to be able to use our SD cards!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much thanks!</p>

    <title>Does Intel provide a driver for HD Graphics Family V. 8.15.10.2559 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jbk65  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does Intel provide a driver for HD Graphics Family V. 8.15.10.2559 that is COMPATIBLE with Win 7 x64 Pro &#39;Service Pack 1&#39; &#40;SP1&#41; Update&#63;</h2>
                    Not&nbsp;an IT pro, but have been able to handle all PC problems to date myself, with the help of Microsoft and other user forums, until now:&nbsp; everything points to a flawed HP driver for the 'Intel(R) HD Graphics Family' cited in the subject line.
<p>Unit is an HP 2012 ProBook 4530s, Win 7 Pro x64, Intel Core i3.</p>
<p>OEM hard drive failed 3x while under warranty, reinstalled Win 7 each time from original discs, the last time onto an upgraded Hitachi 500GB HD 2+ yrs ago: no HDD or any other software/hardware problems since then, ever.</p>
<p>AV: MSE, Malwarebytes Prem, Spybot: updated and run daily. </p>
<p>All Windows Updates were continuously installed EXCEPT:</p>
<p>"Win 7 Service Pack 1 for x64-based Systems (KB976932)": many installation attempts all FAILED:</p>
<p>- with all AV software OFF</p>
<p>- have run 'System Update Readiness Tool: Windows6.1-KB947821-v34-x64.msu' many times: all attempts FAILED.</p>
<p>- have run SP1 (KB976932) as 'stand alone' file from dedicated Update site (~ 900 MB): FAILED.</p>
<p>- Update 'Diagnostic Troubleshooter' run many times: 'no defective files detected'.</p>
<p>Every attempt at installation of SP1 gives: 'Error 80070490' which indicates 'missing/corrupted' files, or 'registry errors'.</p>
<p>Without the SP1 Update, Win 7 can not be upgraded, no browser beyond Exp 9 is possible, Google.forms and many other sites are increasingly inaccessible:&nbsp; the unit in its present configuration is 'dead in the water' in this regard.</p>
<p>A representative example of the difficulty this Update failure has posed:</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/asiasupp/2011/06/19/the-error-0x80070490element-not-found-when-you-are-installing-a-service-pack-or-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/asiasupp/2011/06/19/the-error-0x80070490element-not-found-when-you-are-installing-a-service-pack-or-update/</a></p>
<p>A number of posts were found pointing to a defective HP Driver for the Graphics Device installed on this ProBook and other HP products during this period.</p>
<p>HP has provided no 'fix', Microsoft has provided no 'fix'.&nbsp; If I understand the problem correctly, even if Win 7 was uninstalled, and Win 10 installed, without HP providing a correct driver for the SPECIFIC Intel installed graphics device (hardware) on this
 SPECIFIC laptop,there is NO guarantee that Win 10 will run correctly.&nbsp; Is this assujption correct?</p>
<p>Accessing this Intel forum as a last resort in hope that anyone with familiarity with this problem might advise as to a possible solution.&nbsp; Otherwise, this ProBook is a solid, full-size, aluminum-clad laptop that I'd like to keep, if I can upgrade it.</p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>

            <p>Have you thought about installing Windows 7 with SP1 integrated (slipstreamed) into the image? If you do it that way, you'll have a leaner, meaner result without all the updating junk and HP crap. If you decide to go this route, you can look up your current
 product key and then use it to download/activate a Win7 SP1 iso that matches the version and bit you have now. It doesn't matter if you have the retail or OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the video drivers, if it runs on Windows 7, then there is a chance it will work on Windows 10. What Intel graphics do you have? You can check from Device Manager under the "Display Adapters" category.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you already have graphics drivers installed and working fine, then you can ignore the one WU is offering you.</p>

            <p>@aakkam22 &amp; ElderN:&nbsp; thanks for your prompt replies.</p>
<p>Let me repeat a key point again:&nbsp; 'I Not an IT pro', so I will take each question/answer one by one:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; 'Have you thought about installing Windows 7 with SP1 integrated (slipstreamed) into the image?'&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know how you can install a Win update wihtout the OS already installed.</p>
<p>I don't know what it means to integrate/'slipstream' SP1 'into the image'</p>
<p>After each inexplicable OEM HD failure, I backed-up the system onto an external HD.</p>
<p>I read every Win 7 'Help' guide on back-up techniques and 'creating a system image', but I don't think I was ever able to do this successfully.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; 'you can look up your current product key and then use it to download/activate a Win7 SP1'</p>
<p>Win 7 Pro came preinstalled on this ProBook:&nbsp; neither&nbsp;the 'HP Operating System DVD-Windows 7 Professional' disk or the paper sleeve have any identifying 'product key'.</p>
<p>In Control Panel, under 'system' the last spec is 'windows activation':&nbsp; 'windows is activated' and 'Product ID:&nbsp; 00371-OEM-8992671-00008':&nbsp; I don't know if this number corresponds to the 'product key'.</p>
<p>If this is the product key, then I assume that if I follow the instructions here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7</a></p>
<p>that I can somehow find and download&nbsp;the SP1 Update&nbsp;'disc image file (ISO file)' as you describe, then 'use it to download/activate a Win7 SP1 iso that matches the version and bit you have now'?&nbsp; Please explain how this process differs in any way from each
 of the dozens of attempts at downloading SP1 (and the 'system update readiness tool 'hotfix') described above?</p>
<p>@ElderN is describing this process as a 'clean install'&nbsp;(?)</p>
<p>After each of the 3 HD failures noted above, when I was starting with a blank HDD, wasn't the process of Win 7 using the HP disk in effect a 'clean install'?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This was followed by download of the 'HP Application and Driver Recovery DVD' to install drivers and software originally installed on the unit.</p>
<p>After the last such installation, I spent the next few days insuring that each and every driver was the most up to date, as per the ProBook 4530s 'Drivers &amp; Softwar' page still maintained by HP:</p>
<p><a href="http://h20565.www2.hp.com/hpsc/swd/public/readIndex?sp4ts.oid=5060882&amp;swLangOid=8&amp;swEnvOid=4059" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h20565.www2.hp.com/hpsc/swd/public/readIndex?sp4ts.oid=5060882&amp;swLangOid=8&amp;swEnvOid=4059</a></p>
<p>- many of the drivers were updated versions of the ones on the original disk.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; 'What Intel graphics do you have? You can check from Device Manager under the "Display Adapters" category.'</p>
<p>I answered this question in my first post:&nbsp; using the latest version of HP Support Assistant, under 'Video Specifications':&nbsp; 'Graphic Device 1:&nbsp; Intel(R) HD Graphics Family, Version:&nbsp; 8.15.10.2559 (10/21/2011)'</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;'If you already have graphics drivers installed and working fine, then you can ignore the one WU is offering you.'</p>
<p>Neither HP (via Support Assistant) nor Windows Update has sent me any Graphics Driver Update&nbsp; in the last ~ 2 years, I have regularly gone through all drivers listed&nbsp;on the HP&nbsp;support page listed above, but there have been no new applicable driver replacements
 since then.</p>
<p>I've spent untold days attempting to solve this issue, to the extent of my abilities.</p>
<p>I have found HP forum support threads reporting that this driver does not 'run just fine':&nbsp; all further comments on those threads have been locked.</p>
<p>I found a Microsoft TechNet page dealing with this issue, with user comments from 2011 to 2015, none of which offer any solution with reasonable difficulty - I would ask the moderators to please review this, as THIS IS MY PROBLEM:<br />
<a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/asiasupp/2011/06/19/the-error-0x80070490element-not-found-when-you-are-installing-a-service-pack-or-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/asiasupp/2011/06/19/the-error-0x80070490element-not-found-when-you-are-installing-a-service-pack-or-update/</a></p>
<p>5.&nbsp; @ElderN:&nbsp; 'For Windows 10 does it matter that for that model the HP WWW site says:&nbsp; 'HP is not testing or developing Windows 10 drivers for these PC products:&nbsp;&nbsp;if you choose to use Windows 10 some features, applications, and connected devices might not
 work as expected.''</p>
<p>Without any special expertise, this is the EXACT, bottom-line issue I identified as the make-or-break issue here:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>'If I understand the problem correctly, even if Win 7 was uninstalled, and Win 10 installed, without HP providing a correct driver for the SPECIFIC Intel installed graphics device (hardware) on this SPECIFIC laptop,there is NO guarantee that Win 10 will
 run correctly.&nbsp; Is this assumption correct?'</p>
<p>What you are essentially confirming is:&nbsp; 'no, there is NO guarantee that Win 10 will run correctly with the current Intel Graphics Device (hardware) and 'latest' HP Driver for THIS device on THIS unit here:</p>
<p><a href="http://h20565.www2.hp.com/hpsc/swd/public/detail?sp4ts.oid=5060882&amp;swItemId=ob_103472_1&amp;swEnvOid=4059" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h20565.www2.hp.com/hpsc/swd/public/detail?sp4ts.oid=5060882&amp;swItemId=ob_103472_1&amp;swEnvOid=4059</a>#</p>
<p>I currently have posted the same question at the top to the Intel User Forum Graphics subgroup:&nbsp; after 48 hours have gotten no answers.</p>

<p>The process involves many command-level procedures, something I have very limited experience with.</p>
<p>I was able to get as far as Step 1, but was unable to open the CBS.log:&nbsp; 'access denied'.&nbsp; I am stuck at this step, dunno how to work around this.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the extra information, it helps us a lot. Let's begin with the Windows issue and we'll move to graphics issue later. Andrew provided some excellent help on that issue as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Service Pack 1 for Windows 7 came out, Microsoft started packaging it with the original Windows software to make it easier to apply. This packaging process is called "slipstreaming" or "integrating". It is better to install Windows with SP1 included
 because then you do not have to go through the tedious/unreliable process of installing it yourself. You have had the honor of experiencing the "joys" of Windows Update failure. Welcome to the world of Windows in general :D</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now how do you go about getting yourself a copy of 7 with SP1 included?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. See my article&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_7-windows_install/how-to-recover-your-windows-product-key/f032f08f-f114-46f6-ab81-b28004dd43a0">How to recover your Windows product
 key</a></span>&nbsp;for instructions on finding your product key. When you get to the article preferably use the software method to extract your product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Once you've found the key, use the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<a href="https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-iso-download-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows and Office ISO Download Tool</a></span> to download an .ISO file for Windows 7. (An .ISO file is a single file
 that is a replica of an actual, physical disk). Make sure to download the same version that you have now (Home Premium, Professional, or Ultimate) and download the same bit that you have right now (32 or 64). If you're unsure what bit you should download,
 see <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/827218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a></span> link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. When you've downloaded the .ISO file, you need to burn it to a flash drive. Grab a flash drive that's at least 4 GB in size. Then download
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9391b325-7948-4ab3-af6c-91aa30a75627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9391b325-7948-4ab3-af6c-91aa30a75627" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. When you've selected your drive and iso file, click Start to begin the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. When it's finished, you will have a flash drive you can boot from and do a clean install of Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After Windows installs, you can input your product key and it will activate. Make sure to back up any files if you plan to follow these instructions because the clean install will erase everything and start fresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please ask questions we are here to help.<br />

<p>My advice to you was to check online which adapter you had and whether it would work on Windows 10. I did not say definitively that your graphics would be compatible. This is first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, please realize that we don't work for Microsoft. I happen to be a moderator, but that also does not mean I work for Microsoft. You are taking advice from volunteers and moderators who spend time to help users like you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now we know that the graphics you have (Intel 2nd Gen) are not compatible with Windows 10, but are compatible with Windows 7. There you go, one of your original questions is now answered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you taken a look at my suggestion for clean installing Windows 7 with SP1?</p>

            <p>Forum Admin:&nbsp; Please keep this thread open!</p>
<p>I attempted a first pass at the fixes suggested and ran into a number of issues:</p>
<p>I am working through all these stepwise for another try before reporting on this and requesting additional help:&nbsp;&nbsp;time involved is commensurate with my level of expertise.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>As you mentioned, your help is (gratefully) offered as a non-Micro employee; </p>
<p>likewise I've not been able to attack this fulltime for an equiv reason.</p>
<p>I needed to purchase an ext HD to fully ensure proper back-up:&nbsp; more time.</p>
<p>I will provide an update within the next week and again appreciate all the help.</p>

<h2>            cannot get updates for drivers</h2>
                    


even though it has always been set to get automatic driver updates it has never worked, and since the changed the old system where you cou could go to micro soft with windows xp and check for drivers specific to your machine. I have not recewived any updated or new drivers. when they were sending out the list of monthly updates, I never knew which -- if any I should choose or needed. 



I almost switched to windows 7 from vista 32 bit, but when I was notified I needed ot replace my harddrive, vista was already installed on it, so if I did change to 7 my warrenty with dell was messed up. my warrenty does not cover software. 



dell agreed to let me buy 7 and they would help instal, configure, ect. for free. so I bougtht it, only to find I did not get the whole package just an upgrade, I checked Micro Centers website for the store and found out they did not sell me windows 7 home premium because they did not even have any in stock and the full version so I could do a clean install was $

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>There is a possibility that the hardware isn’t compatible with Vista, and that’s the reason you would have not received driver updates automatically:</span></p>
<p><br />
<br />
Make sure that the hardware device is compatible with your computer and with your version of
<span>Windows</span>. If the device is not compatible, you will need to find the correct driver.
<br />
<br />
Check the information that came with your device. You can also search for the device on the
<br />
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=81593" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Windows Vista</span> Compatibility Center</a> website. This website contains a comprehensive list of devices that have been tested to work with<span>Windows Vista</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From: <span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Tips-for-fixing-common-driver-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Tips-for-fixing-common-driver-problems</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><br />
You may also take a look at the article below for further reference regarding hardware drivers:<br />

<p><span><br />
<br />
In regards to the issues with the upgrade software etc., that is something you would have to take up with Dell Support, since it was an upgrade through them:<br />

<h2>            Digital License by email</h2>
                    <p>I had a genuine windows 8 (came with the pc) upgraded it to 8.1 then later on to 10 (all free upgrades) and awhile later the hard disk was damaged and had to replace it, the guy that replaced it installed a cracked windows 10 pro.<br />
</p>
<p>I was signed in with a microsoft email before the hard disk was damaged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>does that mean my email has a license? and if it does, what version of windows is it? and where do i download it?</p>

<p>It means you have the wrong edition installed. You need to reinstall Windows 10 Home, since that is what you are licensed for.</p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span><span><span><span>
</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p>The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft
 Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key
</span></span><span><span>you already own</span></span><span><span>to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.</span></span></p>
