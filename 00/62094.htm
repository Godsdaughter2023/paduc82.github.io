<p>That's a new step to try. I'll put that on my list of suggestions to give to other customers. Thanks for installing Windows 10 everyone. Thanks for helping others with suggestions on what works/does not work. Have a great day.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is the device getting recognized by the computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, check the device manager to check if there are devices which have a yellow bang or alerts, especially under USB (Universal Serial Bus) and other devices. If you find any
 alerts, update the drivers from device manager.</p>
<p>1. Open
<b>Device Manager</b> by clicking the <b>Start</b> button, clicking <b>Control Panel</b>, clicking S<b>ystem and Maintenance</b>, and then clicking
<b>Device Manager</b>.‌</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Look for the USB (Universal Serial Bus controllers) or other devices and
<b>expand</b> it. Now, r<b>ight click</b> on it and select <b>Properties</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the <b>Driver</b> tab and click
<b>Update Driver</b>. Windows will now try to find the latest drivers for the device.</p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b>Restart</b> the computer after the installation and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also follow this link for updating the drivers:</p>

<p>I am saddened to read this response.&nbsp;<br />
The new version of Skype is particular horrible to use and I know my entire company are looking to downgrade.</p>
<p>The latest version of Skype is slow &amp; unresponsive. Using skype in an office environment where you have the app on your phone and PC open is what i imagine hell feels like. Answering calls can require 5-10 click before answering. Often the ringing continues
 whilst in call. The new group creation&nbsp; is ridiculous, now instead of a neat category of chats i can have 5 chats with the same person open, idiotic.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ah well, no downgrade means i will be looking at an alternative instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi, I'm getting an error warning pop up every time I open a new application (sometimes more often).&nbsp; It says&nbsp;GoogleToolbarNotifier.exe&nbsp;(for example) - Bad Image, then &nbsp;C:\PROGRA~2\Wincert\WIN32C~1.DLL is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains
 an error.&nbsp; etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I found some malware, which has been removed but the problem is still persisting.</p>

<h2>            Unable to share files between two computers.</h2>
                    I want to be able to share files between my computer and my wife's&nbsp; We have a home network and as far as I can see file sharing is enabled. &nbsp; When I go to networks in Explorer:<br />
1.&nbsp; I see her computer<br />
2.&nbsp; It asks me for a Username and Password.&nbsp; Is this my user name or hers.&nbsp; <br />
3.&nbsp; Password?&nbsp; Is this the WiFi Password, the Home Group Password, my computer password, or her computer password.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have not found a combination that works.&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to get this working so that&nbsp; we can both use Quickbooks. It would be handy for a lot of other file exchanges that we currently do by email.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that we have no problem accessing two net work printers,
 or sending files to a printer server that handles our plotter.<br />

<br />
<br />Have you installed the Firmware, Drivers and associated software for that printer into Windows 10 from the support page for that printer on the HP Website?

            Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps, Connect your Printer to the computer and Switch it ON. In case of Wireless printer, Switch it ON and connect it to the Wifi network.
<br />
<br />1. Run printer troubleshooter
<br />HP provides a tool for HP printers to troubleshoot - HP Print and Scan Doctor. Download it, launch it and follow the onscreen directions to locate problems and fix them
<br />
<br />Download Link - <a href="http://ftp.hp.com/pub/printers/hppsdr/HPPSdr.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ftp.hp.com/pub/printers/hppsdr/HPPSdr.exe</a>
<br />
<br />2. Update Printer Driver
<br />Download printer driver from printer manufacturer's website and reinstall.
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall and reinstall the Printer (Credit to Andre Da Costa, MVP for providing steps)
<br />A. Uninstall Printer
<br />Click on Windows Key+X &gt; Apps and Features &gt; Scroll down and click Programs and Features &gt; Select your printer &gt; Select Uninstall

<br />Type Printer in Windows Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; Scroll down and click Print server properties under Related settings &gt; Under Driver tab, look for your printer &gt; Select it and click Remove button at the bottom
<br />
<br />B. Install Printer 
<br />Go to the Printer manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers &gt; Reinstall the Printer driver &gt; Reboot the computer
<br />Type Printer in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Printers &amp; Scanners &gt; On Right side, Click Add a printer or scanner &gt; If Windows detects your printer, it will be listed &gt; Select the printer and follow on screen directions to set it up (In case of Wifi printer, your computer should also be logged into Wifi network)
<br />If Windows doesn't detect your printer, then you will get a blue message - Click The printer that I want isn't listed

<h2>            Extremely Slow CD&#47;DVD&#47;HD Read&#47;Write&#47;Copy Performance Using Windows 7 Ultimate</h2>
                    
<p>The PC's basic HW/SW profile is as follows: It was recently custom built using an Intel Extreme DP55KG motherboard and a Core i5 CPU. It has 4 GBs of DDR3 memory, a 500-GB HD by WD and a 16x DVD drive by HP. Both drives are in the SATA format. The OS used
 is the 64-bit Windows 7 Ultimate. Essentially, a 64-bit PC running a 64-bit OS.</p>
<p>Given all the excitement surrounding the migration from Windows XP to Windows 7 and especially going from the 32-bit operating system and the CPU to the 64-bit versions, I find the read, write and copying speeds of Windows 7 quite disappointing. In short,
 I have found the data transfer rates, regardless of the medium used, to be lousy. I hope, after this post, someone can point me in the right direction so I might find out why my new 64-bit Windows 7 PC is many times slower than my older 32-bit Windows XP PC.</p>
<p>To test the new PC's performance, I copied a 2-GB simple data file stored on the older PC's HD, consisting almost exclusively of OrCad data files, to a DVD, first. Then, transferring the physical DVD to the new PC's DVD drive and using the copy command on
 the Windows 7 PC, I copied the DVD content,&nbsp; pasting it to My Documents folder in the new PC. This simple copying from a SATA DVD drive to a SATA HD on the new PC seemed to take forever, never finishing. Finally, I gave up, interrupting the copy process, after
 over two hours. In the mean time, monitoring the copying speed of only 250KB/s and considering that making the DVD on the old Windows XP PC had taken only a few minutes, I wondered what might be wrong with the new PC, suspecting the new HP DVD drive might
 be the culprit.</p>
<p>Before spending any undue time on the HP drive, I tried a USB backup drive containing the same OrCad file, coping it to the new PC's SATA HD--with the USB device attached directly and via an extesion cable to the PC--to become even more disappointed at a
 copying speed of no more than 1.3 MB/s.</p>
<p>Still, wanting to make sure the HP drive was functioning properly and was not the cause of any issues, I used its own Nero software included by HP, to burn the same OrCad file to a DVD diskette. Surprisingly, the drive performed flawlessly, writing the 2-GB
 file to the DVD in less than four minutes at a nominal speed of 22,160 KB/s; 22.1 MB/s.</p>
<p>Now, with the DVD made on the same Windows 7 PC, I again used the copy command and pasted its 2-GB content to the PC's SATA hard drive. This time around, somehow, the copying process went through, crawling all the way for over 28 minutes. Initially, the
 copying speed was 4 MB/s--but only for a second or two--and progressively dropping to 300KB/s and then, near the end of the process, slowly increasing to reach 1.6 MB/s before the copying was finished!</p>
<p>Obviously, something is seriously wrong with the Windows 7 copy/paste feature and it is clearly demonstrated by the fact that it simply should take a lot less time to copy a file to any hard drive--whether the file is stored on a DVD or a USB drive--than
 writing it to a DVD, something the copy feature cannot simply do. In fact, I have also tried to copy the same file to/from another identical WD SATA hard drive attached to one more SATA port on the motherboard acting as a back up drive, getting the same strange
 behavior.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your assistance.</p>

<p>Hi Azam,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your reply. Unfortunately, I have been too busy and not yet&nbsp;able to implement your suggestions and still&nbsp;have to wait before doing so, hopefully over the coming weekend. But I will surely contact you again as soon as I get the opportunity,
 informing you of any results. However, for now, I can answer&nbsp; your itemized inquiries.</p>
<p>1) The DVD used is the Maxell, DVD-R, 4.7 GB, 16x, 2-Hrs, SP Mode.</p>
<p>2) The software is the Nero 9 Essentials.</p>
<p>But please note that I get very good results burning a DVD using the Nero software. It is only when I use the Windows 7 Ultimate copy/paste facilities to copy from a DVD, USB, or even from a file location on the PC hard drive, and paste to another location
 on the hard drive that I experience very slow pasting speed. For example, when burning a 2-GB file located on the hard drive to the DVD using the Nero software, the burn speed is over 22MB/s, which is excellent and taking less than 4 minutes. But doing the
 same thing using the Windows 7 Ultimate copy/paste options; to copy the same file and then paste to the DVD, it would virtually take forever, the process never ending! Even copying the file already burned to the DVD by the Nero software and pasting it to a
 location on the hard drive could take almost two hours or even longer. This simple copy/paste process is done at a crawling speed of about 300KB/s.</p>
<p>3) The answer was no before hearing from you. But after your posting, I tried the other USB ports and got much better results. In fact, on some of the&nbsp;ports, the copy/paste speed would go as high as 15 MB/s. Compared to what I had got earlier, that was almost
 ten times faster. I found this very surprising because the USB ports are rated to essentially provide the same performance according to Intel. I would investigate this issue further and let you know later.</p>
<p>Anyhow, from what I have experienced so far, I suspect Windows 7 Ultimate must be the main culprit in causing the copy/paste issues I have discussed with you. To verify the validity of my doubts, I used two separate computers, one built based on the Intel
 hardware and the other on the AMD's, both running Windows 7 Ultimate OS. The Intel based PC, is built using the Intel DP55KG motherboard, Core i5 CPU, 4GB of DDR3 memory, 500GB SATA Western Digital hard drive and a SATA HP DVD RW drive. The AMD based PC is
 built using an ASUS M4A785-M motherboard, an AMD Athlon-II CPU, 4GB of DDR2 memory, 500GB SATA Western Digital hard drive and a SATA LG DVD RW drive. Both DVD drives are x24 capable. Basically, the two PCs can be described as having been&nbsp;built based on the&nbsp;64-bit
 hardware, running on the&nbsp;64-bit operating system. Both PCs perform with the same extremely slow copy/paste speed.</p>
<p>If you work for Microsoft and it is possible for you, I would like to ask you to try to duplicate the same hardware/software environments I have described here, testing Windows 7 Ultimate copy/paste features to find out for yourself the copy/paste speeds.
 You will be surprised how slow&nbsp;they can be.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time. I will contact you later again, hopefully soon.</p>
<p>Reza</p>

<p>Azam,</p>
<p><br />
I did what you had suggested without getting any improvement from the Windows 7 simple copy/paste service. In fact, I burned a new 2.5-GB data file to a DVD using the Nero 9 DVD burning feature. It took Nero less than 4.5 minutes to burn the file to the DVD
 at 22,160 KB/s (22.1MB/s). An excellent performance. But when I copied from the same DVD and pasted to the hard drive, it took the Windows 7 copy/paste over 15 minutes to only paste about 60% of the file to the hard drive. And, unlike Nero which had burned
 (realistically pasted) the file at the fixed speed of 22 MB/s to the DVD, Windows 7 was shamefully inconsistent. The paste speed began at only 55 KB/s and gradually increase to 3.87 MB/s, over several minutes. Then the speed started to drop down over the following
 ten minutes or so, before I got tired and stopped the process. What seemed very unusual about the slowdown in the paste speed was the constant rate at which it occurred at almost exactly 2 KB/s! It seemed as though some evil gremlin was turning the invisible
 paste-speed volume deliberately and consistently down! On the other hand, since I know better, I must conclude--given the flawless performance by a third-party vendor, in this case Nero--to say shame on Microsoft for its newly minted flawed operating system
 and for laying one more egg on top of the Vista. Clearly, there is something terribly wrong with Windows 7 for being at least ten times slower pasting to the hard drive than someone else's software doing the same pasting to a DVD. Anyhow, I hope, given your
 position as a Microsoft Support person, you will take a personal interest in the issue I have reported and come up with a solution to this very annoying and also serious problem.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you.</p>

<p>Am I the only one who has run into this issue or none of you so called Microsoft Tech-Support geniuses are able to relate to it which is why you have all gone so mum? Or, are you afraid of something or someone coming after you for having dared to tackle
 a real issue? On the other hand, is it possible that Microsoft is back again to its old dirty tricks, sabotaging its own products on behalf/behest of others so its crooked executives can pocket a few more billion dollars each?</p>
<p>Let’s understand that, just as I have already explained in my previous postings, I built the 64-bit Windows 7 Ultimate based computer using brand new hardware made by Intel's latest 64-bit technology, purchasing everything from Tiger Direct--which is an
 authorized Microsoft vendor--including the 64-bit Windows 7 Ultimate OEM software DVD. Now that Microsoft has begun to drag its foot to provide technical support for an issue that is highly suspected to be the result of a bug or sabotage and you guys appearing
 to follow its lead, it is reasonable to suspect the EVEIL GREMLIN I had mentioned earlier might actually be Microsoft itself. Of course, given the company's past shady history, this might not be too farfetched. The question is why again? Is it possible that
 this despicable conduct might be resulting from Microsoft colluding with major PC manufacturers and sabotaging its own OEM releases of Windows 7 to force people who build their own computers such as me to buy a brand name computer instead, preventing us from
 saving a few bucks?</p>
<p>Including shipping, I paid over $200 for the 64-bit Windows 7 Ultimate software to Tiger Direct, which is a good chunk of cash. Today, a Microsoft representative on the phone was wailing that the retail version would cost over $300, which she was using as
 a justification to refuse tech-support for my issue. When I told her that Tiger Direct had directed me to contact Microsoft for support, she claimed I had been misled. For now, I still consider this an open issue that I am in the process of dealing with.</p>
<p>At the same time, I want everyone out there to know what might be actually going on. That, for all those people who have run into trouble with Windows 7 OEM installations, it would be wise for them to consider Microsoft's bag of dirty old tricks and not
 chasing their own tails. Regarding the problem I have run into, I want everyone to be assured that it is the result of Microsoft sabotage and nothing else because I know enough to have already figured that out. Which is also the reason behind my postings and
 to get other people’s attention to the possible reasons for the thousands of unanswered issues that I have seen posted concerning Windows 7, problems that should not be there to begin with!</p>
<p>With regard to the so called Microsoft Tech-Support personnel, I must tell them that it is understandable that they have to eat too, but please give us a break: Why don't you get a job with an honorable company instead of being stooges to a racket that is
 Microsoft? How many billions of dollars the racket has to be fined for crookedness and law breaking, before you people muster the decency in yourselves to stop being a part of its dirty bag of tricks. Shame on you!</p>

<p>Hi, I have the same problem on my computer: Asus P5P43TD Pro, Intel Core2 quad q9550, 4GB ram, 500 GB Seagate and Windows 7 64bit ultimate, installed by certified Microsoft people. All drivers up to date.</p>
<p><br />
The copy process usually starts off at good speed but after just some second it drops, and keeps dropping. The behavior is consistent no matter how or what I copy, but the initial speed differs.</p>
<p>The worst case I noticed so far was copying a 10 MB file on same HD (C:). I gave up after 3 minutes. Estimated time left was 3 hours something.&nbsp;<br />
I have not bothered to dig deeper into this as I avoid using this machine (using XP machines instead). But I started to wonder if got problem to regain speed if anything affects the read/write process.</p>
<p>I am seriously considering to install any Linux distribution instead even though I payed a lot for the OS.</p>

<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>It is interesting to know that someone else has also noticed this very serious issue with the Flagship of the Microsoft OS (operating system) universe; the 64-bit Windows 7 Ultimate! What is troubling, given the thousands of postings for issues the operating
 system should not even exhibit to begin with,&nbsp;are countless number of computer users who have not even noticed the terrible flaw. It appears that most people have already fallen in love with&nbsp;the TV&nbsp;bimbo who has been faking a French accent hawking the OS&nbsp;and
 paid their hard-earned money for the junk of the operating system that is Windows 7, without even knowing they have been taken by the crooked giant&nbsp;that only has to resort to hype to make its billions and never caring about the quality or even workability
 of its products any longer.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the problem the two of us have posted about is caused by nothing less than a fundamental flaw in the operating system's code and is not something that can be fixed by tinkering with the Windows settings through the usual performance enhancing tricks!
 In other words, you would not be able to fix the issue by turning a running application off here and there, defragging the HD, etc. To fix the issue the shameless Microsoft needs to go back to the&nbsp;64-bit Windows 7 Ultimate kernel, its code, and rewrite it
 before the brand new flagship OS can be as good, say, as Windows 98. I say this because I had already done everything possible to fix this issue before posting on the forum and before finally calling the Microsoft Tech-Support on the phone, asking for a solution
 and still getting no answer.</p>
<p>I called up the Microsoft Tech-Support phone number (1-800-642-7676) last week, directed to do so by Tiger Direct, an authorized Microsoft distributor where I have purchased my copy of the 64-bit Windows 7 Ultimate, asking&nbsp;for assistance with the issue.
 All I can say about the devils there is that they were a bunch of crooks who danced around, refusing even to listen to the problem I was having, insisting that Microsoft would not provide tech-support for the OS because the copy I had purchased was the OEM
 version but only for the retail version. When I told them that Tiger Direct insisted that the OEM version was the same as the retail one except for its plain packaging and that Microsoft was obligated to provide the same support for it, the devils at Microsoft
 told me that Tiger direct had misled me. The crooks also offered me to return the OS for a refund if I wanted to but they would not support it!</p>
<p>When I called the next day to find out what to heck was going on with the return process, I was given a different phone number (1-800-936-5700)&nbsp;to call for tech-support. The person I spoke with&nbsp;at the new number, told me essentially the same thing--that
 Microsoft would not provide tech-support for the OEM version of the 64-bit Windows 7 Ultimate unless I paid him $59.00! Since returning the OS would simply be out-of-the-question for me, realistically, I said fine, giving him my credit card information&nbsp;to
 get&nbsp;a solution for the damned problem. Wishful thinking of course. After agreeing to pay, the person put me on the phone with a Microsoft Windows Technical Support individual, presumably one of the company engineers. He was on the phone with me&nbsp;late into the
 evening for almost 2.5 hours, trying everything he possibly could and getting absolutely nowhere or making any difference in fixing the issue, or even being able to say what was causing it. Near the end of the two hours, after I reminded him that it was getting
 too late for me, suggesting he contact me after finding a solution first, he admitted to have dealt with issue for the first time and had to refer it to his higher ups for their research to find out what was causing it. He himself and others that he consulted
 with that night, while on the phone with me, had no clue!</p>
<p>So, stay tuned for the next episode. When and if the Microsoft geniuses come up with a solution for their own failure--for which they have demanded payment from a paying customer to hopefully overcome at his expense--I will let you know. Then, the rest of
 the hapless would hopefully benefit too. For now, I am including a partial copy of the Microsoft e-mail I got after its failed attempt to fix the issue a couple of days ago, to give a better picture of what is really going on. For privacy purposes, I have
 deleted some of the personal references made in the e-mail.</p>

            I have been doing an extensive search on this same issue with no possible resolutions found to date. Currently running Win 7 Pro 32 with the same issues on file transfer regardless of disk, usb, dvd, copy paste. The result is the same. Around 300kb or
 less. I have tried SEVERAL resolutions reported including updating bios and all drivers, etc. along with changing out hd cable, but no success. I love Win 7, but without a solid ability to transfer files it is useless and I'm seriously considering rolling
 back to XP.

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I was finally contacted by a Microsoft Research Engineer--this is the title of his position according to what he told me after I inquired from him--late last night, more than twenty-four hours after our scheduled arrangement, regarding the issue. He was
 very forthcoming and open about the issue, admitting the problem to be an OS kernel/code issue and that it would be addressed by Microsoft as soon as his research team can come up with an operating system patch which would then be made available for installation,
 publically. He also acknowledged the seriousness of the problems associated with this issue. However, as he described it and because of the complexity of the issue and the solution involved, he was unable to give a timetable before the patch is made available.
 He said, it might take a week or two, or as long as a month before we hear of any solution.</p>
<p>Anyway, I guess, for now, we all have to wait and learn how to live with this extremely unusually, to say the least, annoying and unresolvable issue, until the arrival of the Microsoft patch. Yet, just as DustyBe has alluded to, I too will keep my XP dear
 and close, until such time. But, given the fact that planned-obsolescence is the not so distant future for the XP, and after spending a significant sum of money on HW/SW to upgrade to the 64-bit Windows 7 Ultimate, I personally do not plan or recommend to
 anyone else to give up on Windows 7 altogether. Let us face it that we can no longer refuse to get along with any upgrades, PC or otherwise, and would be dragged to go along whether we like it or not. In the meantime, I recommend, for those us who need to
 transfer large sized files, we use a third-party application to get our copy/paste work done, without being slowed down by Windows 7. To transfer large files to a DVD, for example, I use my Nero 9 DVD/CD burning software, which does the job at about 22.1 MB/s,
 which is a highly desirable speed. For the USB to HD, HD to HD and for cross-network transfers, there are also third-party applications that can be obtained from various manufacturers and used for the work, at least temporarily and until getting the patch.</p>
<p>So, again, until the next episode airs, good luck computing to&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Reza</p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>According to the Microsoft Techsupport engineers/technicians--who have been contacting me by phone and via the e-mail regularly since I contacted the company regarding the issue, including a gentleman who called up tonight a few minutes ago--the company
 R&amp;D team is hard at work to find a resolution for the issue, but as of yet none has been forthcoming.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, apart from getting remote access to my computer to examine the issue directly or uploading software to the computer to gather information to gain better understanding of the problem, no one at Microsoft seems to be able to tell me exactly
 what the R&amp;D team might have discovered so far. For now, I have been repeatedly told that Microsoft takes the issue seriously, keeping it open and wanting to find a resolution to fix it. We should all hope so.</p>
<p>Reza</p>

            I've been experiencing the same thing on a Windows 7 HP m9550f desktop computer. Nothing I've tried has improved the transfer speed of the DVD to hard drive. I tried something different tonight and was surprised at the result. I logged in on my wife's
 account on same machine and tried to copy the same data from the same DVD that went extremely slow for me (well fast then slow to a crawl). It copied without slowing down starting out at about 3 MB/second ending up at almost 9 MB/second. No rhyme or reason
 why I get different results. Will continue to experiment and see what happens if I set up a new account and try to do the same transfer then repeat on my own account. I added a second DVD drive because I thought the problem was with the hardware, I still had
 slow data transfer on new drive. m9550f HP hardware (stock config except extra hdd and blu-ray drive) upgrade from Vista to Win 7 home premium version 8 gb ram dual core processors 1 TB 7200.11 sata hard drive x 2 TSST 653 DVD/CD recorder HP

<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the delay in response to your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to use different computer/ display as a second monitor and check if your PC detects the device. This will let us know if the issue is with your device or the TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, try to use different cables and check if you are able to connect the devices. This will let us know if the issue is with the damaged cables.</p>

<p>I am using DVI to HDMI converter and connecting to Sony Bravia TV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>TV is not detecting any signal. I have connected the same PC via same cable to Samsung and it worked well in first attempt. But tried different cables, different connectors Sony is just unable to detect it. Every other devices (my dish setup box, ps4 and
 media player) are working flawless with Sony at hdmi ports.</p>

            Hello  Wilhelm, hope this message finds you well.
<br />
<br />Are you sure that your PC supports Mixed Reality? To verify, please download the Windows Mixed Reality PC Check app: 
<br />

<p><a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?ncc=uk&amp;lcc=&amp;pq-path=9104/7269&amp;pq-locale=en_US&amp;expression=usb%20not%20recognized" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?ncc=uk&amp;lcc=&amp;pq-path=9104/7269&amp;pq-locale=en_US&amp;expression=usb%20not%20recognized</a></p>
<p>Also, I would download the latest drivers from the Kodak website rather than using the CD which may be out of date.</p>
<p>Overly long USB cables (&gt;1.8m) can sometime cause problems.</p>

                    <p>I am no longer able to find any documents on my PC using Cortana. When I do a search for a known document I only get "Best match", "Store" and "Search suggestions" which are all web results. If I apply the filter "Documents (this PC)" Under "Best match for
 documents" there is nothing except "search using file explorer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for my purposes Cortana is utterly useless, I would rather go back to the old Windows search function which actually worked. How do I do this?</p>

            OK, when I do this I get no search option at all. Before I agreed to install Cortana there was a simple search icon on the taskbar which worked just fine. How do I get that back?

            Is that going to destroy all my 3rd party apps and subscriptions (Like Adobe Creative Cloud apps and settings) or programs and settings that are not Microsoft? If so it could take up to a week to rebuild, which would mean I would rather live with the inconvenience
 of search not working in Cortana. It works fine in File Explorer. I would just live without Cortana.

            A repair upgrade repairs broken operating system files while preserving your personal files, applications and settings. You won't have rebuild, reinstall any applications or drivers.

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This still hasn't worked. I run Cortana without signing in and without letting Cortana collect personal info. Is this her personal passive aggressive way of letting her disapproval be known?</p>

            <p>It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a link on using OneDrive::</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>

<h2>            asus vivobook S550C windows 8 touchscreen stopped working</h2>
                    <p>For seemingly no reason at all, the touchscreen function of our 3 month new ASUS vivobook S550C stopped working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried the following and nothing worked.</p>
<p>1. Refreshing the PC --&gt; Done, but the problem not fixed.&nbsp;2. Went to 'Calibrate the screen for pen and touch' --&gt; press 'Setup' --&gt; Press anywhere on screen --&gt; no response</p>
<p>3. Check all the drivers under Device Manager&nbsp;--&gt; Human Interface Devices --&gt; all drivers are up to date</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Troubleshooting --&gt; Hardware and Sound --&gt; Hardware and Devices --&gt;&nbsp;let the wizard scan&nbsp;the PC --&gt; Hardware changes might not have been detected&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Went to system restore. There was only 1 system restore time point and that was 2 days ago. Our touch screen issue started more than 1 week ago already. So this did not help.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advice how to proceed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Well I actually found my solution. It's still in the setting. Nothing wrong with the ASUS hardware.<br />
1. --&gt; Device Manager --&gt; Human Interface Devices --&gt; USB Input Device ( one of them is the touch screen device ) --&gt; Properties --&gt; Power Management --&gt; uncheck "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power".<br />
2. Disable the "USB Selective Suspend" feature in the power settings.<br />
3. Unckeck “Run when windows starts” at ASUS Instant On</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
Then I performed a cold boot. Voila ! Touch screen is back to work. </p>

            <p>Hi Donna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please specify what type of cable your printer is using, if its usb or if its lpt. If you are not sure explain what the cable looks like or post a picture. Im referring to the cable that connects from you printer to the computer.
</p>
<p>For now, you can try the following,</p>
<p>click on start then open devices and printers, if you don't see it you can type it in the small search box when start is open.</p>
<p>When you are in devices and printers look for the printer by name that you need to use. If it appears greyed out, it is currently offline. Right click on the printer and make sure the tick is removed from "use printer offline". After that if it still doesn't
 want to&nbsp;print, check the following;</p>
<p>There might be a lot of print jobs since you have tried many times to print and nothing came out. Now right click on that printer again and click on ''see whats printing'' if you see any jobs in the queue, click on the printer tab at the top of the current
 window and click on cancel all print jobs. You will notice the last one will take a while to cancel.
</p>
<p>Now reseat the printer cable again that connects from your printer to your computer on both ends. Try to print again. If its still not printing the next possible reason might be that its on the wrong usb port selected in the printer properties. Check the
 following to change that;</p>
<p>In devices and printers, right click on your printer and click on printer properties. In the window that opens, click on the ports tab.</p>
<p>You will see a list of all the ports there currently is, and the one with the tick is the port that is currently selected for your printer. If its usb that your printer is using it should be on a port that says usb001 or something similar. From here it will
 be a matter of trial and error. If there is more than one usb port eg: usb002 or usb003 etc. Select another usb port, make sure it gets a tick then click on apply and ok. Now try to print. If it doesn't go back to those settings and select a different port,
 click on apply and ok and test again. Continue like that until theres no more usb ports to test with. if theres no success in this try to connect your printer to a different usb port on your computer, reboot your computer and test. If it still fail, try again
 select different ports in the settings I described earlier. Below is n picture of what the menu looks like containing the ports you can choose from for your printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your information, every time you connect your printer to a different usb port on your computer, it creates an additional usb port in that menu that im showing here below. Note my window doesn't have usb ports because im not using a usb printer.</p>

    <title>Invisible and Inaccessible Volume - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carl01010111  say:</h3>
<h2>            Invisible and Inaccessible Volume</h2>
                    NOTE: It should be obvious to you, but in case it's not, where I have wrote &lt;Hexidecimals&gt;, the log did not actually say "&lt;Hexidecimals&gt;", I am just using &lt;Hexidecimals&gt; as a place holder for a very long string of hexadecimal numbers.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I should also make clear that the hexidecimal string is the same each time, it does not change.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>VSS = Volume Shadow Copy Service.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This problem started months ago with my <em>avast! Anti-virus</em> giving me an error in the scan report, the error was that avast!<em>
</em>could not access a certain volume, the volume was NOT assigned a drive letter, it was assigned "<strong>\\?\Volume{&lt;Hexidecimals&gt;}\</strong>" in the scan report, I also could not find any additional Volumes using My Computer - nor could I find any additional
 volumes in Disk Management.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I immediately ran full and boot-time scans using avast! and found only the volume error - no malware. I ran full scans using Windows Defender and again found no malware - Windows Defender did not show the error however, so I took an educated guess that
 something was wrong with avast!, I removed avast! (cleanly, using Avast Software's removal tool in safe mode) and re-installed it, avast! no longer gave me an error with the drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I thought the problem was solved, but months later (present day, now), I began noticing 10 second long hangs soon after start-up, I went into the Event Log and found that VSS was "shutting down due to idle timeout" around the time of the hang. I investigated
 VSS further and found that it was passing a warning to the Event Log on initialisation - "VSS was denied access to root of volume:
<strong>\\?\Volume{&lt;Hexidecimals&gt;}\</strong>".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So I attempted to give access to the volume path using the command <strong>icacls
</strong>(using command prompt, with admin permissions), I received an error stating that this failed due to "0 files processed, 1 files failed". I subsequently ran
<strong>sfc (Sytstem File Checker) </strong>and SFC gave me no errors, as far as SFC was concerned everything was in place, I then ran&nbsp;<strong>chkdsk
</strong>and again, chkdsk told me there was absolutely nothing wrong.<br />
<br />
It seems that my system does not recognize this "file path" as a part of a volume, it doesn't seem to have been registered to Windows under a volume, or with a file name, it seems to be a piece of memory on my hard drive that has somehow been created without
 being inside a volume, and since it's not in a volume - to Windows and I, it is completely invisible and inaccessible...&nbsp;<span>though to applications that scan my hard drive (avast! and VSS) it is visible, but inaccessible</span><span>.</span></div>

            <p>The HP_TOOLS partition is FAT32 partition; it doesn't have permissions. It can't be involved in VSS.</p>
<p>The Office Q partition is a virtual partition. You can't do anything with it. It's possible it's causing the problem but I really don't know.</p>
<p>Your C:\ partition should have TrustedInstaller as owner and SYSTEM should have full control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you email Microsoft at the address given here:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just describe your present problem with the hangs, the VSS warnings and the problem running vssadmin. I wouldn't go into the previous problem with Avast as they are not interested in debugging non-Microsoft products.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Movie Maker was part of the Windows Essentials bundle you could download from Microsoft but Microsoft finally pulled the plug on it.&nbsp; They had warned for years that it would terminate and they finally did it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is 'supposed' to be an updated remake of it from Microsoft but forgot what the name of it is and it is not in the "Store", so may be a program you can on the market.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can no longer download he Windows Essential bundle.&nbsp; You can probably do a web search to locate something like it but will most likely be a commercial program you will have to buy.</p>

It's part of Windows Essentials. &nbsp;I believe you can still download the 2012 package here.
