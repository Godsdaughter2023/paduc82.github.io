<h2>            surface book 2 15 &#39;&#39; - something loose inside the clipboard when detached from base</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>i have a new surface book 2. when the display is detached from the base, you can hear that there is something loose inside the display.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>when
 i rotate the display there is a clicking noise at the right bottom corner where there is the hinge mechanism.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>i assume it is the latch that is loose when the display is detached.&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>but i do not know if this is normal or something is broken inside.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>please tell me if you know an answer to that problem.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>when the display is attached to the base, there is no noise at all.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answer. So it shouldn't be like this, right?</p>
<p>There shouldn't move anything around inside the tablet when it is detached?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is completely new, so I heard that when I need to replace it, it might be that I just get a used one back and not a new one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is that possible and how can I prevent this.</p>

            The game might simply be too old to run on Windows 7. You might need to upgrade to a recent version of setup a dual boot configuration with Windows XP and Windows 7 in order to run the game.

<h2>            Windows 8 Pro - C&#58;&#92;Windows&#92;System32 Keeps Growing</h2>
                    I've been monitoring my C:\ drive for a bit now that I noticed that it dropped 6 GB somewhere. &nbsp;I originally had 11 GB free on my C:\ drive, but then I noticed a few weeks later I was down to around 5.5 GB and this was without any new programs installed.
 &nbsp;I set to monitoring this and good see my freespace shrinking very quickly - within another day I had lost around another 600 MB.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I free'd up a bunch more space by getting rid of my Windows.old folder which brought me back up to 12.7 GB of free space. &nbsp;I've been monitoring this now for a few days and can still see the free space shrinking. &nbsp;It seems to be shrinking on order of 600-800
 MB a day.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The one folder I can see consistently growing is C:\Windows\System32\config (I've been using TreeSize and WinDirStat to monitor). &nbsp;This folder just keeps growing and growing. &nbsp;From what I can see the majority of growth seems to be in the -regtrans-ms file
 types? &nbsp;Whatever file types they are are hidden from me because I can only see them via running TreeSize elevated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas on what I can do or what may be causing this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

<span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>From your issue description , I understand that the C drive in your computer keeps growing .</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>System 32 is a directory on computers that runs Microsoft Windows Operating System. The folder contains important Windows system files, which when corrupted or damaged, impede optimal performance.
 Information inside the System 32 directory is changed every time an operator changes any Windows file or document.
<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>I suggest you to run Microsoft Safety Scanner
<span>&nbsp;</span>and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Run Microsoft Safety Scanner scan to check if any viruses have caused this issue.</span></p>

<p>
<span>Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file</span></p>
<p>
<span>entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>

<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Method 2 : </span></b></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Delete files using Disk Cleanup</span>
<br />
<span>If you want to reduce the number of unnecessary files on your hard disk to free up disk space and help your computer run faster, use Disk Cleanup. It removes temporary
 files, empties the Recycle Bin, and removes a variety of system files and other items that you no longer need.</span>
<p>
<span>You can refer the article mentioned below to perform disk cleanup.</span></p>

            Thank you for your help. &nbsp; This did not work as the regtrans-ms and blf files are still in my System32/config folder. &nbsp;It looks like 3 0.5MB files (regtrans-ms and blf) are being written to this folder every few minutes. &nbsp; Right now I'm trying to monitor
 the registry to see if anything is constantly making changes there or not.

            I ended up just deleting all of the DRIVER regtrans-ms and blf files by using an elevated command prompt. &nbsp;After doing that, the files have not reappeared which is strange, but it works. &nbsp;Before deleting the files I did a reboot just to make sure everything
 was okay.

            <p>:-) That's exactly what I ended up trying.&nbsp; I started with just a few of the driver regtrans-ms files.&nbsp; Moved them to a temp folder and rebooted just to be sure everything looked fine.&nbsp; Then proceeded to delete the rest of them.&nbsp; I left the most recent group
 of regtrans-ms files&nbsp;(just in case the system needed them).&nbsp; However, now when I go back to the config folder, Windows has deleted the ones that I left behind.&nbsp; Pretty strange.&nbsp; In any case, everything seems to be fine now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

            This is a real issue.
<div>My OS is installed on a 32GB SSD, with the swapfile and hiberfil.dat files on a second spinning disk.</div>
<div>After install I had ~15GB free. &nbsp;Plenty of space I thought for the system to run, update etc.</div>
<div>Yesterday I had under 100MB of space.</div>
<div>On investigation, I found ~27,000 regtrans-ms and .blf files in the system32\config folder.</div>
<div>I just deleted them and freed up the space.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What is the average user to do when their OS is suddenly stuck with no disk space? &nbsp;I understand the need for a rollback mechanism for registry hives but this PC is a HTPC with a static configuration. &nbsp;Why would the registry need to be backed up over and
 over and OVER to the point where there are 14GB of backups of the registry from an install that is 3 months old?</div>
<div><br />
<div>This issue needs to be addressed. &nbsp;Old, useless rollback files need to be automatically deleted. &nbsp;What use is a backup from months ago of registry data that has suddenly become corrupt?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please address this issue in a future update.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

            <p>I agree with karnold.&nbsp; My Windows 8 Pro O/S is installed on a 46GB SSD.&nbsp; I used TreeSize to locate 21GB of files in C:\Windows\system32\config, with most files being 0.5 MB in size and many being 0.1 MB in size.&nbsp; I've just moved 40,589 of the DRIVERxxxxxxxxx.TMCcontainxxxxxxx.regtrans-ms
 files to another drive and&nbsp;no have&nbsp;20GB of space available.&nbsp; We'll see how long that lasts!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly this is a bug that need to be resolved.&nbsp; I shouldn't have to risk using 3rd party tools to discover this type of problem.</p>

            I too have had this problem with Win 8 on my SSD, I ended up with over 21 gigs before doing a refresh. It has been only about 4 hours and the system32\config has grown rapidly from just over 100 MB to 271. I had installed windows essentials, but now have
 uninstalled to see if it keeps growing. That is the only program I have installed, and only have a few apps I downloaded on the start screen. Going to see how the uninstall goes. Also, what is the command prompt to delete these files? I am not so good with
 it. Thanks!

            <p>I've just reviewed my config folder again and find that files have been continuing to accumulate, about every 5 minutes.&nbsp; I've now just taken two actions.&nbsp; First, I've ejected a WD MyBook external USB drive that has not been showing up in Windows Explorer
 (thinking that it's perhaps the cause of the driver installation / registry activity.&nbsp; Then I deleted about 14,000 of the .regtrans-ms files all with the same&nbsp;pattern like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DRIVERS{7867xxxx-6285-11e2-be7d-20cf30e338ab}.TMContainer0000000000000000000n.regtrans-ms</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>where the xxxx varies and where the "...00n" varies between "...001" and "...002" and which resulted in recovery of about 7GB of space.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since ejecting and unplugging the external USB Drive, about 40 minutes passed without&nbsp;further writes to the config folder.&nbsp; However, thereafter, I'm now seeing 3 files written every 3 minutes.&nbsp; I tried connecting the MyBook USB drive to a Windows 7 machine
 which prompts me to format the drive so I don't know what happed to that drive but my config folder file growth problem still exists.</p>

    <title>Win 10 recovery disk disconnects mouse and keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> haxsaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 recovery disk disconnects mouse and keyboard</h2>
                    <p>I have been struggling mightily for a couple of days trying to get a new SSD installed in my son's computer. The issue, oddly enough, is that when booting from the USB recovery drive that Windows 10 created, Windows 10 actually disconnects the keyboard
 and mouse from the computer, and then asks about what keyboard I want to use, hanging the startup process at this point</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know a lot of people have reported problems with Windows 10 suddenly not seeing the keyboard and mouse, but the solution generally is to boot from a recovery drive or the install disk. This is worse, in my opinion-- the so-called recovery drive
 can't be used to recover the PC!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it disconnects these items as I can see their lights go out: the wired Microsoft Optical Mouse 200's little red LED goes out (except when I click a button, when for some reason it goes on until I release the button), and the backlit Steelseries
 keyboard backlights go out. No keypresses can cause the indicator lights such as caps/num lock to light up, although randomly pressing keys does cause the Steelseries' numlock indicator to flicker slightly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And don't bother suggesting drivers or other keyboards: I've tried. A PS/2 Microsoft Natural, a USB Microsoft Comfort Curve 3000, and and old PS/2 Microsoft rollerball mouse all failed to yield different results. It's actually pretty embarrassing
 if you ask me, as every keyboard I mentioned above works just fine when tinkering with the BIOS, but somehow the Win10 recovery drive isn't sophisticated enough to actually do the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried every USB port, tweaked BIOS settings for USB, flashed the BIOS, disconnected all other USB devices; nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the near term, I just want to get this SSD installed, and I've finally downloaded an Win10 ISO which hopefully will allow me to finish this task. But more significantly, I want a recovery solution that actually allows me to recover the PC. I
 know the DVD I burn from the ISO will allow this, but really? The in-built recovery system can't actually recover a system? Doesn't this seem just a bit beyond the pale?</p>

<h2>            Win 10 &#38; MS Digital lmage Suite</h2>
                    Just upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10 and it won't let me save photos to my MS Digital Image Suite files. The pgm works fine - just can't save any new photo files. I deinstalled the old pgm and reinstalled it from the original disc but it still won't save.
 &nbsp;Anyone else run into this - and, if so, how did you fix it?

            Never could find a driver from MS that would work......by changing some of the settings I have gotten to the place where I can download a photo if I send it to the 'download' file and then click and drag it to the photo file where I want it. That's a pain
 but it works. Also, if I want to edit a photo I get the msg that tells me I need the 'administrator's' permission - but I am the administrator as the settings already verify. So what do you suggest?

&nbsp; The file "C:\Users\Public\Games\World of Warcraft\Launcher.exe" could not be read. If this problem persists, you may be able to solve it by uninstalling and then reinstalling the game. If you are unable to correct this problem, please contact Blizzard Technical

I'd suggest right-clicking on the World of Warcraft or Games folder, going to properties and then to Security, clicking Edit and then&nbsp;adding the 'Everyone' user to it and giving it full control.&nbsp; Make sure there are no Deny boxes checked for other users either.<br />
<br />
Uninstalling it would be needlessly time consuming considering the amount of patches you'd then have to go and download again.

<h2>            Wireless desktop 3000. Mouse is often choppy and keyboard not typing letters. Not responsive.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>A few months ago I purchased a Microsoft wireless desktop 3000. I finally opened it up and started to use it and am wireless. So far it has not been pleasant to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it worked all the time,it would be great. I installed the drivers from the dvd, and it sucks to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there any tips to make the wireless expeience more enjoyable and as accurate as possibe? The batteries are new. I am usin what came in the box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If&nbsp;I have to keep going back and adding letters that do not appear: I will go back to wired. This message&nbsp;is taking more than twice as long to type. I can't stand this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far this is the only wireless item I am using. I did not install the software from the dvd.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I install the additonal software onto more than one machine (my desktop and laptop) or onto another patition on the same desktop?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>I believe the keyboard antenna is above the insert / home / page up keys and likely toward the front or middle on the mouse.</span></p>
<p><span>If the desk is made of a dense material, it can affect the signal.<br />
To test if this is the case, try to put the mouse or keyboard within line of sight of the dongle, or at least as close as possible and test if it's more responsive or not.</span></p>
<p><span>Try installing the latest driver and IntelliPoint software from the download website:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/download/download.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/download/download.aspx</a></span></p>
<p><span>Although they should be good and charged, try different / new batteries just to be sure.</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, do you have any other wireless devices?</span></p>

</p><p><span>I suggest you to ensure you are logged into an Administrator user account and check if you still find the issue. Generally Access Denied error message is related to permissions. If you do not have sufficient permissions to view the file/folder/drive
 you get this error message. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You need to give your account rights to where you are copying the file to. Right-click on the folder, go to Properties, then Security tab. See if your account is listed. If it's not, logon as an administrator account and add your account. If you don't
 have another account, try clicking on Advanced, Owner tab, and change owner to your account. Take owner ship of the folder where you are trying to copy.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the below link for steps and then try to take the ownership of this drive and check if it helps.</span></p>

    <title>Why is my camera turned off&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dbmsnurse99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is my camera turned off&#63;</h2>
                    Here's the problem: when I click on the camera app, a window opens but in the frame there's a camera icon with a red circle/slash that indicates it isn't available.&nbsp; I can't figure out why this is; maybe my husband fiddled with the security settings and
 turned it off??

            Hi  dbmsnurse99 
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Cameras
<br />Right click the camera, then click Uninstall
<br />
<br />Note: If you don't see it under cameras, look under Imaging devices. 
<br />
<br />Exit device manager then restart.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 should redetect it then reinstall it.
<br />
<br />Check if the camera is working again.
<br />
<br />If you have a third party Antivirus utility installed, please remove it.
<br />Also check the manufacturers website for updated driver. 
<br />
<br />If its an external web cam and you have it plugged into a USB Hub, that will not work. You need to plug your web cam directly into the USB port on your system unit. USB hubs are not necessarily powerful enough to power devices like web cams.

            Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I am feeling a little embarrassed; I just finished with an advisor from Lenovo (I have a Yoga 920), and after answering several questions he suggested I try pressing the F8 key.&nbsp; Suddenly I found myself looking at my face in the
 camera app!&nbsp; It is a new computer, and I am obviously still learning.&nbsp; I guess it isn't always as complicated as we try to make it.

    <title>Crackdown 3 - Please Fix Wrecking Zone Matching Or Add Drop-In&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> badcp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Crackdown 3 - Please Fix Wrecking Zone Matching Or Add Drop-In&#33;</h2>
                    <p><strong>I love Crackdown 3's multiplayer. It's really fun and I believe it was worth the wait.
</strong>However, it seems like there is something wrong with the matching. Almost every single team I am matched into is incomplete.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>It's supposed to be 5 against 5, but I'm always on a team where there's only 2-3 players (including myself).
</strong></p>
<p>It's an instant loss. It's incredibly difficult to win with an incomplete team in this game. Thankfully, I've had the experience of being matched with a complete, 5-player team twice, and it showed me how fun the game can be.
<strong>The other times, it wasn't fun at all because when it's just your tiny team against their 5-person team, they swarm you and you're dead before you can even destroy anything at all. It's hard to enjoy the game. You can't have fun when you're in an endless
 loop of death respawning because you keep getting put into incomplete teams. </strong>
And before my connection is blamed, yes, it's fine with everything else on other consoles, and yes, I'm using a hard line connection.
<strong>I'm NOT using Wi-Fi.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please, please, please, PLEASE fix this with penalties or add drop-in. Like me, other people will probably stop playing if they know they'll almost always be on the smaller team, which is an obvious disadvantage.
</strong>It will be difficult to continue playing if the playing field is never level and fair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I intentionally bought this game at $59.99 because I wanted to show my support for the hard work that made it a reality. I was thankful that you guys stayed with the game and didn't cancel it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, give it the attention it deserves. It's a great game, but hard to enjoy for the wrong reasons.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>This game seriously needs drop-in to keep teams fair!</strong></p>

<p>I've noticed the same thing with a few of the games I've played. I'm not quite sure if it's because of server issues because I do know the developers have said some things from a Day 1 Update about that being on their radar to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I also noticed is that I'd load into a full game but then by midway in at least 2 of my teammates would leave. Guessing server issues or the the fact we were losing. I've personally sent a tweet to the developer asking why there isn't a penatly for
 leaving or something becasue it does seem unfair. Apologies for the issues though, it's a fun game but these issues are annoying.</p>
<p>

            With the lack of lobbying/queing with friends at launch I would imagine that a join-in-progress functionality could make it in the future. Always a good feature to have in non-ranked or competitive modes.

            <p>Hello IcedCornholio,</p><p><br /></p><p>You can earn Xbox Live Rewards Credit in two ways:&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>
<p>1. By finishing the offers located on the&nbsp;MyMissions&nbsp;page at&nbsp;<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/mymissions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/mymissions/</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-or-&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;For non-offer purchases, you can earn Credits by earning a one star&nbsp;MyVIP&nbsp;level through purchasing at least $300 USD or regional equivalent of eligible content. After you receive your first star you will begin to earn a percentage of your eligible purchases back as payback Rewards Credit. Pre-orders,&nbsp;in-game consumables, and subscriptions are not eligible for&nbsp;MyVIP.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>
<p>In&nbsp;September 2014&nbsp;we changed to the MyVIP policy.&nbsp;As a result, payback based off Gamerscore (MyAchievements) was discontinued.&nbsp;Also, as of July 2014, we do not award Credits for Xbox Live Gold renewals.&nbsp;In September 2015, we made some refinements to the program. One change that happened was an adjustment of&nbsp;MyVIP&nbsp;purchase thresholds. If you did not reach any&nbsp;MyVIP&nbsp;ranks with your purchases from September 2014-August&nbsp;31st&nbsp;2015, you were placed at a default rank. Since you were a&nbsp;zero star&nbsp;member, you did&nbsp;not get payback Credits on your purchases. You can check your current MyVIP level/progress at (<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/</a>).&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Since you received your first star, you will now get payback on your purchases. MyVIP payback is calculated as a monthly whole and placed as pending midway through the following month.</p><p><

                    I have made several movies with Live Movie Maker. They would all fit on one DVD, but I can't seem to do that. I can burn them individually on seperate DVDs, but not all onto the same DVD.

            <p>Just create your separate movies and save them on your computer as .wmv files.&nbsp; Now launch Windows DVD Maker manually (rather than through Movie Maker) and give it the individual files you created from each of the projects.&nbsp; Add your title, menu animation,
 etc. then burn the single DVD disc.</p>

<h2>            Cannot purchase gold or game pass ultimate</h2>
                    <p>Greetings, I am trying to purchase game pass ultimate on my home PC and when ever I attempt to click on the "join" button on the Microsoft store, it opens a web browser to the same page but the "Join" button is greyed out and I cannot click on it. I get
 the message, <em>"Xbox Live Gold membership requires an Xbox Live Gold Account. Sign up here."</em> I also get this error when I attempt to renew my gold subscription too. I believe this may have to do with me deciding to enable 2FA during my initial checkout
 on the Microsoft Store app which opened a small window within the app to buy Ultimate without opening a browser.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can go ahead and try to perform a &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System Restore</a></strong> to revert the changes.
<br />
<br />
Or you can rollback your mouse driver to its previous version by following the steps below:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Press&nbsp;<span>Windows + R</span>&nbsp;on the desktop screen.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<span>devmgmt.msc</span>&nbsp;and hit enter.</li><li>Expand the category you want and right click on the driver and select properties.</li><li>Navigate to&nbsp;<span>driver</span>&nbsp;tab and click on&nbsp;<span>RollBack driver</span>.&nbsp;</li></ul>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 pre-installed applications will not uninstall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mnaussie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 pre-installed applications will not uninstall</h2>
                    <p>I have a number of applications such as Onenote, Groove Music and XBOX, etc. that I cannot remove from either of my Windows 10 systems.&nbsp; I have a DELL 1745 and a brand new Surface Pro 3.&nbsp; I have tried everything short of hacking the registry which I prefer
 not do unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise how these "factory" installed applications can be removed.&nbsp; Onenote is particularly frustrating as the click of the pen opens the installed program rather than my Office 2013 version that I am using on both devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, I was going to "chat" but they are overloaded and I do not want to wait in the queue and am hoping there is some sort of sort of reasonable explanation for why these will not remove through uninstall normally at start menu, task menu, etc.&nbsp;
 Of course they are not displayed in Programs and whilst I do not consider myself an "expert" I have been a geek for 20 some years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>mnaussie</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't uninstall pre-installed applications from your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using office 2013, you can install&nbsp;it&nbsp;on your computer&nbsp;. OneNote&nbsp; is the app which can be install from the store, which requires Microsoft account.</p>
<p>

            <p>This is totally unacceptable.&nbsp; I believe it is ridiculous that I must have applications that I do not want and are interfering with other PURCHASED applications such as Office 2013 and MediaMonkey.&nbsp; These apps are expensive and I WANT an environment in which
 they work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a better answer from Microsoft.&nbsp; As an IT Director I want to know why would XBox be a required application on an operating system that is used for work?&nbsp; I have never ever played a GAME nor do I want to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

<h2>            Endless Drop-down Menu in File Explorer &#38; Find&#47;Replace in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hey I am suddenly having a weird problem.&nbsp; Occasionally when I open File Explorer the top drop-down menu (where file location addresses are located) keeps pulling down and disappearing, pulling down and disappearing on an endless loop.&nbsp; This makes it impossible
 to select any main commands from the sub-command menus "File, Home, Share, View" because the computer seems to think the drop-down menu is continuously being selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a similar fashion, all of a sudden in Outlook it will suddenly pop up with an endless "Find and Replace" dialogue box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have restarted both processes in Task Manager.&nbsp; That seems to sometimes solve it for a second, sometimes not at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!&nbsp; This is keeping me from using my computer.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
3rd party programs and services are one of the possible reasons why this issue is happening. To help isolate the issue, we recommend performing a clean boot. Click this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article
</a></strong>and follow the steps on how to perform a clean boot. After booting into a clean boot, follow the steps on
<strong>How to determine what is causing the problem after you do a clean boot</strong> section.<br />
<br />
Keep us in the loop with the result.

            Out of the solutions you've tried, have you tried holding control and scrolling your mouse wheel? 
<br />
<br />Also you could try to roll back your drivers. 
<br />
<br />Could you right click on your Start Menu and click Device Manager?
<br />
<br />Look under Display and right click the display adapter and go to properties. Go to Driver and Roll Back Driver. 
<br />
<br />Let me know if this doesn't work.
