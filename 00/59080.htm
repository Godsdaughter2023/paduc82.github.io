<h2>            Windows 10 Slow Performance on PCIe SSD</h2>
                    <p>On my machine (ASUS X99-Pro/USB3.1 motherboard, i7 5820K CPU, 16GB RAM) with a Kingston HyperX Predator M.2 240GB SSD I had the same upgrade problem reported elsewhere in this forum, but a clean install of Win 10 was successful. I noticed random 'stutters'
 (short system freezes lasting from a few seconds to 10s). This was particularly noticeable when using Visual Studio 2015. The system event log had several errors relating to problems reading from this disk:</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an example:&nbsp;SearchIndexer (716) Windows: A request to write to the file "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Search\Data\Applications\Windows\Windows.edb" at offset 0 (0x0000000000000000) for 32768 (0x00008000) bytes succeeded, but took an abnormally long time (29
 seconds)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I ran a disk performance test on the disk I found the following:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0890fa1c-b25f-42ff-8d7f-0222af9c39c4" /></p>

 write speeds are not completely where one would expect, see:</span><br />

            <p>Same problem on my Thinkpad Yoga.&nbsp; SSD performance is just awful compared to Windows 8 or 8.1 on the same hardware.&nbsp; Clean install of Windows 10, and absolutely nothing else installed on it other than the OS and updates, and the performance is totally shot.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>I had ran the insider previews for the majority of the builds, and hadn't noticed this issue on those builds, but the final RTM really has this poor thing crawling for disk intensive tasks on the SSD...</p>

            <p>Same disk but with out of box z230 workstation 8Gb of Ram no errors but slow Windows 10 install!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially I install Windows 8 from Hp disks to obtain the upgrade to Windows 10. Who has offered at first start from Windows Update! Maybe I need it to update drivers first! ON next iteration. Waiting for a 480 disk for another equipment z230 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Waiting to finish for a PK to clean install</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to update EFI Firmware but BIOS is up to date!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PCie2x4 slot for SSD</p>
<p>
</p><p>Default values of BIOS only change storage EFI BIOS load</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updating as progress is made...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently the problem is is upgrading to Windows 10, only work around by the moment is a clean install of Windows 10 (Kingston). (Who is going to be a solution until I tested)! But I need the PK</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kingston is working on an update for it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 hours in 1% of Upgrading Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>Waiting for PK&nbsp;for clean install!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Well, 13% after 14 hours installing Windows 10 is a record, looks so bad people!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Kingston solution?</p>
<p>Hp solution?</p>
<p>Microsoft?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Updating this post Is running fine now but after 4 days of install once it finish everytyhing is fine &amp; very, very fast. 1400/Mb &amp; 600/Mb</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the in another z230 (16Gb Ram) with the 480GB&nbsp;version (1400/Mb &amp; 1400/Mb) of&nbsp;kingston who is more fast! Feels a little bit more fast.</p>
<p>All UEFI settings&nbsp;ON in&nbsp;the BIOS same Pcie port x4 to drive toi be recognizable</p>
<p>I install of 8.1 Pro from 0 everything very fast! After finishing clean install</p>
<p>I updated chipset, disk, network driver</p>
<p>Start Upgrade process from Windows 8.1 update offering</p>
<p>Same behaviour &amp; speed now in 14 % since yesterday 18:00 on install Copying files 47% 10:46</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm leading to believe is not the disk, there are the drivers on UEFI mode Windows 10 it use on upgrading are the problem! Maybe on dowloading updates prior to&nbsp;first reset needs to download something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But well my two users need to wait 4 days each one! Really like&nbsp;to&nbsp;research this things! jajajaja A must I workk for lawyers! Who is not bad only a fact!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who&nbsp;is really bad is the silence or solution&nbsp;from Kingston &amp; MIcrosoft! If I downloaded the update is simple as include new drivers, updates&nbsp;or correction!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>_________</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speed Up at 50% of copying files slows again&nbsp;at 63%&nbsp;- 18% of Upgrading</p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, after two updates everything is fine speed is excellent! Eternal, but after days of install works!</p>

            <p>Further testing showed that it doesn't matter whether the Kingston HyperX Predator is the only (and boot) disk or if it is the only secondary disk, performance remains poor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Acronis TrueImage 2015 I cloned the Predator to a Team Ultra L5 SSD and used this as the boot disk with the Predator as the only other disk. The&nbsp;Team Ultra L5 out performed the Predator for transfer sizes up to 32K:</p>

<h2>            Mixer grayed out on the guide.</h2>
                    <p>I have streamed with the Mixer integration since the beginning (when it was called Beam) using the integration in the guide. But now all my options are greyed out and I can't stream. I can only change the overlay.</p>



<p>I have contacted support through Twitter and did everything they said&nbsp;(i.e. delete and download again my profile, enable and disable streaming, etc.) but nothing&nbsp;worked.</p>



<p>I can stream with other profiles on my console&nbsp;and I can stream on my profile using Twitch, but Mixer continues to be greyed out. I have also unenrolled myself from the Preview Program because I heard that it was causing problems with streaming but even that didn't work.</p>



<p>I will upload a picture to help understand the problem. I appreciate every help I can get.</p>



<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>You could upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate, download the free Chinese Language Pack and use that.</p>
<p>see http://support.microsoft.com/kb/972813 <br />
<br />
If not, see http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Add-or-change-an-input-language<br />

<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-do-I-get-additional-display-languages</p>
<p>Also, you could use the Windows 7 Enterprise 90 day trial which allows you to test Windows 7 for 3 months free and you can download the same Chinese language interface. You could dual boot it on the hard disk or install it in a virtual machine.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Missing &#34;Repair your computer&#34; in F8 menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> acidwolf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing &#34;Repair your computer&#34; in F8 menu</h2>
                    <p>Recently during the process of attempting to add a new BCD store for a different OS using [bcdedit &lt;directory&gt;] (if I'm correct I think this is called dual booting), I accidentally messed up my current BCD store (or boot files, it was hard to tell) and failed
 to create the new one. So the new OS didn't boot (told me to re-insert the installation disk) and my current one (Windows 7) only would boot to recovery. Using that, I eventually fixed the boot by using [bootrec /FixBoot] and [bootrec /FixMbr]. It then said
 that winload.exe had an invalid digital signature. So I copied winload.exe from [C:\Windows\System32\Boot\winload.exe] to [C:\Windows\System32\winload.exe] and fixed the issue...sort of. Now with it's startup it has a green loading bar instead of the default
 animation (similar to Vista startup screen or WinRE startup screen). This isn't much of an issue, but I've noticed since then in "F8 (advanced boot options)" that there isn't "Repair your computer". Yes, I did have that before the problem with the startup.
 Can somebody help me get "Repair your computer" back on advanced boot options? Thanks!</p>

    <title>Media Player 12 stuttering constantly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zahr dalsk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media Player 12 stuttering constantly</h2>
                    
<p>The problem is as such: Windows Media Player 12 regularly falls into stuttering while playing music and video files.</p>
<p>The problem is tied specifically to WMP12; VLC plays files perfectly fine. Unfortunately, I don't very much like VLC's UI and I've been unable to install WMP11 (which worked fine on this same computer) due to Windows 7's pointless restrictions. I've also
 followed several strategies online; none have worked.</p>
<p>This stuttering makes any form of sound, whether music or a video's sound, unendurable.</p>
<p><br />
Is there a way to fix this issue, or is it best just to revert to Windows XP?</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The first thing we can suggest here is to update the sound card drivers manually from the manufacturer’s website.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may refer this link for help:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links</span></span></strong></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Disable audio enhancements and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click
<strong>Start</strong>, type </span><span><strong>Sound<br />
</strong>2.Click <strong>Sound</strong>. The Sound Window appears.</span><strong><br />
</strong><span>3. Click <strong>Speakers/Headphones</strong> and then
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span><strong><br />
</strong><span>The properties window appears.</span><strong><br />
</strong><span>4. Click the <strong>Enhancements</strong> Tab.</span><strong><br />
</strong><span>5. Click to check the <strong>Disable all enhancements</strong> checkbox.</span><strong><br />
</strong><span>6. Click <strong>Apply</strong> and then
<strong>OK</strong>.</span><strong><br />
</strong><span>The properties window closes.</span><strong><br />
</strong><span>7) Click <strong>Apply</strong> and then
<strong>OK</strong>. The sound window closes.</span></span></p>

</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Another thing you can try is to t<strong>urn Off the SRS WOW effects</strong> settings in
<strong>Windows Media Player</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps below to do the same. Another user seems to have resolved a similar issue by turning off the SRS WOW effects.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1) Click
<strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>All Programs</strong>, and then click <strong>
Windows Media Player</strong>.<br />
2) In <strong>Now Playing mode</strong>, <strong>right-click</strong> an <strong>
open space</strong> in the <strong>Player</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Tips: If the Player is currently open and you are in Library mode, click the View, then choose</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now playing to switch it to the Now playing mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3) Point to
<strong>Enhancements</strong>, and then click <strong>SRS WOW Effects</strong>.<br />
4) "<strong>SRS Wow Effects</strong>" panel will appear at the top. From here you can turn off the feature.</span></span></p>

    <title>Bsod every few hours in dell xps 9550 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abdellahrami  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bsod every few hours in dell xps 9550</h2>
                    Hello, i have a dell xps 15 9550 that i bought nearly a year ago, and lately i formated it and istalled a new windows 10, and after 2 days of that i started getting bsods (and the computer restart) every few hours, sometimes every 1h30 and other times
 it can go to 5h or more, but that only when i work with it, but when the laptop is idle ( the laptop is on but i don't touch it ) the bsod doesn't happen even if i let it like that for 2 days ( i deactivated the automatic hibernate ). The most common error
 is CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED but i also get a lot of other message errors, one-time i even got an osod&nbsp; ( orange screen of death ), i re-formated the laptop but that didn't solve the problem ( after i re-formated it, it worked perfectly for nearly a whole day
 and after that the problem returned), and i upgraded it to creators update, still the problem persist.<br />
Here's some other symptoms :<br />
- when i'm playing music, whether in laptop's speakers or through my head speakers, and the bsod happen, the music stop and a loud buzzing replace it.
<br />
- sometimes before the bsod happen i experience a bug, where everything stops and i can't even move the mouse.
<br />
- i did a lot of diagnostics of the computer hardware and the results of all of them say that there's no problem in the hardware.
<br />
- the last error i got was KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR white the note, Failed item : tpm.sys<br />
- after the format, i installed all the available drivers from dell's website, the problem persist.

<p><br />
==================================================<br />
<br />
File Explorer - Right Click the hard drive (usually C: ) - Properties - Tools tab - Error Checking - Check.<br />
<br />
-------------<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : <br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView -<strong>&nbsp;set
</strong><br />
<strong>VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers </strong>- update&nbsp;those without Dump in their names (and<br />
<strong>BIOS and chipset drivers</strong>).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

</p>
<p><br />
====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

For the Windows&nbsp;Memory Diagnostic Tool.<br />
<br />
Type in Cortana's search box -&gt;&nbsp; Windows Memory Diagnostics&nbsp;<br />

After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run <br />

<p><br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable</p>

Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. <br />
Also check with&nbsp;MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can <br />
analyze it.<br />

Hope this helps. <br />

<p>Hi, thanks a lot for your reply, i just did the system file checker scan and the result was that there was no missing or corrupted system files. For the virus scan, i lately did a scan with avast that also said their no viruses at all. And for the troubleshooter
 for blue screen errors, it&nbsp;proposed me 4 solutions :</p>
<p>1 - check for updates : i have done all the available windows update, but the&nbsp;problem&nbsp;persist.</p>
<p>2 - remove external hardware : i tried this solutions by removing all the external hardware, the&nbsp;problem&nbsp;persist.</p>
<p>3 - remove software : i suspected google chrome to be the cause so i uninstalled it, but the&nbsp;problem&nbsp;persisted, i don't have a lot of software since like i said i just formatted it so i don't think software is the cause.</p>
<p>the last solution was to do a clean boot, i still haven't tried that, i'm gonna try it today and tell you if the&nbsp;problem&nbsp;persist in the clean boot or not, but can you please tell right now what should i do if the&nbsp;problem do or doesn't occur while in the
 clean boot ? thanks a lot for your help.</p>

<p>Thank you for your response. Performing a clean boot lets your PC start using minimal set of drivers and startup programs. It also helps eliminate software conflicts that might have occurred when a new program was installed. It also helps us isolate the
 cause of the issue. Once done doing the clean boot and the issue still persists, you can try doing the troubleshooting steps provided above this thread by one of our community MVPs,

<h3> jaimejay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turn Windows features on or off  Windows 10 can someonehelp me configure it&#63;</h2>
                    Nothing opens on the Desktop . I started a Microsoft C+ for beginners course and got Microsoft&nbsp;&nbsp;Visual Studio. Accomplished my first 3 lessons fine but now can go no further because Windows File Explorer refuses to open from files or the start menue or
 settings. In trying to get things to work may&nbsp; have changed settings or maybe the settings are the reason&nbsp;for nothing working in the first place its the free win 10 upgrade so I have no disks to restore from at least my pc worked in Windows 8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; . I
 need help to check or uncheck Windows features because even after looking up what these features each are I have just become more confused. Like matybe&nbsp;should I just turn everything to on asp net and all to get something to open I know that's not good either.&nbsp;

    <title>GTA IV MODDERS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gold3n soldier  say:</h3>
<h2>            GTA IV MODDERS</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, (hope to post in good section)</p>
<p>i play a lot on GTA. Love this game, but with all update as xboxlive did, modders stay in, and that is a shame.</p>
<p>When i play with friends in friendmatchmaking free mode, we always find the same modders. They Always freeze the xbox device and play unfair coz they are Almighty.</p>
<p>We complaint lot of time on their but, nothing happen on these cheaters. We're fed up today, cause we are always afraid to be freezed and mores...</p>
<p>Actually we meet the same famous modders team on GTA "SWAT I" "FLOODS" "TONTON", they always attack us, threaten us, and mores...Last time they said if you complain us, we hack your account and your friends
 accounts too.</p>
<p>So what is the process now to play with fair people, and to use a safe xboxlive? all complaints are checked?</p>
<p>what is your advice to play on xboxlive safely? What is the way in futur to be not afraid to play online?</p>
<p>and if they hack our accounts what can we do after they did it?</p>
<p>I already call xboxlive, they said "we can't do anything, we just manage your subscription fees..."</p>
<p>(Alright and cool... but after we paid a subscription, who can we contact to play safely?)</p>
<p>So who can do something about modders like people we meet? the update do nothing! the complaints do nothing! Avoid this player do nothing!</p>
<p>We know today you work on it to render it safely but please help GTA players to play safely.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading me and reply me in next post.</p>

<p>Let me know if you don't understand some part of it (i'm french...)</p>

<p>Alright, i have to complain more and more so.. </p>
<p>and about if they hack my account or friends account cause they threaten me and my friends, what can we do to keep our account safely and if they did it can we hope to find our account access?</p>
<p>About speak of name other players within the forums here, never did it, i just speak about famous modders team, who afraid lot of people, but with time may be we find safe xboxlive gaming..</p>
<p>my last ask is how many time complaint take to be checked and if all complaint are really checked? complaints about cheatting or modding, are they more importants than tchat complaints or other complaints?</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply!</p>

<p>And i forgot something. you say :</p>
<p>"It is the responsibility of the Game Developer to fix their game to disallow the use of mods/cheats."</p>
<p>But modders can only play with mods by using xbox flash on their drive, or modify their xbox, so xboxlive can do lot of by banned people who flash and modify xbox, no?</p>
<p>with all update we see on this game, modders stay always, but the update are here to delete modders on GTA free mode, its crazy so..</p>
<p>I think today lot of people dont know what they can do to play safely, so may be its time to tell how we can help xboxlive to play more safely, if complaints are not checked or if they are but nothing happen...</p>
<p>you have to dont forgot we paid to play on this service... so in the contract xboxlive promise to render safe and usual service.</p>
<p>When you paid a car, you have the car and the security car's included! so why with xboxlive we dont have the full security inclueded?</p>
<p>we just need complaints are checked more seriously, and you see with players help xboxlive find lot of player who play with illegal game.</p>
<p>for example GTA modders, you think they get they legal copy in the marketplace? so all things are important, if xboxlive ban modders, they ban in same time all players who dont paid their game!
</p>
<p>hope you unterstand our unhappiness about that.</p>
<p>and to find in your next post advices, causes in your last you just reply me to tell me "we dont care"... may be that you dont want do that but, i feel your post like that!</p>

 the use of mods/cheats within their games. And no, you do not need a flashed/modded/jtag console to use mods/cheats.

<p>Listen i'm Stupid, i never use the complaints tool... are you serious Ninja? i complaints for it, but you know what, 3 weeks later they play online, so complaints do nothing, how many times its needed to see something happen! Xboxlive have to think about
 a new complaints system tools, like people use this tools with no reason they disable the acces of it 1 mounth for exemple.</p>

<p>Couple of flaws in your logic - <br />
<br />
1. What's worse XBLPET taking their time and throughly investigating a complaint or seeing the complaint and banning without doing any investigation? Bearing in mind the amount of petulant children/grown adults online these days.
<br />
<br />
2. Let's say for a moment I see someone who might be hacking so I file a complaint and it turns out I was mistaken, it's the fault of a game's matchmaking for putting together such a mismatch in terms of ability. Is it then fair for XBL too turn around and
 remove my access from the file complaint feature for making an honest mistake? Before you say "ah they'll be able to tell the difference between honest mistakes and petulant children" I'll say how would they tell the difference?</p>

<p>If investigating reveal nothing, XBL can flag account who complaint and block the acces of complaint for a mounth for exemple. in real life when you complaint about people and facts, if this is false the accused parts can complaints for defamation. so may
 be it can be applyed for the complaints tool. sorry for my english im french so maybe "my logic" is not as i want to tell.</p>

<p>The 'File Complaint' system works on an accuracy-hit level. Gamertags are classified in level of priority meaning those who accurately report TRUE violations actually have a higher chance of a successful enforcement action. In other words, it the 'boy who
 cried wolf' scenario. However, in regards to rampant hacking; an update for GTA IV has not been released in months, so it's safe to say RockStar WILL NOT comply with requests to move forward with any counter-measuring this dilemma. It's suggested you stay
 off GTA IV-Multiplayer until further updates are available.</p>

                    Hi, I've had my pc for over a year now with no problems, however recently when gaming I get this blue screen of death error code<br />
<br />
blue screen of death STOP:0X00000124 (0X0000000000000000, 0xFFFFFA8007E97028, 0x00000000B66D4000, 0x0000000000000175)&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
my system specs<br />
Operating system: windows 7 ultimate 64 bit<br />
Motherboard:&nbsp; Gigabyte technology, model GA-MA770-UD3<br />
CPU: AMD Phenom II X3 720 3.41 GHz<br />
Memory:&nbsp; 8 GB DDR2 <br />
Graphics card: ATI radeon HD 5770 DDR5 1GB<br />
hard drive: 500 GB <br />
<br />
well at first I thought it must be the graphics card drivers, so I updated to most recent driver, and I still get the problem.<br />
I do use an xbox 360 controller while gaming, though I dont think that is the problem.<br />
<br />
recently I ran tests using windows memory diagnostic that came back with no errors<br />
I then ran an error check on my hard drive, no problems there<br />
<br />
I ran a third party cpu testing software that ran for 6 hours "hot cpu tester" that came back no problems too.<br />
<br />
this really has me stumped I dont know whats causing it, hopefully someone here can help.<br />
<br />
thank you for your time<br />

    <title>no sound on tv using hdmi cable from computer------worked before - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jxaxm  say:</h3>
<h2>            no sound on tv using hdmi cable from computer------worked before upgrade to windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>I used to run windows 7 -32bit and had no problem watching my computer being broadcast on large screen TV . All I had to do was connect the HDMI cable. Now after upgrading to windows 10-64 bit---I get the picture, but no sound on TV. When I connect the cable---it
 registers with an audible chime,but it never shows up in sound window when I right click speaker icon. It doesn't show up anywhere in my audio playback devices ( where it used to before).Even when I right click in open area on sound window, nothing shows up
 even with boxes for disabled or disconnected devices checked. The only HDMI driver that is shown is in device manager under sound,video and game controllers, is an "Intel R audio high definition HDMI". However, when I click on this driver, and try to update
 it---It tells me that I have the best updated driver and will not let me update or change it.( this driver shows properties for 32 bit system,if that helps).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read many fixes that only take me so far, and then the next step shows something that I have no option for. I also have seen some responses that blame windows 10 for this----and only they can fix it. There are numerous complaints about this, which
 should have an easier fix for something many people want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any help,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; John</p>

<p>i had this issue, and it was resolved by updating the drivers for my motherboard, which allowed me to sort the issue by rightclicking the volume icon and setting tv over hdmi as default in playback devices.</p>

            <p>Thank you cy414 for responding, but I am not that savvy of a computer operator. I don't even know where to start looking for the motherboard info. I was just hoping for an easier fix because I would also have trouble installing drivers.</p>
<p>I try to follow steps off internet to try and do some of these things, but it seems I always hit a brick wall( eventually one of the steps along the instructional path seem to lead where I don't have the option that was suggested to me). So I go back to
 square one, where another path takes me nowhere also. I wish it could be a little simpler.</p>

            <p>oh... ok.</p>
<p>if you can open the run command and type in "dxdiag" that should open directX diagnostics(might be a question about drivers, just ok that), then post the system manufacturer and system model information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>these should provide the information to see what drivers to look for.</p>

<h2>            Age Of Empires Definitive Edition wont turn on, it goes to a black screen.</h2>
                    I paid for Age of Empires Definitive edition but once it loaded it won't run. When I click on the game the first screen pops up with the logo on it then it turns off and it keeps turning itself off. I re-installed it 3 times and refreshed it several times.
 Please help me figure this out.&nbsp;

<h2>            New to online playing</h2>
                    
<p>Hey everyone, I got an Xbox 360 a few months ago and have been going through the various games, I rented and then bought Halo Reach after playing ODST and I absolutely love it. I just recently got onto Xbox live so I can go online and play but I never have
 before and I'm not sure what the best way to go about it. I don't feel like I am a very good player, at least not up against other actual players, and I worry about people getting mad at me for being a noob. I really want to try the multiplayer as all the
 reviews I see for games talk about it in very large detail. What would be the best way for someone just starting out at playing with people online to join a game? I only have three friends on Xbox live and only one of them has Halo Reach but he doesn't play
 anymore so I can't start out playing with people I know. I wouldn't want to start a game and get yelled at for being bad and want to quit as I have seen that you get punished for that or get spammed by someone who was taking the game really seriously and I
 ruined it for them. This might sound a little redundant and I have seen other posts with similar questions but I wanted to ask for myself and see what people might say. Thank you in advance for reading and answering if you do.</p>

<p>there's not much negative trash talking on Reach anymore tbh, one or two people who sing or wont shut up (mute them) but its not that bad.
</p>
<p>Should imagine the MLG playlist might get a bit teasy if us 'newbs' go in there, but there all pretty anal anyway.</p>
<p>Short of that, i have started playing Reach again, so if your a 'team' player, i dontt care how bad you are, hit me up on there</p>

<p>I think it would be more fun playing with real friends but like I said, I don't have any that play Halo or even have Xbox's. I did just try playing a campaign game online and I did pretty good I think. Pretty much everyone kept leaving the game except for
 this one guy who stayed through to a second mission before quitting. We were also playing on Legendary and I was about matched with the guy I was playing with. No talking at all though which I never quite get.</p>

<p>Play Rumble Pit to get a feel for your skill against others and learn the multi-player maps. Then check out Infection (it's zombie tag) Otherwise jump in and just go for it. If you were holding your own on Legendary you should do okay online. But watchout,
 vs humans is a lot different than vs AI.</p>

            <p>I also found out a thread about this bug on the TechNet forums:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/ea67f8a8-218a-4fbd-9f03-0c6232ce856a/windows-10-calendar-bug?forum=win10itprogenera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10 Calendar Bug</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can confirm this bug is present when my Time Zone, UTC-04:30 Caracas, is selected. It seems to be the only one affected, as the calendar on the system tray (down-right on the taskbar) is back to normal with all other time zones so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how it's like when selecting Caracas as the time zone</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2daafb8-1faf-440b-9392-d2bdd828ae96" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>And this is how it should be with another time zone. The one selected is UTC-05:00 Bogota, Lima, Quito, Rio Branco.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/21ae22f8-4a12-411e-94e6-b4b4a83042f1" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note the other clock I added for the time the screenshot was taken on my laptop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this problem can be replicated on your machines, but this didn't happen on Win8.1. So please, would you kindly fix this on your next update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.: By the way, I'm from Caracas, Venezuela.</p>

    <title>White screen after sleep mode - Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            White screen after sleep mode - Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>I've started getting a white screen when I try to log in if I let the PC go into sleep mode.&nbsp; The only recovery is to take out the battery and power, discharge the power charger, and do a restart. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem occurs if I close the lid on my laptop when I'm finished with it, OR let&nbsp; it to go to sleep mode&nbsp; on the timers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all started after the Windows updates on 12/21/2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The temporary workaround is to set all the sleep timer settings (battery, Power, etc) to "Never", and to remember to shutdown each time I'm finished before closing the lid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is&nbsp; there a fix for this?&nbsp; My laptop is a Dell Inspiron 7353.&nbsp; All Dell updates are installed as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Hi Ellie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You concern about the performance of your device can be due to the changes in its configuration and/or broken system files. To better understand your concern, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you've made changes in the settings of your device after installing the specified Windows Update.</li><li>The version and build of Windows 10 that you're using on your device. To check this, you can perform the steps posted on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we'd recommend updating the display drivers on your device to isolate your concern. To do this, we'd recommend performing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search and launch Device Manager using Cortana.</li><li>Locate and collapse the Display adapters category.</li><li>Right-click on each of the drivers listed, and then select Properties.</li><li>In the Driver tab, click on Update Driver.</li><li>Follow on-screen prompts.</li><li>Restart your device.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Note: If prompted that there's no available update, you can check the manufacturer's website to validate. If the above steps doesn't suffice, you can uninstall the driver by selecting Uninstall in step 4. If the Roll Back Driver is available/lit, you can
 use this to revert to the previously working driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

 any time the computer went to sleep or the lid was closed.&nbsp; When will this be patched?&nbsp;

            I am having the same problem, and it happened almost the same time as you (Ellie Miller) mentioned, after updating windows 10. My computer is HP ENVY x360, a $1000 one, and it is imbuing lots of regrets in me about buying this laptop. Every time the device
 sleeps or automatically turns off, the screen will turn completely white with vertical lines, just like in the picture of Ellie Miller, every time I turn it on. Oh my gosh, it is annoying as heck! I have to restart my computer over and over and over again
 by shutting down and turn it back on. Then recently, the screen, after being restarted, starts to flash repeatedly on the outer parts like it lacks power or something. Please help me with this, I'm on the verge of breaking down in tears :(.

<p>I understand your pain!&nbsp; At one point, I had the same issue with the flashing and outer parts of the screen dimming then turning black</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem -- according to posts I read here -- was that the Fall Creators Update installed the wrong version of the display adapter driver.&nbsp; However, I read enough other posts about a whole range of problems that I decided to go back to the previous&nbsp;version.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I rolled back to 1703, I also prevented the Fall Creators Update from automatically installing again by using the utility "wushowhide.diagcab" which I found somewhere on this forum.&nbsp; It allows you to block specific updates.&nbsp; I blocked the "Feature
 Update to Windows 10, version 1709".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything has been running smoothly since then.&nbsp; If you use Office 365, it will keep saying it has updates to install, but I just x out of that message and it's fine.</p>
<p>I'm waiting for Microsoft to post something saying they have fixed the bugs. </p>

<p>
</p><p>I copied the following from one of Andre Da Costa's posts.&nbsp; If you haven't seen those they are worth checking out.&nbsp; He seems to have a good handle on all this.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Option 3: <br />
<br />
Use Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update: <br />
<br />
Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />
Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
