<h2>            MS Access - How to simplify the Northwind template</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to "dumb down" the Northwind template on MS Access - obviously I'm NOT a DB Developer.&nbsp; Many of the functionalities are perfect for my small business but there are some I don't need.&nbsp; When I try to remove them (deleting relationships &amp; unlocking
 fields, etc) the changes trickle down and render the form useless.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hand-make all the products in my business.&nbsp; Therefore there's no need for any of the purchasing, inventory tracking functions.&nbsp; I go to enter an order and I'm getting the error "insufficient inventory".&nbsp; I've tried entering a qty of 100 into the table
 but to no avail.&nbsp; There are so many tables, queries, and forms in this template with complicated relationships - I'm in way over my head!&nbsp; I require a products table, Customers table, Orders Table and Invoice Report.&nbsp; A form for easy new product entry and
 one for orders placed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help you can provide!</p>

            As you only want a simple model, you might be able to adapt InvoicePDF.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
Note that if you are using an earlier version of Access you might find that the colour of some form objects such as buttons shows incorrectly and you will need to&nbsp; amend the form design accordingly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link, copy the link (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
This little demo file contains all the elements you want.&nbsp; You'd need to change the invoice form into an orders form, but you could still generate invoices from it.&nbsp; The invoice report, which is currently very basic in its layout as it's purely for demonstration
 purposes, would also need redesigning.&nbsp; These are only cosmetic changes, however, so can be done very easily, without any need to interfere with the tables or relationships.&nbsp; The form includes provision for adding VAT to invoices, but if you are not registered
 for VAT&nbsp; you can just zero rate all products.<br />
<br />
Note that a new product and/or customer can be entered directly from the invoice form/subform.&nbsp; Code in the relevant combo box's NotInList event procedure caters for this if you type a new customer or product name into the control<br />
<br />
The other thing you might want to change is the invoice number.&nbsp; Currently this is generated from the current date/time value in the form's BeforeInsert event procedure, so you might want to amend the code to generate it differently, or even change the column
 to an autonumber.<br />

            Yes the accounts are interlinked only the difference of password is there for security reasons.<br />
<br />
1. For nokia discussions<br />
2. For Nokia beta testing.<br />
<br />
but the username is same in both the cases. So when you try to do beta testing then apply your 2nd password.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to make the IRR function actually calculate out return instead of #NUM because the defualt GUESS is not close enough?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a row with 0-10 year net cash flows. This net cash flow changes base on the year I select.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my IRR forumla is very simple to start =IRR($E$87:O87,) however, sometimes the IRR just isn't there because the guess range is not close enough(i.e. returning #NUM).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I created a&nbsp;GUESS forumla basically calculates net cash flow growth rate between period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=IRR($E$87:F87,<strong><u>SUM($E$87+F87)/$E$85)</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>E87 = (year 0 flow + f87( year 1 flow))/year 0 flow</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This seems to make it work, but i'm not sure why. Could someone help explain how the GUESS part works/ if there are any other easy solutions ?</p>

AFAIK, there is no general method for estimating the "guess" parameter that works in all cases.<br />
<br />
(Hmm, I wonder if MIRR would be suitable "guess".&nbsp; I have not tried it myself.)<br />
<br />
First, note there are cash flows for which the IRR method (not just the Excel implementation) does not work.<br />
<br />
Second, note that there are cash flows for which the Excel implementation of the IRR method does not work.&nbsp; (That might be less true in Excel 2010, which re-engineered the IRR implementation to some degree, according to Microsoft.)<br />
<br />
Finally, where or not a "guess" parameter works depends on the nature of the cash flows.<br />
<br />
It is both easy and hard to explain how the "guess" parameter influences the behavior of the Excel IRR implementation.&nbsp; The ease of explanation depends, in part, on your mathematical background and your ability to gronk mathematical algorithms.<br />
<br />
To start, you might take a look at the wiki pages for the IRR method [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_rate_of_return" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click here</a>] and for the Newton-Raphson and Secant methods of approximation [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click
 here</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_method" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click here</a>] [1].<br />
<br />
To over-simplify, one approach to determining IRR is to guess what it is, then use that guess to compute the NPV.&nbsp; If the NPV is "close" to zero, we are done.&nbsp; Otherwise, choose a new guess that is between the current guess and some boundary; then repeat the
 process.&nbsp; (The initial boundaries might be based on the initial guess as well.)<br />
<br />
One of the problems with the Excel implementation is that it has a fairly small arbitrary limit on the number of iterations before giving up.&nbsp; That limit is 20, according to the IRR help page.<br />
<br />
Another problem with the Excel implemenation is that it is not capable of restarting with a different guess automatically if the initial guess does not seem to converge on a reasonable answer.&nbsp; I suspect that (even) the HP-12C calculator, which requires no
 guess, does exactly that.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, again, there are cash flows for which no IRR implementation can find a solution.<br />
<br />
EA wrote:<br />
<blockquote>I created a&nbsp;GUESS forumla basically calculates net cash flow growth rate between period.
<p>=IRR($E$87:F87,<strong><u>SUM($E$87+F87)/$E$85)</u></strong></p>
<p>E87 = (year 0 flow + f87( year 1 flow))/year 0 flow&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>
<br />
Aside....<br />
<br />
You do not need SUM in that formula.&nbsp; ($E$87+F87)/$E$85 [sic] would suffice.<br />
<br />
Also, you do not need IRR for those particular parameters.&nbsp; Since there are only 2 data points, the IRR (CAGR) [2] is simply -F87/$E$87-1.&nbsp; The unary negative is needed because one of E87 and F87 should be negative.<br />
<br />
(Is there a typo in your formula, and you meant to write $E$87 in the denominator?&nbsp; That would make more sense; in fact, then it is simply the formula in my second paragraph above.)<br />
<br />
But I believe that I tried ($E$87+Fx)/$E$85 myself in the past, where "Fx" is the cash flow corresponding to the latest period.&nbsp; That computes the CAGR, which seems logical.&nbsp; However, it did not work very well for me as a "guess" in some/many circumstances.<br />
<br />
If it works well enough for you, so be it.<br />

Note:&nbsp; Microsoft documentation claims that Newton-Raphson is used.&nbsp; However, some details of the algorithm in that documentation sound more like the Secant method.&nbsp; Moreover, my own Newton-Raphson implementation often has different results than the Excel IRR
 function.&nbsp; However, those differences might be explained by details of the implementation.<br />

    <title>Outlook Mac 2011 &#34;authentication failed&#34; Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rbeebr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Mac 2011 &#34;authentication failed&#34; Error</h2>
                    Outlook 2011 on&nbsp; the Lion OS continuously feeds me this error message: "Mail could not be received at this time. The server for account &lt;name&gt; returned the error "authentication failed" in Outlook for Mac 2011".<br />
<br />
When I searched Microsoft support, it returned a solution that does not work for me. (Article 2353968 at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2353968). The article tells me to change my SMTP port to 587. This does not work. I use GoDaddy for email, and this is not
 an accepted port for them.<br />
<br />
My email is an IMAP account.&nbsp; I've tried talking to GoDaddy, but they don't support Outlook.
<br />
<br />
Is there a solution for this??<br />

            Hi&nbsp;rbeebr,
<div><br />
<div>I've got a couple questions:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>Has the IMAP account <b>ever</b>&nbsp;worked in Outlook?</li><li>If you choose <b>Outlook</b>&nbsp;&gt; <b>About Outlook </b>from the Menu bar at the top of your screen, what version of Office for Mac are you currently running?</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>Service Pack 2 recently made some big changes to the way Outlook handles IMAP accounts. The update improves performance and might resolve your issue. If you found that you're not currently running version
<b>14.2.1</b>, you can get the latest updates by choosing <b>Help &gt; Check for Updates</b>&nbsp;from within any Office application.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you get up-to-date and it still doesn't work properly, try following the steps below to enable&nbsp;authentication for outgoing email:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>From the Menu bar, choose <b>Tools &gt; Accounts...</b></li><li>Select your IMAP account in the left pane</li><li>In the right pane below <b>Outgoing server</b>, click the <b>More Options...</b>&nbsp;button</li><li>Ensure that the <b>Authentication </b>drop-down says <b>Use Incoming Server Info</b>&nbsp;and then click
<b>OK</b></li></ol>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps!</div>

<p>Hello wzf23wzfwzf23wzf,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way you migrate to Office 365 depends on your requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cutover migration, Staged migration, and IMAP migration are used to migrate all mailboxes from your Exchange server to Office 365. The migration way you choose depends on your Exchange server version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Hybrid migration scenario, you can keep some mailboxes in local Exchange server and others in Office 365 cloud.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About PST, it’s used to export all email data to some PST files and then import them back to Office 365 mailboxes. It will be efficient if you only need to migrate a few mailboxes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can choose the migration way by your favorite and requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Barry</p>
<p><br />

<p>Hi Southwide,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order for you to download the images from the webpage and save them to your computer, kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open the URL that you have on column B.</p>
<p>2. Once the image is open, right-click on the image then select <strong>Save as</strong>.</p>
<p>3. A pop-up window will open then put the file name associated for that image from column A then
<strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t delete style from style gallery in Word 2013</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I don't know is it just me or what but I can't delete style from style gallery<br />
because every time I start Word that deleted style is back.<br />
<br />
I tried options Remove from Style gallery and Delete "style name" but no luck.<br />
Well these commands delete my style from the gallery but just for that time while Word is opened.<br />
When I close it and start again this style is back in the gallery.<br />
<br />
Am I a moron or what?<br />

</p><p>
</p><p>If you have added your style to the template, by checking the "New documents based on this template" option in the Modify Style dialog box, you have to remove the style from the template. You can do that by opening the template file itself or by using the
 Organzier dialog box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To display the Organizer: Press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S; in the Styles pane, click the Manage Styles icon, and then click the Import/Export button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Organizer, click the Styles tab. You should see the styles from the current document on the left and styles from the template on the right. Locate the style and delete it.</p>

    <title>Word 365 for Mac menu labels are replaced with numbers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word 365 for Mac menu labels are replaced with numbers</h2>
                    <p>Hi All:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Office 365 for Mac OS Mojave.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed that when I am in Word, some of my menus are replaced with numbers. For example, view, "Page Width" label is simply represented as "5" instead of saying "Page Width". It seems to be occurring sporadically in all menus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now noticed this occurs in Outlook as well, but for far fewer menu options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what is causing this problem? Have other noticed this? Any ideas on a fix?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Looking up a Contact on WIdows Mobile 6</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just switched from a traditional cell phne to a Windows Mobile 6 HTC Tilt phone. There is much to like about this phone - but I can't find an easy way to look up a contact without scrolling page by page from A to Z, unless you pull out the stylus (yuk.)
 A standard cell phone makes it so easy - why can't Windows do the same?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I just pick/scroll through the letters of the alphabet - I could do so on older Pocket PC devices?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            I use the green phone button to do that. Once the dialer is on the screen, I use the slide-out keyboard to type the contacts name and that works.

<h2>            internet explorer 9 will not install - service pack 1 issue</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows Vista Home Premium, Version 6 (Build 6000), 32 bit operating system (x86), which doesn't mean anything to me as I am not technical at all.
</p>
<p>I keep getting a warning message saying that I need to update to Internet Explorer 9 but when I try to download it I get a message saying that I need to install Service Pack 1, when I follow the links through and try to install service pack 1, I get a message
 saying that SP1 is already installed and in use, yet it doesn't appear in my install/uninstall list. I feel like I am going round in circles, can anyone tell me what it is I am doing wrong?</p>

    <title>Win10-Windows Defender can&#39;t be restarted. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derschuhmacher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10-Windows Defender can&#39;t be restarted.</h2>
                    <p>First of all, WHY do the moderators KEEP locking the threads about this issue?! They aren't choking it out, there's a TON of disgruntled people unable to get this issue resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This EXACT same complaint can be found online dating back from 2010 to December 2018.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, #1 I am somewhat computer literate; I am NOT a guru, but I am the one my friends come to, even across the USA on the phone to have me help them with computer problems. I have actually taught Kodak and MS TSR's things about their products they didn't
 even know!!! So, please don't talk to me like I am a guru, but don't talk to me like I am a Best Buy everyday consumer, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And please don't tell me to do things I am telling you I have all ready tried!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do NOT have any other AV on my system. I DO have Malwarebytes. And my system is always clean, minus 2 perceived threats in the past 2-3 years (time I have owned this laptop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ONLY things that have changed on my system in the LAST WEEK (when it started acting up a little bit), was that I added the German Language Pack and there were some Windows10 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, it started out that the green check was not on and if I opened the WD Center, I would see it trying to load the first icon (shield) and the 3rd or 4th one, I can't remember the names now and the WD tray icon is completely gone so I can't just open
 it and say what they are. They would eventually load, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then today, it would not load at all. Then before I knew it, it said Restart Now. It will NOT restart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even shut of real-time monitoring at some point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I went into regedit and the WD DWORD was a 1 instead of a 0, so I fixed that. Restarted. Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Windows Updates and it said there were updates for WD, and each one tried to install by itself and each one FAILED. Restarted. Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally turned the computer off for a couple hours to give my brain a rest and when I restarted it a bit ago, the WD tray icon is completely gone now. I did not uninstall it, couldn't if I wanted to, the Uninstall, as many have said, is grayed out!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The WD Center is not even anywhere to be found. If I go to Control Panel or Settings, it's nowhere to be found. It's the standard WIndows Firewall options and such. That is it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I did a sfc/scannow and it says what everyone else states:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.<br />
For online repairs, details are included in the CBS log file located at<br />
windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For offline<br />
repairs, details are included in the log file provided by the /OFFLOGFILE flag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the wildcard and located the CBS file even though it doesn't mean too much to me. Too many unfound files, duplicate files found and such. Which sounds like the Win Updates did changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Event Viewer and got a .Net Framework error. But, I went ahead and tried a second time and now there are reports, including critical issues, from the last 7 days and 24 hours-the SAME timeframe as the installation of the German Language Pack and
 Win10 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I again hold the Win10 Updates as the culprit because when the Autumn Installation completed (last year??), it caused a bunch of problems I had to fix. And even though Win Updates runs in the background, I will know they took place because my Time/Date display
 will change EVERY time and it will stay like that for days and I figured out how to fix it. Now I just wait for another update or whatever, and it will heal itself. I even had a MS Tech doing remote access see it in person, the first time and after several
 hours she literally gave up! And she was doing things she should not have been doing and I had to stop here several times, so I will NEVER pay $149 again. I will throw the computer out the window and hope it doesn't hit anyone before I spend hard earned money
 (TWICE over the years) just to end up fixing it myself!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the days of Win95 to Win7 you could find repair tools and helpful how-to's for things a bit out of your realm, like dealing with regedit and such. With Win10, it seems techs don't know anything, MS Community regurgitates the same info and locks all the
 threads, and it would seem to me the only "solution" would be to grab and external HD and save all my personal data, refresh Windows, and then painstakingly reinstall all my programs and extra apps, set up E-mail, tweak everything, and that just is NOT an
 answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS did that to me about an older computer a few years back and after I spent DAYS getting everything back to par, "Oh, it's on OUR end." NO FRIGGIN DUH!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS also did that to me about my Xbox 360. Made me factory reset it, did NOT tell me to get a flash drive to save my profile and after DAYS of reinstalling 200 GB of games, THEN I found out I lost ALL my progress and such. Then after I said, "guess what?
 SAME PROBLEM?" They escalated it and said, "Oh it's on OUR end." OMG!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>HA! Now isn't that funny. The WD Security Center Panel just came back! But, still the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I get in the right frame of mind, tomorrow or Tuesday, I will save EVERYTHING and refresh Windows, but this is NOT the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would prefer a fix without spending DAYS and HOURS to play that game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. And I am online without protection to write this.</p>

<p>I'm mostly going&nbsp;to&nbsp;provide some basic clues as to why such things might happen, as well as why things in forums or support work as they do so you can stop assuming the world's out to get you personally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I proceed though, I will mention that other than the 3rd-party AV issues you already mentioned, malware can be involved in such issues, I'm just going to assume this isn't your problem and focus on other possible causes based on your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that these community forums began auto-locking all threads over a certain age, roughly&nbsp;90 days if I recall correctly, over a year ago.&nbsp; That's all threads, so it isn't targeted at those with this subject, though tagging on to old threads&nbsp;is almost always
 a bad idea, since the specifics of a new problem are often different even though people don't see it that way.&nbsp; Opening a new thread as you have was the correct and best action&nbsp;to take.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for telling you to try things you've already done, support groups always provide complete instruction sets, since leaving&nbsp; out steps leads to errors.&nbsp; In some cases these need to be done in sequence even if you've tried them before, but even if not, the&nbsp;helpers&nbsp;in
 these&nbsp;public forums must assume someone else [like you] might review them out of context in the future, so they include&nbsp;all steps&nbsp;in order for that reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As with most consumers&nbsp;who don't know how to interact with support, you've included some spurious additional information about past failures.&nbsp; These indicate&nbsp;an inability to focus and show helpers here that you're unlikely to properly follow instructions,
 which reduces your chances of gaining&nbsp;aid from the most valuable volunteers who might truly be able to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I stated above I'll just attempt to help you understand why your attitude towards support of Windows 10 may be part of your problem and what I can see in your description that might have contributed to the cause of your current issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First you need to understand how Windows 10 is different from previous versions as discussed in depth in this
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/update/waas-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Overview of Windows as a service</a>.&nbsp; That article is a long, involved description for trained IT experts, so I'll just highlight the important points.&nbsp; With Windows 10, there are two release types: feature updates that add new functionality twice per year
 around March and September, and quality updates that provide security and reliability fixes at least once a month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I bring this up is that Microsoft has recently begun rolling out the fall Windows 10 version 1809 update, which had been delayed a few months due to significant issues in early testing.&nbsp; Since I received the 1809 update just last week&nbsp;on a 10-year&nbsp;old
 Windows 7 desktop upgraded to Windows 10 in July 2016, it's being deployed widely on older systems now, so likely yours as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What most don't realize is that the twice annual feature updates are roughly similar to the old Windows Service Packs in size and complexity, while the monthly quality updates are mostly just roll-ups of the security and other minor updates that used to
 be&nbsp;released separately.&nbsp; This means these feature updates are relatively large and take significant time and resources to install, especially on older systems like mine.&nbsp; The version 1809 update took about&nbsp;3 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've learned is that though the installation processes indicate they can be performed while using the PC and also seem to tell you when it's OK to restart the system after installation is completed, it's best to handle these more like the Service Packs
 of the past.&nbsp; In other words, wait to install until you're done with the PC for the day, then let the process download and install, including waiting extra time (I allow 10 or 20 minutes) at the end for the system to settle before restarting.&nbsp; Then once the
 system completes the installation processes after the restart, I wait another 20-30 minutes before logging in and then perform an additional restart even if this isn't requested by the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for all this extra handling is that though it's got&nbsp;a quad-core processor with 8GB RAM and plenty of free space on a 1TB HDD, this system is old and slow by today's standards, so it isn't always truly done with post-installation tasks when it
 appears to be.&nbsp; Part of this is due to the fast login sequence added in Windows 10 and another is that various checks occur after the reboot to confirm everything completed successfully,&nbsp;which if I rush to use the system or reboot might be aborted and need
 to start again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason all of this is important is that the most common complaints I hear about update failures and possible corruption are typically from those who assume things are done as soon as Windows tells them it is and tend to rush to the next step like they
 did with Service Packs on earlier systems.&nbsp; The difference with Windows 10 is that much of the update intelligence is located in the cloud update services rather than on the individual PC, so these after update processes take significant time performing checks
 to confirm and if necessary repair or reinstall modules that may have failed to complete without error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What this means to you is that situations like a partially failed Windows Defender update might eventually manage to repair itself, but by making random changes and rebooting, you're actually interfering with the automatic cloud processes trying to do the
 same with more true knowledge (via telemetry and the cloud's artificial intelligence) of items like that CBS.log file few truly understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To all of this I'll add another complication you&nbsp;threw into the mix, by installing that language pack somewhere in the middle of whatever Windows updates were actually occurring on your own system.&nbsp; Though I couldn't find a clear statement, I've heard for
 years that adding language packs after the initial Windows installation can be fraught with issues, since there are dependencies that in the Windows 8.1 era required that all security and other updates be reinstalled after a language pack was added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if that's still required with Windows 10, but found enough threads in the community and online articles that I suspect it's still a bad idea to add one later.&nbsp; In fact here's some notes from a Microsoft Docs article titled
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/add-language-packs-to-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Add languages to Windows images</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Language components must match the version of Windows. For example, you can't add a Windows&nbsp;10, version 1809 language pack to Windows 10, version 1803.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you brief that article including sections like that titled Considerations, you'll find this as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Install languages, then updates and apps</strong>. If you're adding languages to an image that already contains apps or updates (for example, servicing stack updates (SSU) or cumulative updates (CU), reinstall the apps and updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it does appear that recommendation to reinstall apps and updates after adding a language pack holds true with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what I'm trying to point out here is that along with the potential issues created by attempting to rush the normal Windows 10 servicing update processes, throwing a language pack into the mix has very possibly badly confused the update sequencing on that
 PC, forcing it to revert to reinstalling nearly all monthly quality and other updates performed since whatever original upgrade or initial version was installed on the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, this explanation was long and complex, but so is Windows 10&nbsp;as a service, though Microsoft tries to hide that from the user.&nbsp; What I find from watching those posting in these and other forums though, is that those used to manually performing updates
 on older Windows versions often get themselves in trouble by trying to treat Windows 10 the same way, while in truth this is exactly like two different "experts" trying to fix the PC at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue though is that the two performing the fixes can't see each other and it's like one is at the PC console and the other operating remotely on a hidden screen, performing changes at the same time, each oblivious to what the other is doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my recommendation?&nbsp; Leave the PC on (disable sleep mode) for 24 hours and see what's happened in that time frame.&nbsp; Maybe reboot after&nbsp;logging in to check&nbsp;that a&nbsp;Windows update isn't in progress to&nbsp;complete any processes that previous updates might still&nbsp;require.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most important point with Windows 10 SaaS though is to learn patience, since rushing anything or trying to fix something that Windows can likely repair itself will only interfere, not aid in a solution as it did in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this doesn't work, then the backup and refresh Windows technique you mentioned may be your only recourse, but if you choose this path, I'd first do some research regarding when to best add that language pack while performing this sequence in order to
 make most efficient use of your time in rebuilding.</p>

<p>Hi DerSchuhmacher,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your problem sounds very daunting. With Icons that come and go at will. </p>
<p>Could be malware of some kind, or Rob's interpretation of the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In either case, before you consider a major repair operation, you should</p>
<p>perform a "system restore". That is, if you have a suitable restore point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least, that should put you back into control of your PC, and allow you</p>
<p>to contemplate the value of Rob's warnings, regarding changing languages.</p>
<p>And to eliminate any malware that may have infected your PC in that process.</p>
<p>If the WD DWord that you changed From 1 to 0, was for DisableAntiSpyware,</p>
<p>that indicates that something <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">disabled</span> your WD. Malware, or Anti-Virus Pgm.
</p>

<p>Hi Rob,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply. I have read and bookmarked the two links you gave me.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the rant, earlier. But you have to admit, if you go to those older posts, about this topic (or a lot of different topics for that matter), you will see someone give a proposed solution and when the user says it doesn't work, they are left hanging.
 No other choices will be given nor any explanations. Then the thread gets locked. I don't feel like I am the one being attacked, I feel like all MS customers are getting the shaft! hahaha<br />
<br />
But all that aside, thank you very much for a detailed explanation of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
I am well aware there are 2 major updates a year, just haven't paid attention to dates for them, and then minor ones throughout. The updates I received the other day were nominal things, as I call them. Also, the 3 small WD updates that came up today, I had
 not restarted the computer or anything at the time. I had hoped it could self correct itself. They went to download and quickly gave errors about not installing. And I was like well that's just great!<br />
<br />
However, getting back to the German LP and apps/updates, what I did not know is for instance, in the link about the language packs is how the structure changed on them so drastically. However, when I was on MS's website where the current downloads are, I then
 decided to go check the Language and Time settings and just installed it from there. So, I did not create an .iso file and install it.<br />
<br />
See, between installing it and then within 2-3 days getting the updates, it was hard to decipher the culprit. I have had plenty of issues though, with updates. Even without restarting, if I get certain updates, I will know it, even with it being behind the
 scenes, because all of a sudden my clock/date format will go haywire and I will be like, AH a new update came in, I go look and sure enough it had.<br />
<br />
On a good note, I actually had installed the "current" German language pack (1803) before the Windows 1809 update. Then within a 2-3 days I was getting the nominal updates. However, that still probably screwed things up, because maybe it didn't know to look
 for the LP on my system.<br />
<br />
Also, I am surprised the link you gave me said it's not for swtiching back and forth between languages; normally you would just switch restart and go.<br />
<br />
I couldn't sleep, so I was messing with the computer again, before you responded. I thought about the German LP and went ahead and uninstalled it. Then I made sure WD was turned on in the registry again, fiddled with the real-time settings for WD, used Disc
 Cleanup and such and restarted the computer. I then went ahead and did check for updates and this is when 1809 popped up pending uploading and so I decided to leave the computer alone. So, there must have been an issue the German LP and even allowing the 1809
 to come through before today.<br />
<br />
I left the computer alone while the updates were downloading, and I finally saw they were installing and then later when I came back it wanted me to restart the computer so it did have a little time in there.<br />
<br />
I am also on people about being patient with their computers, just like microwaves aren't fast enough for people anymore! lol I tell them they should wait for a program to finish loading if they accidentally open a program before immediately closing it, as
 well. <br />
<br />
As for Sleep mode, I always shut that off on both desktops and laptops because some computers/software have big issues with waking up. I only set the display to shut off and then shut down when I am done with the computer.<br />
<br />
But the BEST news, for last, is when the computer restarted, I checked the System Info again and now it finally said 1809, gave no errors and sure enough, as you said, it WAS smart enough to correct the Windows Defender issues!<br />
<br />
UPDATE: I was wrong. Windows 1809 update has done some goofy things to my computer. For instance, since it's a laptop, I have the battery icon in my toolbar and it has removed the brightness button. My toolbar and task bar take FOREVER to load. I am sure there
 are other things going on, but these are the first 2 problems I see. But I guess I would have to open a new ticket for that. Yes I found some other things. I see now, I removed my headset and now have static on my speakers. I see that as a thread as well,
 also after a major update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>P.S. I will differ on one thing; I have to say if you look at enough threads, you will often see that multitudes of people are having the exact same issue. And often times a fix in 2010 still works in 2018.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hi Glen,<br />
<br />
Thank you, as well, for your thoughts.<br />
<br />
My computer has ZERO malware on it. I have only ever had a problem 2-3 times in my computer life since 1993.<br />
<br />
The reason I didn't mention doing a System Restore is because just like with Sleep, there are often problems that ensue so I usually turn it off on my computers. It also takes up a lot of resources. With that said, at this very point, it would have been nice
 to test it out! lol<br />
<br />
Another issue I just figured out. I had uinstalled FoxIt Reader before I added the German Language Pack. I now notice it did not do a clean uninstall. So, I am dealing with that, as well.<br />
<br />
Hi Cynthia,<br />
<br />
Are you also going through this problem?</p>

<p>The Windows 10 version 1809 update added a dark theme to File Explorer, so there's a potential for issues with certain color schemes that might cause icons to apparently&nbsp;disappear when in truth they're just the same color as the background.&nbsp; There's also
 the potential that the icon simply became toggled off, or confused, so multiple online articles suggest toggling it of and on again to see if that brings it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that articles like the above&nbsp;might apply any time a significant update to Windows occurs, so yes, some do apply even if much time has elapsed or even on different Windows versions.&nbsp; However, since the Windows 10 interface has gone through multiple significant
 revisions since the initial release and changes like the dark theme have occurred during specific updates, the things that fixed them in one revision may not be that same each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My point was never to try and fix all of your problems, only to make certain you were aware that you might be fighting Windows update itself by making random changes, so I'd concentrate on an individual item&nbsp;like the icon&nbsp;and try to search for the most current
 articles available to see if they're known as a problem with the specific update recently installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds from what you've mentioned so far that your current problems may be less critical cosmetic issues, so at this point I'd try dealing with what you feel is most important first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using System Restore is akin to ripping out portions of the operating system or apps installed sine the date selected, so it typically does more harm than good with a software-as-a-service sequenced update system like Windows 10.&nbsp; For example, we'd seen
 problems caused by System Restore with Microsoft Security Essentials and its update system even back on Windows XP, since this was one of the first time and sequence sensitive apps to be created.&nbsp; Typically it could take a few days for MSE to recover from
 reverting to a prior date with System Restore, since this jerked out portions of the sequencing data the program maintained to insure the integrity of definitions and engine updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing a System Restore with Windows 10 just multiplies this problem 10-fold, since the entire operating system and app structure is now maintained with the same sort of sequencing data as that pioneered in MSE and Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Restore was designed back in the static file based operating system days of Windows 9x and though it dealt with those older version somewhat better, was always intended as a catastrophic recovery tool when all else had failed.&nbsp; I personally used it
 only once when trying to recover enough control of a&nbsp;Windows Vista system, badly damaged by malware, in order to back up data before wiping the system to upgrade it&nbsp;to Windows 7.</p>

<p>I had tried to hover over the missing icon area earlier and there was nothing there. I even changed colors just now, it's really gone. But yes, as far as I can see, it's just cosmetic issues, though it's a shame things have to get changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you were helping me to reflect on the fundamentals of Windows 10 and I do appreciate that.&nbsp; I was started out on Win 3.1 and loved it. Loved Win 95B, XP was okay, when I learned how to tweak Win 7, loved it. I steered clear of 8.x Vista and Media,
 2000 and such. Now, I got stuck with Win10 and not happy, feels like a Vista or something machine, for the problems that is.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I am happy you agree about System Restore. Yes, with Win 95, it was so-so. After that and learning what you are talking about, I just shut it off when I get another computer/Windows version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's just frustrating because this computer was doing really good until the Autumn update a year ago?? and now this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I am rarely on here to post, normally, I can figure something out, but when I have just about exhausted everything I can think of, then I come here and usually don't get anywhere. But, with that said, your post has encouraged me not to give up yet!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will spend this week to try and get at least a few things fixed, unless I am lucky and figure it all out. lol</p>

                    So I have a logo signature I want to add to my emails. I can't. Why? Because unlike gmail and other applications there is no simple attach image process. Instead, apparently, you have to do it via a web-based application. This must be the most stupid way
 of adding a signature that has ever been devised by modern man.

    <title>OME working, cannot make exception for SSN blocking rule - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> owenscc  say:</h3>
<h2>            OME working, cannot make exception for SSN blocking rule</h2>
                    
<p>we have setup and tested and have an "ome for specific subject line" rule.&nbsp; this works fine.&nbsp; but, we also have a dlp rule that will block any outgoing email with a ssn.&nbsp; i have been trying to create an exception in the ssn dlp rule that will still generate
 an incident report, but allow the sending of an encrypted ssn email (only blocking non-encrypted outgoing emails with a ssn).&nbsp; if i try to select an exception in the ssn dlp rule that states:&nbsp; the message properties/include the message type/encrypted and try
 to save this setting, i get an "error" message that states:&nbsp; "one of the conditions you specified can't be used for rules where you want to notify the sender. error details: the notifysender action isn't compatible with 'messagetypematches' predicate."&nbsp; this
 rule is also set to "stop processing more rules" and "add to dlp policy" even though the screenshot below doesn't show it.&nbsp; the ome rule sits 1 position before the ssn dlp blocking rule and is also set to "stop processing more rules", which i would think prevent
 the ssn rule from executing and then blocking the sending of encrypted emails (with a ssn).&nbsp; what am i missing here?</p>

<p>hi owens,</p>
<p>i did&nbsp;a test by creating the same dlp policy and configuring the rule as yours. i can reproduce the error message.<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=b451e648-e89d-4c72-908a-16dd2c2fcf14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3db451e648-e89d-4c72-908a-16dd2c2fcf14" /></a></p>
<p>it indicates that this configuration of the rule is not supported in office 365. thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>to find a workaround or a different setting to achieve the goal, i tried adding a condition like "the sender belongs to the 'unencrypted message users' group" and was able to save the rule.<br />
so you can create a group for users who do not send encrypted messages and only apply the rule to them to see if it works.</p>
<p>for any updates, just feel free to post back.</p>
<p>regards,<br />
henry</p>

<h2>            Unable to Uninstall Microsoft Security Essentials,  Error code&#58; 0x8004FF56</h2>
                    <p>I was trying to upgrade my Microsoft Security Essentials with Windows Update.&nbsp; It keeps failing.&nbsp; So I tried to uninstall it to start over.&nbsp; That also fails.&nbsp; I cannot find answers for the error code I get when I try to perform either the update or the removal.&nbsp;
 That code is 0x8004FF56.&nbsp; I've been through everything.&nbsp; Tried to download the recommended "filter manager rollup" to downloading the "fix it" software.&nbsp; I've even disabled Windows Defender and stopped the MsMpSvc.&nbsp; Nothing is working.</p>

            0x80070643 is very generic error code and gives no clue of the fault.<br />

I guess Revo didn't uninstall MSE completely. Try mesremoval.bat method from <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/uninstalling-mse/a63b8c4b-58ed-437e-8086-fa08d80725a4">

    <title>Crop greyed out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> normal_user20188  say:</h3>
<h2>            Crop greyed out</h2>
                    Researching the answer to crop being greyed out in paint the answers at answer.mircosoft dated 2011. Here it is 2018 and still no solution. The answer suggesting going to a different app still doesn't answer the question. Why is it greyed out and why hasn't
 it been fixed by now? Suggesting going to a different app isn't much of an answer. If I have to go to a different app it sure won't be a microsoft app. Why won't microsoft fix it?

            Hit CTRL-A or <em>Select all</em> from the Select menu to enable crop.&nbsp; It has been that way all along.&nbsp; Also works if you select a portion of the image.

<h2>            VBA&#58; Draw circle over footnote number that will move with text</h2>
                    <p>I am writing a paper and I'm required to&nbsp; encircle all footnotes (both inline and in the footnote at the bottom).&nbsp; I have all the footnotes input and would like to use VBA to draw a circle around each footnote.&nbsp; I can manually draw a circle and move it around
 the number, but if I try to type in front of the footnote, the circle will not move with it.&nbsp; I would appreciate any help!&nbsp; I have included a picture of what I want it to look like.</p>

            I would use the oval method, but that gets really tedious when I have many references.&nbsp; It also does not move with text as I type in front of it.

            There is no simple fix that I know of. 
<br />
<br />What formatting standard is that based on?
<br />
<br />If your instructor is such a wise guy, ask him how to do it?  I would really love to learn that technique.
<br />
<br />The only thing I can think of is that you have to find a font where the basic numbers, the numbers that show up when you hit the number keys on the keyboard,  Then you modify the style called "Footnote Reference" to use that font.  Google for the font.
<br />
<br />Other than that I don't know of any way to do what your instructor wants.
