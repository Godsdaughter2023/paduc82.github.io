<h2>            Stereo microphones and Skype</h2>
                    Hi <br />
<br />
I wonder if I can use stereo microphones and send sound in stereo when using Skype?
<br />
<br />
Best Regards <br />

<p>
</p><p>Apologize for the late reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried the Microsoft Fixit?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Perhaps deleting the contents of some folders may help after a complete uninstall. Then, try again. This was given in the Intel forum.</p>

I would also have you post the query in the Intel Community support.</p>

            <p>Totally brassed off with this dilema. &nbsp;No help from any of the known help sites.</p>
<p>A friend suggested that I use the e mail service that I used before Windows 10.</p>
<p>He said try importing Google but my previous supplier was Yahoo.</p>
<p>So use the e symbol at the bottom of the screen and type in www.yahoo.com in the top box ( your current provider maybe Google or g mail). This will lead you to the safe provider you had previous.</p>
<p>Outlook was a shambles and the Sync suggestion was a waste of time.</p>
<p>its taken two days to get here but now secure.</p>

            No I don't have a triangle. &nbsp;I use TalkTalk and incoming mail is ok, it's the sent I cannot see although doing &nbsp;test run it is sent ok I just haven't a record of what was sent and get the message "not synced" and if I try to syn get the error code 0x800ccc02.
 &nbsp;It seems to be the TalkTalk sent account that is the problem

<br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong><br />
You may uninstall Internet Explorer 8, follow these steps: a.Carefully select and then copy the following command:<br />

<br />
b.Click Start, and then type Cmd.exe in the Start Search box. <br />
c.In the list of programs, right-click Cmd.exe, and then click Run as administrator.<br />
<br />
Note If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
<br />
d.Right-click inside the Administrator: Command Prompt window, and then click Paste to paste the command that you copied in step 1.
<br />
5.Press ENTER to uninstall Internet Explorer 8. <br />
6.When the uninstall program is finished, restart your computer. <br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:<br />

<br />
I tried the first two methods suggested, without success.<br />
<br />
Method 1 got the response FORFILES not recognized as an internal or external command.<br />
<br />
Method 2 required me to enter a 38-digit product code. The only thing I could find was a 20-digit product ID code<br />
<br />
I then searched the web deeper and found the following article http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950719<br />
This says that IE8 cannot be removed after Service Pack 3 has been installed. It directs me to uninstall SP3. I tried to do this but got the response 'The system cannot find the file specified'. Which file, I haven't a clue, because it did not stipulate the
 findings.<br />

I feel like dumping the laptop in the river!!!!!!!!!!<br />

That KB article mentions the Recovery Console but you don't have an install CD to use it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other option mentioned is booting an already installed Recovery Console.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you have that boot option?</p>
<p>AFAIK a Repair requires a CD too.&nbsp;&nbsp; So the only reason that this would be suggested is that if you had an original CD (e.g. XP at IE6 level) that you would need to go back to that level of modules before using that CD in a repair.</p>
<p>Sounds like you have a slipstreamed OS, so you would need a slipstreamed CD to use to repair with or use its Recovery Console.</p>
<p>However, provided all the uninstall files are intact you should be able to use one of the first two methods to do an uninstall and thus get back to a version of your OS in which IE is shown as an optionally installed product and therefore itself uninstallable.</p>
<p>I don't think that you will be able to do an OS Repair without a CD but perhaps all the re-registration effects of uninstalling XPsp3 and IE8 will give you enough of a repair to solve your (undisclosed?) problem symptoms.</p>

            Thanks for the advice, which is most welcome, but I have reached an impasse which seems insurmountable. My laptop is a Dell, running XP Professional, for which I do not have the Discs [it being an OEM] as it was bought second-hand.
<p>I had/have two problems:<br />
</p>
<p>Problem 1 of 2</p>
<p>Although the laptop loaded up quite fast when I bought it, over time it has slowed to a crawl! Even using programs such as CCleaner and AVG TuneUp &nbsp;has made little or no difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem 2 of 2</p>
<p>Recently, when doing Windows Updates, the system could not execute some updates. One example is “Security Update for Microsoft Office Publisher 2003 [KB2553084]” The error message reads “The feature you are trying to use is in a network
 resource that is unavailable. Click OK and try again or enter an alternate path to a folder containing the installation package ‘PRO11.MSI’ in the box below.”</p>
<p>The box below currently shows a string beginning C:\MSOCache\AllUser\ followed by a series of letters and numbers.</p>
<p>As a non-techie, all this bamboozles me. I have tried the various options offered by your goodselves, but to no avail. In the end the systme began to fall apart big-time, so I reloaded the Backup I had made and crossed my fingers. Initially
 I lost the laptop wifi connection to my cable internet, but this has been restored by my ISP.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have decided to [a] cut my losses and stick with my exceedingly slow, but just usable laptop and [b] save up hard for a new one.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Once again, thanks to all.<br />
</p>

Looks like Office Publisher was originally installed from a networked drive.&nbsp; Are you using that product?&nbsp;&nbsp; If not just uninstall it and then you won't get the update.</p>

<h2>            Not able to add Audio_TS and Video_TS files to the Windows Media Player library</h2>
                    
<p><span>Windows media player videos not being added to library</span></p>
<p>I have windows 7 and cannot add certain video files to my video library. The videos files are in the format of Audio_TS and Video_TS files. The video files can be played on WMP but for some reason cannot be added to the library or playlist. Do they have
 to be in a different format? The video files have chapters but even opening up the Video_TS files and trying to add the individual files does not work either.Any help would be much appreciated</p>

I did try that and although it did work I then cannot play all&nbsp;the video (with the chapters intact) on my computer. I was hoping to be able to play the video files, complete with facility to choose the various chapters, the same way on the networked TV as I
 can on my computer. I have now made a copy of the videos and recoded them as m2t files (but with no chapters) just so that I can add them to the wmp library.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            Are you referring to Suresh's reply or mine? The fact that you can use WMP to play these files, doesn't mean that they are also supported by WMP's library.

            Epson Support is the place to find an answer, but the first thing to do is to turn the printer and computer off completely. Wait a while and turn both back on and see what the panel on the printer says--and check ink levels. If it is not giving any errors,
 check the computer for an error in the printer setup.&nbsp;

                    <p>Have a Dell Dimension 630 laptop from auction site, worked fine for 2 months with win 7 updates, then this message.

<p>It seems to have failed the validation/activation procedure.</p>
<p>I have just found the Dell W7 Pro 32-bit reinstallation DVD with a code on the back under the barcode - but no COA label on the laptop (which has XP label)</p>

</p>
<p>Please advise if the code on the back of the DVD reinstall label is of any use to validating/activating the Win7 setup. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Seller says he used this disc to install, so could be invalid, and re-install would wipe out all my setup work so far and get me no further.</p>

            your windows is not genuine.

<div>your install is using a win 7 OEM SLP key which requires a win 7 compliant bios. your computer was built 2 years before windows 7 was released so doesn't have one.</div>

<div><span>OEM SLP: This key comes pre-installed in Windows, when it comes from the Factory. This key is geared to work with the special instructions found only on that Manufacturer's computer hardware.
 So when Windows was installed using the OEM SLP key (at the factory) Windows 7 looks at the motherboard and sees the special instructions and Self-Activates.&nbsp;</span></div>

<h3> elle85zx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Facing lots of issue on Windows 7 computer including high CPU usage, freezing of Internet Explorer and other performance issue.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title: </strong><em>regsvr32.exe issue</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My computer has been running at 100% cpu a lot&nbsp;and internet explorer has been freezing up. I went to&nbsp;the control panel and ran the troubleshooter for performance issues. It asked me if I wanted to prevent a program&nbsp;from running at start up called uyybklqfj.
 I don't know what the program is for, so I hovered over it and I get unknown regsvr32.exe/s&nbsp; "C:\Users\(my name)\Appdata\Local\Stardock_Corporation\uyybklqfj.dll".&nbsp; I was just going to check the program so it wouldn't run at start up, but when I went to the
 start up tab in the system configuration it names the program as Microsoft Windows Operating System and says the&nbsp; manufacturer is Microsoft. I don't know if this program is affliated with Microsoft at all. I know Stardock Corporation is affliated with some
 Dell files and that's the brand computer I have. I'm wondering if I&nbsp;prevent the program&nbsp;from running at start up would it&nbsp;stop&nbsp;Windows from even booting?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank yo for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are facing lots of issue on your Windows 7 computer including high CPU usage, Internet Explorer hangs, performance. There might be a chance that there is some third part conflict or your system is affected by some virus/malware.
 There might be a chance that there is some system file corruption which is causing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that this computer is connected in work environment. If you have the administrator permission then you may try the steps provided below and if not you might need to contact your IT department team.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let’s boot the computer in Safe Mode and check if issue reappears. Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you’re using. You may refer to the article mentioned below to boot the computer in safe mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Advanced startup options (including safe mode).</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p><span>If your computer works fine in safe mode, I would suggest you to perform
<strong>clean boot</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Putting your system in <strong>Clean Boot</strong> state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the link to perform clean boot.</span></p>
<p><strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong><span>: Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If issue still persists and you are able to login to your computer then I would suggest you to check the system files are they working fine or not and to check that try to run
<strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> tool.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>SFC scan will scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />
<br />
How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>All Programs</strong> and open <strong>
Accessories</strong>.</li><li>Right click on <strong>Command Prompt</strong> in the Program list and then select
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER: </li></ol>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong><span><br />
If still issue persists I would suggest you to run the <strong>Microsoft safety scanner.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br />
The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong><span> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>
<p>

<p>Hello Ted,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the issue is related to your BIOS settings or motherboard. Additional information would help us find the right solution for you. Did you notice any changes on your PC prior to the issue?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I suggest that you try to reset your BIOS to its default settings. You might need contact your manufacturer (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14148/computer-manufacturers-contact-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OEM</a>)
 to seek assistance about how to reset your BIOS settings. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.</p>

            Look for devices that have Vista drivers, they should also work in Windows 7.&nbsp; I know that the PVR 150 (Hauppauge) works in Windows 7 (64 bit) but it's so old and discontinued, eBay is probably the only place you will find one.&nbsp;

            Hi,
<br />to renew digital license one need to do a new activation with product key.
<br />If you did not upgrade earlier, you need to buy Windows 10 and you'll get product key.
<br />Free Windows 10 upgrade was ended 10 years ago.

            <p>The acad.exe error points to the ntdll.dll which is a component of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However another, possibly third party, component may actually be causing the crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Flash is referenced in the Firefox error can you uninstall and then reinstall the AMD graphics driver using the latest version available&nbsp;and see if it helps.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 64 bit UEFI USB boot</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>yesterday i got my new PC. it has asus z87 gryphon UEFI BIOS ver 1707. i was assembled and tested before delivered to me. a test OS was installed for the tests and then removed before i got it. i purchased this win 7 version: http://pro-jex.de/shop2/Windows-7-Professional-64-Bit-OEM-Vollversion-Betriebssystem-SP1</p>
<p>
</p><p>its a dell OEM win 7 64 bit. now i couldnt install it, i only got to the "expand windows files" step and then it aborts with the error code. 0x80070017 indicating that the dvd is corrupted. the dvd looks like it has scratches and was used before. but i have
 the key which should be enough to activate and register windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after that i tried to make an image of the dvd on my laptop with Ultraiso but i got stuck and always frozen at 75%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so i tried to install a ISO image file from digital river. i was able to install a windows 7
<strong>32bit</strong> version on my new PC with a USB boot. i used the windows 7 usb/dvd tool, but now when i try to do the same with a win 7 64bit the tool says "invalid ISO file". i found all sorts of things about how i cant make a usb boot for a 64bit OS
 form a 32bit OS. and also is i have a UEFI bios it seems i need to consider a few&nbsp; things extra with that kind of bios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>can someone please give me a step by step guide what to do. i want to install windows 7 64bit professional on my new PC. and like i said my purchased OEM dvd seems to be damaged BUT i have the key to activate it by phone. to wrap it up:</p>
<p>
</p><p>new PC has currently: windows 7 32bit professional.</p>
<p>usb stick 8GB (which i used to install win7 32bit)</p>

            it works now, and btw the dvd is not pirated, the key that comes with it works. but you need to activate it through the phone since it is an OEM version.<br />

<p>no disk to try this.</p>
<p>ive managed to get it to load the desktop by changing settings via safe mode but with a full restore (some drivers missing, ie sound card) it still seems to be filled with issues. it runs terribly slow now and still does not let me do half of what i need
 to do to restore it to its former glory.</p>
<p>at present this will make a&nbsp;lovely&nbsp;door stop or table decoration as it can not be used for anything other than to gather dust.</p>
<p>does anyone have a suggestion as to how to repair this issue that started after i installed the latest windows 7 update 2 days ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Try this:</p>
<p>To access the System Recovery Environment in Windows 7, simply boot your PC, just before the system loads the Windows operating system; hit the [F8] Function 8 key on your keyboard which will launch the Advanced Boot Options menu. There you will see a new
 option 'Repair Your Computer', select this option and hit 'Enter' on your keyboard.</p>
<p>This will allow you boot into the System Recovery Environment and access the same tools.</p>

<h2>            Cortana Is Alive Theory &#40; And Shes Human&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Ill be discussing the end of Halo 4 here, so expect some mild spoilers.</p>
<p><br />
The Final ship on halo 4 that the Didact (thats his name right? the boss?) is on is designed if i remember correctly is designed to transform organic tissue into a A.I. or artificial material. We see this laser that is supposed to do this shoot and land on
 earth. I don't remember how many times, but here is my theory.</p>
<p>When Chief puts Cortana into the console and she starts splitting herself up, I believe Cortana came up with a plan to preserve herself. I believe she was able to figure out how to reverse the process of turning organic material into artificial material
 and turned her Artificial consiousness into a human on earth.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
This opens up the possibilities for another theory... That cortana..... might actually suit up. What better way to show her return then have her save master chief in a spartan suit!</p>

<p>*Spoilers*</p>
<p>I don't think Cortana found a way to preserve herself. In the final scene she tells MC that "Most of me is down there with the Didact. I only held back enough to save you". If she had found a way, even if she&nbsp;thought it was a long shot, I think&nbsp;she would
 have said so.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean she couldn't make a return. Here's my thought on it.</p>
<p>The 'final ship' is called the Composer. It was originally designed to convert biological material (thought patterns, or "the essence of life") into digital data.</p>
<p>That being said, Cortana is the only AI to ever be 'cloned' from human tissue, so the biological information would be there, even if only&nbsp;part of her were composed. If this data were to be found at the site where the Composer's beam hit earth, then I'd say&nbsp;it's
 possible she could be cloned again.</p>
<p>Now for the kicker that makes me think this theory&nbsp;could happen. If you watch the final scene... the one that is narrated by the Didact, (I think it happens after the credits)&nbsp;it raises some questions.</p>
<p>First, this scene is part of the epilogue... and if the Didact is dead, why is it narrated with his voice? Just as 'an afterthought'&nbsp;for effect? Or is there more to it? Was he composed?</p>
<p>Next, regardless of that ^ fact, if you watch closely during this speech/scene, you'll notice a short scene where there are people (or maybe it was just one, can't remember now)&nbsp;who look like scientists wearing something like PPE or hazmat gear at the site
 where the beam hit. Anyone notice what they're doing? Using some kind of equipment to take samples from the area. IMO, it's not a stretch to theorize that they could find a sample of Cortana's digitized biological information. Also seems ironic that one of
 the first missions (or is it the launch mission) of Halo 5 is for Locke's team to recover Dr. Halsey?</p>
<p>Interesting to consider, yes?</p>

<p>I thought this, too. I theorized that somehow managed to fool and tinker with the Didacts ability to digitize DNA and reverse the process...or something to do with the composer...and that would work to her benefit...and as the MidnightKLR stated, she is
 a digitized younger Halsey. Halsey used this very same Forerunner tech to produce her to begin with, using Halsey's own DNA. So Cortana is a digital Halsey clone. Although, I find Cortana's various looks/ designs to be contradictory of this, when thinking
 back on Halo 4 and past titles. Neither Cortana model looks to be what Halsey was described as looking like in her younger days, in the first book...but we'll just pretend that she can alter her appearance, it wouldn't be too far fetched, compared to her other
 capabilities. </p>
<p>So, even if your theory and mine are not the route 343 goes, there are plenty of ways for Cortana to come back...be it, in Halo 5 or 6...but as many of my friends have pointed out, bringing back Cortana is not necessarily a goal for storyboard writers. If
 they did this, it might offset the dynamic between Chief and Blue team. &nbsp;Cortana didn't get to operate with Chief too much, while with blue team. There were cases when they did, only one mission I can think of, in fact, but typically it was either MC and Cortrana
 or Chief and blue team...and if they were deployed simultaneously, they were always split up and it was just Chief with Cortana, while Blue Team did some orbital mission or ground mission. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to factor in that there is a reason why Cortana made an exit and blue team comes back into the picture. However, there is a contrary to my point and that is that all Spartan II's were designed to house an AI. The AI was supposed to enable faster
 reflexes, as she was also integrated into the Spartan's nervous system and quicken their response times between them and their suits. So, there is that idea that every Spartan should have one, but that would be too much dialogue going on...not that we necessarily
 have to read/ listen to everything they have to say to each Spartan. </p>
<p>Another way I theorized Cortana's return, is going by what she was capable of in the books. Wherever she goes, she can leave traces of her. Specifically, the Pillar of Autumn. She could leave a subroutine of herself in ship, to automate their defenses and
 respond to/ for counter measures etc. So, if that ship's console was found, for instance, they would find Cortana code in the console. Cortana was often docked somewhere and she was even left behind for a long time, in Halo 2, with the Gravemind. Heck, she
 even has been in the Infinity's sytem...lots of opportunity there.</p>

<p>I had a similar idea nearly 3 years ago. &nbsp;forums.xbox.com/.../418958.aspx</p>
<p>However, Requiem was destroyed at the end of Spartan Ops, so I'm not exactly sure how that might change things.</p>
<p>What I keep thinking, though, is why has MC gone rogue? Perhaps he's looking for something. Or someone...</p>

<h2>            ALL Programs stop responding when typing. Any keyboard input freezes all programs, browsers, word processors, email clients, etc...</h2>
                    I have a brand new HP laptop running Windows 7 Premium (x64), 4GB RAM, 2.26Ghz Intel Core i3.&nbsp; Almost since day one programs have stopped responding immediately after submitting any typed input via the keyboard.&nbsp; Programs will run fine until the keyboard
 is used.&nbsp; This is obviously troublesome with word processors and browsers.&nbsp; Using a USB keyboard, as opposed to the built in keyboard, yields the same results.&nbsp; The problem will disappear for a while after the system is restarted, however it returns within
 a day or two.&nbsp; I am quite certain it is not related to any viruses and/or malware because this is a brand new system and has had an internet protection suite installed since day one.&nbsp; No viruses or malware have been detected.&nbsp; This system is only a few weeks
 old and should not be having issues like this.&nbsp; It is used primarily for non-web based business activities like accounting/bookkeeping, and this has been quite the inconvenience.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Since its a brand new computer you should contact the Seller and HP for replacement or warranty<br />
repair. The more you do the more they will claim it is something you did. Backup any data you<br />
have as they will probably want you to revert the system back to as it was when you received it.<br />

===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

    <title>Custom toolbar disappears from taskbar after startup in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Custom toolbar disappears from taskbar after startup in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After the last Windows 10 update, my custom toolbar has started to disappear from the taskbar every time I start up my computer. The taskbar survives a reboot about 50% of the time but always disappears after a shutdown/startup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also use the language bar. I've found that the toolbar survives if the language bar is restored to the desktop before shutting down. However, I need both the toolbar and the language bar on the task bar. That was the situation I had before the update.
 How can I get back to that situation? </p>

<p>It doesn't matter what OS you have.</p>
<p>You can connect two computers to one monitor with a KVM (keyboard-video-mouse) switch. Many KVM switches will allow you to connect 4 or 5 computers to one monitor, one keyboard, and one mouse. Have each computer selected when booting to ensure that the computer
 registers the keyboard and mouse, before changing to another computer. The computers will be connected to the network through their own cables and won't be affected by the KVM switch. Your network programs will work normally.</p>
<p>If your monitor has two inputs then most likely you do not need any KVM switch. Just connect both PCs on each port; switching between comps is done usualy by front knob. If there is only one input on monitor then you will need a KVM. Before buying this piece
 of hardware check your graphic cards outputs on each PC. These days most of the monitors have one DVI and one analog (D-SUB) input.</p>

            Hi <strong>Young surfer</strong>,
<p>1. What is the make and model of the laptop?<br />
2. Since from when are you facing this issue?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Run Playing Audio troubleshooter and check if it helps.</strong></p>
<p>a. Open the Play Sound troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel.<br />
b. In the search box, type troubleshooter and then click Troubleshooting. <br />
c. Under Hardware and Sound, click Troubleshoot audio playback. <br />
d. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p><strong>Open playing audio troubleshooter<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter</a></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Try disabling the audio enhancements and check if that helps.</strong></p>
<p>a. Type sound by clicking the Start button, and clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type sound, and then click Sound.<br />
b. On the Playback tab, click Speakers, and then click Properties.<br />
c. Click the Enhancements tab, and then select the Disable all enhancements check box.</p>
<p>If you don't see an Enhancements tab in the Speakers Properties dialog box, those features are not available for your speakers and this procedure is not applicable to your computer.</p>
<p>If disabling audio enhancements solves the audio problem you're experiencing, this typically indicates that your audio driver needs to be updated.</p>

    <title>Shift and Windows Key Stuck On After Installing May 2019 Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> foster coburn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shift and Windows Key Stuck On After Installing May 2019 Windows 10 Feature Update</h2>
                    <p>I had all other available updates installed. I installed the latest Windows 10 Feature Update (think its called the May 2019 update) today and now I can't login. I'll give as much detail as possible as far as what I've tried and what has failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the update was finished, I was asked to login. My password includes a lowercase letter and a number. Using a physical keyboard (Microsoft Keyboard 4000 ergonomic), there was no way whatsoever to type a lowercase letter. Shift did nothing. Caps Lock
 did nothing. Nor was there a way to type a number. I always got the symbol from the number key. The numeric keypad did nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the onscreen keyboard. It showed the Shift and Windows key activated. There was nothing to do to turn them off. Using Caps Lock on the OSK, I was able to type a lowercase letter. But there was still no way to type in a number. Sticky keys does nothing.
 Filter keys does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, the update screwed things up. So I went to Safe mode to uninstall the update. It asks for the password and I have no way to type it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I have booted without a keyboard attached. Even then the OSK shows the Shift and Windows key activated no matter what.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I login to my computer?</p>

            Hi, Foster,
<br />
<br />I am an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />When you see the Login Screen Password box, you should see an option beneath it to change the password. Try changing the password then log into Windows.

            This requires answering security questions that have never been set. So how do I type in the password THAT I KNOW?

            1. Try pressing FN + Insert + NumLock
<br />See if that releases these keys
<br />
<br />2. Press Winkey until keys release

<p>With the On Screen Keyboard displayed, I tried this on the physical keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume you meant Function Lock. I pressed FnLock + NumLock + Insert simultaneous numerous times. The OSK still displayed the Windows and Shift keys activated. In short, nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pressed Windows key numerous times. I held it down. No change whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that I still have the problem with NO KEYBOARD plugged in, I'm convinced there is a driver or piece of Windows screwing it up.</p>

            1. Press hold the Shift key for 10 sec will enable the Sticky key. If its enabled hold the shift key on the keyboard for a while until you hear the beep sound and check, this will disable the Sticky key.
<br />
<br />2. Do you have access to an external keyboard? Use it to log in then I'd advise uninstalling keyboard driver from Device Manager
<br />Ensure you check the option to remove related Files then click Ok
<br />Click Action &gt; Scan for Hardware Changes to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />3. This is tedious but worth it. Open Device Manager
<br />Click View &gt; Hidden Devices
<br />Start with the first item in the list
<br />Right Click on each driver &gt; Select Update
<br />
<br />Sometimes doing this locates updated drivers for components.

<p>OK, I'm going to repeat what I've already said. The problem occurs with or without a keyboard plugged in. It is an external keyboard. The problem happens with real keyboard and it happens with on screen keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Numeric Keypad will not type a number no matter what. Yes, that's with NumLock on...or off. Doesn't matter. Numeric keys at top of keyboard ALWAYS results in a symbol no matter what.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pressing and holding the Shift key (way longer than 10 seconds) does absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't uninstall any drivers because I CAN'T LOGIN! I need numbers available to login and they DO NOT WORK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something involved with the Windows Update made it so the Shift and Windows key are ON AND STAY ON no matter what.</p>

            It's the only option left.
<br />
<br />If it were a new update, you can check the most recent updates in update history or Control Panel &gt; Programs &amp; Features &gt; View Installed Updates
<br />
<br />These updates may then be hidden to prevent reinstallation.

    <title>Shame on you Comcast&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> epixtactic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shame on you Comcast&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So a while back I was saying that comcast always send somebody to my door where they proceed to tell me I should be paying more. &nbsp;Then my price goes up. &nbsp;Well I just got my bill and sure enough. &nbsp;11 dollar hike!!!</p>
<p>- A while back they auto raised my package from like 12 or so Mega Bits to 28 and hiked my plan and told me, &nbsp;"you can either have a 3 Mbps or 28 Mbps connection"</p>
<p>- I'm outraged, &nbsp;the tenacity of these pricks. &nbsp;I have communicated sevrel times that I can't pay 60 dollars a month for the services.</p>
<p>- I've spent hours with these people on the phone telling them that I basically only need 6-7 Mbps. &nbsp;They apparently ( according to their website) just released (I'm rolling my eyes) a 15Mbps package. &nbsp;</p>
<p>-I've asked about 20-30 times if they would offer me smaller mid-package. &nbsp;Apparently they have the right to bump my package 2x the price and then raise it another 11 dollars. But they won't offer me a package that's only slightly more expensive than the
 one I started out with.</p>
<p>-This is outrageous. &nbsp;If you were in my shoes this might make more sense. &nbsp;These people have no moral standard, &nbsp;and are scum.</p>
<p>- I'm also more that certain from past experiences that when I call to ask for the 15 Mbps service, &nbsp;they're going to pretend like I don't know what I'm talking about....</p>
<p>-This is whats wrong with the Online digital distribution Idea. &nbsp;This is why internet based services are sketchy. &nbsp;Whilst all the services of Xbox, Netflix, Hulu, Zune, &nbsp;and all the networks are very clear about their services and packages they offer. &nbsp;You
 can't count on your ISP to treat you with an ounce of respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I may be an isolated "accident" but this is one of the sour'st consumer experiences I have ever had, &nbsp;and thats why I say shame on you Comcast!!!</p>
<p>When their call center opens pack up I am going to call, &nbsp;and if these pricks can't fix my issues I will post the contact number for Joshua the nice rep that came to my door so you can ask about the only package in my area being 28 Mbps and Me being bumped
 into higher packages without my consent.</p>

<p>From what I've heard, you can call Comcast, tell them you cannot afford the tier and that you're going to drop the service. They should route you to the Retention deparment where they cut a deal wtih you for another year at a lower price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>'course, it helps if there IS an alternative in your area to use as a bargaining chip.</p>

            <p>You should really visit a local office, because you are getting the run around. In any case, this really isn't Xbox related so this thread is getting a lock. Good luck and hopefully you get this sorted.</p>

<br />
In Windows movie maker I made a movie of my Christmas video.&nbsp; Went to publish it in the wdvd maker, added all the&nbsp;features (title, menu, scenes, notes, etc.); previewed just fine.&nbsp; Burned the dvd, but it finished&nbsp;without the added features (title, menu etc.).&nbsp;
 And I did this more than once and still no features.&nbsp; What could be wrong?</p>

Might be worth a try to Publish (Save) your Movie Maker <br />
project in the .WMV movie format to a folder on your hard <br />
drive. Then import the .WMV movie file into DVD Maker.<br />
