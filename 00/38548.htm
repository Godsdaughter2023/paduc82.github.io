            Yeah reach out to support to get an automated poorly worded response that requests you send in screenshots of the completed achievements. Send in screen shots. After that wait, for however long it takes for you to hear back. In my case, never hear back
 from support. Try to chat with someone, who was very helpful, but get sent to post in forums. See that multiple people are having the same issue. Read the replies from others telling those are having problems to contact rewards support. Restart loop ad nauseam?
 Come on there has got to be a better way to get help besides auto generated emails. At least follow up with those that have sent screenshots. This is ridiculous.&nbsp;<br />

<p>I have not been asked for screenshot and if i was I would ask to speak to someone who owns a xbox one and have unlocked some achievements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the reason for that is all achievements you unlocked are time stamped so there is no reason to take a screenshot for proof they only ask that because they are too lazy to do there job</p>

    <title>NTFS File structure corrupted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> d-leet  say:</h3>
<h2>            NTFS File structure corrupted</h2>
                    
<p>The hard drive I run win 7 64-bit pro on has been corrupted [not sure how]</p>
<p>I can't boot win 7 off of this hard drive now, just locks up at the win 7 logo screen.</p>
<p>Since this has happened, I can't boot my second hard drive either [a vista system], but seems to cooperate fine if i unplugged the sata data cable for my win 7 hdd [which i may add that my 7 hard drive is a solid state]</p>
<p>I've used some linux utilities [primarly parted magic and partition wizard boot cd] to find the problem, but they cannot write to a ntfs file structure. i've ran testdisk which seems to report that the chs entries for partitions are a miss, for the ntfs
 only, not the ssd itself.</p>
<p>Linux utilities don't seem to choke on boot like vista or 7. also xp seems to fire up fine with both drives connected.</p>
<p>Now i've ran a live xp cd from winbuilder.net to run a xp pe. i ran chkdsk for the win 7 ssd and it encounters an error and refuses to complete scan and fix problems.</p>
<p>So I'm at a loss here, don't want to send the hard drive to some data recovery expert just yet.</p>
<p>I need a chkdsk like solution to fix the structure maps or whatever of the individual partitions and i should be on my way.</p>
<p>so an xp bootable cd [live xp or the like, so i can access to the ntfs] and a tool that won't choke when i run it, unlike the chkdsk from xp that i've been using. or as far as that goes, anything that works.</p>
<p>now it doesn't *have* to be a bootable environment. i could install xp on a rearranged hard drive of my vista environment and boot that.</p>
<p>according to partition wizard boot cd [linux] all the data on my ssd with 7 is intact.</p>
<p>i can still begin to boot from the win 7 ssd, so i don't think there is an error with hard drive recognition or bios setup errors, seeing as how everything there is auto-configured.</p>
<p>how shall i proceed to be able to boot from my ssd again? thanks.</p>

            I tried that as you suggested. All that happened is when I was asked for what operating system I wanted to use repair tools for, it says windows vista and locked up with the revolving circle still going. Anything else that may work?

<p>Hi d-leet,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>I suggest checking the power requirements of your peripherals and the output of your power supply.</p>
<p>That could cause that issue and still not be destructive to the HDD.</p>
<p>Is the drive showing up in the BIOS?</p>
<p>If it locks up and the Startup Repair won't help, you might be able to find a third party option to recover it.</p>
<p>However, it seems like the hardware may be damaged.</p>

            I have advised my clients not to install any WINDOWS updates that are not labeled Security.&nbsp; Microsoft has not issued a single update since 2014 that actually improves Windows 7.&nbsp; They are all updates to make it easier to "upgrade" to Windows 10 or intelligence
 gathering tools.

            <p>That is why they are classified as Optional although some might very well be classed as Recommended</p>
<p>M$ Recommended updates are often the most disruptive </p>
<p>You list some that it very well depends seeing they are optional </p>
<p>Top is for remote desktop features </p>
<p>Second is a bunch of currency font additions</p>
<p>Third is to help upgrade to win-10</p>
<p>You can use the More information link by selecting the update you're wondering about.</p>

<p>I am looking to buy an xbox, there are so many choices, and all I want is a freekin xbox that will work like ps3 lol.</p>
<p>I want it to play online, play all the xbox games, have hdmi, and a hard drive thats bigger than 4 gigs lol.</p>
<p>So long story short, an xbox closest to the ps3 specs.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>They are a mass produced console so all the new units have exactly the same specs. So its neither here nor there which you buy.
</p>
<p>The only difference is the size of the HDD, you don't want the 4GB flashfrive version as at some point you will want a HDD so you can install games and have enough room to save DLC..</p>
<p>All 360's can play online and none play all the xbox games. Fo a list of backwards compatible titles check wiki.</p>

<p>[quote]I want it to play online, play all the xbox games, have hdmi, and a hard drive thats bigger than 4 gigs[/quote]Then there are two options, the 250GB 360 S and the 250GB 360 S Kinect bundle. One comes with Kinect. The other does not.</p>
<p>There's also usually a 250GB 360 S bundle with two games kicking around, but that changes every so often.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 No Active Network - ethernet connection works though - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterpep1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 No Active Network - ethernet connection works though</h2>
                    <p><strong>Problem: </strong>Network Panel displays no active network. This results in inability to fetch windows updates (reports try again message) and Edge gives an error about no page found.<br />
<br />
<strong>Information: </strong>My network adapter (realtek) is working. It states Ethernet Connected. I can access the internet using Chrome. So the issue is not with my internet configuration. There is no wireless card on this desktop. There is a bluetooth
 connection though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Visual Studio installed with Xamarin and the various settings regarding to mobile development (I have a suspicion that it could be related to something here, but not too sure).<br />
<br />
<strong>Steps tried so far:</strong> I have tried sfc /scannow and that did not resolve the problem. In addition, I cannot set up a homegroup because it says my network is not private. I have uninstalled the network adapter and reinstalled it (did not resolve
 the issue).<br />
<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>Before anyone states this question has been asked and answered already, I already have reviewed several posts and googled this issue already. And have not found a solution yet.</p>

            <p>Hi Arul_D,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response. My driver was 9.1 and I updated to the latest one ( i think its 10.XX now). I did this prior to your recommendation. However I did not install it using compatibility mode. Do you still think it could be driver related?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Open services.msc and restart Network Location Awareness. This usually solves almost all UI indicators went awry.
</p>
<p>I have been fighting this problem for months, but since I had internet access, I didn't try very hard to solve it. However, Cortana doesn't find the internet, it reads that error and says there is no internet. After reading dozens of reports, THIS one is
 the one that worked for me.</p>
<p>I updated my network drivers, rand the sfc program, nothing had any effect.</p>

Just a few follow up questions: did edge not work for you and were you unable to fetch windows updates?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Just to highlight some of the issues that are persisting:<br />
<br />
Network and Sharing center says "You are currently not connected to any networks"</p>

<p>Windows update does not fetch updates at all.</p>

            <p>Okay for anyone experiencing specifically the no active network and edge not working i have found something that fixed it for me.<br />
<br />
1. Open regedit</p>
<p>2. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\NetworkList</p>
<p>3. Give permission full control and give the same permission to the children (inheritance)</p>
<p>
</p><p>this immediately solved the problem. <strong>Note: Any time using regedit backup and proceed at your own risks.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am still receiving an error on windows update: "We couldn't connect to the update service. We'll try again later, or you can check now. If it still doesn't work, make sure you're connected to the Internet."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like this could also be a permission issue in the registry, maybe not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any advice on this? (I would open a new thread, but I have a feeling my original issue and this are tied together).</p>

<p>Curious indeed. The case would have to be listed as not owned by the player AND an NPC would have to have taken it upon themselves to take items out of it. I'm not sure if I believe that, because it sounds a little odd to me.</p>

<p>People follow me into my house all the time because they are talking to me and won't shut up just because I shut the door in their face so maybe the sheer randomness of NPCs can make them wander in off the street. Our stuff is marked as ours so it shouldn't
 be taken from a container but if it's just out in the open that may well be different. I know if you drop armor on the ground (body armor seems to be the trigger) a random dude will run up and "you're throwing that away, I can have it, right?". The only time
 I lost anything was when i stored all my enchanting needs in a barrel at the college intending to come back right away. It was 4 game days later and everything had reset. I tracked back to when it was lost and restarted but still lost hours of my play. In
 the College not even your room is all yours. No barrels anywhere are safe there, though your assigned wardrobes and bed tables are. You don't even get a well rested from sleeping there.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 apps not connecting to internet</h2>
                    <p>Just upgraded to Win 10 on my PC with Ethernet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firefox works fine, i.e. internet connection ok.</p>
<p>Outlook works fine, i.e. internet connection ok.</p>
<p>Antivirus can update, i.e. internet connection ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, some apps are not connected:</p>
<p>Edge says: "Hmm, we can't reach that page".</p>
<p>Store says: "Check your connection".</p>
<p>Skype says: "Signing in..." but never does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Eset Smart Security 9 installed, could that be blocking some access maybe?</p>

            <p>Hello Jonas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly refer to the below suggested methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Place the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if any third party applications are causing the application.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A. </span><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called
<strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow: <span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Disclaimer: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may
 also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a
 clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>B. To disable any 3<sup>rd</sup> party unwanted startup programs in Windows 8 and above, follow:
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/20119.how-to-enable-or-disable-startup-programs-in-windows-8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span>(Applies to Windows 10 as well)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, disable the installed antivirus program temporarily to check if the issue is due to connections getting blocked for specific applications.</p>
Also, disable the Windows firewall and check with the results.
<p>To turn it off, go to the search box and type <strong>Windows </strong><strong>Firewall</strong>. Then select
<strong>Windows Firewall &gt; Turn Windows Firewall on or off</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Disclaimer: </span></strong><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install
 other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps to run the Windows in built troubleshooter: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>in the search box and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>
tab<strong>. </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>view all</strong> option on the upper left corner.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the&nbsp;<strong>Windows Store apps&nbsp;</strong>option from the list.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click Next to run the<strong> </strong>Troubleshooter.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, also refer to the below link to deploy the <span><span><strong>Troubleshooter for Windows 10 apps</strong></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above recommendations does not help, I would suggest you to <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
check if the same issue occur when logged in through a different user account.</span><span>
</span></p>

            <p>So, logged in as Admin and did the Clean Boot. Same result, i.e. Edge and Store not working. However, I noticed that I was unable to disable Eset. So, I went to Eset and disabled all settings. Now Edge and Store was working. I enabled Eset settings one by
 one while testing, and found that it is the Personal Firewall which is the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I went to the section of Clean Boot describing how to get back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st problem:</p>
<p>I can't set it back to Normal Startup, it keeps popping back to Selective Startup (or whatever that 3rd option is called).</p>
<p>Don't know how big of a problem this is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd problem:</p>
<p>In my standard user account (not Admin), then when I start Outlook is says: "Outlook could not create the work file. Check the temp environment variable".</p>
<p>Solved by: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3062443</p>
<p>
</p><p>3rd problem:</p>
<p>In my standard user account (not Admin), the Search box does not work anymore. When I start typing the letters I type appear in the search field but the result screen remains white and blank, nothing pops up no matter how much I write. It works fine in my
 Admin user.</p>
<p>So far the biggest issue I have, one which is not able to live with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4th problem:</p>
<p>Well, the original problem of this thread, Edge and Store not working. Now we know why. I'll have to get in contact with Eset to learn more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, for the 3rd problem described I really need some help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Br,</p>

                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 Home and my Windows update nor Windows store doesn't download anything.</p>
<p>I have tried a bunch of solutions but none of them helped. (some of them fixed the problem&nbsp;temporarily)</p>
<p>I had the same problem on Windows 8.1 and I could fix it with Update Troubleshooter ran as administrator, but it doesn't fix it on Windows 10.</p>
<p>There are no error messages the updates just won't download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, help!</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this tool
 as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Please download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version –watch the checked boxes whilst installing), update definitions and run in
 normal mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans. </span>

You could call an Activation Center for help too.&nbsp; You have to let all the recorded prompts die off and stop, do this by ignoring them until a real live person answers the phone.&nbsp; They should easily fix your activation problem for you.</p>

    <title>Comfort Curve 3000 keyboard and Intellitype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> p.jay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Comfort Curve 3000 keyboard and Intellitype</h2>
                    <p>I have just bought a Microsoft Comfort Keyboard 3000 and was assuming that it would work with Microsoft's Intellitype software. However Intellitype 8.2 does not find a Microsoft USB keyboard (the CC3000 is a Microsoft USB keyboard).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Comfort Curve 3000 displays as a Comfort Curve 3000 in Devices and Printers (my old keyboard did not), however, under device manager it's simply shown as a HID keyboard device (with an old 2006 driver). Doing a driver search finds no other drivers, nor
 does Windows Update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Comfort Curve 3000 download page on Microsoft Hardware does not list Intellitype (the Comfort Curve 2000 does). Can I get my Comfort Curve 3000 to work with Intellitype?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm running Windows 7 Professional 64 bit.</p>

<h3> mtwilson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update trouble &#40;where&#39;d all my stuff go&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So yesterday 3/24/16 my computer decided to upgrade to windows 10 while I was deep into my schoolwork. Not only did it take about 2 hours for it to upgrade but when I finally got control of my PC back it apparently gave me a new desktop. After a short search
 I was able to find all my old folders, files, and applications and move them to the new desktop. I figured the worst was over and I could finally get back to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So jump forward to this morning..... I crank up my computer and the "new" desktop is no longer there.... all I have left is my old desktop minus all the stuff I transferred. What's worse is that I can't find any of the stuff I transferred, it's like it has
 been completely deleted. I need those files... if I can't get that stuff back.... it will set me so far back in my classes that I'll likely fail.</p>

    <title>Where can I get an actual Windows 8 ISO&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joman mied  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where can I get an actual Windows 8 ISO&#63;</h2>
                    I use the Upgrade Assistant on my Windows 7 64bit machine, but when it gets to the "Checking the Installation" process, it gets an error "Access is Denied." I wasn't really wanting to upgrade my system, I wanted to put Windows 8 on my other partition.
 I was wondering where I can get just the ISO so I can make a bootable USB to install onto my E: drive.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I bought Windows 8 last weekend (Oct. 27 to be exact), but kept receiving the error. I am afraid I might not be able to return it and get a refund... But I'd rather get an ISO. The Upgrade Assistant has also told me my Product Number, but I was too careless
 to write it down and now I don't know what it is. Is there a way to find that out as well?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be appreciated :)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To summarize: Can I get an ISO of Windows 8? And, where can I find my product key if it didn't download and install properly?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you!</div>

            <p>The Upgrade Assistant is your bet at getting a .ISO or if you had an MSDN or TechNet subscription.</p>
<span>
<p>Redownload or resume</p>
</span>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>When you purchase Windows 8 an email with the download link and purchase details will be sent to your email address that you use to purchase/register your product, you can just access that email and use the download link in it to re-download it on your computer.</p>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p>Below are the links that will help you download Windows 8.</p>
<p>Note: Please refer to <b>option 4</b> in first link below and to download the correct version from second link and use the product key of windows 8.</p>

<p>Clicking "Download Pro" installs and runs the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant, which lets you know if your PC can upgrade to Windows 8 Pro, provides you with a compatibility report, and then walks you through the steps to purchase, download, and install.

<p>When the "Install Windows 8" message appears, select "Install by creating media" to create a bootable USB flash drive or an .iso (a disk image) file.
</p>
<p>Step 3: Wait for the Assistant to download the Windows 8 Pro installation package and create the bootable media or .iso file. The flash drive must be have 3GB or more of free space available.
</p>
<p>Step 4: Burn the .iso file, if that's the path you chose, to a blank DVD. </p>

<div>Thank you both!</div>
<div>I finally got it to download properly, and I decided to have it save on a USB Flash Drive.</div>
<div>I have a 145 GB partition set up on my hard drive, but when I boot from the USB and start the installation process, I get a message saying something like: "Cannot install on E: because it doesn't have the size requirements."</div>
<div>Any ideas as to why 145 GB isn't enough?</div>
<div>Please reply as soon as possible!</div>

            Hi. I once had the a similar problem on my external drive telling me there is not enough space for the file, even though it was empty. Later I realised that it was formated in FAT32 and not NTFS, so just make sure that the partition is formated in NTFS.
 FAT32 have a size limit of 4GB(not completely sure, but think it is 4). I hope this solve your problem.

Thank you, Smartie083, for your post, however, I have formatted, re-formatted, and re-re-formatted the partition probably 20 or so times. Still doesn't work...

1. The model is:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(64, 64, 64, 1)">Notebook Samsung Ativ Book 2 with Intel" Core i3 - 4GB 500GB Windows 8 LED HD 14 HDMI Bluetooth<br />
<br />
2. </span>The notebook started to exhibit this problem at startup after the latest automatic updates of Windows 8.1 provided by Microsoft Windows Update.&nbsp;<br />
The detail is that all the options that Windows provides 8.1 to solve the problem are: "Refresh your PC", "Boot from a (USB / CD / CD-USB) device", "repair inicilização" However, none of these options worked, I downloaded a version of Windows 7 (test) to reformat
 the computer, but the options do not work as they should, when I try the USB, or the DVD drive, it is not recognized at boot (using the same Windows 7 USB / DVD TOOL for Crair discs). From what I understand we do not have the same autonomy of formatting you
 had in windows XP / 7, the widnows 8 does not allow us access size, summarizing, we consumers who screwed us with these restrictions, there are days I am without notebook!</p>

<p>"Mp Navigator requires 1024x768 or higher and High color 16 bit or better mode"</p>
<p>The pc is configured correctly for color and 32 bit. The driver has been removed and reinstalled numerous times by myself and a Canon tech. Seems to be a security issue with windows preventing MP Navigator from opening the scanner.</p>
<p>This is a "new" problem, three weeks. Too far back to return to.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply. I disabled UAC. the problem persists. Now it does not ask for my permission to continue then give the error message, it goes directly to black screen with "MP Navigator ex requires 1024x768 or higher resolution and high color 16 bit
 or better mode." </p>
<p>It is already set at 1024x768 res and 32 bit color.</p>

<p>thanks but three times you have replied with the same answer. I tried to explain it does not improve the situation. There must be a way to solve this. I'd hate to scrap my pc for this but it looks more like that may be the only solution. Microsoft help charges
 for all help. I am convinced a Vista upgrade led to this as the scanner worked fine before and Canon has no issues with the driver on other pcs. Someone must be able to help?</p>

<p>Quote: </p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;found the following workaround that worked on my PC. Open the "Properties" windows&nbsp;by right-clicking&nbsp;the shortcut&nbsp;icon for&nbsp;the MP Navigator. Select the "Shortcut" folder, click the "Advanced" button,&nbsp;check the "Run as administrator" checkbox and finally
 hit OK. Then MP Navigator started and worked fine with the scanner.</p>

<h2>            Skype credit gone also</h2>
                    <p>My Skype problem started when Skype became a part of Office 365 and a second Skype account was created. I cannot no longer access my original account and it will no longer renew its subscription and now the credit is gone also. Is this happening to others
 also?</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7a7b6cd5-84ea-4775-85a6-ac9e23b6e89c" title="MarshaTracey">
<p>
</p><p>This happens when&nbsp;your Skype and Office 365 accounts were not successfully&nbsp;updated. That's why when you access Skype using your Office 365 account, it created a new Skype profile under that email.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A possible reason why you're not seeing your Skype Credits on the account under your Office 365 email is because those Skype Credits are under your original Skype account. Having said that, you will need to recover that original Skype account of yours by
<a href="https://go.skype.com/reset.password.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
resetting your password</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since there is no option to merge Skype to existing Microsoft accounts anymore, I'm afraid you can only use the 60 minutes of calling on the Skype account connected to your Office 365 account and not with your original account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have further questions.</p>
