<h2>            Mozilla Thunderbird won&#39;t uninstall</h2>
                    I've changed my default email program to Windows Live Mail and I've tried to uninstall Mozilla Thunderbird a few times now, but when I click on "uninstall" in Programs and Features, it doesn't respond - it acts like I've not clicked "uninstall" at all.
 &nbsp;I've tried right-clicking on the application in the list as well and then clicking "uninstall" but the same thing happens. &nbsp;I've not had this problem with any other application I've installed on my computer. &nbsp; Any ideas on why this might be happening and
 how I can get rid of this application?&nbsp;

            <p>Computers, which are built by large manufactures that come with Windows Pre-Installed, come with two (2) Product Keys:</p>
<p>A) OEM SLP: This key comes pre-installed in Windows, when it comes from the Factory. This key is geared to work with the OEM Bios Flag found only on that Manufacturer's computer hardware. So when Windows was installed using the OEM SLP key (at the factory)
 Windows looks at the motherboard and sees the proper OEM Bios Flag (for that Manufacturer and that version of Windows) and Self-Activates. (that's why you did not need to Activate your computer after you brought it home)</p>
<p>B) COA SLP: This is the Product key that you see on the sticker on the side (or bottom) of your computer. It is a valid product key, but should only be used in limited situations (sush as if the OEM SLP key stops self-activating for whatever reason). The
 key must be activated by Phone. (Note: All manufacturers that use the OEM SLP system are required by contract to include a Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker, that has a COA SLP key, on the computer)</p>
<p>Your Windows is using an OEM SLP key, but (for whatever reason) cannot see the special instructions in the computer’s motherboard and is unable to Self-Activate.To fix the issue, you will need to change out the OEM SLP key with the COA SLP key. The normal
 way to do this is to click the ‘Start’ button, right-click ‘Computer’, select ‘Properties’ and then click ‘Change Product Key’ (located in the lower right-hand side of the window). Enter the COA SLP key and follow the instructions in the Change Product Key
 Wizard. http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en/genuinewindows7/thread/da16dd03-502a-4b21-9c9f-24fd26497a51</p>

<h2>            WINDOWS EXPLORER&#58; How to disable highlighting of files when mouse hovers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>If the mouse happens to hover over a file, it highlights it. &nbsp;You have to be constantly mindful of your mouse position. &nbsp;When I need to highlight a file, I'll click it. &nbsp;Its way less hassle than having to constantly reposition my mouse pointer all the time
 when using Windows Explorer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There must be a way of killing this "feature". &nbsp;I don't want to change to double clicking in Folder Options. &nbsp;Single clicking seems to be more efficient.<br />

            <p>I've changed colors and fonts in Appearance so if I use the Windows Classic Theme I lose all that and have to reconfigure all that again. &nbsp;Of course I should have made note of my settings when I changed stuff before....duh. &nbsp;Live and learn. &nbsp;Is there a way
 to back up my Appearance settings?</p>
<p>So I like the Registry idea. &nbsp;However I don't have MouseHoverHeight or Width in that Registry area in my XP 64bit SP2. &nbsp;I'm using the Classic Start Menu (don't know if that effects this problem). &nbsp;I'm also using X-Mouse and WizMouse. &nbsp;Perhaps they have overridden
 those settings? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Another issue that when I scroll using the wheel on my Kingston Trackball it stutters quite often. &nbsp;I've tried disabling X-Mouse and WizMouse but this doens't seem to effect the stuttering. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Life sure would be boring with problems to solve!</p>

<h2>            Internet connection drops after 4 to 5 minutes - Windows 10 Home v. 1607, 64-bit</h2>
                    <p>My desktop PC loses internet connection after four to five minutes of access regardless if connected to the DSL modem through Ethernet or Wi-Fi. I first noticed internet connectivity issues on Thursday, January 19.&nbsp; I placed my first call to the Microsoft
 Help Desk on Friday, January 20.&nbsp; As of 8:20 p.m. CST on Tuesday, January 31 - this problem still exists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP 550-150 Pavilion purchased new from Amazon in June of 2016.&nbsp; It has the Windows 10 Home version 1607, 64-bit operating system.&nbsp; It's connected to the internet through a DSL modem (ZyXEL C1100Z).&nbsp; My DSL service provider has been out and replaced
 the modem twice.&nbsp; They replaced the network card outside my house.&nbsp; Those replaced the community network card.&nbsp; They ran a direct connection from my modem to the junction box that serves my home.&nbsp; Thus, the DSL service or modem is not the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my desktop computer loses its internet access, it must send a signal to the DSL modem.&nbsp; The DSL technician said that the modem is losing its authentication.&nbsp;&nbsp;This causes all other devices on the network to lose their internet access.&nbsp; Once I unplug
 the Ethernet cable going to my desktop, all other devices on the network regain internet access within seconds.&nbsp; If I plug that Ethernet cable for the desktop computer back into the DSL modem, the desktop and other devices get four to five minutes of internet
 access before going offline.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I talked to four different Level 1 technicians over the past ten days.&nbsp; Here is what we tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Network Reset</li><li>IPCONFIG Release/Renew, DNS Flush through Command Prompt</li><li>Delete and reinstall network driver</li></ul>
<div>
<p>None of these things worked.&nbsp; I then did a full reset of my computer (great fun).&nbsp; At that point, the computer had perfect internet access for several hours.&nbsp; I then ran Windows Update and reinstalled my software.&nbsp; Not long after the Windows Update finished,
 the exact same problem returned. While I suspected this problem was the result of a bad update recently released by Microsoft, this reinforced my belief that a bad update was at fault.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at the update history, and I uninstalled each update one at a time.&nbsp; After uninstalling each one (with restart), I checked internet connectivity.&nbsp; I had reliable internet access after uninstalling several updates. &nbsp;Finally, there were four updates
 that I could not uninstall.&nbsp; My theory is that one or a combination of these updates is causing this problem.
</p>
<ul>
<li>KB3211320</li><li>KB3199986</li><li>KB3199209</li><li>KB3176936</li></ul>
<p>I was then advanced to the Level 2 technicians in Windows Tech Support Home Updates &amp; New Release.&nbsp; They did a remote into my computer and messed around for five minutes at a time.&nbsp; I had to unplug the Ethernet connection, wait for the DSL modem to regain
 its authentication, and plug the Ethernet cable back in.&nbsp; That gave us another four to five minutes of internet service.&nbsp; That was a lot of fun.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, the Level 2 technician advised that I take my computer someplace and replace the network card.&nbsp; I asked why everything worked fine after a full reset (but before updates were applied), and the Level 2 tech admitted it was likely an update issue
 and not a hardware problem.&nbsp; So, I'll give doing a full reset a try tomorrow (Wednesday, February 1).&nbsp; The Level 2 technician said they could flag and ignore the four suspicious updates so that the computer would not process those updates while doing Windows
 Update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>That sounds like a&nbsp;addressing the symptom instead of the root&nbsp;of the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know what to as the Community, but I know I need help.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>As of 10:45 a.m. CST on Friday, February 10, this problem still exists. &nbsp;I talked to a Level 2 technical on Friday, February 3, and he advised that I use the DOS command prompt to manually remove the questionable updates. &nbsp;He said he would send me an email
 with instructions. &nbsp;I waited until Monday, February 6, and no email arrived. &nbsp;I looked the process up on the internet and found it. &nbsp;I tried to remove each of the four questionable updates, and the process would not work. &nbsp;The DOS window said something like
 "update cannot be removed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I did a full reset of my desktop computer. &nbsp;I can't put my copy of Microsoft Office on the desktop, because Office wants updates. &nbsp;This triggers Windows updates. &nbsp;The Level 2 tech advised that I install Office and deactivate updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender wants definition updates, and this triggers Windows updates. &nbsp;The Level 2 tech advised that I deactivate Windows Defender and purchase a separate anti-virus software. &nbsp;Nice - I have to pay for an issue that Microsoft created.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't install my Adobe on this computer, because it is a pain to install it every time I reset the computer. &nbsp;Oh, and using a restore point doesn't work either. &nbsp;When the PC restores itself using a restore point, it gets stuck in the startup process. &nbsp;This
 requires a full reset to escape.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an absolute nightmare. The Level 2 technician advised that I call them once every week to see if their development team has found a solution. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This problem still exist on December 26, 2017</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a week now, my deskop computer has been unable to hold the connection (ethernet cable connected to a wireless network connect to a box) for more than 5 minute of active internet use (video watching, downloading, web-browsing).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it could be my network card but then an other deskop computer had the same problem. I tried a lot of ****, including the power savingthing on the network card, cheking every pilotes. This computer defenitely has no hadware problem (would be suprising
 with that kind of hardware). So Nothing new here ?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            canon mf 4570 dn drivers won&#39;t install on laptop with windows 8.</h2>
                    I am still having problems trying to install my Canon Imageclass printer to my laptop.&nbsp; I followed the advice of the&nbsp;member&nbsp;who told me to turn off the metered connection.&nbsp; I did that and it downloaded the drivers but something goes wrong when&nbsp;I try to
 install it. I brought the&nbsp;laptop home and tried it with a non metered connection. Same results.&nbsp; So I lugged the printer home and downloaded the drivers again.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;seems to start&nbsp;the install&nbsp;process by asking if I want to let canon make changes but that's
 as far as it goes.&nbsp; My machines&nbsp;now recognizes the printer but says it need troubleshot.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I run the troublshoot, it says the drivers are not available.&nbsp; I'm afraid if it turns out&nbsp;windows&nbsp;8 wont support my printer I may break the "code of&nbsp; conduct" for
 the community when I visit....&nbsp; Help please&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi Abbie.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It's a PITA and I'm sorry you're going through it, but I'll give you everything possible to do so that at least something will work:
<br />
<br />First see the various troubleshooting steps here: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-10-account-password-from-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Next try enabling the Hidden Administrator account to log into and set up a new Local Administrative Account to sign-into, move files over and set up, using whatever method given here that works:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>
<br />
<br />To do this you'll need to access a Command Prompt in repair mode by one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  If you don't have the password this may be limited to using the booted media.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options for Command Prompt.  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the Troubleshoot Options try a Reset, saving files.
<br />
<br />If this fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Your files should always be backed up externally because the Hard drive can die at any time without notice.  I would keep them copied to an external or flash USB drive, and also to OneDrive or Google Drive backup in the cloud where they are theft- and fireproof. 
<br />
<br />I hope having the full range of options helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD or USB, you should see this option.

<br />The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use your previous version of Windows.
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart and reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

<h2>            Windows 10 taking up 398 of 500 GB</h2>
                    <p>After i updated to 10 from 8.1, windows 10 is only leaving me 40.5 GB free space out of 500. I've already went through file explorer-storage.
</p>
<p>Everything is to a minimum except at the bottom is has "other" which is taking 350 GB. The biggest part is c:/users/myname/myname-343 GB. I click on this and it goes to KITCHEN-LAPTOP, which isn't under Local Disk (C:).</p>
<p>
</p><p>System and Reserved uses 28.7 GB. System files-17.8 GB...Virtual memory-896 MB...Hibernation-Off...System restore-10 GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 21.8 out of 24.8 GB used on Recovery (D:).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know Windows 10 isn't supposed to use my whole hard drive. Any help?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To ensure that you don’t lose your files, you should back up the files regularly. You can set up automatic backups or manually back up your files at any time.</p>

            <p>During the upgrade process Windows creates a backup of the previous version allowing you to restore files if the installation fails.&nbsp; Could it be that the backup created during the update&nbsp;is eating up your disk space?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Launch <strong>Disk Cleanup</strong>, and allow it to scan for files that can be removed.</li><li>Once it completes,&nbsp;select the <strong>Clean up system files</strong> button.</li><li>Disk Cleanup will do another scan.</li><li>Following the second scan,&nbsp;select the&nbsp;"<strong>Windows Update Cleanup" </strong>
checkbox&nbsp;from the list and hit OK.</li></ul>
<p>Choosing this option will permanently remove the Windows 8.1 backup.&nbsp; You will not be able to restore to 8.1 after removing the backup files.</p>

</p>
<p>The file i mentioned above that's taking up 331 GB is almost a duplicate of my Local Disk (C:) except it doesn't have Program files or any Windows type files. I'm tempted to delete it. It says it's too big to recycle only completely delete.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Screen automatically dims when watching videos</h2>
                    I have a Dell, and the screen dims depending on the colors on my screen. Example... I open a website whose home screen is dark colors, and my entire screen dims. I've tried to turn off night light, adaptive brightness... Nothing works. I want it off so
 I don't have to keep readjusting my brightness.

            Hi Tori.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues with Windows Updates one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />Once you have this first and most important step done, we'll continue if a driver has not been found that corrects this.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Skype application not launching properly</h2>
                    <p>When I tried to open Skype on my Mac today, the app launches up to a certain point where the logo is on the dock and there are no error messages. However, there are no windows from Skype and in the top menu bar, there is only Skype and nothing else suck
 as file, edit, view, etc. This only occurs on my main administrator account, and Skype works perfectly in other accounts I have created to test this. What should I do?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 becomes a useless shell - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jetpilot60  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 becomes a useless shell</h2>
                    <p>I have seen so many posts on this without resolution that I am compelled to start another one.&nbsp; They all say one or more of these things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Edge does not work.&nbsp; By this we all mean that it will not start - no response when clicked (or no icon to click).&nbsp; Thank goodness there are other browsers around that
<em>do</em> work, like this reliable old horse (Firefox).&nbsp; A solution that proposes to monkey around with Edge options is no solution at all because
<em>Edge will not start</em>!&nbsp; Said again, in a simpler way: &nbsp;<em>Edge will not start</em>!&nbsp; No way, no how. &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Apps including but not limited to Store, Calendar, Calculator, Mail, Cortana (just pretend for fun that it's an app, for this discussion) and a great variety of other programs
<em>do not start</em>, either because their tiles and/or icons have disappeared altogether or because a tile or icon remains, but will not start the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can Microsoft possibly release to the general public an operating system that is so stuffed full of bugs, and then fail to adequately support the hundreds of thousands (millions?) of users who are flummoxed by it?&nbsp; Just because it's free doesn't mean
 that nobody relies on it, and/or that it need not function!&nbsp; And let me say that I have
<em>welcomed</em> all Windows updates with open arms - for many years!&nbsp; My bad.&nbsp; I have seen unresolved posts dating back anywhere from 2 days to 2 years asking all of these same questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, Edge and Cortana suddenly stopped working.&nbsp; Mail,&nbsp; Calendar and probably many other apps might have stopped working a while ago, but I didn't notice because I didn't use them.&nbsp; Mail is particularly perverse; the Outlook web app is far easier
 to use.&nbsp; The Calculator stopped working recently - it does not have an icon in the All Apps list.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all of these solutions already - all of them posed hundreds and hundreds of times by Microsoft's experts in Microsoft's forums -
<em>all </em><em>with no success</em>:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Tried to back out the Windows 10 upgrade to return to Win 7.&nbsp; Too late - I am already past the 30-day deadline for backing out (from Win 7).&nbsp; I upgraded somewhere around March 15, 2016.&nbsp; I was successful doing that on his box times before when Win 10 failed
 for various reasons.<br />
</li><li>Ran the App Troubleshooter.&nbsp; It found no issues, which I think is pretty funny...&nbsp; so a big LOL for that one.</li><li>Tried that lengthy powershell command that appears all over the forums.&nbsp; That eliminated the Edge icon from the task bar altogether.&nbsp; The icon had been there before but was unresponsive:&nbsp; All Edge did was to briefly flash a blue screen with a big window
 icon in the middle and then vanish.</li><li>Tried restoring the system to a previous restore point.&nbsp; This failed for all restore points because the system was unable to find some Adobe update file.</li><li>Looked at Resetting Win 10, but rejected this option because I would be left with nothing but the Win 10 system itself.&nbsp; No apps.&nbsp; I would have to undo about 4 years of work.</li></ul>
<p>So what are these hundreds of thousands (millions?) of trapped Windows 10 users to do now?&nbsp; And by the way, only a very few of us want to become computer geeks.&nbsp; We just want our computers to work.&nbsp; Simple, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And before anyone asks:&nbsp; Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3152599) "successfully installed" on 5/16/ 2016 (yesterday).&nbsp; I had no known major problems before that update.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I wish to share with Microsoft's developers a cool concept that many of us in I.T. have long been familiar with:&nbsp; testing.</p>

            <p>ZigZag3143,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I want to thank you for your reply.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Between the time at which I made the original post and the time at which I read your reply, I downloaded and executed another Win 10 installation - one of those 'over the top' installations where the PC was already running Win 10.&nbsp; This was the last option
 that I had seen in forums, but had not yet tried, to restore Win 10 functions (<em>all</em> Apps including Mail, Calendar, the Store, Calculator and so on; also Edge and Cortana).&nbsp; This effort also failed completely.&nbsp; In addition, now the Start icon no longer
 responds at all to a left-button mouse click, so I no longer have a Start Menu.&nbsp; The Start icon still responds to a right-button mouse click though, so I can still get to File Manager, Control Panel, Command Prompt (Admin) and so on.&nbsp; But the computer is even
 more of a shell than it was before the re-installation attempt.&nbsp; I can only run things easily (I could still double-click .exe's I guess, if I could find them) that I have shortcuts for on the desktop or in the task bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried your suggestions to run first sfc and then DISM, per your link above.&nbsp; These executed, but found no issues whatsoever.&nbsp; I even reran sfc again after DISM just to see, but again, no issues - instead always see friendly-looking "Windows Resource
 Protection did not find any integrity violations".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my status quo is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>No Start Menu, and therefore no tiles and no Apps</p>
<p>No Edge, not even a task bar icon to try</p>
<p>I still have a Cortana icon in the task bar, but it does not respond to the mouse</p>
<p>
</p><p>... and I am out of options.&nbsp; It is almost as if I am back to Win 7, except without a Start Menu.&nbsp; Non-Win 10 apps like Firefox, a flight simulator, Open Office and others seem OK.&nbsp; I could probably install I.E. 11, but why bother?&nbsp; I already have Firefox.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I elected not to try your App restoration instructions above for three reasons:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I have tried them, or things like them, before without success;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; your instructions are not completely clear and understandable (what exactly does "<span>remember the
<strong>InstallLocation</strong></span>" mean, and what does one do with this information?; and</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; it appears that I would have to run these one at a time for an indeterminate number of Apps that do not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You included no suggestions for restoring Edge and Cortana.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is worth emphasizing here that my Win 10 computer was behaving normally until the May 16, 2016 KB3152599 update.&nbsp; But if some Microsoft fix to this clearly disastrous update materializes, will my computer pick it up?&nbsp; Is it still getting updates?&nbsp;

            <p>How about we try to tackle the really nasty stuff first:&nbsp; the fact that I have no Start Menu ( can live for now without Edge and Cortana, but living without a Start Menu is a pain in the ... .&nbsp; In any event, what good would it do me to restore Apps when
 I have no Start Menu from which to run them?&nbsp; App diagnostic tools suggest that Apps aren't corrupted anyhow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I strongly suspect - and you should too - that this system's registry has either been corrupted by the&nbsp;KB3152599 update, or has been compromised in some other way.&nbsp; There have been no diagnostics suggesting that there is anything wrong with the Apps themselves.&nbsp;
 What's more, both sfc and DISM yielded no, suggesting that Windows 10 itself must be reasonable sound.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I strongly suspect the registry.&nbsp; What do you suggest I do to repair the registry, or at least get a handle on its status?&nbsp; I am reluctant try any old 'registry repair' tool on the internet...</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Get-AppxPackage is rejected by the Command Prompt (Admin) because it is "not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file".&nbsp; I presume that to "Get" a package for the Start Menu, something must be substituted in this

<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay, I have been away from this computer for over a week.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I enter Get-AppxPackage in powershell as admin, there is no response whatsoever.&nbsp; The "PS C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;" prompt returns with cursor positioned and blinking.&nbsp; There is no output list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean install/reset is an absolute last-resort solution because I would have to rebuild the computer from scratch.&nbsp; If I did that, I would restore it to its delivered image, namely Win 7, and then
<em>leave it there</em>.&nbsp; I've had all I want of Windows 10.&nbsp; I have installed Win 10 several times on two different computers including this one.&nbsp; Each and every time, there have been a host of glitches and issues (apps don't work, start menu quits, Edge quits,
 Cortana quits, sound quits, and so on and on).&nbsp; Win 10 is far too buggy for general use.&nbsp; Win 7, on the other hand, was reasonably stable.&nbsp; IMHO Win 10 is another classic Microsoft consumer release - it is a big bag of bugs.&nbsp; On the other hand, Win 7 is a
 stable product suitable for the only market that Microsoft actually values:&nbsp; the corporate market.&nbsp; Note how the corporate market has ignored Win 8 altogether.&nbsp; Given consumers' experience, I suspect that it will ignore Win 10 indefinitely as well.&nbsp; Windows
 has been stable for consumers when consumers and corps shared the same version.&nbsp; Most recent examples:&nbsp; XP and Win 7.</p>

            Quite simply put no. The in store App is always the newest and there is no way to go back or to uninstall the updates to the Apps What seems to be the issue maybe we can offer some help? Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will
 be glad to Help you.

    <title>Added a monitor, display resolution changes when laptop lid closed. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Added a monitor, display resolution changes when laptop lid closed.</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a new monitor&nbsp; (LG 27"), and at the moment I have the screens duplicated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both are showing resolution of&nbsp; 3840 x 2160, and life is wonderful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Occasionally I'd like to close the laptop lid,&nbsp; OR at least go to screen 2 only (neck issues - trying to train myself to look UP, not down),</p>
<p>but when I change from Duplicate to&nbsp; Screen 2 Only,&nbsp; &nbsp;screen 2 changes to 1960 x 1080, and doesn't allow me the option to change back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get back to 3840x2160 by duplicating screens again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?&nbsp; &nbsp;Win10.&nbsp; &nbsp;NVidia Graphics card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            The monitor on the product page only supports 1920x1080. 
<br />What is most likely happening is that when you duplicate/project the screen to the LG monitor, the monitor or your GPU then downscales that resolution to 1920x1080 allowing it to work. 
<br />
<br />I just tested this theory with my monitors (one is a 3840x2160 monitor the other is a 1920x1080 monitor) the same as your scenario. It too will also let me duplicate the displays and take the higher resolution of the 4k monitor. 
<br />
<br />However, it does appear to downscale for my 1920x1080 monitor in order to allow this to work. Once I am no longer duplicating those displays it no longer allows me to select the 4k resolution for my 1920x1080 monitor because it does not support that resolution.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, in this case if you need to have the 3840x2160 resolution on your second monitor the best option would be to return the LG monitor and purchase a monitor that is a 3840x2160 or higher resolution.

    <title>High Contrast Mode with Solid Color Background - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            High Contrast Mode with Solid Color Background</h2>
                    If I use any form of show desktop (Windows Key + D, alt + tab, show desktop at bottom right corner) the desktop background gets much brighter than it should. However, if I just minimize out of windows then it will be the color I want. First picture is
 how I want it always, second picture is what happens when I show the desktop. Thanks. Also it looks funny because I am using print screen with two 1080p monitors.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ce6735f-3a61-4052-82c7-9333d1f624ca" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2990342-f467-400d-b255-0fbd28abd074" />

            <p>I've figured it was because I had a program called "UxStyle" installed (it allows me to use themes made by artists such as on DeviantArt), and I uninstalled and restarted my PC which fixed it. It was a "possibly bugged" version and apparently I have found
 a bug. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Actually nevermind, I think it is a problem when you switch between an Aero theme and a High-Contrast theme. I will do more research, but I think you have to restart the PC with a High-Contrast theme to fix it and make it not happen any more.</p>

                    I was downloading drivers for a motorola phone I keep getting download manager which I uninstalled 3 times then error message Ioloservicemanager.exe-application error so i contacted them, and did a repair on xp home, now when i try to start in normal mode
 and log in I get this.Windows needs to be activated before you can log in yes or no I tried both but I get this other message "Msoobe.exe-application error "The instruction at 0x604a29b6 referenced memory&nbsp;at 0x00000000" This memory could not be read. I can
 get into safe mode only but no network cant install anything because windows installer doesnt start in safe mode.So where do i go from here to get logged into a computer thats already been activated before I did a repair&nbsp;

<h2>            80004005 on KB4074598, KB4093118, KB4056894 and KB4093113. Others install fine.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For several months "&nbsp;Security Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 7" fail to install because of&nbsp; "Code 80004005". They start to install, and after reboot configuring updates goes to about 75% and fails (reverting changes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried:</p>
<p>- https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors</p>
<p>- disabling bit defender total security</p>
<p>- uninstalling bit defender total security</p>
<p>-&nbsp;KB947821 which found only that some jpg and sample media files are missing</p>
<p>- tried manually downloading patches and install</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other updates like KB2952664 install just fine.<br />
</p>
<p>I auto-updated my system since 2013 and the first update that failed to install is&nbsp;KB4056894 ( i already had bitdefender for a year or so ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do more to diagnose/debug this issue ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi _Konrad_,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Are you still experiencing this error? If so, then some of the possible reasons is that your device doesn't have enough storage to install the updates since these Monthly Rollup has bigger file size that the other updates, or the network wasn't strong since
 these updates will require stable connection to download the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd also like to know until which point for troubleshooting did you finish on the article Fix Windows Update Errors. Did you finish all 8 steps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate the concern, I suggest you create a test user profile to check if it could be a user profile corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward your response.</p>

<p>Well, this is not the solution I was expecting. Agreed that I can always reinstall windows, but for now I prefer to keep my windows unsecured and not spend whole day on installation. I have my windows since 2010, so I have lots of stuff to reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot believe that update procedure does not keep detailed log what is being done during each step...</p>

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I try to open EDGE it closes down automatically. This issue happened a few days ago, probably after some windows 10 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other apps/software seem to be OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>No warnin message&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just the page does not load and even after trying to amend settings (in the 5 seconds chance I get) nothing solved this.</p>

<p>

</p><p>Corrupted or missing system files might be a possible reason why Microsoft Edge automatically closes when you open it after the update. We suggest using the

    <title>Fresh Windows 10 install - Start menu, Settings app, Search menu all - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reknoz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fresh Windows 10 install - Start menu, Settings app, Search menu all cause VIDEO TDR FAILURE BSOD</h2>
                    <p>This is insane, ludicrous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just installed a new hard disk in a client's Toshiba Satellite L850, Intel i7, 16 GB RAM, intel graphics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Windows 10, downloaded from the Microsoft site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a successful install, I went straight to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update which showed there were updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I let it do the updates. At some point, it said it was time to reboot. So, I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been unable to use the system ever since, including doing a complete re-install of Windows which included removing all partitions and formatting the disk!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is some kind of graphics issue. The screen frequently goes black for 3-5 seconds, several times in a row, as if it's changing graphics modes. I can use Task Manager to start *some* applications, but if click the Start menu, the Search menu, or if I
 start Settings from the command line, the screen will go black, return, go black, return about 5 or more times and then I get a BSOD:</p>
<p>
</p><p>VIDEO TDR FAILURE</p>
<p>igdkmd64.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've downloaded and installed the latest version of the intel graphics drivers. I've gone back two or three device driver versions. I've done all the sfc /scannow, GetXApp, troubleshooters, etc. that I can think of. I also used the WSUS offline updater.
 It did a good job, but didn't resolve my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, I've googled the error message and the device driver a thousand times and followed all the threads, but most of them say "Go to Settings and do the updates." But, I can't open settings. When I do, it crashes. So, after 72 hours of this nonsense,
 this computer is unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does *any*one have any *good* and *novel* things to say on the subject?<br />
<br />
I'm happy to provide whatever info is useful, but rather than dump lots of useless info, just tell me what you need/want to help me solve this problem.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
I can't believe how hard it is to maintain a Windows machine. It's absolutely insane. Installing a fresh copy of a Windows operating system on a brand new disk should be a no brainer. Not a 72 hour exercise in futility. Ludicrous. Get your head out of your
 ass, Microsoft, and for once, produce an operating system that just works. These kinds of issues DO NOT happen on Apple computers.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Yes,&nbsp;Windows 10. I have loaded *no* programs in this fresh install. It's *only* Windows 10. The thing that fails is clicking the Start Menu, the Search menu or by opening Settings via Task Manager and CMD.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Edit: Oh my god! There's no "clean boot" option? I have to disable every Startup program individually?!? For Christ's sake, Microsoft, why can't you make things *easier* to debug? FFS!<br />

<p>
</p><p>Nope. Still getting the same damn failure. This is absolutely atrocious.</p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the reply and update. Appreciate your efforts.
</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that this must be a difficult time.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Let’s try to resolve your issue as quickly as possible to help you get back on track.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot is an environment in Windows for the sake of troubleshooting. It is very simple and easy to perform.
</span></p>
<p><span>You may want to update or re-install the drivers from Device Manager to check if that makes any difference as the issue does not persist in Safe Mode.
</span></p>
<p><span>Further, you may also want to run the

<p>Srimadhwa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been working with Windows computers since it ran under DOS; I know what clean boot is. And, no, it's not simple/easy to perform. Not to mention, you didn't specific how to do it, in case I didn't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran SFC, DISM, and many other diagnostic / recovery programs. Nothing helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You didn't really read my post, did you? I already updated the device drivers - THAT'S THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. I went back several versions, and they don't help, either. I re-installed Windows 10 about 3-4 times. After the initial installation, the display
 device never worked correctly.<br />
</p>
<p>"as quickly as possible?" Yeah, that boat has sailed. I posted this four days ago. As I got no useful support, I gave up and just installed Windows 7. It also upgraded the device driver so the same thing happened, but I was able to roll back. So far, it
 seems ok. No thanks to Microsoft.</p>

<h3> doctor-who  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why would Cortana try to play music from Groove&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Cortana for a while now. Since when Microsoft Groove was a thing. (A good thing, for that matter.) Back then I had Groove set up as a music service in Cortana. Of course, Groove is gone now and I've migrated to Spotify. I've got Spotify set
 up as the only music service to use in Groove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, why is it that tonight while coming home, I wanted to listen to some music and issued the command, "Hey Cortana, play artist Celldweller", Cortana then replied to say, "I can't play Groove right now."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Huh? Groove isn't even in the picture for me any more. Why did it try to play anything at all through Groove?</p>

<p>Hello Devlin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I remembered Groove Music from my Cortana's Notebook. I don't think it's also in Cortana's Settings; I haven't seen it there. I removed Groove Music from Cortana's Notebook back in December 2017.</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to us. If <strong>Groove</strong> <strong>Music</strong> is already removed from
<em>Cortana's Notebook</em>, there's a possibility that a corrupted Windows system file is causing the issue. That being said, can you tell us the current

<p>Thank you for getting back to us. It seems that you already have the latest build for

 to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Create a local user or administrator account in Windows 10">support

<p>Hi Devlin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm very sorry for getting back to you so much later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, concerning what you suggested about creating a new user account and so on, you mean on my Windows 10 PC, correct? I've got other accounts on this machine I can use. So, I can log into it and then, do what?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But getting back to my original post I should have made this clear then, but I didn't, when I was trying to listen to music while driving home, I was doing this on my Lumia 950, currently running Windows 10 Mobile, version 1709. OS Build 10.0.15254.248.
 I got into Cortana on my phone to see what was in her Notebook. For music, there is only Spotify. For Connected Services I've got LinkedIn, Outlook.com and Skype. In any case, Groove is long since gone. Given all of this additional information, could it still
 be possible that my Microsoft user account is corrupt and some how that effects what music Cortana tries to utilize to stream music on my phone?</p>

    <title>Running in to endless problems with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sandswimmer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Running in to endless problems with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have started to wonder if the latest development of Windows 10 is actually a serious attempt of returning to the good old days of Windows Me o Windows Vista when no native repair tool could get to grip with the faulty architecture of this system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About two weeks ago my install of Windows 10 went dead and no attempt of system repair succeed in bringing it back to life. I then decided to install Windows 10 media on a memory stick. This took about 8 attempts because at around 50% the install would just
 roll back. When I finally succeeded at doing a clean reinstall Windows 10 broke down at the first attempt of installing updates. having spent the last two days in figuring out a solution by wading through an endless amount of forums and suggestions I decided
 to remove the the existing copy through it's native Restore Windows to Factory settings (hoping, in this way, to perform once again a clean install but no. Half way through the operation Windows 10 gave up and reverted to the old copy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having spent an considerable amount of time on this matter (and no, it's not the hardware which has been thoroughly checked) and having lost all my personal data in the process I can only conclude that Windows 10 is a rushed edition which should have been
 given a lot more thought.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you could enlighten me any further on how to solve this I would be glad to have some feedback but I won't hold my breath.&nbsp;</p>
