            Hi daztiny
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />How to Boot from a USB Flash Drive in Windows 10 - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />

<br />

<h3> mobius187  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intel Management Engine Interface - Device cannot start &#40;code 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>On booting up my Windows 7 64-bit system, I noticed that in Device Manager, under System devices, the Intel Management Engine Interface was showing an alert icon. On investigating I see its showing the "Device Status" as: Device cannot start (code 10). On
 attempting to update device driver it tells me that my driver is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) What is the&nbsp;Intel Management Engine Interface (driver) used for, as it doesn't appear to be impacting my PC in any way I can determine.</p>
<p>2) How should I go about fixing the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any help. Thanks.</p>

    <title>Tritton Warhead 7.1 wireless headset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xthemorningstar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tritton Warhead 7.1 wireless headset</h2>
                    
<p>I am aware that as of right now chat will not work through the warheads, but in game audio will through the digital optical imput.</p>
<p>My question is, will Microsoft be manufacturing a wireless adapter to allow chat function for the warheads to the xbox one.</p>
<p>I have conflicting reports, some on the Tritton facebook say that an adapter -IS- coming, however I have also heard reports that Microsoft has said that they are not making an adapter to support this headset.</p>
<p>I've contacted Tritton and Tritton says to contact Microsoft, I contact Microsoft and Microsoft say to contact Tritton and thusly the perpetual circle continues.</p>
<p>At this point I really don't care if it works or not, I would just like a definitive answer that way I can either continue waiting for an adapter if one is planned, or go out and purchase a new gaming headset that will work with the xbox one.</p>
<p>Its the state of limbo that bothers me the most.</p>

<p>Can any one here help with this?</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance</p>

<p>Adrenline - The adapter that Microsoft is currently making is only for a 2.5mm Jack imput for existing wired headsets</p>
<p>The Tritton Warheads are 100% wireless and have no cables </p>
<p>All data to the headset is received wirelessly though the headsets docking station, so the adapter in current production is useless for the warheads</p>
<p>There would need to be a wireless adapter that would allow the warhead docking station to sync with the xbox one</p>

<p>Ok &nbsp;so i wonder if this has been tried........</p>
<p>What about a &nbsp;jack splitter plugged into the Warheads with the Tritton mic plugged into 1 output and the cable adapter thats appearing on auction sites plugged into the other? Chat would then come wirelessly via the controller?</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>I currently wear the xbox chat headset with my Warheads over the top. </p>
<p>Not the most comfortable set up and I can only hear the sound out of one ear (handy when the enemy is approaching from the left!!)</p>
<p>Oh and it makes me look a tad special. :o)</p>

<h2>            Games for Windows Live AND Microsoft Store App - NOT WORKING.</h2>
                    Before I even say anything about my problems, it's not my internet. I can use other applications fine, and I'm obviously browsing the net, right this moment, on the computer I'm having the problems on. Months and months ago, I was given the game Dark Souls: Prepared to Die Eddition. I downloaded the game, and tried to install it. Games for Windows Live was installed, yet when the application opened up, it gave me errors, specifically that I needed to update the application: Oh, did I try, and fail. I uninstalled the GFWL steam downloaded, and downloaded the apparent most recent GFWL; but alas, of course I was still having problems. This time it gave me an error that something was missing (I can't remember what it was now.), so I looked up why I could be having problems, I was told to download a specific previous version, which I did, and update via that installer, but when it popped up to install, I was apparently having connection problems to the microsoft site; that was both on the brows

            I'm sorry, but did you even read my problem? It's not my drivers, if you'd read what I wrote properly, you'd know the problem is with GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE, and that halfway through downloading on the installer, IT CANT CONNECT TO THE MICROSOFT DOWNLOADS,
 and my computer CANT either. - I also cannot use WINDOWS UPDATE, or any of the tiles on the homescreen. ----------------- and, that site you linked to; OVER half of the people say it's not compatible, that doesn't mean it is compatible; it doesn't matter what
 that says; it's the people who say whether it is or not.

            I managed to screw up Windows 8 and had to restore the system, now, they're working fine. I don't need help anymore; and this seemed to be the only thing to fix it, not sure why. Here's to hoping nothing goes wrong after installing the game, since GFWL
 is now installed properly.

<h3> rachelcampbell5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Service Agreement Update on August 30, 2019</h2>
                    <p>I received an email from Microsoft alerting me to Service Agreement Updates.&nbsp; I do not understand the agreement or the updates.&nbsp; One of the updates says you have to sign in periodically.&nbsp; I've never done that.&nbsp; I don't even think I have any services. No
 X-Box (whatever that is).&nbsp; I just send emails, social networking and surf.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Microsoft Customer Service and not only could I not understand the woman's accent, but she didn't tell me anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I just disregard this verbose Service Agreement?</p>

            What is the Stop Error (the numbers on the blue screen)? Do you have multiple CD/DVD drives or just one? Please give a brief description of your computer, including its make/model, type (laptop/desktop) and its approximate age.

            Hi Charianne,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your reply. In answer to your questions:<br />
<br />
- the tablet has never connected to my computer<br />
- so far I only connected the tablet to one of two ports on the front of the Dell Optiplex 390, neither of which connects<br />
- I just removed the webcam, connected the tablet to one of the six ports on the back of the computer, and it connected, the drivers loaded successfully and all is well<br />
- Problem is that all 6 ports are being used by mouse, keyboard, printer etc.<br />
<br />
What can be done to make the two front ports responsive?<br />

<p>The fact that the computer recognized that there was a new device connected into the USB port, although it is unidentified, that means the port itself is still working. Sometimes, you just need to check if there are available updates on your computer drivers.
 Kindly visit the link provided for the steps on how to check for updates: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15048/windows-7-update-driver-hardware-not-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>The <strong>rear</strong> USB ports recognize the Samsung device and name it as such in Device Manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>front</strong> ports do not recognize it and name it as "unknown" device.

<p>Might be the ports are dead. It happened to me on my desktop few years ago. With few tinkering on the hardware itself, I ended up replacing the front ports entirely. If you already checked the device manager list and all looks good, maybe its time to think
 that the problem doesnt lie in the software itself but on the hardware. Im giving you a link below, hope that helps. But need to set your expectation as some of the troubleshooting in there requires changing something on the registry. If you're not comfortable
 doing it, don't do it at all. you might mess with the registry and end up screwing up the entire system</p>

<h2>            Gears of War 3 Limited Edition - Adam Fenix download code</h2>
                    
<p><span>I'm trying to redeem an Adam Fenix Gears of War 3 character code via Backwards Compatibility on Xbox One, but the code isn't working. I purchased the Gears of War 3 Limited Edition, and yet it says "this code has already been used".&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The code was purchased from a seller online, but it was completely sealed and new. The code is printed on a physical COG replica inside the special edition box, and it's facing down inside it so couldn't possibly have been used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I contacted customer support, they ran the code through a check and it was redeemed in September 2011 (!). Long before the listing was available to buy now, and again, it was sealed so shouldn't have been used.</p>
<p><span>The thing is, I didn't buy this from a chain retailer. And the special edition is out of print. So there's so no way they can just create a new code for me.

            <p>Sorry to hear it. &nbsp;First off, I wanted to mention that you should never post codes on the forums. &nbsp;Even if they have been used.</p>
<p>Now, there are two possibilities here.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;The package had been opened at one time and then resealed. &nbsp;You should definitely contact the seller to let him know the code is not valid</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;(and probably the most likely cause) The code has expired. &nbsp;Gears of War 3 came out quite a few years ago. &nbsp;Even special edition codes do expire after time. &nbsp;You could try contacting Gears support to see if it's possible to issue you a new code for the purchased product. &nbsp;They may not do it but you never know until you ask.</p>

<p>Thanks for your suggestions. However the Gears support forum redirects things like this here to Xbox support. Unless there's a contact number or specific forum I'm missing, option 2 isn't viable. And like I said, the seller is not a high street retailer,
 and would be unable to generate a new code. And I highly doubt they'd go to the trouble of resealing an entire limited edition with official Xbox wrapping after using the code!
</p>
<p>Obviously, this is hugely disappointing. I don't understand why Microsoft are unable to generate a new code. Like I said above, I've worked in the industry and know this is fully possible. A real shame, especially as a life long Xbox / Gears fan.

    <title>PC crashing when starting games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> digimicah  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC crashing when starting games</h2>
                    
<p>This is going to be a bit long as I hope any details might shed light on my problem. I'm having issues with games starting up. Whenever a game gets to a point where it starts to display 3d graphics, my system crashes. I've searched many forums and found
 some similar problems, but none of the fixes worked for me.</p>
<p>First of all, I'm running 4G of RAM, Intel Pentium D processors, both at 3.00 GHz, and an Nvidia GeForce 8800 GT.</p>
<p>A bit of background first. I've been playing World of Warcraft on my pc for a couple years now. Back in August, I fell prey to a pretty widespread keylogger from worldofraids.com that took advantage of a vulnerability in Flash player. My account was compromised,
 but restored by Blizzard. I cleaned the infected files off my computer manually, as AVG didn't catch them, and installed Kaspersky, which caught a couple others I had missed.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next few months I noticed decreasing performance from my pc. I would get about 35 fps in a boss fight, 15 the next, 3 after that, then about one frame per six seconds. Some of my guild members suggested overheating, but another guildie
 said my paging file was being flooded by remnants of the keylogger. He gave me a list of programs to run (malwarebytes, smitfraudfix, and ccleaner, among others). I followed his instructions, cleaned almost 200 infected registry keys, and showed up for raids
 the next week with no problems (I even topped the damage meters for several fights).</p>
<p>Our raid week finished and in the interim I played Torchlight through Steam up through the night before our next raid day. When I logged on to raid the next night, my graphics glitched and I was unable to play. The screen would pixelate, the sound would
 start stuttering, and I got a bsod. The bsod happened twice and every other time the pc would either just lock up or reboot itself. I thought it might be a problem with WoW, so I loaded up Torchlight and got the same issue.</p>
<p>My minidumps for the times I actually got bsods indicated nvidia drivers being at fault. I took my roommate's video card and put it in my pc and was able to log into WoW without crashing, but my sound went out (Windows stated it was due to an audio conflict).
 I put my card in a friend's pc, and it ran WoW without a problem. I tried updating my drivers as well as rolling back to older drivers to no effect.
<br />
<br />
I ran stress tests on my system, and the memory passes, my cpu passes, pretty much everything up to the gpu, which still crashes my pc without indicating why exactly. The mobo appears fine, with no bulging or leaking capacitors.</p>
<p>From my reading on similar crashes I figured I might have residual registry issues so I bought Windows 7 (as XP Media Center came preloaded on my pc)&nbsp;and did a custom install of 64-bit, saving nothing. I downloaded new drivers for everything, and even updated
 the BIOS for my mobo. I reinstalled WoW, and it still crashes.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
While looking up specs on my card I noticed that it requires a 400W minimum power supply. Mine was 300W, although it had run for over a year with no problem. Thinking that any change in my fan settings or the like might<br />
be drawing just enough power to make it fail, I ordered a new 550W power supply. After replacing it, I still crashed. I was able to log in once for about 10&nbsp;minutes after replacing the supply, but the next time I tried logging in (several hours after having
 powered down my pc) it crashed immediately.</p>
<p>I haven't gotten a bsod since the first couple of times, so I have no minidumps to access. I turned off the automatic reboot, but that just causes my system to hang when I crash and I have to power down manually.</p>
<p>A couple more things I've noticed that may be related:&nbsp; When I start WoW from the launcher, usually the screen would go black temporarily and then go to the login screen. Since the problems began, in that brief time where the screen goes black, it flashes
 some white text on the screen in a DOS-style display. I haven't been able to read it as it happens so fast, but it mentions shading and some other graphics settings. It's a short list of items, about 10-15 lines.<br />
<br />
Also, from time to time while my computer's idle (not in sleep mode, usually while I'm playing my 360) I hear the speakers make a popping sound, similar to when you first turn them on. I've checked for anything that might be shorting by touching the case, but
 everything looks to be fine. The wiring in my apartment is a bit older, but I'm running my pc, monitor, and speakers through a UPS.</p>
<p>I'm pretty much at a loss as to what to do now, other than trying to replace my mobo. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd be happy to try them out. Sorry this was a bit on the long side. Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi digimicah,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft Windows forum.<br />
<br />
<strong>To troubleshoot BSOD problems, boot your computer in Safe Mode and check :</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Here is how you do it : </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Select Safe Mode when the Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press ENTER<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>If it works with Safe Mode you may want to perform Clean Boot .<br />
</strong>&nbsp;<br />
You can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note </strong>When you perform a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or you may experience the original behavior.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Follow the below steps to put your computer in clean boot state: </strong>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note </strong>If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer
 unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Click Start button, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup , and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points.
 Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5. Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start button, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab , click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart .<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Looks like there is a problem with the display drivers.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As the posts above mention, the problem is with your drivers.&nbsp; BSOD crashes are commonly caused by bad drivers (manufacturer's code).&nbsp; With Windows 7 being new your manufacturer doesn't have fully working drivers.<br />
Unfortunatly when this is the case there is little Microsoft can do as the problem is with the vendor's code.&nbsp; I suggest you beat down on their support lines (send them your crash information) and tell them that you are getting crashes as a result of their
 hardware and drivers - they should open the relevent support tickets for you.<br />
<br />
<strong>What you may try doing: </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Update all drivers (sound card, graphics card, etc...)<br />
2. Try disabling caching<br />
3. Try disabling virtualization<br />
4. Try using onboard sound with updated drivers<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Make sure you have the latest chipset drivers installed along with the latest <strong>
BIOS</strong>.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>BIOS DISCLAIMER:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer
 from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;<br />
I also suggest you to download and install the latest updated drivers.<br />

If none of this works, try dropping to 2Gb RAM.<br />
If your board has 3 or 4 slots, use only slots 1 and 2<br />

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, however after&nbsp; researching your suggestion, your fix<span> "Unable to turn off sleep/standby (windows 8 x64)" has nothing to do with my problem.</span></p>
<p>My problem is -</p>
<p><span>Windows 10 shutting down as soon as "low battery level" has been reached, thus ignoring warning and critical level settings.</span></p>

            <p>We'll need to do some&nbsp;"digging" here. Please answer <em>each of the following </em>
[admittedly tedious] <em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting my post:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I installed Windows via a boot-able USB and had to transfer over cd-dvd drivers for it to complete the installation.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1. When (exact date) did you install Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Did you format the HDD before you installed Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Are you running Win7 32-bit or Win7 64-bit?</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;After the install of Windows , Windows Update was not working and had to do several things to start the service but it works now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>4. What did you have to do to get Windows Update working again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Is Windows Update working or is the computer merely fully-patched at Windows Update? [Yes, there's a difference.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription&nbsp; </em>(if any) <em>expire?</em> What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed? What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Is Internet Explorer 8 (IE8), IE9, IE10, or IE11 installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Is&nbsp;KB3197868 and/or KB3188740&nbsp;listed in <strong>Installed Updates </strong>
(<em>not </em><strong><em>Update History</em></strong>)? [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Is Adobe Flash Player <strong>v23.0.0.207</strong> installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>10. Is Firefox <em>version 49.0.2</em> (or higher) and/or Google Chrome <em>version&nbsp;</em><em>54.0.2840.99</em><em>
</em>(or higher) or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>11. Are you in the habit of using "registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic;
<em>System Mechanic</em>; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Total System Care; Glary Utilities; Registry Booster;
<em>McAfee QuickClean</em>; <em>AVG Quick Clean</em>;&nbsp;<em>AVG PC TuneUp</em>; Norton Registry Cleaner;
<em>Norton&nbsp;PC Tuneup</em>; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; FixMyPC; PC Doctor; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Comodo System Cleaner; Advanced System Optimizer; CCleaner

<h2>            Windows 7 Installation Error 0x80070017</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Everyone!<br />
<br />
Yesterday I recieved my copy of Windows 7 Ultimate NFR (Not for Resale) from the Microsoft Expert Zone.&nbsp; I tried to install it however I came up with error code 0x80070017.&nbsp; So, after a little bit of forum searching I found a few ways around this issue (installing
 it from a flash drive, using a different DVD/DVD-ROM drive, etc).&nbsp; However, none of these have worked for me.&nbsp; I am running Windows XP on the machine I am installing Windows 7 on.&nbsp; I have also tried a few different types of installs.&nbsp; Here's what I have tried
 so far:</p>
<p>-Upgrade Install (I put disk in with Windows XP running however it said I must do a Custom Install)<br />
<br />
-Custom Install (I put disk in and restart computer - this is where I ran into the above error code.&nbsp; I also tried to reformat the hard drive using the advanced tools however I still recieved the error.)<br />
<br />
-Custom Install&nbsp;on blank hard drive formatted using Windows 98 Startup Disk (FAT32 format)<br />
<br />
-Three Optical Drives (I used the DVD-ROM&nbsp;&amp; DVD-RW drives that were already installed on my computer and I installed a different DVD-ROM drive from a different computer and none have worked.)<br />
<br />
-Install from Flash Drive (I have tried to copy the files from the Windows 7 disk onto a SATA hard drive, flash drive, and USB external hard drive however I get error messages each time I try.&nbsp; Using the first two DVD drives I got the error 'Cannot copy install:
 Data error (cyclic redundancy check).' and using the other drive it said that it could not copy 'install.wim')<br />
<br />
Due to the error in copying the files off of the Windows 7 DVD is it possible that I recieved a bad disk?&nbsp; I have heard people have had problems with&nbsp;ISOs they burned themselves however this is a copy directly from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            Hi Devica, <br />
<br />
Thanks for posting Error code 0x80070017 usually refers to bad media. If this is happening on both your flash drive and your burned DVD media I would recommend that you download the file again as you may have corruption in the ISO itself. So if possible, download
 the file again. After you download the new copy, try to burn it on a lower setting 4x or 8x. After you burn the disk on a lower setting with the new ISO, then see if you can install Windows 7.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. Post back and let us know if this gets your issues resolved. <br />

<h2>            How to get 64 bit Windows 10</h2>
                    I ran the 32 bit disk first, when I installed windows 8.1 and it asked me if i wanted to update to windows 10. And I did but now I seem to be stuck with the 32 bit os and when I try to load the 64 bit disk it wont change my os to the 64 bit os I want.
 This is a new pc build. I I have tried to recovery yet I remained windows 10 with no change to the 32 bit. Please someone tell me how to get the 64 bit os I paid for.

            <p>Why did you run the 32 bit first?&nbsp; Shouldn't you have installed the 64 bit first, especially since that is what you paid for, right?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the problem is that you have to create the 64 bit media on a 64 bit machine.&nbsp; Once you do that, you can install the 64 bit on your newly built PC.</p>

            <p>Hey DARTH LimiteDZz, since you are experiencing issues with your Xbox App on your Windows 10 PC, I shifted your thread to the better suited section - just a head's up! :)</p>
<p>That said, let's have you check some settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your version of Windows 10 fully updated?</li>
<li>Is your Xbox App fully up to date?</li>
<li>Is your USB mic's firmware fully updated?</li>
<li>And what USB mic are you trying to use?</li>
</ul>
<p>Check for those updates and see if any of that helps. If not, post back with your mic's information and we'll see what we can do next. :)</p>

    <title>Dell Touchpad scrolling not working on old laptop after Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chasevogt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell Touchpad scrolling not working on old laptop after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>this is less a question and more an answer that will hopefully help someone in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my brother gave me an old dell inspiron N5030 that he no longer needed so i figured i'd update it from windows 7 to windows 10 and try and find some use for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>upon updating i discovered the touchpad's scroll feature no longer worked, this is the old vertical scroll on the right, horizontal scroll along the bottom type of device, not the more modern multi gesture two finger scroll we've all come to love.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after an in depth search i landed on these instructions and drivers that fixed the problem about 5 minutes ago, and figured i'd post here for posterity and for some poor soul reading this trying to avoid grabbing the scroll bar every 5 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The instructions for extracting and installing the drivers can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="http://dellwindowsreinstallationguide.com/dell-touchpad-drivers/#ExtractDriver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Fix your Dell Touchpad</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Under the heading "contents" you'll find links to the various drivers of each touchpad used in Dell Laptop's, a quick search of your model number should tell you where to start, mine was an Alps touchpad, and the driver that finally did the trick for me
 is listed on that page as&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://ftp.dell.com/input/R307442.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Alps Touchpad</a>&nbsp;– 7.1209.101.204 Windows 7 32/64 Bit</li><li><a href="http://ftp.dell.com/input/R307442.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Alps Touchpad Driver Download</a></li></ul>
<p>beware you may have to try quite a few of the drivers before you succeed, but there it is, so if you're on an ancient laptop but running windows 10 scroll to your hearts content</p>

About your second question, a security identifier (SID) is a unique value of variable length that is used to identify a security principal or security group in Windows operating systems.<br />
<br />
Null SID is a well known SID with value (S-1–0–0) to identify a group with no members. This is often used when a SID value is not known.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Internet connection problems &#40;Wi-Fi&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacobmichael&#40;xjmw&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Internet connection problems &#40;Wi-Fi&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have noticed this for a while now,but ever since I upgraded from Windows 8.1,my PC suddenly decides it won't have any internet connection through Wi-Fi.It shows up as "Connected,No Internet" under the network I'm connected to,but I have tested this multiple
 times and have seen it with my own eyes that,indeed it's my PC that has the issue and even tried connecting with multiple other devices (Other PCs,mobile phones and gaming consoles) during the issue and suprise suprise,it worked perfectly fine.Albeit,there
 is a way to resolve this,which is by restarting the device,I find it annoying to constantly have to restart for me to resolve something that more likely is yet again a simple coding error.Upon further notice I also found out that the issue mostly occurs when
 I resume use of my PC after setting it to sleep mode and sometimes it even occurs when changing networks as well.In the case someone has figured out a solution,let me know I am inquired to finding out the true cause of the issue and hopefully resolve it with
 relative ease.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
I had replied stating that restarting fixed this issue,but now it no longer does.When my PC wants to,it loses connection to the internet and once again when it wants to,it connects again.I WANT to fix this,thus I expect a reply which could potentially help
 fixing this.As a side note however,I believe it's the driver that is causing this error,so if you have a drive download link for a driver compatible with a Windows 10 (Previously W8.1) laptop post it in a reply below so I can check and confirm my issue.<br />
<br />
LAST EDIT:<br />
So after all this, I have finally come to the root of my issues.<br />
Unfortunately, it's not a small thing. My searching suggests that the issue is, as far as I can tell, a compatibility issue between my Wi-Fi Adapter (driver) and Windows 10. Since my PC was originally made to have 8.1 and not 10, it makes sense.<br />
https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/19654/Ralink-Wireless-Network-Driver-for-Desktop-Boards<br />
The Wi-Fi Adapter I have is a Ralink RT3290 802.11bgn and since they seem to be unsupported by Intel, it makes me that much more certain that the driver doesn't cooperate with W10 (considering that the issues come to surface at random, either while booting
 up, starting my PC after putting it to sleep, or even while I'm watching a video or something of the sort, plus resseting the Adapter ALWAYS fixes the issue, it's even more likely that this is indeed the answer).<br />
So to sum up, it's the Ralink Wi-Fi Adapter Driver that is causing my issues, and could perhaps be what is causing yours as well. I personally have yet to confirm the ends of my issues, but here's a few things you can try to fix the issue for yourself:<br />
1) Use/Download Intel's Driver Update Utility to automatically search and find any drivers that may require updating from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here.</a>2) Manually download Intel's
 Realtek Wireless Driver for Windows 10 (should fix your issues) from&nbsp;<a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25071/Realtek-Wireless-Driver-for-Windows-10-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here.</a><br />
3) Manually download Intel's Network Adapter Driver from&nbsp;<a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25016/Intel-Network-Adapter-Driver-for-Windows-10-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> (haven't tried this yet so proceed with caution) .<br />
<br />
Hopefully you will manage to fix your issues.<br />

<p>Okay,so after checking a good amount of the probable fixes,I must say that my issue is not resolved.<br />
Restarting did fix the issue,but not permanently.Most other probable fixes didn't work however.<br />
That being said I have not checked all solutions,thus please keep that in mind.<br />
I await a reply as to how should I continue my attempts to fix this,as it has started becoming more and more common.</p>

<h2>            Airplane mode button does not turn off in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell Inspiron 17 running Windows 10 and my Airplane mode light stays lit even though I am connected with my WiFi. When I check my settings it says that Airplane mode is off but for some reason I can't figure out the Airplane mode button stays lit
 in the action center. Having the light lit does not prevent me from making a WiFi connection as I am connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me how to turn this off.</p>

            It's a known bug.&nbsp; As you already know, only the highlight is stuck showing, but the airplane mode is not actually on because you are connected.&nbsp; But they've acknowledge it (and even fixed it in the new test builds), and will send out a public update soon
 to address it.

            Thank you for the information. Do you have any idea when this fix might be released and does it seem to be a problem that alot of people are having? &nbsp; Dell support as well as Microsoft support both have not been able to help me and it's driving me crazy.
 &nbsp;Thanks.

<p>The official announcement is here:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px">After logging in to your PC, you may hit a UI issue in which Airplane Mode will incorrectly show as “on” even though your PC’s Wi-Fi is powered on. This is due to a timing issue between how the UI communicates
 and waits for the underlying platform to respond. The UI for Airplane Mode essentially does not wait long enough for the device’s physical radios to power on before reporting the current state.&nbsp;You can toggle the Airplane Mode on and off to get Airplane Mode
 back to showing the correct state. https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/02/03/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14257</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can toggle it off and on to make it match the real status, but you can also just safely ignore it and continue using your connection normally.&nbsp; They are working on it but there's no solid release date for it to be shipped out. They'll finish testing
 it and roll it together with other updates and send with a cumulative update or build.</p>
