    <title>Video Drivers &#40;NVIDIA GeForce 310M&#41; cause Windows 10 to BSOD - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Video Drivers &#40;NVIDIA GeForce 310M&#41; cause Windows 10 to BSOD</h2>
                    <p>I recently tried to upgrade Windows from 7 to 10 (64-bit) on a Toshiba Satellite A665-S6070, and was unable to get the video driver successfully installed.&nbsp; As the title indicates, this laptop has an NVIDIA GeForce 310M video card.&nbsp; Windows is stable (although
 the resolution is low) if the driver for the display adapter is set to the "Microsoft Basic Display Adapter."&nbsp; However, if I try to install any other driver for the adapter, the computer blue screens with the error: ATTEMPTED_EXECUTE_OF_NOEXECUTE_MEMORY. Here
 is more information about the crashes (from WhoCrashed):</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Fri 11/27/2015 3:57:16 PM GMT your computer crashed<br />
crash dump file: C:\WINDOWS\Minidump\112715-11312-01.dmp<br />
This was probably caused by the following module: nvlddmkm.sys (nvlddmkm+0x7124D)
<br />
Bugcheck code: 0xFC (0xFFFFD001C5FCD910, 0x800000000F730963, 0xFFFFD001C5FCD150, 0x2)<br />
Error: ATTEMPTED_EXECUTE_OF_NOEXECUTE_MEMORY<br />
Bug check description: This indicates that an attempt was made to execute non-executable memory.<br />
This might be a case of memory corruption. More often memory corruption happens because of software errors in buggy drivers, not because of faulty RAM modules. There is a possibility this problem was caused by a virus or other malware.
<br />
A third party driver was identified as the probable root cause of this system error. It is suggested you look for an update for the following driver: nvlddmkm.sys .
<br />
Google query: nvlddmkm.sys ATTEMPTED_EXECUTE_OF_NOEXECUTE_MEMORY</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried installing the current driver NVIDIA's website gives me for the 310M card (driver version 341.92) as well as the most recent driver Toshiba recommends for the laptop model on Windows 8.1 (version 327.65).&nbsp; Also, we had to downgrade back to Windows
 7 because this is a work laptop and it needed to be in operation, so I'm unable to do any additional testing unless we re-upgrade.&nbsp; I am hoping someone can offer an explanation as to why this is happening, though.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that you are facing issues with Windows 10. I apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.</span></p>
<p><span>The issue could occur if some faulty driver or software is not installed properly.</span></p>
<p>To assist you better, please provide the information:</p>
<p>Have you made any changes to the Computer&nbsp;prior to the issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SYS files such as nvlddmkm.sys are <strong>third-party (eg. Microsoft) device drivers or critical system files</strong> that come as part of the Windows operating system. Most SYS files allow internal PC hardware or attached hardware, such as a printer,
 to communicate with third-party software programs (eg. web browsers, word processors, the operating system (eg. Windows).</p>
<p>Nvlddmkm.sys blue screen errors can be caused by a variety of hardware, firmware, driver, or software issues. These could be related to either Windows10 software or Microsoft hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the below methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: I suggest you to uninstall any third party software which might be causing the issue and also try to update the driver in the device manager.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would also suggest you to update the latest driver in Device Manager.<br />
1.&nbsp;Press <strong><span>Windows Key + R Key</span></strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;Then type “<strong><span>devmgmt.msc</span></strong>” without the quotes and hit on Enter Key.<br />
3.&nbsp;Expand <strong><span>each options.</span></strong><br />
4.&nbsp;Right click on the driver and click on <strong><span>Update driver software</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If the issues still persist, refer to the below method.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>: I&nbsp;suggest you to&nbsp;scan the Computer with Windows Defender or with any other antivirus
 for&nbsp;virus.</span></p>
<p><span>If you do not&nbsp;have any antivirus software on the Computer, then you can install the Microsoft&nbsp;Safety Scanner and scan with it.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for your response.&nbsp; I forgot to mention I had already tested the memory using Windows Memory Diagnostic, which returned no error, so I don't think the RAM is the issue.&nbsp; Also, as to your suggestion in Method 1: as I wrote above, installing any driver
 other than the "Microsoft Basic Display Adapter" causes the BSOD, including right-clicking in Device Manager and selecting "Update Driver Software."&nbsp; I don't believe the computer is infected with a virus, as we keep anti-virus installed and updated; however,
 I will have the user scan the system and I will report back.</p>

            Hi, I´m Douglas M. 
<br />
<br />I would like to help you, just zoom your screen:
<br />
<br />In most browsers, you can also press Ctrl + + . Each time you tap + while holding Ctrl , the screen magnification will increase until it reaches the maximum zoom level.
<br />If you have a mouse with a scroll wheel, you can press and hold Ctrl while scrolling forward on the scroll wheel to zoom in.
<br />
<br />
<br />kinds Regards

            What make and model is the drive?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
What make and model is the external enclosure?<br />
<br />
The problem may be that many (all?) drives with capacities over 2.1 TB use "Advanced Format."&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows XP doesn't support this (see
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2510009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2510009</a>).&nbsp; See this explanatory article from HP:
<a href="http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c02691731.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c02691731.pdf</a> (mostly about installing Windows on an Advanced Format drive, but has some useful information and links).<br />
<br />
However, some disk manufacturers provide solutions.&nbsp; If you have a Western Digital drive, see<a href="http://www.wdc.com/global/products/features/?id=7&amp;language=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://www.wdc.com/global/products/features/?id=7&amp;language=1</a>&nbsp;
<a href="http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c02691731.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
</a><br />
The WD article says to use the alignment tool for "full performance," which suggests that the drive should be recognized even if you haven't yet used the tool, so something else may be going on.&nbsp; I see at the bottom of that article a link to another WD article
 about using Advanced Format drives in USB enclosures.&nbsp; In that article, WD says, "WD does not support using any of our Advanced Format Drive alignment utilities on third party USB enclosures. ... Since WD does not provide support for installing our drives
 in 3rd party enclosures, you will need to contact the enclosure manufacturer for any further help installing the drive."
<br />
<br />
If the WD Alignment Tool doesn't help, or if you have a different manufacturer's disk, get in touch with tech support from the disk manufacturer.<br />
<br />
Another possibility is that your external enclosure does not support a 3 TB drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; See this thread:
<a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/forums/f16/hitachi-0f12450-hdst723030ala640-3tb-drive-not-recognized-587112.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I just went there and I can only see my screenshots which I think would mean there's a few issues going on at the moment.</p>

            I removed the Vaio Smart Network Utility, and the network still was not working. It was showing that the wifi card was installed and the drivers were working but the wireless connection tab was all blank except for the speed which showed an impossible
 412.3 Gbps. I also could not locate or connect to any wifi networks.
<div><br />
<div>I restored the registry but still the same problem, so I decided to delete all of the Atheros wifi drivers both the Atheros and microsft version from my system. I then installed a generic or non oem atheros driver for my wifi from www.atheros.cz V. 10.0.0.251.
 Immediately my wifi started to work, I then re-installed the Vaio smart Netwok utility as it controls the software on off switch for the wifi card and bluetooth as well. It's been 2 days and I haven't had a BSOD yet, fingers crossed.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>How do you Dedicate Windows 7 To Core 0 on a dual core processor&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dan2me76  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you Dedicate Windows 7 To Core 0 on a dual core processor&#63;</h2>
                    Computer info first.&nbsp; I am running&nbsp; windows 7 64 bit operating system on a toshiba satalite (if you want model number info, just ask)&nbsp; with an AMD dual core 1.9 Ghz processor with 4 gig of ram.&nbsp; This is a laptop with a suspected cooling problem, but it's
 on a cooling pad on a wood service with nothing surrounding it.<br />
<br />
Now, on to my issue.&nbsp; I play a number of on line games at the same time.&nbsp; They are web browser based games.&nbsp; I use firefox and google chrome to run them because one of the game has a script I can run with it (possibly, my primary problem).&nbsp; One of the games
 is Dragons of Atlantis (the game I run the script with).&nbsp; I run two tabs of that game on firefox with the script, and at time (not too often) another entity of that game on chrome.&nbsp; Dragons of Atlantis is a game I run off Facebook on firefox and a Google game
 I run off chrome.&nbsp; It is made by Kabam in case you want to research it (just to add in there, Technically, the script I use is against the user policy of the game, but is not punishable).&nbsp; But lets forget about chome for the time being.&nbsp; That is usually only
 run for about 30 minutes before my wife goes to work and maybe about an hour or two after work.&nbsp; I run firefox with the other two tabs of Dragons of Atlantis and scripts on both on firefox.&nbsp; I also run a tab with an EA game called lord of ultima.&nbsp; Just to
 let you know, I am running Lord of Ultima right now with this tab open typing this and my processor usage is averaging about 50%.&nbsp; So I know the script is my problem.&nbsp; What I want to do is load and run windows 7 on core zero of my processor, and run firefox
 on core 1.&nbsp; I want to set these as permanently dedicated operations.&nbsp; My hope is that having windows running on it's own core and firefox running on it's own core, it might fix the problem of my processor hitting 100% constantly when I'm running the 3 game
 entity's with 2 scripts on firefox.&nbsp; Chome slows everything down a lot more and that probably won't ever change.&nbsp; But I'm hoping I can get a little bit of control.<br />
<br />
Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; If you need meoreinfo, please ask any questions you wish.&nbsp; I will try to answer them if I can.&nbsp; I do know that there is no issue with my internet connection considering it is a cable broadband conection I run
 with a CAT5 cable directly to the modem.&nbsp; It is reported by the cable company to be a 9 mb connection, but seems to run at 10 +.&nbsp; Thank you in advance for any help you can give.<br />

            Actually, I researched the problem further and discovered that there was a major problem in the .dll files and some system 32 files that had become corrupted.&nbsp; I'm not sure what caused the corruption, Norton Internet Security had never found a virus, but
 those corruptions were causing kernels to get trapped into a loop causing the high CPU usage I was trying to repair by dedicating one core to my operating system.&nbsp; So I ran a clean install and everything appears to be working fine now.<br />
Thank you for your help.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Surface for Maths Student</h2>
                    I am considering getting a surface book for university. I will be studying maths and wondering a surface book is good for writing notes and formulas. Is it better to use this over pen and paper for writing equations?

            <p>Surface Book (or any of the other Surface models, such as the different Surface Pro models) are great for taking notes, even when mathematical equations are involved. OneNote (which comes free and preinstalled with Windows 10) not only lets you write with
 the Surface Pen (which means you can write anything you want, and there are also features in Windows 10 to have it recognize text), but Windows 10 also comes with an accessory app called Math Input Panel which lets you write mathematical equations to be inserted
 into apps that support it (which includes OneNote).</p>

<p>Sometimes it all just depends on personal preference, but since as you obviously know, everybody needs a computer of some kind regardless of whether they use it for their notetaking, Surface Book is great for that anyway, and if you end up preferring paper
 over digital for your mathematical notes, there is never anything to stop you from switching back, so I would definitely&nbsp;recommend the Surface Book as the best choice! Good luck!</p>

You need an audio / sound device driver.</p>
<p>What is the make &amp; model of your computer as a whole?</p>

            If you follow these instructions, we will should know enough about your machine to give you the best advice:<br />
<br />
Since the Microsoft Answers forum implementation does not prompt for any kind of system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and
 agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
What do you see (exactly) that you don't think you should be seeing and when do you see it?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
Now provide a few more gory details:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
For audio device and driver information, expand the Components, click Sound Device, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.
<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />
<br />
This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork.<br />

    <title>where are my files after windows 10 &#34;upgrade&#34; &#63;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> koinca  say:</h3>
<h2>            where are my files after windows 10 &#34;upgrade&#34; &#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>After installing Windows 10, I lost then found my missing files and&nbsp;documents&nbsp;in Windows.old. I moved them back on to my desktop, where they were before the upgrade, opened several docs to make sure they were accessible (they were fine), changed the background.
 Then I rebooted. EVERYTHING was gone again. I finally found the files again (this time in Windows.old/Users/ MYNAME/Favorites - but NO documents were&nbsp;in the files!! I have searched for&nbsp;docs by name but when I found and tried to&nbsp;open them they not accessible.
 And the old background is back. I tried signing in both with my old sign in and my new Microsoft sign in. NO difference. I searched in OneDrive. Nothing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now what do I do??</p>
<p>I don't have backups, and frankly with the assurances about "All your files are where you left them!" it didn't occur to me to do so. That should have been the very first message in the Window for the process if this is the case!!!!!!!!!!!! "Back up your
 files because we are going to lose them for you!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so unhappy with this so-called "upgrade"! To have to search for my documents in the first place, set everything up again, then lose them all again, spend hours searching and trying all the suggestions in this community to no avail - this is insane!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want my documents back! I would happily go back to&nbsp;my old system! Who needs an "upgrade" like this?!</p>

            <p>The problem may be that you said you moved them back to your desktop, where they were before the upgrade. The desktop is not the place to save files. The safe place MS would have expected them to be was in your personal folders. (documents, pictures etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You were probably logged in with a temp profile when you moved the documents and that is why the profile disappeared when you restarted. If you moved and not copied files from the windows.old folder then the files are no longer available if you roll back
 to your previous system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you looked in C:\users\[yourname] folders, or any of the named users folders. When you open Start is your login name at the top left hand of the start window.?</p>

            <p>Yes, my profile name was on the top corner after the upgrade. I logged in with my prior-to-upgrade log in, as instructed, then moved the documents back to desktop from Window.old. Everything worked fine until I rebooted, after which I was only able to log
 on with my Microsoft login password. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep files I used frequently on my desktop, like most people do.&nbsp; Nowhere have I read that users should not do that. It was not posted in the messages for the upgrade. I also lost my shortcuts to FB and Gmail, etc. but those are retrievable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was finally contacted by Microsoft Help, who informed me the my computer (a 6 year old Gateway) didn't have the drivers to upgrade to Windows 10. &nbsp;I would have to&nbsp;go back to Windows 7 (fine with me!), and hope my documents showed up (they didn't).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First - Why didn't the upgrade itself ask or check to see if they drivers on the device were able&nbsp;to handle the upgrade?
</p>
<p>Second - Where were the warnings that should have preceded any upgrade? Instead, all I saw were reassurances that everything would be fine!</p>
<p>Third- Where on earth did my documents go? It seems like so much stuff is retrieved by hackers and the government all the time, is it really likely that these documents are really gone?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been a terrible experience. </p>

            <p>Took my laptop to a shop. It's been restored to a long ago back up but the documents I really need are gone. Not only that, the Windows 10 "Upgrade" somehow reached into my boss's share drive&nbsp;&nbsp;(it loads automatically with start up) and HIS backup drive and
 deleted files at random. After hours and hours of work, we found most of them in a&nbsp;"deleted" cache and were able to restore them to his share drive. How&nbsp;could&nbsp;that possibly happen when nothing happens in the share drive unless you physically add, move or delete
 items?? No idea, we just know it did. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>BEWARE: Windows 10&nbsp;was a catastrophe for my computer and&nbsp; automatically reached into a distant share drive was a near catastrophe there, too.

</p><p>Thankfully I am back on Windows 7 which works perfectly fine. It has taken about 36 hours of work this week to re-stabilize and recover. &nbsp;I have lost countless documents and will spend countless hours more to hunt through&nbsp;emails to recover the most important&nbsp;of
 those. Yes, I will be more vigilant about backing up my laptop more often, </p>
<p>but <strong>Microsoft </strong><strong>- &nbsp;how about you DON'T release products that&nbsp;will install in systems that can't handle the product, and will ultimately take a functioning system and nearly destroy it? How about that? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

            I found my files but am furious at the automatic downloading and/or tracking this new system is doing.&nbsp; It's late tonight but when I get to it I'm backing up everything I have and undoing this monster.&nbsp; It's like a virus and I don't trust it at all and
 think Microsoft should be turned in to the SEC and FCC for fraud.

            <p>Hi Nachappa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually&nbsp;disable any update suggestion for windows 10, but this time it installed anyway. After it, with all the changes, I looked for my files and nothing was on place. I found them in C: Users, so I move them back to My documents and Pictures, used the
 PC&nbsp;normally and shut it down. When I turned it on&nbsp;again some updates were in progress. The phrase "All your files are where you left them" appeared and also "Don't turn off computer".&nbsp; l log on and looked for my documents and now&nbsp;I cant find anything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked in Search, C:, Users, Windows.old, I cant find my files!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any backup for my files, but neither Microsoft aware me of what would happen with this update. Neither I agreed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me!!&nbsp;I have all my MBA works and personal photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Here's some info on the prefetch&nbsp;folder: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-is-the-prefetch-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>If you want to delete these 3 cookies, find them in the folders and delete them directly.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are typically in: C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Cookies\.&nbsp; Just right click on the ones you want to delete and that should take care of
 the problem.&nbsp; If that doesn't work, t<span>ry using one of the following free products to delete the cookies.&nbsp; Unlocker at:</span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Unlocker.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Unlocker.shtml</span></span></a></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>or

 These programs often work when normal Vista delete functions fail to operate properly.</span></p>
<p><span>If you're still loathe to delete the&nbsp;contents of that folder, you can try using CCCleaner<a href="http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download</a>&nbsp;and
 select ONLY the cookies and that should delete all the cookies in the system.&nbsp; Do NOT use this product as a Registry Cleaner - it may damage your system and your registry.</span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then there's probably no harm in deleting
 the contents of the windows prefectch folder though your system may be a little bit slower for a while until it rebuilds itself. I sincerely doubt this will do anything to delete those cookies and is pointless to solve that problem, but I believe it is basically
 safe and won't harm your system to do it.&nbsp; I just don't think it will do a single thing to resolve the problem (and I'd put quite a bit of money on that).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.</span></span></p>

<p>Two points:</p>
<p>1. You may simply be getting the cookies again by going to a<br />
particular web site.</p>
<p>2. You are using Norton Anti-Virus? In my view, and that of lots of<br />
others of us here, it's among the worst security software available. I<br />
strongly recommend you replace it with something better.</p>
<p>For an anti-virus program, I recommend eSet NOD32, if you are willing<br />
to pay for it. If you want a free anti-virus, I recommend one of the<br />
following three:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Avira<br />
Avast<br />
Microsoft Security Essentials<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You also need anti-spyware software. I recommend that you download and<br />
install (both freeware) MalwareBytes AntiMalware <strong>and</strong><br />
SuperAntiSpyware. </p>

<h2>            Read Only &#40;Folders&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Please help me understand... Viewing the folders with windows explorer, checking the properties....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is the "Read Only" shaded? This is with every folder on my drive, and network drives. If I change it to a "Check Mark" and reopen the properties it will show as shaded again... Why is that?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f90db3d6-631c-4c51-807a-9c832461f170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f90db3d6-631c-4c51-807a-9c832461f170" height="403" width="325" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wanting the folder and existing and future files to be "Read Only"... If I open a existing file in the folder make a modification to the file, the program will prompt me with this is a "Read Only" file do you want to continue to edit. YES/NO, I say
 yes, and go to save it. Then it prompts me with the "Save As" option only... This is a good thing! So I give the file a new name and save it under the "Read Only" folder. Here is the problem, the new file is not "Read Only", but it should be as it is under
 the "Read Only" folder. So I have to check the "Read Only" box again for the new file to be "Read Only". And when I go to do this the box shows as shaded? Shouldn't the box show a "Check Mark"????</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I did check to see if I have full rights on this computer and the network drive...</p>

<p>The "read only" box on a folder's properties sheet has caused much confusion over the years.&nbsp; The default state of this box is "filled in."&nbsp; This does
<strong>not </strong>mean that the "read only" attribute is set for a folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some folders do have the read only attribute set, which you can see by using the "attrib" command in a Command Prompt:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/923afc14-988a-407d-8933-a15e4471181a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/923afc14-988a-407d-8933-a15e4471181a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not mean that the folder is read only.&nbsp; If the read only attribute of a folder is set, Windows Explorer examines the folder to determine if it contains a desktop.ini file and if so, what customizations have been made to the folder's display.&nbsp; This
 is explained in "<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/326549/you-cannot-view-or-change-the-read-only-or-the-system-attributes-of-folders-in-windows-server-2003,-in-windows-xp,-in-windows-vista-or-in-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">You

<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><span><em><strong>Note</strong></em></span><em> Unlike the Read-only attribute for a file, the Read-only attribute</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>for a folder is typically ignored by Windows, Windows components and accessories, and other programs. For example, you can delete, rename, and change a folder with the Read-only attribute by using Windows Explorer.</em><br />
<br />
<em>The Read-only and System attributes is only used by Windows Explorer</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>to determine whether the folder is a special folder, such as a system</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>folder that has its view customized by Windows (for example,</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>My Documents, Favorites, Fonts, Downloaded Program Files), or a folder</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>that you customized by using the <strong>
Customize</strong> tab of the folder's</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><em><strong>Properties</strong> dialog box. As a result, Windows Explorer does not allow you</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>to view or change the Read-only or System attributes of folders. When a</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>folder has the Read-Only attribute set it causes Explorer to request the Desktop.ini of that folder to see if any special folder settings need to be set.
</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>It has been seen where if a network share that has a large amount of
</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>folders set to Read-only, it can cause Explorer to take longer then what is expected to render the contents of that share while it waits on the
</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>retrieval of the Desktop.ini files. The slower the network connectivity to
</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><em>the share the longer this process can take to the point where Explorer may timeout waiting for the data and render nothing or appear to hang.
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you check (or clear) the read only box on a folder's Properties sheet and click "Apply" or "OK" you get the following confirmation message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13e945a3-6bcb-4d7f-80d3-e00587fe9423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13e945a3-6bcb-4d7f-80d3-e00587fe9423" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on whether you cleared or checked the box, the read only attribute of all of the
<strong>files </strong>in the folder -- or all of the <strong>files </strong>in the folder and in all of its subfolders -- will have their read only attributes cleared or set.&nbsp; Nothing happens to the read only attribute of the folder or of any of its subfolders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving a file into a folder (or saving a file into a folder) will NOT automatically set its read only attribute just because all of the other files in the folder have been set that way.</p>

    <title>Activation Worked, then disappeared, in Win 7 under VirtualBox - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Activation Worked, then disappeared, in Win 7 under VirtualBox</h2>
                    <p>I have an XPS 13 running Fedora Linux 22. Win 7 is installed as a guest OS under VirtualBox. Office 2013 is installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set this up successfully and activated Win 7 and Office 2013 about a month ago. Win 7 activation wasn't automatic--I had to do the dance with the activation window, and typing in the 7-8 sets of 6-digit numbers to get another set of numbers with which
 to activate. But it worked. Office 2013 activation was automatic upon typing in the product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I didn't open up Win 7 for a while. When I did, I went to set up Outlook, and before I could see my mail, it said Outlook wasn't activated. I clicked on the automatic activation link, which worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then Windows said "this copy is not genuine" and asked me to activate! So I did the dance again, and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the heck? Is this going to stick this time? What did I not do, or do wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Matt</p>

<p>I don't know without searching. But I can say that MS never contact users directly (unless you are signed up to a newsletter) anything that pops up on the screen purporting to be from Microsoft that says you should contact them is not from Microsoft. (or
 a partner)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would notify your bank that you believe you have been scammed and give the name and date you made the debit card payment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you allowed them remote access to your computer then the general advise is to to save your personal files to an external device and clean install windows. After that change your passwords. If you use your computer for online banking I would say this is
 a "must do".</p>

            Well I checked with my bank &amp; all money is there. I deal with a small town bank that does not offer online banking. I have all bill payments auto drafted by the companys &amp; utilitys that I deal with. americageeksllc is a tech support company.with a website
 &amp; phone # &amp;&nbsp; # they gave me for tech support works I can call them &amp; they answer. All of this happened on the 13th of march, &amp; my account has not been touched I have all my passwords stored in my google acct.When I shop online I use paypal so my account #
 info is safe when I am shopping online. I think if this was a scam to get my account info they would have already drained my bank account. I hank you for your help. I just wish microsoft had a site thatI could check to see the tech company's they deal with
 were there. I have had other issuses with my computer &amp; when contacting microsoft about windows issuses was always connected to a tech support co. So I guess this one is ligitimate.

<p>Whenever I work on my footnotes a window pops up with the "This is not a valid action for footnotes" error, I try to click okay, but the window will not close and I cannot work around it. I have to start my task manager and "end" my windows task, thus causing

<p>
</p><p>I need some clarification because of the two following options:</p>
<p>When your computer is idle your status changes and when your status doesn't change for a certain amount of time then you get another status. Is the icon displayed the same for the two scenarios, the yellow one?
</p>
<p>

            Hi Jason,<br />
<br />
As I understand, you are unable to copy media files from USB drive, you get the error:"Cannot create or replace folder: the disk is write-protected".<br />
<br />
What is the make and model of USB flash drive?<br />
<br />
<b>Let's try the following methods and check.<br />
</b><br />
<b>Method 1: </b>Check if your flash drive has any write protection switch. If you have it, check it's status. If it is locked, unlock it by moving the switch.
<br />
<br />
<p><b><span>Method 2: Rename the file and check.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Right click on the file and select rename.</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Check the filename for invalid characters (colons, backslashes, vertical bars, less-than signs, greater-than signs, question marks, or asterisks).</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>If the filename has been entered correctly, but you still cannot create or replace the file, the drive may have run out of disk space. Go to the next step.</p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Let’s try to save the files to a new folder in your computer.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Use the following steps to save your files to a new folder.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click <b>Start, click All Programs</b>, click
<b>Accessories </b>and then click <b>Windows Explorer</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click the <b>Desktop</b> icon.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Right-click anywhere on the desktop, right click and click
<b>New</b>, then click <b>Folder</b>. </p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Try to copy the media files to this new folder.</p>
<br />
Hope the above information helps.<br />
