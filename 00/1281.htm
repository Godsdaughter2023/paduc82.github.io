            <p>Is your HTC 8X an operator branded variant?<br />
- if so, which operator?</p>
<p>Did the app store work previously?<br />
- if so, when (approximately) did it start to fail?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please find and post the information regarding operator branding (if any) and operating system version from: App list &gt; settings &gt; about &gt; more information</p>
<p>
</p><p>The primary Microsoft account must be set up correctly and verified, for the app store on the phone to work. From a PC, go through the settings on<br />
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/</a> <br />
to set up your language, country and time zone correctly on<br />
<a href="https://account.live.com/editprof.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/editprof.aspx</a>
<br />
Ghana is <strong>Universal Time - GMT</strong> in the selection box on that page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, check your incoming mail for any alerts and account verification messages on<br />
<a href="https://outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.com/</a> <br />
- using the same Microsoft username and password as on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If setting the date and time manually, Ghana is <strong>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</strong> in the list of time zones in Settings &gt; date + time on the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not post the same question on multiple boards. This is the most appropriate place (you get strange answers when posting on the Windows PC board!).</p>

In the following thread, it is suggested&nbsp; that it's the Windows Search service causing the problem.
<p>(On Windows 7, open the Start &gt; Run dialog, type "services.msc", locate "Windows Search" and double-click it, then for "startup type" select "disabled" , and click "Stop", if it's enabled)</p>

            <p>If it was removed and not quarantined, it is gone. If it is quarantined, open MSE, select History, select the radio button for quarantined files and you can highlight and restore.</p>
<p>I suggest changing the settings in MSE for all threat levels to quarantine from "recommended action" to prevent this from happening in the future.</p>
<p>What threat was identified by MSE and why do you need an infected file restored?</p>

    <title>Manual configuration of WLAN in Symbian&#94;3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajaydavidson---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Manual configuration of WLAN in Symbian&#94;3</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Intermediate
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br />
<br /><b>Details</b><br />
<p>Hello all, most of the users might be familiar with the manual setting up of WLAN. If someone is there having problems with WLAN configuring then this post might help them. To configure a WLAN manually do the following.<br />
<br />
Press the <font color="red">menu </font>button then tap <font color="red">settings</font>&gt;<font color="red">connectivity</font>&gt;<font color="red">settings</font>&gt;<font color="red">destinations</font>&gt;<font color="red">options</font>&gt;<font color="red">new destination</font>.<br />
<br />
A box will appear type the<font color="red"> destination name</font> and then select any icon from the set of icons that is shown then tap the
<font color="red">new destination</font> that you have created then tap<font color="red">options</font>&gt;<font color="red">new access point</font>.<br />
An option will appear asking whether to <font color="blue">"automatically check for available access points"</font> if you are in the range of the WLAN then tap
<font color="red">yes</font> or else <font color="red">no</font>. Generally use <font color="green">
no</font>. <br />
<br />
Three options will be provided like <font color="orange">WLAN</font> or <font color="orange">
Packet data</font> or <font color="orange">VPN</font>. Tap <font color="red">WLAN</font> then enter the
<font color="red">WLAN name</font> then select the <font color="orange">Network mode/status</font> three options will be shown. Select
<font color="blue">infrastructure(public)[usually this is used]</font>. If its an
<font color="green">open network</font> then tap <font color="blue">open network(no key is needed for this)</font> or else tap
<font color="red">WPA/WPA2</font> then tap <font color="red">pre-shared key and enter the key</font>. This will create the access point.<br />
<br />
Now tap the access point then <font color="red">options</font>&gt;<font color="red">advanced settings</font>&gt;<font color="red">IPv4 settings</font>. Tap the
<font color="red">Phone IP address</font> and enter the number. After this you will be provided with an option to enter the
<font color="red">subnet mask</font> and <font color="brown">default gateway</font>. Enter these numbers then tap
<font color="green">back</font>. Then tap <font color="brown">proxy server number</font> and enter the number that you had entered in the
<font color="brown">default gateway</font>. Then enter the <font color="red">port number</font>.
<br />
<br />
Then tap back and again back. To use this as the <font color="green">default connection</font> tap
<font color="red">options</font>&gt;<font color="red">default connections</font> and select the one that has the
<font color="red">WLAN access point</font> as the default one. The IP address and default gateway number and proxy port number will be provided by the WLAN provider. Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Syncing Office 365 between devices - specifically calendar &#38; contacts</h2>
                    I need information on syncing Office 365 Home Premium between devices. I currently have an HP laptop (running Windows 8) SurfacePro (running Windows 8 pro) and an HP desktop (running Windows 7 Home Premium). Office 365 is installed on each ("office 2013
 on the Windows 7 machine). &nbsp;Email inbox &amp; sent boxes sync up automatically just fine. I'm running into problems with my calendar &amp; contacts syncing between devices. (more concerned about the laptop &amp; surface as those are what I use the most). They both say
 "(This computer only)' in Calendar, Contacts, and Drafts &amp; Junkmail. Any assistance I could get so they'll all talk to each other would be fantastic! So far I"m loving the Office 365 product... do I need to upgrade to one of the pro-versions to achieve this?&nbsp;<span>

<p>Windows update doesn't offering build 10532.<br />
I'm running the build 10240 of Windows 10, the insider program is on and it's configured in the fast ring. I quitted the program, changed the ring speed, but none of these worked.</p>
<p>Please, let me know if you have any way to fix it.</p>

<h2>            Initial OneNote Impressions, Issues from an &#34;Evernote Migrant&#34;</h2>
                    <p>There is a lot to like about OneNote, but much of that potential has been undermined by the repeated sync problems I've been having with ON since I started my migration project a week ago. I'm hoping that I'll get some help here in finding some solutions
 to my issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here's some background on what I have and what I'm looking to accomplish with OneNote:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>As noted, I am looking at migrating to ON from Evernote. I have been an EN user pretty much from the start, and I've accumulated roughly 13,000 notes that I had organized into six different notebooks.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>My largest notebook (Current Events) is basically a news clipping file, with roughly 9,000 notes. Most of these were clipped via either the Evernote Web Clipper or Evernote Clearly (when it was still available). Most of my notes are text versions of web
 pages, though maybe 10% or so were saved in web page format. Probably half of them have a picture or graphic, but most of these are modest size, both in terms of dimensions and capacity. The other five notebooks have between 1500 to 2500 notes each.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I make extensive use of Tags in Evernote, with all articles having at least one tag, and many having multiples, with five or six tags per note fairly typical. If you're not familiar with EN and tags, the tags are completely independent of the Notebooks,
 so you can use the same tag in any notebook. This makes searching across notebooks for specific topics or references very easy.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Apart from syncing issues (more later), the lack of tags in ON is the biggest shortcoming I see as an EN user. The ON Sections make sense from a metaphor standpoint (notebook -&gt; section) but they're too rigid to be of much use to
 me. &nbsp;Take for example my Recipes notebook in EN which I've "organized" largely through tags. So, a recipe for Chicken Tikka Masala would include tags for "Poultry Dishes," "Indian Cuisine," and "BIR Curry" (collection). It doesn't make sense to me to replicate
 this same recipe in three different Sections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I used the OneNote Importer tool to convert my EN notebooks to ON notebooks. I did this on a per-notebook basis, figuring that it would go quicker and be more manageable. At the end of the process, I ended up with six converted ON Notebooks, which I have
 since consolidated into two ON notebooks. </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I have the largest notebook (Current Events) set up as separate notebook that will in practice be a static archive -- once I complete the migration process (I'm planning on 6 weeks) no more items will be added to it. However, it
 will always be open in order to be able to search archived news stories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The other notebook (Primary) will be my active notebook, and I have set it up with six sections, to mirror the notebooks I had in EN. So, for example, Current Events is a section and Food &amp; Cooking is another section (along with Personal, Entertainment,
 Business, Digital Tech). All new notes will be saved to Primary and assigned the relevant section when I clip it from the web. I'd read that the ON clipper was not as good as the EN clipper, but I'm impressed so far.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">When I moved the other migrated notebooks to sections in my Primary notebook, I did this by "moving" notes from the sections that ON created during migration to the relevant "notebook section" I set up in my Primary notebook. Based
 on how I've organized my notes, I really don't have any use for Sections, beyond having them mirror my previous EN notebook structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>One nice thing about the OneNote Converter tool is that it recognized my EN tags and included them in my individual ON notes as "hashtags." For example, notes that included an Indian Cuisine tag in EN now include a "#Indian Cuisine" notation near the ON
 note header. That's nice, as it allows me search by tags, and I've also loaded an ON add-in that will allow me append similar tags to new notes going forward.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">This still won't be as convenient as EN tags, as the EN Clipper made auto-suggestions and also allowed manual assignment, including text-entry with auto-suggestion as I typed. But it's better than losing my tags entirely, or not
 having any way to use them going forward.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The main reason I went with an archive notebook for the big Current Events EN notebook was to keep the ON file size down to a reasonable level in future. That "archive" notebook file is currently 1.4 GB, and my Primary notebook file is around 2.2 GB. At
 the moment, Primary contains zero Current Events notes, so once I start adding those after the migration, the file will grow fairly quickly.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I'm only a week into my migration and I'm tearing my hair out with syncing issues. I've only added a couple dozen items to my Primary notebook, and I already have syncing issues and my Food &amp; Cooking section has been relegated to Misplaced Sections. ON never
 did manage to clean up the issue on its own, and I ended up spending the better part of 2 hours just today recreating that Section from the backup. And even after doing so, ON is still not completing sync of my Primary file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've researched this via Google and see that syncing issues appear to be pretty common. &nbsp;Several of the Microsoft KB articles I've read explain how to recover from Misplaced Sections and syncing issues, but I've been around long enough to know that when
 a developer suggests a "workaround," it's a strong indicator that the developer has no idea what is causing the problem or how to go about fixing it. I find this pretty alarming, as everything about ON is proprietary to Microsoft -- it's MS software and it's
 MS's cloud platform in OneDrive, and yet it can't resolve what appears to be ongoing sync issues? This is not a brand new product, so I'm already concerned that this migration isn't going to work out for me. But I'm game to give a fair trial, and that's why
 I'm going to run EN and ON in parallel until October 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it's not fair or productive to compare ON to EN, but sometimes it's impossible to avoid. Short and to the point, I used Evernote for more than 7 years and I NEVER had a sync issue on my desktop or with any of my mobile devices. At this stage, I'm pretty
 much limiting my focus to just ON on the desktop, and I've already had sync issues that are taking up way too much time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said at the top, there are a lot of things I think I'd really like about OneNote. The clipper seems to do a much better job in how it takes web content and converts it to a note. Also, ON's formatting capabilities are miles better than EN. Text editing
 and formatting in EN has been an unmitigated mess and while the company has made a lot of noise about fixing it, it never has. My other big annoyance is that EN is regularly messing around with the Windows app UI, and rarely for the better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I'm really interested in trying to make ON work for me as my note-taking and archiving platform going forward. But the sync issue is immediately looking like a big brick wall, so I'm hoping that I can find some ideas, suggestions and solutions to
 the problems I've experienced so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have Evernote to fall back on, but I'm not terribly confident in the management or long-term future of the company. So, I'm thinking if I need to move, it's better to move on terms and a time of my choosing rather than something that's forced on
 me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the long note, but I know from experience that the more info available, the better chances are in identifying solutions. Let me know if there's any other info that might help in that regard, or if there's any questions about the details included
 here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks...</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>1) Use manual tags. Just put "IndianCuisine" and "BIR Curry" anywhere on the page (remember, you can put text anywhere). I usually prefix my tags with "qq" so that I only find tags (qqBIRCurry).&nbsp; Then use CTRL+E global search

<p>
</p><p><strong>I had a sync issue a couple of times in the past couple of years. Usually it happens when the program thinks that both the desktop and Onedrive version have been changed. I also use it on 2 mobile devices and I find that the Android version was responsible
 for probably 90% of my problems. It is unfortunately the worst. Onenote for iPad is decent, still has a couple features missing but very solid.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I think I fixed the sync issues by creating a new notebook and copying old pages into it. I haven't had sync issues in well over a year now, so it can be very stable. I do agree that MS sync is slower and at times problematic. Usually when you shut
 off the mobile device without letting it finish it's sync. At least it's not going to lose your data, just duplicate it ;)

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Some tips based on personal experience so far:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><br />
<strong>As I said, try creating a notebook from scratch and moving pages to it.</strong></li><li><strong>Are you using the Metro version, standalone free Office version, or a paid Office version ? I suggest using at least the standalone free version (non-Metro app).&nbsp; The Metro app really sucks.
</strong></li><li><strong>If you have a full blown Office, and use Outlook, Onenote integration with Outlook is amazing. I can brainstorm a project in Onenote using a half-assed mindmapping approach, and create Outlook tasks on the fly. Also, with paid Office version, you
 get local files that you have a bit more control over.</strong></li><li><strong>Even with free version, you can back up your files to a local drive and open them later, they just won't be the master copy. Make sure you set up the automatic backup.</strong></li><li><strong>Check out the free Onetastic macros, they are extremely helpful and powerful.</strong></li><li><strong>You can create encrypted and password protected sections, great for storing bank statements and similar items.</strong></li><li><strong>Tables are great if you need to organize many similar items on one page, like those bank statements. I create a header for each year (2016, 2015 etc), then insert an indented 12-cell table and put a pdf file statement in each cell. Then collapse
 the outline, so when I open the page all I see is year #s.</strong></li><li><strong>Check out Office Lens, it can do a lot of neat tricks when used with Onenote. Like scanning a business card and creating an Outlook contact + adding contact info into ON.
</strong></li><li><strong>ON doesn't have search in PDF attachments, unlike EN Premium. You have to "printout" them to page if you want to search them from within ON. This is also where Office Lens helps.&nbsp; This is a limitation, OTOH you still get search inside PDFs for free,
 just have to convert them to printouts (it retains the original PDF).</strong></li><li><strong>You can embed Excel spreadsheets &amp; edit them, works great on the desktop, half-works on iPad (you can edit them, and the change will be saved, but the table won't automatically update&nbsp; until you open it on the desktop_.</strong></li><li><strong>If you want to mark up screenshots or PDF file printouts, set them as background, this way they won't move with items on the page.</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>OK, I think that's all I can think of now :) Good luck !</strong></p>
<p>
I still have Evernote to fall back on, but I'm not terribly confident in the management or long-term future of the company. So, I'm thinking if I need to move, it's better to move on terms and a time of my choosing rather than something that's forced on me.&nbsp;<br />

<li>I have the personal edition of Office 365, but don't use Outlook. I used to, but it kept getting slower and slower on me and I bolted to gMail roughly 10 years ago. It would be hard to go back now.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>My syncing issue cleared itself up about an hour ago. It seems OK now, but it seems fragile and I'm concerned that I haven't seen the last of the Misplaced Sections hassle. I hope I'm wrong. I'm also using the Android version, but primarily just to view
 notes, rather than creation or editing. I'll try to make a point of not leaving it running when I'm not actively using it. One thing I'm learning about the Android app is that the search function is borderline useless, which makes the app pretty close to useless.
 Might be a bad first impression (or it might be operator error). Need to spend more time on it now that my sync issues are in remission.</li></ul>

</p><blockquote>
<p>Many thanks for all the ideas and suggestions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have the personal edition of Office 365, but don't use Outlook. I used to, but it kept getting slower and slower on me and I bolted to gMail roughly 10 years ago. It would be hard to go back now.</li></ul>
<p><strong>I use Gmail too, synced to Outlook. I mainly use OL for keeping track of meetings and tasks and syncing them to my phone and tablet. So the ability to create a task from within OneNote is great for me.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>My syncing issue cleared itself up about an hour ago. It seems OK now, but it seems fragile and I'm concerned that I haven't seen the last of the Misplaced Sections hassle. I hope I'm wrong. I'm also using the Android version, but primarily just to view
 notes, rather than creation or editing. I'll try to make a point of not leaving it running when I'm not actively using it. One thing I'm learning about the Android app is that the search function is borderline useless, which makes the app pretty close to useless.
 Might be a bad first impression (or it might be operator error). Need to spend more time on it now that my sync issues are in remission.</li></ul>
<p><strong>As I </strong><strong>said, the Android version is unfortunately very limited and in my experience, creates most of my sync issues. I use it mainly to look things up or to add a quick note. The iPad version is very good, about the only thing I really
 miss is collapsible outlines, which would be far more useful on the small tablet screen than on the desktop. Hopefully MS is listening .</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>As I said, the sync is slowish compared to EN, but it's also unlikely to lose your data - most of my sync issues were due to the program being overly cautious with my data and throwing up the "misplaced" flags. But I've been syncing problem free
 for over a year now, so it's certainly not as fragile as you think.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I discovered OneTastic over the weekend and it looks like there's some good stuff there. I've only downloaded a couple so far -- Pin to Favorites and Sort -- and both look like they'll provide some of the things I liked about EN. No doubt there will be
 others.</li></ul>
<p><strong>If you look at the Tags and TOC macros, you can replicate or even expand on much of Evernote's tagging functionality. Although it will be slower and can only be run on Windows.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I also found OfficeLens, and can see that coming in handy. It is too bad that OneNote can't read text from PDFs, but it's not a dealbreaker to not have that.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p><strong>It can read from them if you insert them as printouts.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have played around with Excel and OneNote but wasn't able to figure out how to embed spreadsheets, though I was able to copy them. I might be looking at this incorrectly, as when I think "embed" I think OLE, but based<strong> on
</strong>what I've read ON doesn't support OLE and probably won't.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p><strong>No, it's not OLE, it inserts an actual Excel table in OneNote that you can edit from OneNote. But you may need to use ON from your Office install, not the Metro version, and you may have to run Office installation repair to fix broken program links
 if it doesn't work</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I wasn't aware of the outlining structure or tables, so I'll check that out and think about ways that I could use that.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Outlining is a great way to keep large amounts of information on the same page while only showing what you want to see, without getting overwhelmed. It's also a good way to visually organize structured information like project data. Too bad it's
 a desktop only feature at this point, this is one area where Evernote has nothing similar.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Tables are great for arranging PDF files and other attachments in a compact and organized way. And of course for creating text tables when you need them.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you're familiar with mindmapping approach to brainstorming, this is another thing that OneNote can be used for. You can place any text or any other item anywhere on the screen, and along with collapsible text structure it makes a half decent mindmap
 (the one thing missing is the graphic connectors).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here's an example (I posted it in EN forum, but was told to stop writing about ON there). It also illustrates the use of outlining (if you look at the File System header on the lower right, it's expanded, while all other headers that have roughly
 the same kind of notes inside are collapsed).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d6799eef-8d0a-4cbb-934b-47c0b324576a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d6799eef-8d0a-4cbb-934b-47c0b324576a" /></a><strong><br />
<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Basically, one&nbsp;of the reasons I jumped ship almost two years ago was that I saw EN as just an information database, while ON is also a great project planner.</strong></p>
<p><br />
<br />
<strong>Glad to be of help</strong>.</p>

            <p>Sorry if I'm abusing your prior kind assistance, but I wanted to doublecheck something with you, if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am finding that it's not possible to share a single page in a section of a notebook with someone without sharing the entire notebook and all its sections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All or nothing? That can't be right.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I must be missing something here, because I can't imagine that someone would have structured this so that sharing is only something that can be done at the notebook level. That really makes no sense and seems like a design that purposely ignores the many
 different ways that people might want to share notes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's OneNote. Not OneNotebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, I assume I could create a new notebook and put that single page I want to share in a section and then share that notebook. But then I'm setting myself up for notebook sprawl and a constant campaign of clean-up. A tool for organization should not
 be creating unnecessary clutter and maintenance work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is the limitation that it appears to be, is there an add-in that can work around it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for all your previous assistance and suggestions.</p>

                    Hi<br />

<span>I am currently using IMAP in outlook for my Go Daddy Mail. Everything is working fine except for when it comes to send email with large attachment (of around</span><span>2</span><span>MB or more).</span>
<br />
<br />
First of all when i send the email - the email is not saved in the Imap sent items folder as other emails - yet it is saved in the sent items folder of my personal folder of outlook.<br />
<br />
Then when i try to move the mail from the sent folder of my personal folder of outlook into the sent itesm folder of my imap folder list i get the following error message<br />
<br />
<span>Cannot move the items. The server responded: 'sockio_write_msg_timed() failed, rc=</span><span>4294967295</span><span>.'</span>

<br />
<br />
None of this happens with my Gmail imap account. So i suspected it is a problem related to Go Daddy so i contacted Go Daddy support but they keep insisting that it is not their issue but it is microsft outlooks issues. Tried searching problem on google yet
 found zero results.<br />
<br />
<span>I suspect that is a timeout error so i increased the server timeouts to </span>

<span>10</span> <span>seconds (max), yet still not luck.</span><br />

Can anyone help please - or at least guide me to were i can find help for this problem.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using office 2007 - on both pc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sending mail through webmail does not cause the same problem since the go daddy file limit is 30mb. Mail send through webmail is saved in my sent folder.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet if i were to forward the email to my godaddy address then move the email from one folder to another folder within the godaddy imap folder list - i get no errors and it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the problem is moving items from my personal folder of outlook to my godaddy imap folder?</p>

            <p>Haven't played with MS Project since Office '2010's&nbsp;release so not sure if it checks the following so asking the question, in case,</p>
<p>Has the same bit-level (32 vs 64) been installed for both Office &amp; Project? If you have 64bit Office on your systems and 32bit Project (or vice-versa) - that would result in the "Project cannot access Outlook" message since the two would need to be the same.</p>

            <p>Didn't suggest that that 64bit Wn7 was a factor (and shouldn't be) if both Outlook and Project were both the same bit level.
</p>
<p>Have not gone through the process of importing anything directly from Outlook into Project and don't have Project currently installed on any systems to test anything - so going to ask the following on that basis...</p>
<p>Given that the the cause of the error can be one of two different things</p>
<p>a) - Project cannot access Outlook OR</p>
<p>b) &nbsp;- There are no available tasks </p>
<p>And for the sake of this, let's assume that the issue is &lt;not&gt; that Project cannot access Outlook but rather can't find the tasks.....</p>
<p>1) - If you export the tasks from Outlook into a CSV file - do the required tasks export?<br />
2) - If answer is yes to #1 - does this CSV file import correctly into Project (again, am assuming that there is a CSV import option in Project)<br />
3) - Does Project ask you which tasks folder to import from or does it try and import from the default tasks folder and is that the same folder that was exported in #1</p>
<p>The reality is that the underlying problem is fundamentally a MS Project related issue since it is the program that can't the required data for whatever reason which may or may not have anything to do with Outlook depending on what that reason is. In this
 situation, Outlook itself is not involved in the MS Project import process.</p>
<p>Also, one question that hasn't been asked...</p>
<p>What version of MS Project is in use -2010 or something earlier? If it's an earlier version of Project - then that may be the reason it cannot find Outlook and is a question that would need to be posed in the MS Project forum to confirm if that's the source
 of the problem</p>

            <p>Yes, there are tasks and I was able to export it to a CSV.&nbsp; When I did that and tried to import to Project it said that was a legacy format and had to enter it into the trust center.&nbsp; I did that and then during the import it said that there were a lot of
 errors in the file because things weren't the right type.&nbsp; Maybe Outlook did a bad job of exporting to the CSV file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project doesn't ask which tasks folder to import from but there are 2 as she has 2 email account setup and there are tasks in both.&nbsp; (There weren't originally which made me wonder about that but we added tasks to the second one and still got the same error.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything is 2010.&nbsp; Office Pro 2010 and Project 2010.</p>

Rusty, you note the user has two folders - are they POP or IMAP or Exchange folders?&nbsp; I use both POP, IMAP, and Exchange online.&nbsp; When I attempted to import from the POP folders, I received the same message.&nbsp; When I created tasks in the Exchange Online account
 -- all worked as expected.<br />

<h2>            I have been infected after visiting malicious website</h2>
                    <p>I looked for an address in Ethiopia through Google. </p>
<p>I got a red screen to say I have been infected with a virus and to call a windows number 1-844 (the rest I lost) ....&nbsp; meantime hundreds of files were downloading. I did not click anything on any download or Google or the virus warning page.</p>
<p>My laptop (Lenovo) totally&nbsp;locked and crashed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I eventually got it going after huge delays and ran some kind of check that came up. All was clear.</p>
<p>I then ran Defender/AVG/Norton/Malwarebytes/AdCleaner and all said I was clean. I deleted 2,400 files in downloads without opening any.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The laptop was still compromised.</p>
<p>I then decided to recover my HDD back to factory status. This was successful.</p>
<p>Still...it now takes 5 minutes to get to the login screen and I have to turn off anf&nbsp;turn on just to get to this screen.</p>
<p>Is my HDD crashed/thrashed...should I replace it? Can I transfer my Windows 7 (original MS product) to the new HDD?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Hi Sean.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />That's a Fake Virus scam which can emanate from a mistyped URL it occupies.  If you have a shortcut for Favorite/Bookmark of the site be sure to delete it.  It may have also set itself as your Home page or be lodged in your Browser Add-Ons or Extensions so you'll want to check there and run the scanners I give below.
<br />
<br />Close the Browser window using whichever method is necessary, as it cannot escape the browser unless you download something from the page.  
<br />
<br />If you cannot close the browser window, right click the Task Bar or press Ctrl + Alt + Delete keys to open the Task Manager, choose Show Less Details, highlight the browser and choose End Task. 
<br />
<br />If this fails hold the power button to Shut Down.  If you do this Edge may reload the page when it starts back up, but it will also give you an option to Start Fresh to avoid opening the previous tabs.  
<br />
<br />Also in Edge, if you try to X out of the browser WIndow, it may present a dialogue box to end the session.  The webpage is allowed to put text in the box but cannot stop it from closing the Windows when you choose OK, so that is safe to do.  
<br />
<br />If you called the scammers and they installed anything on your PC, open Settings&gt;Apps &amp; Features, choose Sort by Date, uninstall anything on that date you didn't install yourself. Then run a full scan with Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner.   In MB settings tell it to search for rootkits. You can turn off the trial version later in it's Account Settings.
<br /><a href="http://filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti_malware/tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://filehippo.com/download_malwarebytes_anti...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a>
<br />
<br />Clean up anything found.  If you are seriously infected with Trojans or Rootkits that show up again when you re-run the scan after cleaning, post back for further instructions.   
<br />
<br />If you paid them anything, notify your bank that you were scammed.  
<br />
<br />Now as to whatever you did that installed all those files you said you got, it would not be an inert web page that cannot do anything unless you choose it.
<br />
<br />What I would do is wipe the drive clean to Clean Install following these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Add to the steps in the tutorial first wiping the drive with Diskpart Clean Command: <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/52129-disk-clean-clean-all-diskpart-command.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/52129-disk...</a>   You can access the Command Prompt during install by pressing Shift + F10 at the first screen after booting.  
<br />
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<p>HI Greg....many thanks for your very prompt&nbsp;reply and offer of help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not call the number as I was suspicious and did not send any money.</p>
<p>I deleted all of the files, unopened, and from the recycle bin.</p>
<p>There is no added extension nor are ( I think)&nbsp; my browser settings changed. I dod not have any odd site in favorites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The search was simply for an address and then this all happened. I did not click any download, or anything at all when the page opened. It just started automatically and all hell happened!</p>
<p>As the laptop was frozen and locked - I reset my laptop back to factory settings with the recovery tool by pressing F11.</p>
<p>I then was able to reload windows OS with the recovery section on my HDD.</p>
<p>If I run the disc cleaner will this&nbsp;also delete my recovery which is listed as "Q"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any suggestions on why it takes 5-8 minutes to get to the login screen? The laptop, when logged in, seems to be working fine.</p>
<p>I do not mind doing another full recovery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again....Sean in Dublin</p>

            Sean, yes, to wipe the drive to get the best install cleanest will remove the Recovery but that contains the factory bloatware which could very well be the problem since it throttles and causes issue.  Most enthusiasts won't even run a Factory install for this reason.
<br />
<br />You can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of these help then you can do the Clean install or 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

<p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You seriously need to look at a post carefully before responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't you see that the OP selected Windows 7 as his operating system and indicated in his very first post that he'd already done a factory install of the operating system from the recovery partition on the HDD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You keep using responses keyed to his initial problems and Windows 10, neither of which were either still the problem or operating system in use since his very first post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moral of the story; read before you post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sean, Ignore everything posted to this point.&nbsp; I'd first want to check the system out for hardware issues, but typically this can be skipped, moving directly to the same basic steps Greg has mentioned, but chosen instead to support the Windows 7 operating
 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure that Greg can help you.&nbsp; He just needs to stop rushing long enough to actually read what you've written so he can provide the response that's appropriate to your true issue and system specifics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rob</p>

<p>Hi Grag...as Rob kindly pointed out my OS is Windows 7 and the previous advice was for Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am really reluctant to wipe the HDD with my OS on it.</p>
<p>How do I reinstall Win 7 if I wipe it off the HDD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>
<p>I am off tomorrow, actually to the States, so if you do not mind I will leave this till I return. Can I come back then?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meantime I will do a factory reset&nbsp;</p>

            Not sure why it was funneled to me if it's Windows 7, but I will be glad to help you all the same.<br /><br />If you want to transfer to a new hard drive, you can do this with an imaging app like macrium but it will most likely transfer the problems with it.<br /><br />You'd be better off doing the clean install in this tutorial for the best possible clean reinstall of Windows 7 which includes the media and everything else needed.  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install-wininstalls/clean-reinstall-windows-7/0ae269fd-167e-423b-94ef-26133f89e10c">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

                    <p>Hi all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot install Office Mix. It downloads and after getting it to run, it loads to about 60% and then shows an error 0x80070642. User cancelled installation. Which is not true. I did not cancel.</p>
<p>I have a Dell Inspiron 3520 i5 running WIN 10.</p>
<p>There is adequate HDD space and I have 4Gbs of RAM. Powerpoint is closed when I do the install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact - I close everything besides the install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What can I do?</p>

<p>I get exactly the&nbsp;same error message ("<span>r</span><em>un-time error 2147417848 Automation Error The object invoked has disconnected from its clients")&nbsp;</em>when saving worksheets to PDF-file from VBA-code. I was
 made aware of this problem by a user a week ago (24.1.2018), and it has been affirmed on at least two other Office 365 installations so far. Thought the latest update of Office 365/Excel 2016 could be the cause, but reverting to an earlier version (1707 Build
 8326.2062, July 31 2017) didn't help. Is it possible that a recent Office 365 update might have corrupted some registry setting for Excel 2016, and that this corruption could be persistent despite reverting to an older version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the line that throws the error message:&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;OpenAfterPublish:=False</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Pressing OK (in the error message) upends Excel totally, after which <em>Task Manager</em> and
<em>End Process</em> is the only way to close the Excel instance.<br />
</p>
<p>This has all worked fine for five years up till now. Still no problem when using Excel 2007, haven't tested with 2010 or 2013.</p>

    <title>How is the best way to reference a closed workbook using vlookups and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dak  say:</h3>
<h2>            How is the best way to reference a closed workbook using vlookups and a variable&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Here is the formula that I have been using referencing a sheet in my <br />
workbook. These cover an array of R3:DJ504 just to give you an idea how many <br />
lookups I am currently using. These are mostly for # values.<br />
=IF(ISERROR(VLOOKUP(O3,Import!P:CB,18,FALSE)),"",VLOOKUP(O3,Import!P:CB,18,FALSE))<br />
Now that I am wanting to reference a fetch file instead of a sheet in my <br />
workbook I would like to change this.&nbsp; In cell M1 of my workbook I have a <br />
drop down menu of dates such as "10-May-10" in text format. I am wanting to <br />
figure out the most efficient way to use this as a reference variable to <br />
sheet names in my fetch file. I am hopeful to do this with the fetch file <br />
closed so that I will never need to open it unless I find something doesn't <br />
make sense with the data I am seeing.</p>
<p>Again what is in your opinion the most efficient way to get the data from this closed workbook based on the variable for sheet names in that workbook?</p>
<p>-- <br />
Thank you!<br />
</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>The code for this add-in is not open source. This add-in has obviously not been maintained for 2.5 years.</p>
<p>Please see my</p>
<p>http://sulprobil.com/html/excel_don_ts.html</p>
<p>topic #1.</p>
<p>I suggest not to link a spreadsheet to another closed one. Use a database approach and let your sheets write/read to/from it.</p>

<p>It's not clear if this will reduce your overhead or not, so I can't make a decision on which formula would be better.</p>
<p>Regarding the Database option.&nbsp; There are justifications for using both databases and spreadsheet or using them together.&nbsp; Making that decision is not possible without a complete understanding of the process and size of your project.&nbsp; I'm not sure if anyone
 here will analyze your project to the necessary detail for free, its a consultant type issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if you want that you should create a new thread addressing with that topic.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I'm having the same error. But it happens with many things. Including but not limited to running portable applications from an external drive. Also trying to open files such as images, videos and music. And when trying to adjust the advanced setting or any
 of the system settings.<br />
<br />
Another error I run into is trying to open applications downloaded from the "store" or any of the stock apps like paint or powershell. They either will not open or open and then close within a second. All of this took place after my computer upgraded itself.
 I already had installed 10. But it did another installation of 10 over that during the night. when I woke up I had to set everything up again. Luckily it didn't wipe anything. But I think this is where things went wrong.<br />
<br />
I know this post is old. But I've been looking everywhere and this is the only post I have seen relating to the issue.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:I am also unable to verify the computer. As in I click verify and nothing happens. Also I can not set or preview a screensaver. And the time setting to turn the monitor off is totally disregarded. It seems to do it whenever it feels like it wants to.&nbsp;</p>

            Actually, $107 sounds low for any Office bundle. Even the Product Key Card version of Home and Student lists for US$120.&nbsp; Where, what company or web site, did you buy office from?&nbsp; What office bundle did you buy? I agree with Gordon, for that price the
 only one it could possibly be is Home and Student which does not include Outlook.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If you do have a legal copy of Home and Student (at a REALLY good sale price &lt;grin&gt; ) your best bet functionally and economically is to take advantage of the "Anytime Upgrade" to get Office Home and Business.
<br />
<br />
Personally, I always advise people to AVOID the Product Key Card and go with the "Retail" license. It is slightly more expensive, but the license terms are MUCH better. PKC can only be installed on one computer, PERIOD. 2 people in the last week have had their
 new computers die the same day they installed a PKC Office on it.<br />
<br />
I would be curious to learn if MS would allow an ANYTIME UPGRADE from PKC to Retail.<br />
<br />
<b>I have Office Home and Student. I Need Outlook. Now What? – Anytime Upgrade</b>
<p><i>You will have to buy Office 2010 Home and Business to get Outlook.</i></p>
<p><span>If you start with Office Home and Student and realize that you need Outlook, you have 3 options:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Buy standalone Outlook to add to Home and student</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Buy Home and Business full bundle</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Use Office Anytime Upgrade offer</span></p>
<p><span>Pros and Cons:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The standalone Outlook does not integrate with Word in Home and Student, and it is the most expensive combination.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Buying Home and Business is better price wise, especially since you can resell the Home and Student to someone else.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Apparently MS provides a discounted price to using Anytime Upgrade to a full Home and Student bundle</span></p>
<p><span>Here is the new and improved solution (much better than our previous advice) to your problem, direct from MS Customer Service.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Anytime Upgrade offers you a discounted upgrade between Office 2010 bundles.

</span></span></span>Click on office anytime upgrade</p>
<p>

<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>Here is another similar story:</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>I went to Office Anytime Upgrade under Start Menu</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Made payment for Office Home &amp; Student &gt;&gt; Home &amp; Business upgrade ($120)</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>After payment, a box with an "Install" button came up. I wasn't given the opportunity to save the download. I was given a new Product key.</p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>I clicked Install &amp; it installed (or upgraded?) to Office 2010 Home &amp; Business</p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>I ran Excel &amp; Word, and the "non-commercial use" was no longer there</p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>However, under my Control Panel / Uninstall Programs, there is only 1 office installation - Microsoft Office Home &amp; Student 2010; there isn't any Home &amp; Business.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span>My main intention in upgrading was to get rid of the "non-commercial use", so it turned out ok. But is there anything wrong that I did? Why does Control Panel show Home &amp; Student? &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>Here is the “old” advice as an alternative.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Consider it based on the upgrade price they present you.</span></p>
<p><span>You have to buy a product key that is valid for Outlook.
</span></p>
<p><span>The simplest apparent solution is to buy Outlook standalone for rougly USD$140. However, I have been told that this may not be the best overall approach for a couple of reasons. The obvious reason is that you'll
 have to manage 2 separate Office installations: separate install files/CD's and separate product keys. The other reason I've been told about is that when you install a standalone Outlook it does NOT fully integrate with the existing H&amp;S. Apparently spell checking
 dictionaries are maintained separately and a few other things.</span></p>
<p><span>If you do the math, retail H&amp;S has list price USD$150. Standalone Outlook has list price USD$140. Home and Business is USD$280. So, if you have the option, buying H&amp;B makes best sense all around.</span></p>
<p><span>If you bought the Retail/"FPP" license for H&amp;S, you have the option of uninstalling it and reselling it to someone else. If you have an OEM or Product Key Card license transferring the license to someone else
 is NOT an option.</span></p>
<p><span>PS: prices assume Retail/"FPP" license (my only recommendation). The product key card name "equivalents" are slightly cheaper on the surface. But if you understand the implication of license terms, you instantly
 realize that for most people the PKC is effectively a s*c*a*m IMO (because most people are not aware of the downsides of the the PKC when they buy it)</span></p>

            Hi IRS’ 18,<br />
<br />
You could try AutoRecovery Folder see if the file has a back-up there:<br />
/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.Word/Data/Library/Preferences/AutoRecovery<br />
<br />
If you use OneDrive to save your file, you could check Version History in OneDrive.
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/restore-a-previous-version-of-a-file-in-onedrive-159cad6d-d76e-4981-88ef-de6e96c93893" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Restore a previous version of a file in OneDrive</a><br />
<br />
If you set up Time Machine in your Mac, you could restore the file from it: <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/ht201250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Restore a previous version of a file in OneDrive</a><br />
<br />
To avoid this from happening again, I sincerely suggest you use online service which has version history, like OneDrive, and turn on Autosave when you edit the file.<br />
For important file, use Save As to save copies of some important versions.<br />
<br />
Other members who has similar experience, welcome to share your solution here.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi everyone!&nbsp; I just got a Samsung ACE yesterday.&nbsp; Pretty cool little rig!&nbsp; Its my first PDA type thing and i really like it so far.&nbsp; Anyway, it doesnt seem to have come with MSN messenger.&nbsp; I installed the new windows live and set all that up which is cool
 but there is no messenger in that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So basically, where can I get some kind of MSN messenger for my WM6 Samsung Ace?&nbsp; I do not like the crappy web based one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any tips!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Project 2010-Non-working Days</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
In Project 2010. Is there any way to display a calendar that would show non-working days for ALL the resources. That is for example all sick days, vacation days.
<br />
Thank you
                </div>

            SAVF,
<div>I'm not quite sure what you mean exactly by "display a calendar". You can of course see each resource's work calendar by selecting Resource Information for each resource and then hit the Change Working TIme button. You could also collapse the Resource
 Usage view to show only resources (i.e. no assignment lines) and select the Unit Availability field for the timescaled information.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, this request sounds very similar to a Gantt type display I created for leave times for a work crew several years ago. A VBA macro was used to create a "task" line for each resource and the Gantt Bars were the leave times for that resource. In
 my case the leave data was imported from a database but it could also be pulled from the resource working time calendars of any Project file.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good suggestion from John. Should you want to go the VBA road do check out my website:</p>
<p><a href="http://users.online.be/prom-ade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://users.online.be/prom-ade</a></p>
<p>and click through to Microsoft Project: An abstract</p>
<p>That article contains VBA code doing what John describes (and much more); by all means it has all the methods you need.</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>

            Thank you for your reply John,<br />
<br />
For example if I have 20 people working on a project. In a given month, several may be off due to vacation or other reason. I would like to display a calendar or view for a specific month,&nbsp; that would show the name of the resources on the left and non-working
 days highlighted in the calendar.<br />

Thank you.<br />

            SAVF,
<div>Oh I understand what you want and why but the type of "calendar display" is the question.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Nonetheless, I didn't realize that Jan already has VBA code to essentially do what I described. With that approach you should be able to either display the "calendar" in Gantt Bar form or use the Calendar view, although the latter has space limitations.</div>

<h2>            E71 two problems</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I start to write my issues, firstly i should say this device is so nice,handy,practical,functional. I am very happy with it :) But i have two issues:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 ) I bought a bluetooth headphone ( samsung sbh 700 ), i connect headphone with mobile device, i can listen the music but the sound goes down for 5-10 seconds for every minute. This is annoying. Is there any trick to set bluetooth settings or how can i
 am get out of this issue ? ( By the way Auto - connection is enable ).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 ) When i writing sms, after 3-4 lines characters that i wrote, that&nbsp;will be&nbsp;seen 3-4 seconds later. This is annoying too. This issue emerged after i upgraded version of my phone to version 3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My phone version is :</p>
<p>300.21.012,rm-346,NOKIA E71-1(202.08)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for responses.</p>

<p>mmm, my E71 has never acted like that. Assuming that the phone is not faulty, something appears to be drawing on a considerable amount of power every minute. The only thing I can think of is to check its not searching for a WLAN so make sure that is switched
 off. Check to see what other applications are running or if you have any active data connections that you are not aware of.</p>

<p>ok, good. Perhaps its the samsung headset, does it work ok if you use a plugged in headset or if you play anything through the phone speaker?</p>
