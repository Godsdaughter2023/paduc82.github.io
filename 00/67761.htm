 random, i can't identify a trigger. If i change the view to details, contents etc and then back to icons the spacing corrects itself but it feels like i'm having to do this all the time. I can't overstate the frustration i feel everytime i open the folder,
 it's like being back on Vista and watching my carefully organised folder structure disappear.</span><br />

            Nope. The file names are always visible. Some of the movie titles are two lines long and some icons are bigger than others. I figured this inconsistency was the cause of the issue.<br />
<br />
In other sub-folders, TV-Shows for example, where all files are from the same source and all labeled the same way - S1xE01, S1xE02 etc - i don't have a problem.<br />
<br />
Can i attach screenshots?<br />

    <title>Windows 10 services revoked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> papasum1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 services revoked</h2>
                    <p>Why is my windows 10 license revoked? &nbsp;Somebody phone me last June 5 telling me to turn on my computer because they said my computer had communicated that there is something weird going on with my computer. &nbsp;They said they are authorized technicians from
 Microsoft servicing Canada and USA. &nbsp;So, I complied with the request and then they took over the operation of my computer and started to do a scan using Mechanic 3.0 to take over the Registry of my computer. &nbsp;While they do the scanning, they are asking me
 money to pay through credit card. &nbsp;Unfortunately, there was a power failure at that time and communication with my computer was cut off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Waited for the power to come back and when it does, I again turned on my computer. &nbsp;I found out that after signing in, there was a drop down screen saying "SERVICES REVOKED" saying, this may be used to steal my identity, my online banking, personal data,
 etc. &nbsp;At the bottom there was a blank rectangular entry space asking for a &nbsp;code! &nbsp;(I also discovered that my product ID was gone as well! &nbsp;Because no windows was running in my computer, I cannot use my computer.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what code are they asking. &nbsp;I lost the use of my computer thereafter and I cannot do anything at all. &nbsp;There was a telephone request to call 877-887-7945. &nbsp;I was warned by a friend not to call that number because it could be someone who will
 extort money from me. &nbsp;So I did not call that number. &nbsp;What should I do to recover the use of my Computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me. &nbsp;Thanks</p>
<p>Ferd</p>

<p>Thanks PA Bear for the help that you have given me.&nbsp; It took some time for me to reply because of the lose of the use of my computer.&nbsp; This month, I bought a new computer and within 2 days, the same "bug" had cropped up when I log on to my new computer.&nbsp;
 There was a drop down window that came up asking if I am trying to change the apps.&nbsp; I tried to click the "NO" box and a message appeared telling me to immediately insert a USB stick disk (It didn't tell me what USB to use, so&nbsp; I grabbed one close by and inserted
 it) and suddenly a red drop down window popped&nbsp;up with the message "TROJAN VIRUS so and so" directing me to call a Microsoft Expert technician&nbsp;with the phone number listed with the message to fix the problem!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh no, not again! &nbsp;In my panic, I grabbed the
 phone and dialed the number.&nbsp; There was a lady (sounds like east indian due to her accent) who answered and asked me what problems do I have and told her that there was a message from a drop down note that a TROJAN VIRUS had infected&nbsp;my new computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; She
 assured me that they will fix it.&nbsp; She asked me to press the Microsoft icon and the letter R and a window appeared where she asked me to type in something like "iexplorer...(sorry I can't remember the rest of the words) until wordpad window appeared where
 she can type messages.&nbsp; At this point in time, she was scanning my computer.&nbsp; She asked me about my address, phone number&nbsp;and e-mail which I no longer mind so much due to my panicky situations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked her name in return and her location (New York) and she typed in her name, her title, employee ID number and extension number:&nbsp; Sareena, Sr. Diagnostic expert (windows) ID# 2158, extension # 729.&nbsp;&nbsp; She showed me the report&nbsp;about my computer and anti-virus
 I have just installed a day before and reported A/V ws Not active!&nbsp; Hacking protection:&nbsp; None.&nbsp; The report, reported a Windows Critical Warning alert:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - network security damage</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - email hacked</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - porn traces ( Whoa!&nbsp; I just bought the computer and I never gone to any **** site!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - hackers found</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cyber issue = Level 3 (Microsoft certified tech)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hacking/cyber issues</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; time to fix:&nbsp; 40-45 mins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The total price was $457.00 for the One Time Fix and said she will transfer me to the Billing department.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>A person named Greg Martin, Billing Manager ask me on&nbsp;what manner of payment should I use.&nbsp; I told him I don't have a credit card but only a bank debit card.&nbsp; That should do, he said.&nbsp; So he&nbsp;asked me my name, address, phone number, e-mail address, etc. including&nbsp;my
 bank debit card number including the 3 digit security number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He processed the billing entries in their own department but told me that the bank numbers I supplied them won't work for international transactions.&nbsp; So he asked if I knew somebody who has a credit card.&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife's&nbsp; name came up but she wasn't at home.&nbsp;
 So he tried to teleconference the three of us to her but the cell phone did not connect.&nbsp; I personally contacted my wife on a land line and told her&nbsp;if I can borrow her Visa credit card and gave me the details of her Visa card.&nbsp; I got hold of&nbsp;the billing manager
 and gave him all the details of my wife's credit card.&nbsp; He entered all the details I supplied him but then afterwards, he told me that we will just continue the transactions later because their server was out of service.&nbsp; Later on, he came back and everything
 was okay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He reconnected me&nbsp;with Sareena and she informed me that she can transfer me to the&nbsp;&nbsp;Level 3 technician. to do the fixing.&nbsp; However, the Technician would like to charge me an additional amount of about $168.00 if I waned to upgrade to a 1 year subscription!</p>
<p>I was so furious upon hearing this and I tried to argue that Sareena and I already agreed on the cost and never mentioned about the one month or 1 year subscription and I&nbsp;insisted that that $457.00 was only good a lifetime fix!&nbsp; He argued that the deal I
 agreed with Sareena was only for 1 month one time fix!&nbsp; I became furious and&nbsp;asked the tech if this sort of Virus infection will come up again after one month?&nbsp; The answer:&nbsp; It depends and that will cost me more for the "upgrade" of the fix they will do!</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>I told them to just do whatever fix they can without me paying additional money and if things go wrong again after one month, we will have to haggle for upgrade and the price!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It actually took us about 5 hours&nbsp;after some haggling on the price of the services.&nbsp; When the fix was done, the tech asked me if I am happy with his services.&nbsp; I told him that things appear okay when I tested opening my e-mails and going to the news links.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I really don't have any idea if the job was done!&nbsp; After the "thank yous" I shut down the computer and turned it on if things are okay.&nbsp; One thing I observed, a pop up question greeted me if I wanted to run the "cleaner' apps!&nbsp; What was that?&nbsp; I clicked the
 NO option and I continued to sign in my "Hello/Welcome" log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was a horror story&nbsp;and only realized afterwards that they may be the same groups that would like to scam me&nbsp;for the fake virus that I suspected they put that in there in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for this long story and&nbsp; I felt so stupid&nbsp;&nbsp;for giving in to their persistence!&nbsp; I don't know what to do.</p>

 or if it has a reset to factory you need to do it, and for the future no legitimate company will call you and be careful on the internet.&nbsp;

</p><p>I have tried all of the various fixes I can find on-line. I have cleaned up the Software Distribution/Downloads folder, run Microsoft Trouble-shooter,&nbsp; run SFC / SCANNOW, run DISM with various different switches, turned off Anti-Virus... you name it. The
 only discernable difference I can see is that the error message I used to get no longer appears. Windows now tells me it installed the update, but my update history says different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I run the update it seems to install, then the PC re-boots, then I get the "Installing Updates XX%" message . It gets to 100% then says it was unable to install, backs everything out, reboots again, gives my another installing updates message and then
 launches windows. A message pop-up appears saying updates were installed, but my update history says not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is becoming massively frustrating. The PC re-boots two or three times a day, and the whole update/backout process takes 30 minutes or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really would appreciate any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dave</p>

            <p>Hi Marvin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the steps in the link you provided, and I see that the following .DLL's were not present in the Windows/System32 directory:</p>
<p>
</p><p>browseui.dll</p>

<p>wucltux.dll</p>
<p>wuweb.dll</p>
<p>wuwebv.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a search on my PC to see if they are installed elsewhere, but there are so many different files, with different dates and sizes, that I didn't want to try moving one over in case I screwed things up even more.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response. We suggest that you perform clean boot. It is performed to start PC by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you update or when you run a program in Windows.
 Check this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay in replying. I just had a heavy couple of weeks at work and had not had the time to look into this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried doing a clean boot, and then installing the update, and this still fails. It gets to 30%, re-boots, then continues to 100% and says that the installation failed. No codes, no error message, nothing in the Windows Update history other than 'Failed
 to Install'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a little fed-up with this, so I disabled the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here we are a couple of weeks later, and all of a sudden I am being prompted to install 'Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for X64-based Systems (KB4015219)'. So I tried exactly the same process, downloaded the install package, did a clean
 boot, ran the install. I get exactly the same results as above. It fails to install but does not give any specific error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is beginning to get very tiresome now. I don't want to disable the update as it is obviously a good idea to install it, but I also don't want to have my PC constantly re-booting itself as it tries, and fails, to install the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dave</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, that was a frantic, and quite frankly frustrating 24 hours!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the re-install as recommended above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created installation media on a USB stick. I tried the install from a clean boot, from a normal boot, from every combination of boots I could think of, and every single one of them results in a message box popping up after about 45 minutes (33% or so on
 the install progress) that simply says "Windows 10 Installation Failed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing else, no error message, no other indication that would help trouble shoot what the **** is going on here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So unless there is a way of looking for an error code in some hidden installation log, I guess my options are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Revert back to the previous version of windows.</p>
<p>By an iMac.</p>
<p>Throw my PC and its garbage operating system out of the window.</p>
<p>Put up with the massive inconvenience of having the damn thing re-boot at least two or three times a day as it tries to re-install this heap of elephant dung operating system update.</p>
<p>Hide the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am opening the window....</p>

<h2>            DELL_Intel Core i7-4500U CPU_RAM8GB_Windows 8.1 CRASH_UNKNOWN DRIVER_system32</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought my new DELL pc 3 months ago and the last week started to crash.</p>
<p>In the beginning the Event Name was <strong>APPCRASH-chrome.exe and camera.exe</strong>. I updated all the drivers - it was also weird the&nbsp;automated
<strong>Windows update</strong> option wasn't working. I also uninstall Google Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything seemed to function properly until the day before yesterday until this morning, I had another CRASH named:</p>
<p>Cause: The<strong> 'Unknown'</strong> <strong>driver</strong> <strong>(C:\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\igdkmd64.sys)</strong> appears to have caused a system to crash</p>
<p>Buck check code: 0x00000113</p>
<p>Driver: C:\WINDOWS\System32\drivers\igdkmd64.sys</p>
<p>Driver version:10.18.10.3977</p>
<p>Device: Unknown&nbsp;</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Application Error</p>
<p>Fault bucket 0x113_dxgkrnl!DXGADAPTER::SetPowerComponentActive</p>
<p>CB,type 0</p>
<p>Event Name: Blue Screen</p>
<p>Response:http://wer.microsoft.com/response/resredir.aspx?sid=23621&amp;Bucket=0x113_dxgkrnl!</p>
<p>DXGADAPTER::SetPowerComponentActiveCB&amp;State=1&amp;ID=cd8fe669-ed4f-48b8-b428-f0d44b91f3dc</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>I also notice that I had this crash when my laptop was in condition of 'Sleep' after 10 minutes being inactive - it was not awaking and restart was needed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am thinking that it may be a problem&nbsp;in the <strong>gGaphics card&nbsp;</strong>or in the
<strong>software Windows 8.1</strong>. As I mentioned above ,it is weird to me that I run 'check for updates and after a while nothing is found and never installed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>More detail concerning the pc:</p>
<p><strong>DELL Intel Core i7-4500U CPU_RAM8GB_Windows 8.1</strong>,<strong>64 bit</strong></p>
<p><strong>AMD Radeon HD 8850M, Intel HD Graphics Family.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Could anyone provide with more information - advise of what to do?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is it something that could be fixed?,or I have to downgrade to Windows 7?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I will probably download the <strong>Windows 8.1 update</strong> to see if that fixes the problem with Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>
<p>:)</p>

                    I have windows 10 English version, I installed a German keyboard und set a log in password with Germans letters.<br />
Today I had the problem that at the login screen I couldn't change the language to German so I &nbsp;wasn't able to enter the password&nbsp;<br />
Any solution please?

            <p>Hi Fayez,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try switching between input languages by pressing the left <strong>Alt</strong> key + the
<strong>Shift </strong>key on your keyboard. If it does not allow you to use the German input language, you may need to seek advanced help from the IT Pro audience in TechNet. You can post your concern on this
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?searchTerm=windows+10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
page</a> to get suggestions from them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are able to sign in to your user account, you can configure the language settings to use the same international setup when you get to the welcome screen. Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click on the <strong>Windows </strong>icon on your home screen.</li><li>Open <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Set the view to <strong>Small icons</strong>.</li><li>Open <strong>Region</strong>.</li><li>Go to the <strong>Administrative </strong>tab.</li><li>Click on <strong>Copy settings...</strong>.</li><li>Check the box for <strong>Welcome screen and system accounts</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We hope you find the information helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post if you have other concerns.</p>

<h2>            Cannot Install Blackberry Device Driver. Also, Windows Update Repeatedly Fails &#34;Some updates were not installed. Failed&#58; 4 updates. Error&#40;s&#41; found&#58; Code 643 Code 800705B3&#34;</h2>
                    <p><span>I have repeatedly had Windows Update failures of four updates, and am unable to get my new Blackberry to connect (driver won't install). Win7ProSP1.</span></p>

<p><span>I get the WU announcement of failure, and the message:
</span></p>

<p><span>Some updates were not installed. Failed: 4 updates. Error(s) found: Code 643 Code 800705B3</span></p>

<p><span>It was trying to install at the time: KB2533523 KB2468871 KB2539636 and Microsoft USB Hardware Mouse</span></p>

<p><span>A few updates have installed during all of this - not obvious what the difference is with them.</span></p>

<p><span>I have documented what I've been experiencing, happy to share. It's really hurting me to be dead in the water with this, and Verizon Wireless is threatening big charges
 if I don't get the prior (still-barely-functioning) Blackberry back to them The prior BB's driver is installed &amp; works, can't get the new BB's driver to install, so I can't restore my BB backup into the new BB and I can't synch to Outlook - totally unacceptable!</span></p>

<p><span>More on this - I posted this last night on the MSE forum, on a thread about the 643 error (can't find my posting today)</span></p>

<p><span>I have suffered with this error/set of errors for the past 3 days. Have tried many approaches and MS tools. My main pain is that I can't install a RIM Blackberry driver
 (this is a REALLY big thing for me, I'm forced into a different BB, and cannot get it to connect / synch / restore... and I must make the move), this is just a symptom of not being able to do updates, it appears. I spent 3 hours Sunday with a Verizon Wireless
 tech engineer, then 6 hours yesterday with a RIM escalation II engineer, trying everything... finally isolated that Win wasn't doing updates (I have another identical Win7ProSP1 laptop, but without all of the MS servers etc. - i consult in MS Dynamics GP and
 have multiple instances of SQL2008 R2 for multiple installs of GP for instance... and I'm dead in the water... anyway, I spent today working on this since it became critical, forgoing income for a 2nd day to fix this... the solutions here offered hope, but
 they didn't work either... I've documented all of this, have found that the Fixit tools (wu and device) don't work (they are cool and give the sense of working but they don't), hunting down downloading and direct installing as admin the KBs (doesn't work),
 all after turning off the non-MS services in msconfig, uninstalling Norton 360 (could not get N360 service to stop)... logs are long and kind of indicate msi installer isn't working right... so much pain and no gain... PLEASE HELP, I'd love to be able to be
 a productive part of the MS Partner community again and put this behind me!</span></p>

    <title>How does drive letter change affect restore&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tocguy001  say:</h3>
<h2>            How does drive letter change affect restore&#63;</h2>
                    Attempting to perform a complete PC restore to multiple drives. Using the Vista 64 DVD restore tool I see that the available drive letters for the new drives are different than those detailed on the Backup images. In other words, the Backup image appears
 as though it would try to backup onto what is now a DVD drive. Obviously, that is not good. How do I tell Restore to put Vista OS onto C, the XP OS onto F, and the Data onto D when the drive letters seen by the DVD boot don't match those as they were seen
 when the Backup images were captured by the OS during a normal boot?&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi Tocguy001,</span></p>
<p><span>You can restore to different locations using backup and restore wizard. Once you see the window below while using the backup and restore files, select the location where you want to restore the files to.
 Consider the following scenario.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, suppose that you want to restore a Document file named
<span>&nbsp;</span>ABCD to the Documents folder that became corrupted. Since you know the name and location of the file, you’ll click the Add Files button. When you see the Add Files To Restore window, select the fil, and click the Add button. The file will then
 be added to the list and you can click the Next button. Doing so will take you to the next page in the wizard, which will prompt you to select the location that you want to restore the file, In most circumstances, you’ll want to restore the file to the same
 location, but as you can see, you can choose and customize a different location.</span></p>

            I ended up getting all the drives and performed a complete backup. BTW: the prompt window you displayed did not appear.<br />
<br />
Now that the system is restored I'm having all kinds of bizarre errors like redundant&nbsp;ATA 0 and 1 channels in Device Manager. A PCI card whose Option ROM cannot be loaded and is thus rendered disabled. And, a strange error in Outlook 2007 for which there is
 no previous posting to be found. "Outlook could not create the work file. Check the temp environment variable." The temp variable is set and working fine as evidenced by the temp files being created and used by the OS.<br />
<br />
All in all, the windows backup and restore is not quite 100%.

<p><span>It sounds like your system did not restore properly - perhaps some files are missing or are corrupt.&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll try to
 deal with that.<br />
<br />
Try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer (Start / Control Panel /
 Administrative Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html</span></span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            I cannot get my desktop icons or shortcuts after windows 10 install</h2>
                    <p>After numerous attempts to access my start menu with left mouse, and trying every suggestion on these pages, I saw where several people had suggesting adding a new user.&nbsp;&nbsp;I logged in as a new user and became&nbsp;the administrator. &nbsp;This is what finally allowed
 me to get a working start menu.&nbsp; However all my old icons, shortcuts and programs did not transfer to Windows 10.&nbsp; If I want to use them I have to log in using my old info and I can then access all those items. How can I get them to move over to my Windows
 10 screen?</p>

            <p>This is weird, If you changed your user account you are not supposed to lose your icons or your old data, Did you Back up your files to Backup drive or whatever you'd be calling it? If so use it to get your old data</p>
<p>Unless working, You may log back to your old user in which the old problem occurs copy the shortcuts or files that your missing on a flash drive and log once back to your new user and paste them back. I'm sorry if my answer seems weird, but i can't figure
 out the problem.<br />

            <p>thanks for your response but I need more help.</p>
<p>If I log in as Mary, I have all my old icons and programs but cannot get to my Windows 10 start menu.&nbsp; I am basically still in Windows 7.&nbsp; Then I created new user Betty. When I log in as Betty I&nbsp;am able to get Windows 10 working but my old info is not there.
 I have tried making Betty the new administrator and thought I would then have access to everything that I&nbsp;did as Mary, but I can't.</p>
<p>That means I have to log in and out and go back to Mary to get my email, documents, etc. in Windows 7.</p>
<p>I'm still not sure how to move all that over to Betty and my Windows 10 screen.</p>
<p>Please tell me exactly how to go about doing that. I'm somewhat of a novice. </p>

<h2>            Would I upload a picture and put it as a gamer picture&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Guys,</p>
<p>I see people with gamer pictures that I rarely saw before. For an example, my friend had a gamer picture saying "Harms Way" in Captial letters with a minigun/chaingun underneath it, another friend had a skull emblem with the slimiar background&nbsp;like Gears
 of War 3. Are they been upload it from their computers to the Xbox or do they buy them in Marketplace? What happens if I upload a picture from my laptop, put it in the Xbox and use it as my gamer picture? Will I get banned for it? How long would the ban be?
 I'll need some advise. This is my frist time to post a thread into forums by the way.</p>

<p>Hello Guys,</p>
<p>I see people with gamer pictures that I rarely saw before. For an example, my friend had a gamer picture saying "Harms Way" in Captial letters with a minigun/chaingun underneath it, another friend had a skull emblem with the slimiar background&nbsp;like Gears
 of War 3. Are they been upload it from their computers to the Xbox or do they buy them in Marketplace? What happens if I upload a picture from my laptop, put it in the Xbox and use it as my gamer picture? Will I get banned for it? How long would the ban be?
 I'll need some advise. This is my frist time to post a thread into forums by the way.</p>

<p><span>Yes, you can use the Vision Camera to take a picture of yourself or an item for your Personal Picture (seen only by people on your Friends list), but Kinect can't be used for that.</span></p>

<p>Personally I have never used a third party performance enhancing software to run Windows efficiently, many of the inbuilt tools, such as Disk Cleanup, Defrag, Performance Monitor do a good job, I have also found that finding out &amp; understanding how a Windows
 PC really works is the best solution.</p>
<p>Also using a suite of tools from Sysinternals has been very useful:</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/default?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/default?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Many third party apps may do a good job, but you still need to know what it is really doing to your PC and not accept the actions it performs without knowing why &amp; how.</p>

            <p>Even though you are logged on as administrator, you are operating with normal privileges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is so that malware cannot take control of your system from your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some operations then require administrative or elevated &nbsp;privileges.</p>

<p>&nbsp;How you accomplish this, depends on what you are trying to do.</p>

<h2>            Laptop wireless connection issue, &#34;Identifying...&#40;network name&#41;&#34;.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,<br />
I'm having an issue with the wireless on my laptop. Its an HP Pavilion dv6000 and its just under a year old. I haven't had any issues with the wireless until recently. I use the laptop at home and usually the internet is fine (aside from the occassional disconnect)
 but when I'm at school it frequently won't connect to the school network (I'm a university student and there are several routers throughout the school and in the many buildings). Sometimes it will connect in one building and I'll move to another and it won't
 connect. Everytime it won't connect it always says "Identifying...(wireless network name)". No amount of repairing, restarting or reseting the network adapter will make it connect. The weird thing is that sometimes it will connect to the router in that particular
 building (i.e. the library) and sometimes it won't. Everytime I check the status it shows that the laptop is recieving but not sending.</p>
<p>Help! This problem is really starting to irritate me and I don't want to end up throwing my laptop across the library.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1st make a Restore Point so you can revert back if needed (it should not be though).<br />
<br />

<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76332-system-restore-point-create.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76332-system-restore-point-create.html</span></a><br />

</a><br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it - driver's tab - write
<br />
down version - click Update Driver (may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then<br />
Right Click on Wifi Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />

<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even newer versions. (The<br />
ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated drivers as Vista loves<br />
updated drivers.<br />
<br />
I would also disable auto-updates for drivers. If Windows Updates suggests one just HIDE it as they<br />
are almost alway old and you can look for drivers manually as needed.<br />

<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Make another Restore Point so you can get back to where you were if needed with the new drivers active.<br />
<br />
Make sure you know the login details for your wireless router - SSID and Password.<br />
<br />
You will lose connection when doing this and have to redo your logon.<br />
<br />
I would remove ALL of the networks so you can re-establish them as needed.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network &amp; Sharing Center - on Right Side click Customize - Set Network Locations page -<br />
on lower left click Merge or delete networks&nbsp;locations&nbsp;- DELETE ALL instances of your network&nbsp;(and any&nbsp;<br />
others you no longer use) - REBOOT.&nbsp;Start - Connect To to logon on to Network.<br />

<p>Hi&nbsp;Iniyan G (iniyanunna),</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I know if you have an Office 365 account with Skype for Business license? If so, please make sure&nbsp;you have signed in the Skype for Business client and Outlook client with the same email address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And may I know if you create the Skype Meeting in calendar? If so, please make sure the calendar belongs to the account which is used for Skype for Business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can set the account as primary account and check if it helps. If the issue persists, could you please provide a screenshot of the error message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Carlos</p>

<h2>            How to fetch all SAS&#47;SATA drives and Ethernet ports link speed by command line&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know if Windows OS supports built in command to fetch all SAS/SATA drives and Ethernet ports link speed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>i.e. for SATA3 drive it will show 6Gb/s, for SAS3 drive it will show 12Gb/s, to present current link speed.</p>
<p>i.e. for 10G Ethernet port it will show 10Gb/s while the current link speed is at 10Gb/s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need the command to create a batch file to perform system power cycling test in order to check all link speeds are correct on each cycle runs, if Windows OS does not support built in command to achieve it, please share any 3rd-party tool with command line
 support to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>Notepad codes, commands, and Outlook 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimmyphd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Notepad codes, commands, and Outlook 2016</h2>
                    <p>I'm a career customer of Microsoft products and use Notepad extensively for various tasks. Currently have installed Windows 10 Professional and Office 365 on my upper end HP computer (has an internal static drive and a mechanical/normal rotating disk drive).
 I also purchased a Microsoft Assure support option so have been covered with pre-paid support. Unfortunately, because of problems (too
<span>numerous to describe</span>) and created by a well-known nationally-known computer store, I have endured extensive technical difficulties while attempting to install the new Microsoft products. I have consulted at least three MS technicians in
<span>numerous to describe</span>) and created by a well-known nationally-known computer store, I have endured extensive technical difficulties while attempting to install the new Microsoft products. I have consulted at least three MS technicians in
 India and 2-3 technical help consultants, as they identified their location, being in the Caribbean. Further, I have taken my computer to our local Microsoft store for a "tune-up" with the so-called improvements being very minimal. At this point I am extremely
 frustrated with the installations; thus, creating more <em>Sturm und Drang</em> (storm and stress) than I can tolerate at age 81. At the moment I have most installation problems resolved; however, Outlook 365 (2016) is dealing me fits. I know this app well
 and have installed/setup this favored program many times. </p>
<p>Major Problems:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Outlook has so many "bells and whistles" now that I need a notepad beside my keyboard in order to remember where all the commands reside. I commend Microsoft for the many improvements in the current release but the redundancy and many options offered
 when attempting to create a simple email are overwhelming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The settings, although not extensively different than previous versions, are atrocious.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; a.&nbsp; For example, the past several days at the bottom of the boot up window I'm receiving a notification of downloading something like 24 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; emails but when I count these messages showing in the Inbox I have about half
 of that number. NOTE: I always check for misplaced </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; emails in my junk and trash folders (and elsewhere). I cannot determine where the stated received messages are going if, in fact,
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; they are being sent elsewhere. </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; b.&nbsp; I am unable to send an email to myself. These trial sendings are showing in the sent folder but do not arrive in my Inbox although
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; with other trials to friends, I apparently am sending messages to some people with success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; c.&nbsp; I am receiving email from other sources although I can't understand the gap between the notification of, e.g., 24 downloading and the
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 12 tangible messages arriving in my Inbox.</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp; Sorry that I'm deviating from the subject of this thread but I can't find another appropriate venue wherein to unload my frustrations.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: I easily installed Windows 10 and Office 365 on my wife's and my daughter's computers. This procedure on my high end computer,</strong></p>
<p><strong>has produced many problems and wasted time. At the stage of my profession and age I cannot tolerate problems like this. As Professor Emeritus, I remain an informal advisor and consultant for many former PhD graduate students when researching and
 editing their&nbsp;</strong><strong>literary</strong><strong> endeavors. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:&nbsp; After all of my ramblings above <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
my original and main objective in writing this request lies with the simple question of how I can search and replace wanted/not wanted line breaks in Notepad and replace these appropriate codes</span>. I have done this many times in the past with Word, I believe
 the command was Go to a page, line, or bookmark in a document and set Ctrl+G. Isn't there any command now in Notepad?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you very much. I truly appreciate this opportunity to "vent" some disappointments as well as obtain your valued expertise, computer knowledge, and answers to my simple questions which I should remember.</strong></p>

            Hi BadAzzDad,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />What you need is a subscription or credit not a number. If this number is Skype number, then this can be used only to receive calls. You can't make calls using Skype number.
<br />
<br />To see subscriptions / credit - <a href="https://secure.skype.com/calling-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/calling-rates</a>

<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Thank you for the quick reply Just so I'm understanding this correctly I would need a $3.00 subscription a month for her mobile phone or would I use it on my Xbox or do I needed on both. And who would call who or can either one call the other not quite
 sure how it works&nbsp;

            This is for calling from Skype to landline / mobile. Hence if you use Skype on Xbox One, you can call any mobile / landline number within USA including her. You will be using Skype client to call her up.
<br />
<br />If she also installs Skype on her mobile, she can call up your Skype also free of cost. 
<br />
<br />Actually, if you ask her to install Skype on her phone, you don't need $3 subscription at all as Skype to Skype calls are free. Only requirement is both of you need to have internet. 
<br />
<br />The benefit of buying $3 subscription is that she won't require internet but you would be requiring internet + you can call other mobile/landlines in US.

<h2>            Xbox app &#40;pc&#41; has problems downloading a game</h2>
                    So I recently bought the xbox game pass and tried to install a few games<br />
I started with Vampyr, which worked fine and I am still able to play it.<br />
I then saw I could download Imperator: Rome, a game that I wanted to buy at its launch. When it was downloaded, it gave en error message<br />
<span>Error code:</span><span> </span><span>0x80070780<br />
<span>Error code:</span><span> </span><span>0x80070780<br />
</span>When I tried restarting, it gave the same error, even cancelling the download doesn't even work.<br />
I assumed it downloaded incorrectly so I tried finding the game in my file explorer to remove it and try redownloading it completely.<br />
After changing the security of the main WindowsApps file, I tried to remove the Imperator: Rome files, but I seem to not have permission to remove the file, it says I need permission from myself and I haven't been able to find out how to bypass this.<br />
I have the latest windows.<br />
<br />
Specs:<br />
CPU: Intel Core i7 7700K @ 4.20GHz<br />
GPU: 4095MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080<br />
Motherboard: ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC. STRIX Z270F GAMING (LGA1151)<br />
<br />
Storage should also not be a problem, I have 600gb free on the selected drive.<br />
<br />
Nvm got it fixed
