    <title>Office 365 installment problem, please help - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 365 installment problem, please help</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a laptop from a Lenovo outlet. Lenovo laptops have built-in Office 365 (good for 1 year) apps, so I just went home and activated my account. I started to install the Office 365 Personal apps. However, because Office 365 took a long time
 to download, I had to restart my laptop and uninstall Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I received an e-mail which says "<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">This mail is confirmation that you successfully changed your subscription to Office 365 Personal on&nbsp;<span><span>Tuesday,
 March 01, 2016</span></span>. Please retain a copy of this for your records. Here is a description of the change:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This entitles you to a free one month trial of Office 365 Personal subscription."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Apparently, what I was able to reinstall was the 1-month free trial version of Office 365.&nbsp;</span><span>I have accidentally changed my Office 365 Personal (good for 1 yr) to (free trial). Can I go back
 to the 1-yr subscription? If yes, am I required to purchase or make payment as soon as the 1-month period ends? :(</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>How to change the color of track change's side bar in word 2013. In normal view, it is showing red, while when in print preview and print out it is showing black. I have notice that in Word 2010, in advanced option, there is an option in to change color
 in CHANGED LINES, can anyone confirm that they removed that in word 2013. thank you!</p>

            The option to define the color for changed lines was removed from Word 2013 because in that version the color (black or red) indicates whether the document is in Simple Markup or Full Markup view. Clicking on the change bar changes the color and the view.

<p>
</p><p>The person who receives the task request becomes the temporary owner of the task. They can decline the task, accept the task, or assign the task to someone else. If they decline the task, it's returned to you. (You still have to reclaim ownership by returning
 the task to your task list (task list: A list of tasks that appears in the Tasks folder and in the Task Pad in Calendar.).
<span>&nbsp;</span>If they accept the task, they become the permanent owner. If they assign the task to someone else, the new assignee becomes the owner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The owner is the only one who can make changes to the task. When you send the task to other person, then you are not the owner and since you are not the owner, you cannot update the task.</p>

            Yes, "on selection" means when you select something. But the mini toolbar is also always displayed&nbsp;above or below&nbsp;the context menu (what you get when you right-click). Why is this a problem? I confess when I right-click, I'm looking for a specific command,
 which I click on, and I don't pay any attention to anything else, so the mini toolbar is not really an issue; as soon as I click on a command, the menu and toolbar vanish.

                    I am not a Word Expert, but I created a document that I inserted pictures into. I then inserted a box from the shapes menu and added text in the box. Everytime I open the file, all the text in the "callout" boxes has moved or disappeard. Anyone know why
 this would happen. I've fixed the document numerous times and am fed up!! Am I not creating the document correctly?

            <p>It happens primarily on one document. Always starts on the same page and hoses the rest of the call outs for the rest of the document. I copied the "bad page" from a previous version (that is correct) and replaced the whole page with the copy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done this at least 10 times. I've turned on the codes and cannot see anything unusual. I am, however getting a large list of drawing object errors each time I open the file.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/700cb911-8bc5-4ac9-8cbd-7f2e1b4d51cd" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I select any of these, it does not take me to the object error. It stays on the first page of the document. I do select "Location" and it still does not take me to the location.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I draw the objects by going to "Shapes" then select the box, then I right click the shape and add text. I then go to shapes and draw an arrow from the shape to whatever I need to point to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just found an odd thing. When I click to select the callouts on page 4, the selection tool takes me to page 8 and selects those callouts. Page 8 is where my document goes wacky.</p>

<h2>            Zooming in during PowerPoint presentation</h2>
                    When using PowerPoint, is there a way to give a command to zoom in on on the screen so that when it presentation is playing, it does it automatically for that slide?&nbsp; For example, if I had a slide with a map of the U.S. and wanted to zoom in on the state
 of Oklahoma, is there a way to set that up where it zooms on the next mouse click?

    <title>Task Usage View Customization - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Task Usage View Customization</h2>
                    <div>Guys, <br />
I have been searching for an answer for sometime now but with No Luck! <br />
Let me give an example scenario first: <br />
- A Contractor has 30,000 Square feet of floor Tiling works to be done. (this info is added to a Column Number1 in Tasks Table Titled 'BOQ').
<br />
- He has 20 workers known by name, and they get paid based on their productivity.
<br />
The Contractor needs to capture not only the workers hours; but also their daily output (How many sq. Feet of Tiles each has fixed).
<br />
- The Contractor wishes to use the Physcial Progress % (not simply duration based progress). Hence, the Sum of the individuals production is required to calculate Physical Progress % against the task.
<br />
<br />
The Question is: How do you add a row in the Task Usage view (in the time phased side on the right side of the screen) to enter the Daily Production (similar to the Daily Actuals Work), and Have it totaled by Resource and then over the whole task.
<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
<br />

            <p>Hello Husan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your workers are paid solely by their output rather than their hours, then change them from a Work resourcce to a Materials resource, and add the payment per unit as the Std Rate value. Then, when you add actuals into the Task Usage view, you can add
 in the units they've completed, and the actual cost will be calculated for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your workers are paid for both hours and output (e.g. you pay a minimal wage but then give them a bonus on top of their hourly pay for their output), then I think you'd need to create 2 resources for each of your 20 workers: a Work-type resource and a
 Materials-type resource. Put the hours against the Work-type resource, and the output against the Material-type resource. That will give you the extra row to put the extra data in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that helps,</p>
<p>Andrew</p>

            Husam,
<div>The bottom line answer to your question is, you can't, at least not directly. What you need for your daily productivity is an extra field (e.g. Number1) that is timescaled and Project does not timescale any extra fields.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, by thinking outside the box, you might consider this approach. Each of the auxiliary baseline fields (i.e. Baseline1 thru Baseline10) does have timescale spread. They also allow user entry. However, they will not automatically roll up cumulative
 values and the display is fixed as hours, so there are a couple of issues to overcome.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The second issue is fairly easy to overcome, just assume each square foot of tile productivity is expressed as 1h (ignore the "h"). If you use the Baseline10 Work field as your daily data entry for each resource's productivity then I suggest you use the
 Task Usage view instead of the Resource Usage view.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The first issue is a little more involved to develop but not that difficult. It will however require a VBA macro to examine the values input to the selected Baseline10 Work field, sum them up and display in an extra field (e.g. Number1) at assignment level
 (i.e. per resource) and at task level (i.e. per task). This cannot be done with a formula in a custom field.</div>
<div><br />
<div>From there it is an easy step to calculate whatever performance metric you need.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Hello Andrew,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your previous Answer. The second Paragraph was what I'm looking for. Nevertheless, we still have the other issue unresolved:</p>
<p><em>"- The Contractor wishes to use the Physcial Progress % (not simply duration based progress). Hence, the Sum of the individuals production is required to calculate Physical Progress % against the task. "</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in other words, Can % Progress or any version of "% Complete" be updated automatically based on:</p>
<p>[Completed Qty] / [Overall Qty]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks Again.</p>

            <p>Hello Husam,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only way I could think of getting this was by a VBA script. Executing the following code on your project will calculate the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Units&nbsp; </strong>- Using the task.number12 field </li><li><strong>Actual Units </strong>- Using the task.number11 field </li><li><strong>% Units Complete</strong>&nbsp;- Using the task.number10 field</li></ul>
<p>Run this script, drop these&nbsp;columns&nbsp;into your gantt view and you should get the values you need. Values won't calculate automatically though, so you'll need to rerun the script to re-calculate these values when things change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>

            <p>There are several ways of accomplishing your goal.&nbsp; The simplest is to use AutoFilter.&nbsp; Assuming that the Cheque Numbers in column C are numbers and not Text, settup the Filter as
<strong>Custom...</strong></p>
<p>with the conditions <strong>Greater than</strong> 99999 and <strong>Less than</strong> 1000000</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will surpress all the non-Cheque Number rows and allow you to scroll directly up and down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another approach is to take advantage of the fact the the Cheque Numbers are sequential.&nbsp; Just list these Numbers in another column and use
<u>VLOOKUP()</u> function to display the associated amounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A third approach uses column D.&nbsp; It appears that a value in column D is only associated with a cheque.&nbsp; Use an AutoFilter to surpress any rows with blanks in column D</p>

<h2>            Excel 2013 and Word 2013 won&#39;t save new documents to a local drive.</h2>
                    <p>Recently I can't save new documents to either of my local drives (SSD and disk). This happens under Excel 2013 and also Word 2013. My PC is running Windows 10 with automatic updates. Both applications can read existing files stored locally. This behaviour
 seems to have happened in the last week or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>My Office 2013 copy is activated and legal. The version number is 15.0.4433.1508. Automatic Office update is turned on. My PC is a 2 year-old Dell Laptop with 16gb of RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried so far</p>
<p>=========</p>
<p>I have tried a repair and then a fresh installation of Office 2013 from DVD but I still can't save to local storage. I can save to OneDrive but otherwise the apps just hang if I try to browse my hard disk after choosing Save or Save As. I also put my McAfee
 firewall back to its default settings but this did not help.</p>

<p>I've managed to cure the problem. I repaired Office again in Control Panel but this time I chose the option to do it Online. The version of Office eventually updated to 15.4989.1000 ... which so far seems to allow saves as required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why the automatic updating enabled under Office didn't routinely install this latest version.&nbsp; Hope this helps some one else experiencing similar difficulties.</p>

                    <p>Hi! I have had hotmail account in my samsung smartphone for ages with no issues but it stopped syncing since 16/11/2016 and I haven't been able to receive my emails via the phone.</p>

            <p>I have already posted this reply to a thread primarily relating to the Windows Office / Outlook platform, but my wild guess is that the cause of your problem on Android might well&nbsp;be related -----</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I suggest you look at the website downdetector.com, under "Outlook status". There are dozens of current posts about difficulties some people are experiencing trying to access
 describe - your Outlook simply will not be able to find your email settings anywhere on the www. The thread also suggests some temporary fixes. This seems to be a global problem but only affecting some - apparently older? - Hotmail accounts.

            <p>As MS doesn't inform us what so ever about this issue, let me show you what the issue is EXACTLY...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you go to your WEBMAIL outlook account please ? Go to hotmail.com and log in to your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to options&gt;pop&amp;imap</p>
<p>First enable POP if you haven't yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then secondly, have a look at the set protocols :</p>
<p>
</p><p>in the option pop&amp;imap you can see the protocols used for incoming mail and outgoing mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incoming should be "SSL"...but I suspect you have it set to "TLS"</p>
<p>Outgoing (smtp) should be "TLS", but you probably have it set at "STARTTLS".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is MICROSOFT's doing, NOT YOURS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS is migrating (it seems) those protocols globally, from SSL to TLS for incoming mail, and from TLS to STARTTLS for outgoing mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already mentioned this to MS support, and to GPB HMA also, and all they can respond is that I have a 'misbehaving' account. Which is total BS by the way. All my accounts are verified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for everyone having sync issues, and I mean EVERYONE globally having issues syncing outlook on either MS Outlook app, Android or Iphone, Ipad,... anything other than the webmail itself, is in fact affected by this change in mail protocols !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have three hotmail accounts, and only one of them has the mail protocols set to TLS (incoming) and STARTTLS (outgoing)...and low and behold it is the only one having issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another user CONFIRMED to me that he has the exact same issue, he has several accounts, but only one of them has the mail protocols set to the new TLS and STARTTLS, and also for him it is the only account not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yes it affects MANY BUT NOT ALL hotmail accounts, but has nothing to do with what you suggest, GPB HMA !!!!</p>
<p>MS is MIGRATING ITS MAIL PROTOCOLS TO A MORE SECURE PLATFORM, and MANY BUT NOT ALL accounts are affected by this migration !</p>
<p>Stop replying with that same 'idea' of yours because it isn't correct, and has nothing to do with the actual issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have sync issues, check the pop&amp;imap option, if you have TLS and STARTTLS instead of SSL and TLS, then you should blame MS, because it is a GLOBAL issue coming from THEIR SERVER END !</p>
<p>
</p><p>So MS, when you finally read this, be advised that SOME of your users already have identified the specific issue to be a SERVER issue coming from your end. STOP BLAMING YOUR USERS FOR YOUR OWN MESS UPS !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope THIS will help a LOT of users out there THINKING it is something they can fix. The END-USER CANNOT FIX THIS !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS should first pull their finger and admit this issue, then start to fix it.</p>

            <p>I never did suggest it was a user created problem, and my expression "misbehaving" was intended to suggest that the problem is some kind of MS server-side problem, but perhaps I wasn't very clear about that. The previous post does of course seem to be along
 the right lines, becasue I totally agree that the only Hotmail account I have using STARTTLS is the only one I have that is playing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, though I agree this is not a user-created issue, there are some user-related work-arounds listed on downdetector - such as using an "alias" - that do seem to help.</p>

<h2>            How do I count the number of non-blank cells between blank cells&#63;</h2>
                    I have a series of data points in a single row. Some cells in the row contain values and some don't. I would like to count the number of value containing cells between blank cells. For example:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A &nbsp;B &nbsp;C &nbsp;D &nbsp;E &nbsp;F &nbsp;G &nbsp;H &nbsp;I &nbsp;J &nbsp;K &nbsp;L &nbsp;M &nbsp;N &nbsp;O &nbsp;P &nbsp;Q &nbsp;R &nbsp;S &nbsp;T &nbsp;U &nbsp;V &nbsp;W &nbsp;X &nbsp;Y &nbsp;Z&nbsp;</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would like to find a formula that counts the number of cells between columns D and M and columns O and X (for example).</div>

<h2>            Auto-complete email addresses on Outlook Live Mail</h2>
                    <ol>
<li>I don't have any difficulty saving and organizing email addresses in "People", but when I try to type some addresses (not all of them) in the "To" box in an email, it can't be found - the address doesn't auto-complete, and if I search for it, it can't be
 found.&nbsp; I have to go into "People", copy the address and then go back into mail and paste it in manually.&nbsp;
</li><li>Also, some addresses that I have deleted in "People" still show up in the auto-complete list</li><li>And finally, if I try to add a new address from an email, I can't find an option to "add to contacts" or "add to people".&nbsp; It's another copy and paste job.</li></ol>
<p>It's as if the People and the Mail aren't connected to each other, except for old email addresses which are still showing up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be really grateful if anyone could help.&nbsp; I didn't have this problem before "Beta", and now I have no option to go back.</p>
<p>

            1. Are they new contacts? Outlook doesn't put names on the autocomplete list until you send to the address. The server will scan the contacts and mail t find addresses you frequently receive email form and put them on the autocomplete list.  It will do this with contacts but there can be a delay before it scans. 
<br />
<br />2. They are on the autocomplete it. if there is an X on the right, click it to delete the address from autocomplete. 
<br />
<br />3. Click on the email address to open the contact card - on the right in very faint color, are 3 dots. That gives you a save to contacts option. (I missed it the first time. )

    <title>Glue will not work if group contains more that 45 shapes. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mustang carl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Glue will not work if group contains more that 45 shapes.</h2>
                    <p>I'm not sure if this is the correct place to ask, or if this should be in the TechNet forum, as this is really a development issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I create a group and add a connection point to the group, it works as long as the group has 45 or less shapes (including nested groups). If I add any more shapes so it contains more than 45 shapes, the glue stops working. If I delete those shapes and
 return it to 45 or less, it once again works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of our drawings hit this limit routinely. Sometimes we can combine shapes to reduce the shape count, but sometimes this is not possible. For example, if I build a data table that contains 8 columns and 68 rows, the glue does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any chance that this limit can be raised? Or am I just missing something? This really limits the usefulness of the Glue feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried this in 2010, 2013 and 2016 and they all have this issue. For us, this issue actually started with Visio 2003.

            <p>Never heard of this problem. I have many shapes with hundreds of sub-shapes within a group. Glue seems to work ok in Visio 2007 and 2010.</p>
<p>Try these shapes: </p>
<p>http://www.paulherber.co.uk/visio-electronics/</p>
<p>and download the sampler. There are two shapes:</p>
<p>68HC08GR (QFP48)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>ICL7106 - (QFP-44)</p>
<p>with 98 and 90 grouped shapes respectively. See if they work.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the delay. I posted a follow up last week, at least I thought I did. Your shapes behave the same as my test shapes as far as I can tell. If I create as simple rectangle and add in/out connection points to the corners and then try drag your&nbsp;68HC08GR
 (QFP-44) to it to try to get the connection points to glue, it doesn't work. If I go into your shape and delete sub shapes so the shape count is less than 45 it does work. Also, if you drag a simple shape like a connector to your complex shape it works. What
 doesn't work is dragging a complex shape to another complex shape and having them glue to each other.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The connection points on my 68HC08GR shape are type 0 (input connection points) - designed to have a connector attach to them. You won't get two of these shapes to glue to each other without editing the shape and convert one or more of the connection points
 into type 2 (input/output).</p>
<p>I can get a connector to connecft to the 68HC08GR. If I create a rectangle with one type 2 connection point then I can drag this up to the 6HC08GR and glue it. It won't work the other way round though (again, that will need the 68HC08GR connection points
 changed).</p>
<p>This all works fine for me in Visio 2003, 2007 and 2010. No limit of 45 shapes.</p>
<p>Hold on, I've just been doing some shape duplication, grouping and glueing and it has stopped working for some shape connection points. But then you do some other task, go back to moving shapes and glueing, the ones that didn't work now do and those that
 did now don't (this is in Visio 2010).</p>

            <p>I've been looking at the connectors in your 68HC08GR shape and I see that they are type 0. At one time I thought that it was the type of connector that was the issue, and in some cases it can be. However, the issue that I have seems to be different. Here
 are the steps to illustrate the problem. For this example, I use type 2 connectors on both sides, which are in/out.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new blank drawing.</li><li>Draw a rectangle.</li><li>Add a type 2 connecter to each corner of the rectangle.</li><li>Duplicate that shape, and then using the duplicate, create 49 more duplicates.</li><li>Group the 50 duplicates, leaving the original shape as a separate shape.</li></ol>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd14c31f-d608-4667-afa6-3e7fd8d860bb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd14c31f-d608-4667-afa6-3e7fd8d860bb" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Test 1: Drag the single shape to any one of the 50 shapes in the group and it will glue to that shape.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8482ac27-9f2f-4928-a12d-2b72f57f60e6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8482ac27-9f2f-4928-a12d-2b72f57f60e6" /></a></p>
<p>Test 2: Drag the group containing 50 shapes toward the single shape and neither the glue or snap to Geometry works.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce7104a9-fdf6-48de-937b-27ecf5f24729" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce7104a9-fdf6-48de-937b-27ecf5f24729" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Test 3: Delete five of the shapes in the group so there are 45 shapes in the group. Repeat Test 2. It works.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/623356bc-a1b6-41aa-b8b7-cfc7fb20f12e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/623356bc-a1b6-41aa-b8b7-cfc7fb20f12e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The weird part is today the magic number seems to be 49. After doing test 3 above, I then added one shape at a time back into the group and it worked (snapped and glued correctly) all&nbsp;the way up to 49 shapes, and then as soon as I added one more to make
 it 50, it quit working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually reported this as a bug to Microsoft way back 2003 sometime and they called me back to confirm it was a bug. But back then it was more like 25 or more it would quit. Visio 2000 did not do this, or more precisely, we never hit the limit using Visio
 2K.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only reason I ask here is because our customers keep asking us, "How come some of your shapes will glue and others don't?"</p>

<p>On my Nokia E71 (VirginMedia sim card), I've been to the Amazon.co.uk page hundreds of times but now, as soon as I open that page, it appears for a second then I'm immediately disconnected from the net and back on my phone's home page. There's no problem
 accessing any other website (inc.Amazon.com). The problem started this afternoon. Why does this happen?</p>

<p>Hi MaccMadman,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Nokia Support Discussions!&nbsp;:smileyhappy:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding your concern, have you tried clearing the browsing history on your phone? You can do this by going to Web &gt; Options &gt; Clear privacy data &gt; Clear cache then try accessing the Amazon web again. If this one will not work, you can do some troubleshooting
 on the phone like switching the phone off to reboot it. You can also try to use a Wi-Fi connection just to isolate the concern that you are encountering right now. Keep us updated on what will be the outcome of these steps provided to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I just saw something that may explain what happened to all my stuff, Jack. I go to MyPhone account from a PC @ the radio station where I work. They recently got a new Exchange server. Could that have anything to do with this MYPhone FAQ caveat:</p>
<p>"(If you already sync your contacts, calendar appointments, or tasks by using an
<span>Exchange ActiveSync</span> (EAS) account, you won’t be able to sync them with
<span>My Phone</span> in order to avoid conflicts with your Exchange account.)"</p>
<p>In other words, would this have anything to do with my missing stuff even though I've never signed in or up with any EAS account?</p>
<p>Thanks more,</p>
<p>Ric</p>

<p>Exchange shouldn't affect MyPhone. On the device if you do use Exchange, your Contacts,Calendar,Tasks will be&nbsp;grayed&nbsp;out (Under Menu-&gt;Sync Options) since they are&nbsp;synced&nbsp;with your Exchange server(if you are using it). It shouldn't affect anything else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems strange that your Archive was deleted, because it requires interaction to select the items and then delete them. Hopefully someone from MS is watching this thread and maybe able to provide further assistance with your account.</p>

<p>Everyday MicroSoft gives me more reasons to hate them. This is the last straw. I love just about everything about my Samsung Omnia but the fact it uses a MS OS. 6 months and then they delete everything?Without even a warning before doing so? So typically
 anti- user of the company. But...</p>
<p>Even if that were true,</p>
<p>#1, How come the "notes" from my phone disappeared only AFTER I made my last transfer on May 1 of this year and</p>
<p>#2 (yet another reason why IHMS--which I'm sure is now the standard acronym for "I Hate Micro Soft.") When my "notes" which contain both script, text &amp; voice WERE transferred the 1st times I connected to myphone.ms.com they appeared in a form that couldn't
 be read or heard. What the ____ is that about?</p>
<p>#3 if M$ doesn't fix this soon, as much as I love my Omnia, I'm switching to Android.</p>
<p>#4 Pleas help, Jack.</p>

<p>Yes, Steven it is strange. But then it also seems strange that since M$ took over HotMail, the email client get worse with ever "update." Like why it would say "mark as read" instead of "mark as unread" when you already have the email open. And if you use
 Hotmail you will probably know of what I speak plus too many other irritations.<br />
<br />
Sorry if I seem pissed but it seems there's something new every day. And this time doubly so as, without changing any settings from my last transfer, all I did was click on the connect feature. Then when going to myphone.ms.com, saw there was nothing there.
 And then when going back noticed all my "notes" were gone from my Omnia as well. So much for "living in the cloud."</p>
<p>It probably won't help you find the problem, but those notes contained potentially thousands of dollars in future profits for my business and I can't think of another way to back up valuable info from a "Smart" phone to my dumb PC.</p>
<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>The key words here are "Last Fall" IMHO Ric.&nbsp; You did not access the site for over 6 months and as I indicated above, that according to the terms of service: "If your<span>My Phone</span> account remains inactive (currently for more than six months), then

            I can answer your question, but first I want to address an inaccuracy in Daniel's answer. He said "...the format used by Word in its equations [is](called MathType)...". That's incorrect. MathType is a commercial product, available by separate purchase,
 and is a more powerful equation editor than its little brother "Microsoft Equation Editor 2011 for Mac", which is made by the same company and has been included with Word 2011 and every previous version of Word since v2. If that's the equation editor you're
 using (let's call it MSEE), you're going through Word's Insert menu to do it. There are actually 2 equation editors in Word 2011 though, and
Equation</span>, this is a different equation editor. This editor is called the OMML equation editor (OMML = Office Math Markup Language).<br />
<br />
Now what Daniel said was true about your online school system being able to understand the format used by the equation editor. This is true regardless of whether you're using MSEE or OMML. However, in his instructions for Paste as Picture, you'll only need
 to do the cropping if you're using OMML, because the OMML equation pictures will be page-wide, as he describes. The MSEE equation pictures will be actual size.<br />
<br />
Let's go back to MathType. You don't say which "online school" you're using, but MathType has special capability to work with many learning management systems (aka "online schools"), like Blackboard, Moodle, ANGEL, and many others. Go through the list at
<a href="http://www.dessci.com/workswith" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.dessci.com/workswith</a> to see if yours is listed there. If it is, there will be additional instructions for using MathType with it.<br />

            Unless your online school system can understand the format used by Word in its equations (called MathType), you cannot transfer them. You can convert equations to pictures, if the system supports images. To do that:
<div><br />
<div><b>Paste as picture in Word<br />
</b>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Select the equation and copy it to the clipboard.</li><li>In the main menu bar, select <i>Paste Special.</i>&nbsp;Make sure "Paste" is selected (not "Paste Link").</li><li>The equation will paste as a graphic, and it will seem to lose resolution, but a quick Zoom-in will show it is of sufficient quality. Also, it will be page-wide. If you don't want this, you can crop it:</li></ol>
<div><span>
<ul>
<li><span>Click on the picture-equation.</span></li><li><span><span>In the Ribbon, click on the <i>Format Picture</i>&nbsp;purple tab.</span></span></li><li><span>Select the fifth icon, <i>Crop</i>.</span></li><li><span>Move the cursor to the left edge. When it looks like a sideways T (⊣) move the left border to the right.</span></li><li><span>Likewise on the other side (⊢). Zooming will help.</span></li></ul>
</span>
<div><br />
<div><b>Take a snapshot</b></div>
<ol>
<li>Zoom real close on your equation.&nbsp;The larger you zoom in, the larger the quality (more pixels).
<ul>
</ul>
</li><li>Press <i>Command Shift 4. </i>This will turn your cursor into crosshairs.</li><li>Click and drag across the equation. (Press ESC to Cancel.)</li><li>When you let go, you'll have a picture on your Desktop. Rename it suitably.</li></ol>
<div><b>What doesn't work</b></div>
<div>Saving the .docx document into the older .doc format will convert all your equations into graphics, all at once. However, the display quality is miserable.</div>

            Yes, there may be "problems" but you wouldn't expect that something as basic as intel Bluetooth drivers would end up as one of these.

<h2>            Microsoft Office InfoPath 2007 error</h2>

    <title>Windows Defender conflicting with Kaspersky--cannot disable Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Defender conflicting with Kaspersky--cannot disable Windows Defender</h2>
                    I use Kasperski antivirus.&nbsp; Just recently I am getting warnings that both Windows Defender and Kasperski are off (but no means is offered in that warning to turn Kasperski on).&nbsp; Kasperski is still working, but you can imagine the conflict and delays I
 am running into.&nbsp; Settings where I could disable Windows Defender do not show (I do have it off in the main settings area but it still keeps trying to run, and flashes warnings that Windows Defender needs to scan).&nbsp; I have not been able to find in Windows
 10 the screen showing all programs and which ones I can enable or disable.&nbsp; Where is that now?&nbsp;

            <p>Did you seek advice/assistance from Kaspersky? &nbsp;If Kaspersky is installed and working properly then the real time protection component of WD should have been disabled. &nbsp;WD may possibly have been enabled because Kaspersky quit working properly.</p>
