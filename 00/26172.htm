    <title>Problem with duplex printing on Canon MX512 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mitchberger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with duplex printing on Canon MX512</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to print a trifold, two sided brochure for my cancer support group. I am running MSOffice 2007, on Windows7. I have a Canon MX512 which has duplex printing. However, when I send my word document to print, the second page prints upside down. I
 have monkeyed around with the settings, and have tried templates, but nothing seems to work. If anyone has a solution, I need it explained to me like I'm a five year old - a five year old from when I was a five year old, long, long ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>The rotation of the second page is controlled only by the printer driver, not by Word. In the Print dialog, click the Properties button at the top right -- that opens the Printer Properties dialog, which is supplied by the printer driver and is different
 for each manufacturer (and maybe for different models).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Canon MX860, which I hope has the same Properties dialog as your MX512. If your dialog is the same or similar, look at the Page Setup tab for a way to control which side of the paper would be stapled or bound if you were making a booklet. If it
 says "long side" change it to "short side", or vice versa:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f41f23a8-a1da-4241-a7be-502c8ffd3ad7" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get a choice of "Top" or "Bottom", it shouldn't matter which you choose; that affects only which edge gets an additional margin (to accommodate the staples) if you click the Specify Margin button. By default the margin is zero.</p>

                    <p>Build 9879: &nbsp;Uninstalling Apps by right-clicking on them under Start | All Apps and selecting Uninstall takes a VERY long time to happen (if at all). &nbsp;This has got to be made several orders of magnitude faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: &nbsp;It looks like the icons for the apps don't get removed until the system is restarted. &nbsp;At the very least, the icon should be changed somehow to reflect its uninstalled status as soon as it happens.</p>

    <title>List of Nokia Lumia 820 Compatible MicroSD Cards - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> swil---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            List of Nokia Lumia 820 Compatible MicroSD Cards</h2>
                    
<p>Quote from page 29&nbsp;on&nbsp;the Nokia Lumia 820 user guide that comes in the box with the phone: "Use only compatible memory cards approved for use with this device. Incompatible cards may damage the card and the device and corrupt data stored on the card".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guide doesn't list the "compatible" or "approved" cards for the device, or provide any insight on how to find them (well, there are a few links to
<a href="http://www.nokia.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.nokia.com/support</a>, however I haven't found a list of these cards on this site, just a bunch of people complaining about feeling ripped off for buying an incompatible MicroSD card).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anybody point me to this list if it exists or create it please? Preferably I would like somebody from Nokia to post an official list, however if anybody has bought a card that's working (or not working), please clearly indicate the model, brand,&nbsp;and
 perhaps model number of the card and whether it works or not with the Nokia Lumia 820 so a preliminary (and perhaps close to complete soon) list can be compiled.</p>

            from what've read, you'd be safe with any card that isn't Class 10, so any Class 2, Class 4, Class 6 up to 64GB from a reputable brand such as SanDisk or Lexar. One to definitely stay away from is Transcend.

<p>I have just found out I was using a Class 10 SanDisk microsdhc card, and am concerned that I may have done damage to my phone and/or music collection (as per Nokia guidelines). Is anyone able to tell me what the chances are that this will have damaged them,
 and if there's anything I can do to rectify? Thanks!</p>

            i dont believe that it would have done any major damage, just that it may not work. i would invest in a cheaper card, and trust me, there's not much to worry about ok :)

            Not trying to bash Nokia, but I fully agree. Where is the list of compatible Micro SD cards? What is Nokia doing to correct the incompatibility with the new faster Class 10 Micro SD cards? My 64GB Sandisk Ultra works well in a Symbian Nokia N6, but not
 a Lumia 820?

            Not that i'm aware of. Internet Explorer Mobile supports a subset of Javascript, but probably not enough to run your applications. But maybe you can get a workaround from a developer community. try one of the MSDN forums below:

                    <p><span>Hi there<br />
<br />
I upgraded to Windows 10 Home (64-bit) yesterday. This morning I was able to receive emails via Outlook 2013, but when trying to send I get error 0x800CCC13. 'Cannot connect to the network. Verify your network connection or modem.'<br />
<br />
Checking Account Settings, they all look fine. I click on next (with Automatically test this accounts settings ticked), and the test emails are sent and received successfully -- it is just creating a new email that won't send.<br />
<br />
Anyone else experiencing this issue? Any tips on how to get it back up and working?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />

            Hi,<br />
What is the error code you see when you try and open ActiveSync?<br />
<br />
Have you tried creating another user on the PC and then try and open ActiveSync?<br />
<br />
Try looking at the registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows CE Services\WCESMGR WindowPlacement key.&nbsp; If the window is off the screen, try changing it to 0,1,-1,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0,0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: Modifying the registry is not supported by Microsoft.

    <title>Will Windows Defender on Windows 8 detect ALL spyware, viruses. adware - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wildflowers47  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will Windows Defender on Windows 8 detect ALL spyware, viruses. adware etc&#63; And how do I turn off the &#34;MsMpEng,exe element of it which is gobbling-up CPU&#63;</h2>
                    I am running Windows8 on Dell Inspiron 17R. I recently got some sort of virus/adware that installed Babylon and Hola toolbars on my browsers which then started showing ads and redirecting me.
<div>I am not particularly tech-savy so Googled the problem. With the aid Maleware Bytes, iSafe, Hitman Pro and a couple of other fixes I have managed to fix (I hope) the infection, which I surmise I got after installing some software without paying close enough
 attention to what was happening. I checked Windows Defender which had quarantined one severe Trojan, yet the problems had persisted for another week until I threw every thing suggested in forums at it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am also annoyed that Windows Defender has an element called MsMpEng.exe in it that I would like to stop as it is using CPU heavily.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone help me please........with non-complex solutions if possible!!!!</div>
                </div>

            <p>Windows Defender will detect any Malware it is aware of. When malware is researched and identified as dangerous or unwanted, it will be added to the database used to scan for such software. This is one reason why scans should be done regularly.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When is this high CPU-usage occurring?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here is a thread that discusses&nbsp;a similar&nbsp;issue. Although it is in the Microsoft Security Essentials category, Windows Defender is the exact same thing on Windows 8.</p>

            Thankyou Cameron, - my computer is scanned daily, but it did not prevent or eradicate the Toolbar/browser problem, unless that was the Trojan it quaranteened, yet other programmes picked up on them I presume.
<div><br />
<div>The CPU usage is pretty constant according to iSafe scan. One google search seemed to be saying that it was something to do with the indexing option on Windows defender and that it could be turned off, but I wasn't clear how.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I feel inclined to remove Windows Defender and replace it with something else.....yet I suspect Microsoft may have have made it unremovable!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will go to the thread you kindly provided now.</div>

            <p>Windows Defender is not removable, but if Defender sees you install another antivirus, it will disable itself completely, depending on the product you install. You will not notice it at all. But I do recommend Defender.</p>
<p>I read your original post a little more carefully. I've seen that Babylon toolbar before, very hard&nbsp;to remove. You can try using the internet explorer reset button, found in tools&gt;internet options&gt;advanced&gt;</p>
<p>Other browsers, you may have to un/reinstall.</p>

            <p>You cannot turn off MSMPENG.EXE -- it is the engine for the protection provided by Windows Defender (and MSE on prior versions of Windows).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these toolbars, though pretty much worthless garbage bordering on criminal, are not "malware" in the full sense of the word, so Microsoft's products (and those of other vendors) will often let them slide. They typically ride along with the
 installers of shareware, so you must be very careful when installing downloaded software and even updates for installed programs, lest this junk get installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What was quarantined by Defender?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you consider "heavily" for the CPU used by MSMPENG and how persistent is it -- that is, when does this happen? Continually, at startup, at idle? Defender on Windows 8 will perform maintenance tasks such as scanning when the PC is otherwise idle.</p>

<p>Even so, I wonder why Malwarebytes' anti-malware doesn't detect it. I have known Malwarebytes' to remove non-malware PUPs (although Babylon goes beyond "potentially" in my opinion) for years, especially products such as MyWebSearch and other toolbars.</p>
<p>I had to remove it from a friend's computer once, and it was harder to remove than anything else. At least Norton (someone else's computer) didn't run anymore. Despite being very skilled with Windows, I could not get this thing to even go invisible and forgotten
 about at all. I forgot how I eventually did it.<br />

            Antiviruses have certain norms, if an Adware is not found violating them then it is not removed in scan, if it violates then they will be removed. How MS detects a program as PUP or not:<br />

<br />
Their are many Adwares that are removed by MSE, many are not because of above reason. See this for list of Adwares MSE removes:<br />

            Thanks everyone for help and links and for keeping things simple.
<div>The trouble with being an amateur is that one can easily get 'spooked' by running some of these 'defender' programmes.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Progress so far: I<span>&nbsp;seem to have managed to removed all traces of the Babylon and Hola search engines. &nbsp; I am going to leave the CPU hogging processes for now because I don't feel that I can identify the offending files confidently.</span>
<div>Left on my computer, then, is Windows Defender; iSafe; SuperAntispyware; jv16 Power Tools 2013; Revo Uninstaller and Malwarebytes AntiMalware as well as the normal programmes. (Please stop laughing!)</div>
<div>I uninstalled several other adware removers and Hitman Pro. As you can see, I went in for the overkill approach!</div>
<div>My final question therefore is: do I need to run any of these scans regularly and what can I sensibly keep of the battery of 'defences' I have installed?</div>

            <p>I have no clue what iSafe is. Searches return a keylogger, a virus remover, and a rogue antivirus program. If it is any of these three, you don't want it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SuperAntispyware *free version* is a good on demand scanning tool. The paid version includes real time protection and may cause performance issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see no usefulness in jv16 Power Tools 2013. In fact, it may well cause you problems.</p>

<p>RevoUninstaller is fine and may come in handy for removing a persnickety program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malwarebytes Anitmalware *free version* is also a good choice for occasional on demand scanning. The paid version includes real time protection and may cause performance issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"several other adware removers" doesn't tell me much, but if any had real time protection and didn't uninstall cleanly, you may have bits leftover. I suspect not, though, since you do have Revo to check for that.</p>

Run <a href="http://www.appremover.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AppRemover</a> to remove conflicting softwares. It may solve high CPU usage problem. First download AppRemover, it will scan for installed antiviruses and P2P software, remove everything that comes in the list (you can
 leave Malwarebytes if you have Free version [neither Pro nor Trial] and SUPERAntiSpyware also if you have Free version [neither Professional nor Trial]).<br />

            Again, thanks for everyone's guidance and advice -which I will act upon,
<div><br />
<div>It brings me back to my first problems:</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is possibly impossible to find an antivirus problem which spots every single thing.&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is vital to be vigilant when downloading anything to avoid programmes etc. which hi-jack browsers.</div>
<div>It is easy to panic and try so hard to fix problems with various 'solutions' - that you cause your computer to have conflicts and apps and downloads that you don't need.....that give you more problems.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have learned some valuable lessons from this and will make this forum my first port of call for future issues.</div>

<p>The problem is that mail sent from the Yahoo email server is not being received by the screwed up Outlook mail program!!!&nbsp; Since you closed down the Live Mail Servers, I can not get the Validation Code from the Elite&nbsp;Dangerous server.&nbsp; Fix this problem or
 I will stop using Microsoft.&nbsp; It is a shame, that you closed&nbsp;down the working mail server to add advertising, which people do not want or need.&nbsp; I&nbsp;receive so much trash mail,&nbsp;that it, can not be&nbsp;blocked, and you refuse to stop it, making the mail unusable.&nbsp;
 Thanks&nbsp;for letting us know,&nbsp;that you are going to continue to screw your long time customers&nbsp;by changing your operating system into an advertising system.&nbsp;&nbsp;Guess what, that means that you are not providing an operating system any more.&nbsp; This leaves your company&nbsp;open&nbsp;for&nbsp;replacement
 and you have no way to prevent it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft is not a company, I want to do business with.&nbsp; You no longer listen to your customers.&nbsp; Have you tried to get any kind of help from Microsoft?&nbsp; Let me tell you what you get, when you try to get help from your company.&nbsp;
 First, they try to get you to use their on line troubleshooting.&nbsp; You are connected to morons, in foreign countries, that&nbsp;could not troubleshoot them selves out of a wet paper bag.&nbsp; They screw up&nbsp;four times&nbsp;as many computers,&nbsp;than they fix.&nbsp; None of these
 morons, have any idea how your program works.&nbsp; You have complicated a once decent&nbsp;operating system in to a complicated pile of crap.&nbsp; They take control of your operating system, then they start making changes to your operating system, without your permission,
 until it goes down.&nbsp; Then, they give you a web site, that is not a Microsoft web site and have you&nbsp;reload&nbsp;Windows.&nbsp; They do not stay online to insure your computer comes back up.&nbsp; Instead they have you down load a version of Windows from a site that is not
 owned by Microsoft.&nbsp; Needless to say, the file that&nbsp;they have had you download is infected with viruses.&nbsp; After they do this to your&nbsp;customers many times, we as customers get very pissed off.&nbsp; I have had to spend over 80 hours on line with your, so called
 tech support. &nbsp;What is more, you have no one, including the supervisors, that can fix a problem with Windows.&nbsp; Your tech support had me spend $299 to fix my Windows. It did not work.&nbsp;I had to completely reload&nbsp;Windows 10 Pro&nbsp;from&nbsp;my Windows disk.&nbsp;I wish, you
 would listen to your customers.&nbsp; It would prevent your company from failing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear IJustHelping,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using Microsoft Windows since it began.&nbsp; It has not always been crapware.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Email did not contain advertising, until morons decided, they could make money on it.&nbsp; Email is suppose to be private, between two people or companies.&nbsp; It was never designed to contain advertising.&nbsp; Now, Microsoft has changed what Email is suppose to be.&nbsp;
 They have made it worthless.&nbsp; Originally, Email had no advertising.&nbsp; It was&nbsp;suppose to be communications between&nbsp;a person and another person&nbsp;or group of people.&nbsp; It contained no advertising.&nbsp; Microsoft has decided that, they can go&nbsp;beyond the law.&nbsp; They did
 not ask their customers,&nbsp; They just decided that, they wanted to make more money, not provide security for their customers.&nbsp; Microsoft does not pay us to take their advertising.&nbsp; They are stealing from every customer that uses the internet.&nbsp; Don't believe
 me,&nbsp; look at&nbsp;what is&nbsp;really in the email.&nbsp; Over half is advertising&nbsp;and who is paying for it.&nbsp; That's right, you and I are paying for this added junk mail.&nbsp; If Microsoft wants to increase your&nbsp;internet traffic, make them pay for it.&nbsp; If an email does not reach
 my inbox, then there is a problem&nbsp;with&nbsp;how&nbsp;Microsoft's email servers are working.&nbsp; Any email that is sent to me, should find it's way into my inbox in seconds.&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;has seen&nbsp;that only Microsoft&nbsp;mail is coming through.&nbsp; This is against the law, and Microsoft
 should be sued by the Federal Government.&nbsp; Microsoft claims to be an operating system, it is not!!!&nbsp; It is an advertising piece of trash&nbsp; Microsoft should be charged for increasing the cost of the internet connection, by including their advertising crap.</p>

            <p>Since many others are having no issues receiving their emails then there is something with your setup (could be on the servers) that isn't allowing email to go through. As you are unwilling to work on that in these forums, I would suggest you contact Microsoft
 Tech Support directly.</p>

<p>Perhaps you should read the messages on Microsoft's servers.&nbsp; Many customers have complained about this problem.&nbsp; It has been reported to Microsoft, but they have done nothing about the problem in&nbsp;their programming.&nbsp; I have completely reinstalled&nbsp;Windows
 10 Pro, two days ago.&nbsp; It is not an operating system problem, but&nbsp;Microsoft's setup of the Outlook Mail Program.&nbsp; It's called bad programming.&nbsp; I was referred here by tech support.&nbsp; Microsoft needs to get it's head out of it's ****, and fix the problem.&nbsp; This
 has gone on way to long.&nbsp; It worked when Live&nbsp;Mail was up. There is no way for customers to get thru to Microsoft's &nbsp;support center.&nbsp;&nbsp;You get morons on line that break your computer and leave you with no way to communicate with them.&nbsp; Microsoft made this change
 so that we can not view our mail in peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, is that the mail servers send us spam, that we have not signed up for.&nbsp;They are using Microsoft's name in the anti-mail&nbsp;spam&nbsp;note.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>0786-8237 Borderlinux/DHL 4505 Honeywell Court. Dayton. 45424-5760-, OH, US</p>
<p>
</p><p>is the one listed as the group responsible.&nbsp; Email with this listing should never be sent to any customer as DHL has no office at this address.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where as, I am unable to receive mail from Elite Dangerous, sent thru Yahoo's serves to me&nbsp;thru &nbsp;Microsoft's Outlook mail server.&nbsp; This is a problem, because the mail contains a Verification&nbsp;Code that must be enter or I can not play the game. No email is
 received so that my account can not be verified at the https://www.elitedangerous.com/&nbsp; game server.&nbsp; If Microsoft does not want to fix the problem, I with terminate Windows all to gather.&nbsp; I have better things to do with my time and money than to tell a bunch
 of morons how&nbsp;to do their job correctly.&nbsp; I am looking for another programming language,&nbsp; that will protect my computer, not force advising on&nbsp;me.&nbsp; If this continues, I will sent Microsoft a weekly bill for the advertising&nbsp;they are sending me.&nbsp; Maybe this
 will wake someone up.. </p>

            Microsoft's Marketplace for Windows Mobile devices closed down a long time ago. You'll need to find apps in other places.<br />
<br />
You can still find apps for windows mobile devices, but <i><b>you won't find many of the more recent, hot apps like WhatsApps, Skype, Viber, etc,
</b></i>since developers are no longer creating new apps for the now discontinued windows mobile OS.&nbsp;
<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t download apps to Microsoft phone</h2>
                    I have had a Microsoft phone for several years. I bought an upgrade this year and can no longer download apps. After looking at solutions in older posts I realize I had Zune on previous phones. Went looking for it to learn it is no more. Tried suggestion
 in one post of factory reset and disable video upload. No success. Any answers out there?

<h2>            Moving folders in outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Let's start with this is about outlook.com not outlook within office. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I accidently moved 2 of my e-mail account folders under another folder and now it won't let me move it to the base. I don't want it under any other folder I want it as a main "Base" folder. When I try to move out from under the current folder to the base
 I get a pop up telling me "The folder couldn't be moved. A folder with the same name already exists." But the problem is it doesn't exist. I just, by mistake moved it under another folder and now all I can do is moved it under other folders. I don't want it
 under any folder I want it in the base line. </p>

            In the new Outlook Mail interface, create a new top-level folder with the same name as the subfolder. Then open the subfolder, select all the messages in it, and move the selection to the new top-level folder you created. When the move completes, delete
 the subfolder.

<div><span>I would describe my issue the same as the original questioner did. But my problem is, I don't want to generate an automatic table of contents, because I don't want to create headings based on Styles,&nbsp;</span>for stylistic reasons related to how I
 want to format either the table of contents itself or the overall document<span>. What I want is to create a table of contents manually but then add links allowing me to jump from one part of a document to another. I might want to add such links in places
 other than tables of contents too. Is that something you can do with bookmarks? It seems like hyperlinks have to link separate documents?</span></div>

            First you need to define a bookmark. To do this:
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>Place your cursor where you want the bookmark placed (or select some target text)</li><li>Do <i>Insert &nbsp;&gt; Bookmark </i>and name it (some characters are not allowed)</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>Once your bookmark is defined, you can refer to it:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>Select the source text (typically, something like "This is explained in <u>Chapter 8</u>."</li><li>Type <i>Command K</i></li><li>Select the <i>Document</i>&nbsp;tab</li><li>Click on the <i>Locate</i>&nbsp;button next to the&nbsp;<i>Anchor </i>field</li><li>Display the <i>Bookmarks</i>&nbsp;and select the target</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>Then, clicking on the hyperlink should take you to your destination within the same document.</div>

            <p>Your Office 365 Home subscription has nothing to do with your issue; Outlook is a mail client by which you can access your mailing service. It does not allow you to create addresses, just add account you have with a service provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What kind of mail account do you have with GoDaddy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you only bought a domain there, then you'll need to link it to a mail hosting provider to actually send email via that domain. GoDaddy offers this service and you can also get an Office 365 for Business subscription with Microsoft that contains Exchange
 Online. This is also available as a separate service;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Depending ont he region that you are in and how many custom addresses you need, you can also use Outlook.com Premium for this;
<a href="https://premium.outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://premium.outlook.com</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I'd contact GoDaddy first and ask what they have to offer you. They also resell Office 365 Exchange Online and can make the DNS changes for you if you are not comfortable with doing that yourself.</p>

<p>That is referring to the old Windows Live Custom Domain service. Outlook.com Premium is a new service that Microsoft is currently rolling out but isn't available world wide. Office 365 for Business Exchange Online is available world wide.</p>

    <title>Windows Defender Red X - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bhaydis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender Red X</h2>
                    So, my computer shows a red X on the Windows Defender icon in the notifications tray. But, when I open up Windows Defender, everything is fine. This has been going on continually since the April 18 Windows update. What gives? I've started ignoring the
 error message, but what if there IS an actual error? How will I know? What's the fix, Microsoft?

<p>What does the error message say? Anyways, if there is an issue, you may be able to fix it by doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Scan:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows key and type <strong>Command Prompt</strong>.</li><li>Right-click and choose <strong>Run as Administrator.</strong></li><li>Type "<strong>sfc</strong><strong>&nbsp;/</strong><strong>scannow</strong>"</li><li>You may run that a couple of times.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the previous steps don't fix anything (or even if they do), you can do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>In Command Prompt, type in "</span><span><strong>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth</strong>"</span></li><li><span>You can also type "</span><span><strong>DISM&nbsp;</strong></span><strong><span>/</span><span>Online</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>/</span><span>Cleanup</span><span>-</span><span>Image</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>/</span></strong><span><strong>RestoreHealth</strong>"</span></li><li><span>You can then run "<strong>sfc</strong><strong> /</strong><strong>scannow</strong>" again.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You could also use the troubleshooting tool if it isn't fixed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows key and type <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li><strong>Choose</strong> the correct box corresponding to your problem (or any additional problems)</li><li><strong>Follow</strong> the on-screen instructions for that troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p>Note: You could run the Windows Update troubleshooter as well, in case there was some corruption in Windows Update that caused your issue after the update.</p>

<p>I ran the first scan an no integrity errors were found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second suggestion came up with "No component store corruption detected. The operation completed successfully" and "[==========================100.0%==========================] The restore operation completed successfully.<br />
The operation completed successfully." The red X on the Windows Defender icon continues.<br />
</p>
<p>The issue is that the icon in the notifications tray shows the red X and when I hover over it, it says "Actions needed." Yet, when I open up Windows Defender, all the areas show green Xs and say there are no actions needed. So, the third suggestion above
 only takes me there where there's nothing to be troubleshot, even though the icon says there are actions needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-clicking on the choices when I click on the icon I get this error message: "Page not available. Your IT administrator has limited access to some areas of this app, and the item to tried to access is not available. Contact IT helpdesk for more information."
 Which makes no sense as this is a personal computer at home. I'm the IT department.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's got to be something with this April update causing this, as it never happened until then.</p>

<p><span>According to the updated documentation for the Windows Defender Security Center app, it looks like these messages would be generated when a page was hidden by Group Policy:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-security-center/windows-defender-security-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-security-center/windows-defender-security-center</span></a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So you can check to see what’s missing in the WDSC, and then check for the corresponding Group Policy setting or registry entry with the set of tutorials that was published by Shawn Brink, e.g.:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/99493-hide-virus-threat-protection-windows-defender-security-center.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/99493-hide-virus-threat-protection-windows-defender-security-center.html</span></a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this is the issue, and you’re using the Home version of Windows 10, then it looks like you should be able to just manually delete the problematic entry in the WDSC
<em>Policies</em> folder:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><p>I guess I'll just wait until it fixes itself. That's what happened before when I first updated the machine to the April update. I had the red X then it went away. Next day it was back.</p>

<p><span>That sounds like a good plan. If you’ve confirmed that each one of the pages will actually open up and display properly, then it’s most likely just a glitch (</span><span>y<span>ou might
 also want to check the availability of each one of the pages from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Security)</span></span><span>. If the issue persists, then you can file a “problem” report at the Feedback Hub. The lack of any response often makes this
 seem like an exercise in futility, but I’ve noticed that a couple of the minor issues that I’ve reported there actually have gotten fixed eventually, without ever being acknowledged.

    <title>Office 2013 Cursor Styles Changed&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pcrosby85  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2013 Cursor Styles Changed&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since the last update the cursor options in Office 2013 have changed styles, and it is very off putting. I can not screen shot the issue, because a when I use the Steps Recorder tool, it captures the cursor image as it should be, and not as it is? The cursors
 are larger, surrounded by a dashed line instead of a solid line, and are less responsive to certain tasks, like cell selection and drag and fill functions in Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office is not the only impacted application, as the cursor has become very large and dashed when hovering over any text field in a web browser (including Edge) and almost transparent when the mouse is used in non Microsoft apps running in windowed mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have turned pointer shadows on and off, to no avail, and tried several different pointer styles, also to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have inserted an example of what the drag and drop cursor should look like in Excel. Imagine the existing cursor about 150% larger, and made of dashed lines instead of solid fill.</p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>Have you already redeemed Office 2016 with your Microsoft Account?
</span></span></li><li><span><span>If not, then are you referring to </span><a href="http://office.com/setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://office.com/setup</span></a><span> and trying to redeem the Product Key? If not, are you trying to
 activate/re-activate Office 2016 from the My Account page? </span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you are trying to redeem your Product Key then you may follow these steps:
<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">T</span><span>ry redeeming Office 2016 using the InPrivate browsing mode from IE.

            The best way to set this up is to make sure all the files are in the same folder with the PowerPoint file before inserting the hyperlinks.<br />
<br />
One thing you can try now is to open the original file on your computer, go to the Office button &gt; Publish &gt; Package for CD. You can save the presentation to a folder that should be movable. See this for some caveats about this:<br />
<br />
Package for CD breaks links, loses animations in my 2007 presentation file<br />

<p>You can find the your device Mac address in Wifi settings. So start Connection Manager and launch Wifi and click Settings - Wlan Settings - Connection status. Scroll down and you will see the MAC address.</p>

<h2>            Auto populate the User Name field when signing for Yammer</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
We have migrated our network from public to office 365 and integration with ADFS 2.0 is working as expected i.e. within office, users are directly taken to the Yammer group page.</p>
<p><br />
we followed the Technet article (<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/4184.ad-fs-2-0-auto-populate-the-username-field-of-the-forms-sign-in-page-when-signing-in-to-office-365.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/4184.ad-fs-2-0-auto-populate-the-username-field-of-the-forms-sign-in-page-when-signing-in-to-office-365.aspx</a>)
 to auto populate the email address when user is connecting to Office 365 via iPad or iPhone.</p>
<p>This also worked perfectly fine!</p>
<p><br />
However in case of Yammer SSO, behavior on iPhone and iPad is little different as user has to first enter the email address at Yammer home page and then same information needs to be entered to ADFS authentication page.</p>
<p><br />
Is this something that can be tweaked so that email address is auto populated like we have for Office 365?</p>
<p><br />
Do we need to make some changes to our ADFS setup for token and claims?</p>
<p><br />
We are using Azure AD Connect with ADFS 2.0.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help in advance.</p>

<p>Hello Neeraj,</p>
<p>As previously mentioned on my private message, your Yammer network is free. SSO networks can only be enabled on enterprise networks. Upon checking, Yammer does not support the coding on the link you provided like in O365 (powershell). You may want to explore
 caching options on your browser to see if you can obtain the desired result.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Thanks John!</p>
<p>Appreciate your help on this.</p>
<p>Sorry about the typo in the domain name but we are already on enterprise licensing as mentioned in my original post. The user's were finding different behavior when signing into O365 (email already populated) and Yammer (need to enter email twice) hence
 I created this thread.</p>
<p>I still have one question and would like to understand in which all scenarios we should be configuring ADFS to accept token from Yammer as I see notes from different users that we need to do that however my authentication to Yammer is still working fine
 without adding any Yammer configuration related to tokens / claims.</p>
<p>Regards, Neeraj</p>

<p>Hello Neeraj,</p>
<p>I did not understand what the question is. Could you please rephrase it so that I can provide an appropriate answer?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
