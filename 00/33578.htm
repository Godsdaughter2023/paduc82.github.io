<h2>            Lost access to shared file on Windows 7 PC</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 10 laptop that I run on my home wi-fi.&nbsp; I also have a Windows 7 PC that is hardwired to the wireless router.&nbsp; Up until this last Windows 10 update (v1803), I have been successful in accessing from my Win10 Laptop&nbsp;the drives on the Win7 PC
 which was running Home Group.&nbsp;The Win10 Laptop was part of the Home Group, but Home Group has been removed from Win10.&nbsp; Now I cannot access the files on the Win7 PC&nbsp;from the Win10&nbsp;Laptop.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The Win7 PC appears in the Network list of computers on the Win10 Laptop; however, when I click to expand it, I get the error message:&nbsp; "Windows cannot access …" followed by the computer name. When&nbsp;I run Diagnostics, I get the message "Troubleshooting couldn't
 identify the problem"</li><li>I can ping the Win7 PC from the Win10 Laptop using the Win7 PC IP address and when using the Win7 PC name</li><li>The Win7 PC appears in the device list of my router.</li><li>I&nbsp;have Internet access from the Win10 Laptop.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have "left" the Home Group on the Win7 PC.</li><li>I have turned on file and print sharing for all network types (private, home, public) on both computers.&nbsp;
</li><li>In my Norton Security Firewall on the Win7 PC:
<ul>
<li>I have "trusted" the Win10 Laptop </li><li>I have "allowed" network discovery and File and Print Sharing in Public Exceptions</li><li>I have set the network adapter to "Full Trust"</li></ul>
</li><li>I've verified that the IP address of each computer is correct -- they are both static addresses; and I've checked everywhere this info is stored.</li><li>I have restarted both computers numerous times, allowed them to "settle out" before trying the connection; but no luck.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>Have been working on this for several hours now.&nbsp; Does anyone have any ideas on what else I can try to make this work again?</p>

            Hi CLJ.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />They've repeatedly broken WIndows networking since removing the HomeGroup in Version 1803.  I've compiled all steps that are working to fix it, including the latest issue with Windows 7 sharing below:  
<br />
<br />Go over these steps to make sure File Sharing is set up correctly:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>
<br />

<br />
<br />If Windows 7 is involved make sure if applicable you have the WIndows Update released to fix Windows 7 sharing issues here:  <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-releases-kb4487345-update-to-fix-windows-7-share-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft...</a>
<br />
<br />You may want to change to sharing via OneDrive:  <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3256907/microsoft-windows/how-to-use-onedrive-in-windows-10-to-sync-and-share-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.computerworld.com/article/3256907/m...</a>
<br />  
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p><span><span>Hello Kuppie,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>What
 is the security software installed on your computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>What
 happens when you try to do Windows update on your computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check if you are able to start the Windows Defender service on your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 on Start and type ‘services.msc’ in the search field.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open
 the services panel and look for the Windows Defender service.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Right
 click and start the service.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest that you boot your computer to ‘Safe Mode with Networking’ and run a full scan with the Antivirus installed on your computer. You can follow
 the below steps to boot the computer to ‘Safe Mode’ :</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Restart
 your computer if it is powered on.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Tap
 the F8 key after your computer initially powers on.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Once
 you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Use
 the up/down arrow keys to highlight your selection.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Select
 Safe Mode with Networking and press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Logon
 to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If this is caused recently on your computer, I suggest that you do a System Restore on your computer. You can follow the below steps to do a System
 Restore: </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 Start, type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in the Programs list.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>If
 you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>In
 the System Restore dialog box, click Choose a different restore point, and then click Next.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>In
 the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click Next.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 Finish.</span></span></p>

<p>Sounds like the save might be corrupted. &nbsp;He might have to start over. &nbsp;If this happens through the new play through, I would uninstall the game and reinstall it. Sorry.

<p>It should tell you if the save file is corrupted when loading. &nbsp; Go ahead and delete the game and redownload before deleting the save file.... &nbsp;Or, try starting a new game under a different save file.....Otherwise, you could try clearing your cache 3 times.
 &nbsp;GOOD LUCK!!!!</p>

<p>Hi there, I would suggest moving the save data to a USB before doing anything.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Once you've got that data then delete the game from the HDD and re-download from your download history and see if you can then reload the save from the USB.</p>

    <title>Disk space keeps filling up after joining homegroup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelforbush  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disk space keeps filling up after joining homegroup</h2>
                    <p>I joined my laptop to my homegroup&nbsp; in order to watch movies saved on my desk computer that has much more space. Suddenly the disk drive free space began to disappear. After being prompted to use some software called TreeSize I was able to figure out that
 the laptop was downloading the movies onto my drive - which is too small obviously. I tried to access the folder that they are being saved in, and it says that I don't have permission. But, I am the administrator - so I should have access. Even if I am able
 to delete these files, I would still like to know the setting I should change so that these files don't start downloading again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            My suggestion would be to not use the <em>Homegroup</em> functionality. If both computers are on the same network, you might want to try and share the drive or folder using Windows' default sharing platform. (If they are on a separate drive from whatever
 else is on your desktop computer, then this is very easy.) On the desktop computer, right click on the folder or drive where the movies are located, then go to
<em>Properties</em>. If they are in different places on your machine, right click on the most specific folder that contains all of your movies. From there, click on the
<em>Sharing</em> tab, then click on <em>Share</em>. Pick a share name. This share name is what the shared folder will be named in your&nbsp;<em>Network</em> tab on your laptop. Then just click
<em>OK</em>. On your laptop, go to <em>Network</em>, and then click on the name of the computer in the listing there. If you don't know your computer name, on the desktop, go to (My)&nbsp;<em>Computer</em> in an Explorer window, and then click on
<em>System properties</em>. If you scroll down to near the end, the computer name should be listed under
<em>Computer name</em>. Then, click on the folder with the name that you chose when you put in the share name on the desktop. Hopefully, your movies will be there.<br />
<br />
Additionally, on your laptop, to disable the <em>Homegroup</em> feature, go to the page where you set up the homegroup. In a blue link near the bottom of the page, there should be a
<em>Delete this homegroup</em> or a <em>Remove this computer from the homegroup</em> option. (...or something along those lines, I'm not as proficient with Windows 10 as I am with Windows 7.)<br />
<br />
If you have any problems with this or the sharing functionality, please let me know. I'm happy to help with what I can!<br />

<p>I actually figured out what happened. Although, I don't understand how it happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow "Sync Center" was activated and the computers started syncing the video library.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After learning about Sync Center I was able to delete the files that had already been transferred and then disable it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That could be a nice thing to use, but not for video files on my laptop!</p>

<p>In regard to using the folder sharing - that was how I had done it before I attempted to use Homegroup. I found by using the homegroup setup I was able to use the media streaming with the TV. I couldn't figure out how to get the smart TV to find the folders
 otherwise. None of this seemed to be straight forward, so I just needed to try the different options and see what worked.</p>

<p>Yeah - I believe that Windows Sharing only works between Windows computers. At least of what I've tried - my network has never seemed to work with intra-network connections.</p>

<p>I really didn't want to type this all up but on the small chance of my issue being resolved quicker... here goes.</p>
<p>I love Xbox. I've been a player for over a decade and a total advocate for this brand. This is why it is quite frustrating to me when i am on the end of some shabby service.</p>
<p>I lined up at midnight to collect my pre-ordered Xbox One Day One console. I came to discover that my day one controller had a faulty trigger so i started a service request on xbox.com to get it replaced. I entered all my details and was sent an email with
 instructions to ship the faulty controller away (service request #<span>1224884986)</span>. These instructions included how to pack and ship back to Microsoft for free:</p>
<p><span><strong><span>Ship us the Product<br />
<br />
</span></strong>Send the non-working&nbsp;<span>Xbox</span>&nbsp;product to our service center using Australia Post for free shipping.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />

<p><span>I followed the instructions, packed up the box and went to Australia Post on November 28 to ship off the controller. Australia Post said they could not send this for free as i did not have a reply paid address or some kind of barcode with free shipping
 information (not provided in the instructions). I reluctantly then paid to ship the controller away in the interest of expediency.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I phoned xbox support that night with my service request number to tell them that I had to pay for shipping and I would like to be somehow compensated for this. They agreed that someone would phone me back "within a few days".
<span>I was not contacted.</span></span></p>
<span>I was not contacted.</span></span></p>
<p>I received back in the mail a new controller (not day one) to replace the faulty day one.. i assumed this would happen so fine.</p>
<p>On December 12 i began an online chat with Arthur who apologised "<span>f<em>or the long time frame that you have to wait to have a resolution for this</em></span>". He made a new service request number -
<b>1226976274</b>&nbsp;and was told he "<span><em>successfully escalated it and I modified the status of the case that will surely make our Advocacy Team contact you within 2 days via email preferably</em>" and "<span><em>I am putting my reputation on this to assure
 that they will contact you to put a resolution on your issue</em>". &nbsp;</span><span>I was not contacted.</span></span></p>
<p>On December 16 i began an online chat with Rex C. I was told it was "<span><em>currently been handled by our level 3 of support"</em>
<span>and "<span><em>it has been escalated to our highest level of support</em>" and "<em>apologized if they have not reached out yet. They are currently reviewing the request now. Please allow 24 hour turn around time regarding your refund request</em>."
<span>and "<span><em>it has been escalated to our highest level of support</em>" and "<em>apologized if they have not reached out yet. They are currently reviewing the request now. Please allow 24 hour turn around time regarding your refund request</em>."
<span>Again,&nbsp;I was not contacted.</span></span></span></span></p>
<span>Again,&nbsp;I was not contacted.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>On December 17 i began an online chat with Jake asking for an update. He told me "<span><em>The given time frame for this to be completed is 7 days starting on the day of the process...<span>expect an email message confirming that the refund has been
 successfully done tomorrow</span></em>" Why then was I told 2 days on the first instance? and that time had certainly lapsed since the request began on the 28 November. "<span><em>I can guarantee you that you'll be refunded on this matter. We got your back
 on this case. The whole Microsoft team. Let me assure you once again that I will be the last chat agent to settle this.</em>"
<span>Yet again,&nbsp;I was not contacted.</span></span></span></span></p>
<span>Yet again,&nbsp;I was not contacted.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>On December 19 i began an online chat with Yuki who passed on the request to the phone support team to call me. They called within a minute (not sure of rep name) and immediately asked for my phone number to ring me back "<em>in case we
 get disconnected</em>" which i provided. I then gave him the details of the service request, he then put me on hold and then the phone call was disconnected after about a minute.
<span>He did not phone back</span>.</span></span></span></p>
<span>He did not phone back</span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I waited an hour then i opened a new chat with a rep named Jerome. He told me "<span><em>our Advocacy team are working on it for the finalization as we chat right now</em>" i was told it was very possible the job would be completed in the
 next few minutes.. then was told "<span>rest assured that you'll be notified by us within today or 24 hours"
<span>This did not occur.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<span>This did not occur.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>I waited another day or so and decided to again phone the xbox support team. I asked to be put through to a manager who identified that I was clearly having a bad time with them, but was essentially powerless to directly talk to the advocacy team or to resolve
 the issue himself. He told me someone would contact me within 24-48 hours. <span>
This did not occur.</span></p>
<p>On December 26 i was sent an email from Charisse from the Customer Advocacy Team who told me they "<em>are unable to refund the shipping fee when accessories are shipped to us."
</em>I was then offered a 3 month xbox live code (I was guaranteed a refund and I already have 12 months subscription on my console so not really helpful!). I would have been happy with a credit on the xbox marketplace (which i suggested to try and expididite
 things). I replied same day to ask for an alternate offer.</p>
<p><span>I was contacted on December 29 by Jack from the Advocacy team asking me for photos of 1. my xbox one purchase receipt 2. the console box and 3. the serial number on the console. I provided these photos the following day (now a week ago).<span>
 I have had no reply back.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Today I opened an online chat and was told that I should expect a response after 7 working days. This whole interaction has been a complete joke and a total waste of my time (i estimate 5 or 6 hours of being on the phone or online chats). &nbsp;I've been
 promised time and time, and time again that someone would contact me within X amount of time.. and not once has that occurred.
<strong>This has now been going on for 5 weeks.</strong> I make this post in the hopes that 1. my issue will be resolved and 2. support teams can be trained on giving realistic expectations to customers so they dont make promises they can't keep.</span></p>
<p><span>If you made it through the whole post thanks for reading my whinge. I really don't like doing this but hopefully this feedback can improve the experience for others.</span></p>
<p><span>Cheers,</span></p>
<p><span>Mark</span></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I'm in a similar situation. After losing a 3 hour battle to get an advanced exchange for my day one controller, I mailed it in on November 24th. Two weeks later, I called MS support to see where they're at in the process; no update, however,
 they did say they would call me back for a follow up to see if everything is ok - no phone call ever. A week later I called to see what's up and they told me the service order was cancelled, but didn't know why. They escalated the case to Advocacy and said
 to wait a week for them to contact me. A week later no contact and I called in, they told me to wait a week and they would follow up with me - never did they follow up. I called back yesterday to see what's up and they said nothing yet. I asked to speak to
 a supervisor and they put me through to one. That guy told me he would personally look into this and speak to some "Ranger" and find my controller and get one shipped out ASAP, but it would take probably a week. And here I am, no controller, no reinsurance,
 nothing. All of this would have been avoided if I could've got the advance exchange like I wanted in the first place.</p>

<p>I'm having exact same problem but with the console itself. First one had a faulty hdmi connection, I done the advance exchange and had a replacement sent(great service very quick and eficient) then the fun started, the exchange units hdd whines very loudly
 and constantly when powered on. 3 weeks later 6 phone calls, 3 online chats 1 manager and I'm still only being told that I have to wait 4 days for the advocate team to e-mail me. It will soon be more than 1 month since the first complaint. I did not spend
 £450 on a console that does not do what it's supposed to. Angry is an understatement at this point. The case number is #1235032795 so if anyone from this anonymous advocate team does happen to see this then CONTACT ME.

<p>Just an opinion, please make the service repair transaction fast and quick. Especially the issuance of shipment label. Common complain from most of the customers. This must be given so much attention for customer's sake. Thank you. My suggestion is all for
 good for the customers and the Microsoft. </p>

<p>I'm having a similar issue!! They do not respond by chat, by phone, nor by email. My kinects, still under warrantee, has broken down for the second time in the 4 months since we purchased the new xboxone for our grandson. Put in the service order request
 about 3 weeks ago. The support just shows "Order in Progress" but no email confirmation with shipping instructions!! They don't answer or return my calls, they don't answer chat requests, nor emails!! I guess once they get your money they don't care. They
 rank at the top for crappy service.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>I have same question as above, but your reply did not answer their question. &nbsp;The question is --- when I am sharing my screen -is there a way to have my mouse cursor be view-able by all viewers. &nbsp;This is especially important when showing complicated slides
 over S4B and you need to point something out. &nbsp;If not capable - this is a big gap in S4Bs potential and seems like an oversight. &nbsp;Presenters need some way to have an active pointer on their screen that everyone else can see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Win 10 extremely slow boot after April 2018 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> russellbryson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 extremely slow boot after April 2018 update</h2>
                    When will Microsoft address the extremely slow boot time we experience since the "feature" update from version 1709 to 1803? My computer is unusable for 10 minutes or longer when I boot. Even sleep mode is slow and the computer is unstable for a few minutes
 after waking up.

            Hi Russell.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can roll back Version 1803 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased a Microsoft Surface about 2 months ago. Since about two weeks ago, the blue screen has been appearing about once or twice every day, causing my computer to restart and says "Critical_Process_Died"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering why this keeps happening, especially&nbsp;on a brand new computer, and am looking for any advice or tips.

<h2>            ERROR CODE&#58; 80070026</h2>
                    Windows Vista update KB973917 will not install. I have tried several times, several different days. It downloads, but I get the error code 80070026 after the attempt to install. I have tried to install in safe-mode(saving to my desktop), but it won't allow
 that operation in safe-mode. This update was successful in Dec. '09, but I read that they re-released in March because of some problem that was found. Would they use the same KB number for a new update? Anyway, It shows up as a successful install in December,
 but now it keeps calling for me to install. Anybody have an easy fix? .......I'm no computer guru, so I don't like messing with the registry.

<br />
I was just wondering if it is necessary to create separate computer groups for the x86 and x64 bit versions of each OS, or if only having a computer group per OS will do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on what is the best approach?<br />

            <p>Hi Sudhir, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft Community Forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer few questions to narrow down the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the exact issue that you are facing? </p>
<p>2. What is the make and model of the computer? </p>
<p>3. Do you get any error messages? </p>
<p>4. From where exactly have you extracted the troubleshooting steps provided in your post?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A driver is software that allows your computer to communicate with hardware or devices. Without drivers, the hardware you connect to your computer—for example, a video card or a printer—won't work properly.
</p>
<p>
Uninstall the particular graphics driver, restart the PC, install the drivers and software, and restart the PC and check.

            <p>Unfortunately I had to seek outside support because of changes made to my computer that caused the deletion of Windows Installer.I amm unsure of what was done except setting up another account and downloading Installer Package for Windows Vista SP2 64 Bit.
 I do appreciate your advice if the installer showed as installed but corrupted I could've,would've used your suggestions .Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Notifications are usually gone before I can read them. Is there a way to delay them&#63;</h2>
                    I would really like to have the taskbar notifications remain on the screen for 15 seconds to give me a chance to break off from whatever else I'm doing, turn around, and refocus on the left-hand monitor where they pop up. Is there a way to do this? Right
 now I turn around and 9 times out of 10 I'm just in time to see the notification fade away. That gets very frustrating.

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, the notification is set to show for at least 5 seconds. But you can modify it and have the notifications display or remain for at most five minutes. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>, then click <strong>Ease of Access</strong>.</li><li>In the left pane, click <strong>Other options</strong>.</li><li>Under <em>Visual options</em>, locate <strong>Show notifications for</strong>.</li><li>Click the drop-down arrow and adjust the time as you desired.</li></ol>

<p><em><span>To do so: Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might
 occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how
 to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</span></em></p>

<p>Hi Maynard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why this issue occurs is due to corrupted system files, or software conflicts. As an initial troubleshooting, we recommend that you perform a
<strong>Startup</strong> <strong>Repair</strong> in <strong>Windows</strong> through the
<strong>Windows</strong> <strong>Recovery</strong> <strong>Environment</strong>. To do this, kindly follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><strong>Improper shutdown process</strong>.<br />
<br />
</span>-Turn on your computer. When the Windows logo is visible, unplug the power source of your computer. Perform this step three times.
<span><br />
</span>-On the fourth time that you turn on your computer, just simply wait for the
<strong>Windows</strong><strong> Recovery</strong><strong> Environment</strong> (<strong>WinRE</strong>) window to appear.
<span><br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>The Automatic Repair screen will appear, </span>
<span>select </span><span><strong>Advanced options.</strong></span></li><li><span>On the <strong>Choose</strong><strong> an </strong>
<strong>option</strong> screen, select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Advanced options</strong>, then select </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Startup repair</span>. This process will replace or fix what is broken with your startup<span> system.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please post back with the result.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><br />

<p>Hi, thanks so much for trying to help me. I have an HP s5212y desktop pc. I did try another mouse and keyboard</p>
<p>however the results have been the same. I can get to the Recovery screen and am given two options, "See</p>
<p>advanced repair options" or "Restart my PC". But again neither mouse nor keypad allow me to select an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem occured after an automatic download from Windows 10. I have another desktop and laptop as&nbsp;</p>
<p>well as a windows phone running Windows 10 and can't recall ever having any problems with them so far, in</p>
<p>fact I was wondering why so many people complain about Windows OS, that is until now. I am not ready to</p>
<p>give up on Windows yet, but I am a bit frustrated at the moment. I never really cared for this desktop very much</p>
<p>but can't afford to buy another one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen a number of complaints over this very issue. Do you know if Microsoft is taking any steps to correct</p>
<p>this situation?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again thanks so much for your help and I'm really hoping we can resolve this issue.</p>

    <title>Battlefield Bad Company 2 VIP Maps Not Available to Download - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Battlefield Bad Company 2 VIP Maps Not Available to Download</h2>
                    
<p>Anyone who has the Battlefield BC2 VIP item is supposed to have access to eight VIP map packs.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these do not seem to be on the Xbox Live servers anymore.</p>
<p>It does not matter if you had VIP access from long ago (as I did) or if you just added it now.</p>
<p>The GwG version of the game recognizes that I have VIP access, but does NOT show any of the VIP content as available to download in the in-game store (which is where you are supposed to download the VIP items). Oddly enough I can download a trailer of some
 of the VIP maps, but not the maps themselves.</p>
<p>Considering that the VIP packs more than double the maps and modes that come with the game, it would be great to see those restored. This way everyone with VIP access can update their downloaded version of the game. Otherwise, it makes for fragmented MP
 communities as the only people who still have those maps are those that did not delete previous downloads.</p>
<p>For those curious, details on the VIP packs can be found on the official game site:</p>

<p>Misses Quinzel, I think you've misunderstood the question.</p>
<p>The VIP pass is like a season pass. Those who have it, are supposed to have certain maps and modes available in-game.</p>
<p>These items certainly should be available, as even when items are delisted (such as arcade games), those who still have an entitlement to use them are allowed to re-download.</p>

<p>It's not a seasons pass </p>
<p>It was a code only given when a game was new for online and extra Dlc</p>
<p>However publishera still retain the right to discontinue offering content as per international copyright laws</p>
<p>Publishers can decide to discontinue services as they see fit and it is not needed for core part of the game</p>
<p>As ms is not the publisher you will have to ask the publisher for access to the discontinued service</p>

    <title>Game DVR for Xbox 360&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Game DVR for Xbox 360&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>do you think they will make a game dvr for xbox 360? It could be nice to record the game in the cloud only and edit it from your PC instead of having a full app like Xbox One. I would like to record some Xbox 360 video, but I don't have te equipment for
 that.</p>
<p>Vote for my idea plz&nbsp;: <a href="http://xbox.uservoice.com/forums/251650-console-accessories/suggestions/6076386-game-dvr-on-xbox-360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Does the 360 even have the hardware for this? plus Microsoft wants you to get the One so i don't think they will take game DVR from the One to 360</p>

<p>The reason why you can record gameplay on the Xbox One is because the One was designed to be able to do it from the get go.&nbsp; The Xbox Box One reserves two of its processor cores for background apps and about 3GB of its 8GB of RAM.&nbsp; In contrast, the Xbox
 360 has no such extra free resources&nbsp;to call&nbsp;upon.&nbsp;&nbsp;All of it's processing power and RAM - 512MB of it, is devoted to running games.
<br />
<br />
There not a chance there will ever be a game DVR on the Xbox One.&nbsp; The console simply doesn't have the processing power or the memory.</p>

<p>You can find a DVR for a VERY decent price......... &nbsp;Shop around.</p>
<p>Seems like this idea is not going to happen because of the console itself.....</p>
<p>Many others use a third party capture device for all consoles. &nbsp;If you don't have the equipement, I suggest saving up for a while.

<p>Good Luck!!!</p>

<ol>
<li><span>Have you made any recent changes on the computer?</span>
</li><li><span>Do you receive all the error messages when updating AVG security software on the computer?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The MSI engine is related to the Windows installer service on the computer I would suggest that you refer the article below and try
 the steps mentioned, check if it helps.</span></p>
