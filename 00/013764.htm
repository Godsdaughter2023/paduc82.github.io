    <title>Can the automatic cursor labels be turned off&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulpiano  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can the automatic cursor labels be turned off&#63; Please&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Is there any way to turn off those annoying little yellow boxes that appear and tell you all sorts of useless information like "Plot Area" or "Chart Area" when you pass the cursor over charts? I find it extremely annoying, it makes the raw charts essentially
 unusable in presentations, and most disturbing, the boxes often get stuck on the screen, remaining visible even when switching to different sheets or windows within XL. Sometimes the only way I can get rid of them is to quite XL altogether and then restart/reopen
 the document. PLEASE tell me there is someway to get rid of this!

    <title>Word 2010, unable to change page size - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smallen618  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010, unable to change page size</h2>
                    I was typing in Word 2010 and apparently hit some keystroke that set my page size to a width of 19 inches and pushed the vertical ruler off the left hand side of the window.&nbsp; It doesn't matter what view I'm in the page size stays the same.&nbsp; I tried changing
 the page back to letter and manually set page size to other, selecting 8.5x11, portrait.&nbsp; This didn't change anything.&nbsp; I checked the options and it's set correctly.&nbsp; I deleted normal.dotm.&nbsp; I deleted the registry keys for margin.&nbsp; Nothing will change the
 page size. Any help I can get would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; At present, this prevents me from printing anything I work on.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

            <p>If you haven't gotten an error message ("Settings you chose for the left and right margins, column spacing, or paragraph indents are too large for the page width in some sections.") when you changed the paper size back to Letter, then you probably have succeeded
 in changing it, and the issue is with your display. Perhaps you have somehow changed the unit of measurement to centimeters or "character units" (see
<span><a href="http://www.gmayor.com/Character_Units.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">http://www.gmayor.com/Character_Units.htm</font></a>); this, together with a change in Zoom ratio, might produce the effect
 you describe.</span></p>

                    I signed up for an Outlook account at the end of January. I left emails I wanted to keep in my inbox, and noticed today (4/15/13) that every email in my inbox with a date of 3/28/13 or earlier is now gone. My sent emails are still present, although I'm
 worried mentioning this may jeopardize them. I did not delete the missing emails from my inbox. I REPEAT, I DID NOT DELETE THE MISSING EMAILS FROM MY INBOX! I have looked through this discussion board, and every pseudo-answer starts with the answerer instructing
 on how to recover emails the user deleted. AGAIN, I DID NOT DELETE THE MISSING EMAILS FROM MY INBOX! I have been unable to locate any account setting or policy statement that says that emails beyond a certain age are automatically deleted by Microsoft. However,
 this appears to be the case, or there was a data loss on the part of Microsoft around the end of March that must be to blame. Everyone who questions the loss of their emails notices that they only go back to the last week or so of March. What happened? Is
 there any way to keep this from happening again? Is there some stealth account setting that can explain this behavior, and if so, how do I disable it?<br />

            <p>Hello, RandomRickM,</p>
<p>Do you see a POP folder in folders menu?</p>
<p>Check there for messages</p>
<p>Do you have a scheduled "clean up" or rules for sorting messages?</p>
<p>Messages may have inadvertently been set up to be deleted after 10 days using "clean up".</p>
<p>Delete the Message Sort rule:</p>
<p>1. Login your account and go to your mailbox.</p>
<p><span>2. Click <b>Options </b>then <b>More options…</b></span></p>
<p><span>3. Under “Customizing Hotmail”, click<b> Rules for sorting new messages.</b></span></p>
<p><span>4. Find the rule then click the check box.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click <b>Delete.</b> <b><br />
</b></span></p>
<p>If some of your email seems to be missing, a feature called conversation threading may be turned on. Conversation threading groups together all email with the same subject line. You only see the most recent email in your inbox or other folders.
 Click on the email, and all the email in that thread will appear in the preview pane.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect Microsoft Phone with my Windows 10 PC.</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to connect my Lumia 550 Microsoft phone (with windows 10 OS) to my Windows 10 computer without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On system try in the hardware remove tool my device appears and is also recognized as "Lumia 550 (RM-1127)".&nbsp;In the "Devices and Printers" my device is listed as "Unspecified" but with a proper name. And that means my device is recognized.</p>
<p>In Device Manager my Phone is listed under "Other devices" with a yellow exclamation mark beside it and driver details reads "No driver files are required or have been loaded for this device."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the methods I tried:</p>
<p>- Using different cables and USB ports</p>
<p>- Using the troubleshooter</p>
<p>- Uninstalling the driver software</p>
<p>- Using the auto-driver update in device manager</p>
<p>- Manually updating the driver, but apparently I'm missing the MTC and can't install it</p>
<p>- Downloading and installing manually the old WinUSB Device from Microsoft Update Center</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having this issue for about a year now. Any help is appreciated, I'm clueless where is it even going wrong.</p>

            <p>I couldn't manage to extract the .inf file, and the ones I found online did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I've found a solution to my problem. Apparently my windows version was Windows 10 Pro N and the missing driver (Media Transfer Protocol I presume) was to find in the Media Feature Pack and nowhere else. Also outdated versions of this Media Feature
 Pack were also available on the official Microsoft website to make it harder. Horrible design I must say, but the problem was solved so case is closed.</p>

<h2>            Error code 0x800704EC  appears every time I attempt opening Windows Store &#40;using Insider Preview Build 10525&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I get a "Store App is blocked",&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please check with your administrator" along with error code 0x800704EC.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I looked this code up,&nbsp; all I see is reference to Windows Defender within Win8.&nbsp;&nbsp; I deliberately turned off ALL security to see if a fix had
 something to do with this.</p>
<p>Alas,&nbsp; nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not believe this has anything to do with the Insider Preview, but would be happily corrected if I'm wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice?&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't believe MS let this issue slip with all the beta testing over the last year.&nbsp; I had a similar issue with Cortana not working the day after the initial upgrade to win10.&nbsp; This has apparently been rectified by Build 10525, and has worked
 since its installation.</p>

            Hi,
<br />     If you try the following:
<br />
<br />1) Right-click on a file that uses the file type you'd like to change the default for. For example, one with a .jpg extension (a photo).
<br />
<br />2) Click on Get Info in the pop-up.
<br />
<br />3) Click Open With if the section isn't already expanded.
<br />
<br />4) Click the drop-down and choose Excel.
<br />
<br />Voila! From now on, all those file types should automatically open in Excel.
<br />
<br />Thanks       
        </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Activation Issues</h2>
                    Running windows 10 insider preview on both laptop and desktop since build 10049. both drives failed, both were copied over, both are on 10547 currently. The Laptop still has the old Windows 7 information on it, where at the desktop does not have the old
 8.1 on it anymore as it was deleted to clear space. both are now saying to activate windows 10. I have tried to activate it on both and it is not allowing me. the laptop does not give me the roll back option anymore. Reinstalling the old operating systems
 from scratch is not an option. When i signed up for the preview builds, it was supposed to be where these would be activated. How do we correct this issues.&nbsp;

            Seeing that you just signed up, did you use the original MSA on both system that you joined up with, &nbsp;what you signed in here &nbsp;shows no activity, and the preview needs to be on the internet and with the original account that you started with.

            Just signed up for this forum. However, both are still on the same MSA for both systems since the 10049 build. They are on two separate accounts, the laptop on my personal MSA and the desktop on my "business" oriented MSA. Everything was fine with both
 systems till both drives failed and were cloned to a new drive. Both are currently online. I am on the laptop as we speak.&nbsp;

<p>Would you mind explaining for the benefit of us inexperienced ones how to clone failed drives to new ones? What builds were you running when they failed ... and, were they activated?

</blockquote>
<p>I guess I missed the "it was supposed to be where these would be activated" info; however, I did see the warning (among others) that each insider should take care to have on hand a method of returning to his/her licensed operating system, whether it be the
 install disc or a disc image type backup. (With the disc image type backup, one can, in about 10 minutes, return to their licensed OS, complete with all installed programs as of the time the image was made.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some, of course, felt that they didn't need to read that stuff. Now, many of them are looking for ways around the activation rules by telling sad, sometimes doubtful, stories, and, then, posing questions such as, "How do we correct this issues?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>For ones who chose not to read/heed the warnings beforehand, and/or just didn't bother to keep up with the preview builds as they had agreed to do, licenses are available for purchase, to correct their issues.</p>

            Both were on build 10240 when my hard drives failed. And the purpose of cloning a drive, it creates an exact bit by bit copy of one drive to another. essentially its an identical copy of your current drive. I do this almost every time my drives go out
 when I can. That way I don't have to redownload and reinstall all the software and drivers and everything else onto a new drive in the event some of my software licenses are no longer possible to find. Yes, i have programs to extract them, however, spending
 6-8 hours letting a drive clone over vice reinstall an operating system on a new drive, searching for and downloading all the drivers for the current hardware and then running updates for hours on end and reinstalling everything, which can take a lot longer
 than cloning. And its pretty simple. theres free software out there where you can just point and click and it copies the drive to another drive. Yes, both were activated when the drives failed however.&nbsp;

            Where it said that people who participated in the Windows 10 beta would have their licenses activated fully when the distro dropped. They also said that you would be able to roll back to the previous operating system given the old info was still on the
 PC, which in my case it is, and the roll back option isn't there. On another note, my preview builds are kept up to date. so unless you have something useful to say. try not saying anything at all. :-)

<p>So let's see you made clones before both HD crashed (strange that two hard drives would crash at the same time), when you make the clones were they both on 10240 and active? as &nbsp;for returning to your previous build it was posted to make a restore/recover
 media as anything on the hard drive may be deleted, and as for old info on the PC well that was only for the RTM version and only for 30 days after the upgrade to win10, as for the fully activated that was all changed in July yep it was posted.</p>

<p>Yes, I understand the purpose of cloning a drive .... what I was hoping for is an explanation of how to clone a "failed drive" to a new one that will work. If a drive can be cloned, is it really a "failed" drive?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Everything was fine with both systems till both drives failed and were cloned to a new drive."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just was a little surprised that the drives on both of your machines failed at the same time, and that you were able to clone both failed drives to new ones, and make them both work, while losing the activation of both machines in the process.</p>

            Both systems were working fine. Both however were on Seagate drives, which have a high failure rate as it is. The laptop, the drive has been in it since i got it back in 2011. The Desktop basically came with a shoddy hard drive. Yes, both were activated
 at the time, both were on the Win 10 Insider Pro version at the time as well. Now its on the Home version, not sure if that will make a difference. However, just cause a drive has failed or is failing doesn't mean the data cant be recovered. The drive just
 is unable to run the operating system either due to the disks being screwed up or something else wrong with it. Cloning the drive just moves over the existing data. Some of which as for the OS can be corrupted or some files being damaged, but that isn't always
 the case. at which point a basic chkdsk /f and sfc /scannow typically can and will fix. But no, the cloned drives were not done prior to the failure. One was just cloned to a new 500gb drive, while the other was cloned to a SSD.

<p>The mystery deepens ... how would cloning your failed drive to a new one, and running the programs to find and correct file errors, change the OS version from Pro to Home? Did you try to force activation? If so, that kills it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft activates a machine based on identifying the motherboard, etc., and that information is stored in the activation server. After activation has been accomplished, you can reinstall the same OS on the machine (even clean install), or upgrade to the
 next build, and the activation continues (automatically, but might take a few hours to show as activated). The Pro version continues as Pro, it doesn't change to Home (or visa versa). This has been well publicized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When one has thrown away the activation for a machine, Microsoft's usual answer is that he should go back to his properly licensed, activated OS that is eligible for the free upgrade to Win 10, and then upgrade to the version released to the public on 29
 July, or a later version any time up to 29 July, 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some say that going back to their licensed version is not an option because it's too much reinstalling, but for those who made a disc image backup before installing the first preview build, it only takes about 10 or 15 minutes to restore their image with
 all of their programs that were installed at the time the image was made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ones who had the computer expertise that Microsoft said would be needed in the insider program, knew how and why to do that, so it's no problem for them; however, others who jumped in without bothering to read or heed the notices have possibly learned something,
 and that has some value.</p>

<p><span>Hi Matthew,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am here to follow up on this thread.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Via the SARA diagnostic information, it seems the issue is related to the shared folder not cached. As for it, I suggest you try creating a new Outlook profile to see if it is workable. In addition, I'd like to know
 whether you have a special reason about stopping the shared mailbox's automapping. Nevertheless, it is supported for the Exchange Hybrid environment. I mean, you can try with adding the shared mailbox via automapping.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>At last, SARA also indicates "the shared mailbox can't be found". my understanding is that it should exist otherwise how can its full access permission be added. So, if it is possible, you can try with another migrated
 user to access the shared mailbox to see if it makes a difference.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Looking forward to your update.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,<br />
Alan</span></p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wondering if anyone knows&nbsp;how to eliminate&nbsp;the gray shading when using one of the default Sharepoint site&nbsp;formats? Please see the example below. this is a screen grab from a 5 tile site.</p>

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you click&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c878036e-c019-464a-a80e-4ebad872f3f8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c878036e-c019-464a-a80e-4ebad872f3f8?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;icon
 on the lower right corner of the tile, you need to switch <strong>Show title in layout</strong> to
<strong>No</strong> like below. Then the Gray shading won’t display.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e0ada4b7-8d58-40c0-ad35-9e0d4d58c679?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e0ada4b7-8d58-40c0-ad35-9e0d4d58c679?upload=true" /></a></p>

I have exactly the same issue. A permanent solution would be very appreciated.

            <p>I was able to "fix" this problem, against the advice of others in an Office365 forum.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Closed Outlook 2016.</li><li>Right-clicked on Outlook 2016 shortcut in Start; selected Properties.</li><li>On Compatibility tab, clicked on Run compatibility troubleshooter, which yielded NO fix to the problem. But...</li><li>Followed prompts in troubleshooter app to undo all changes and NOT to report issue to MS ("No. I am investigating...").</li><li>Opened Outlook 2016, and emails in reading pane and as opened messages displayed properly.</li><li>Rebooted Windows 10, and opened Outlook 2016, and emails still displayed properly in both environments.</li></ol>
<p>I hope this will work for others. I figure my system had some wonky settings somewhere, and the run through the troubleshooter, though apparently undoing its changes, fixed what was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can't hurt to try, I guess.</p>

            <p>Kerry - thanks for this advice. &nbsp;However, I'm running Windows 10 and I don't see the Properties - Compatibility options any longer. &nbsp;When you right click on the program, all you get are pin options to Start or the Taskbar or Run as Administrator (which launches
 the application). &nbsp; I've been looking in the File Options but not seeing anything yet for Compatibility or Troubleshooter. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose one option may be to Uninstall Outlook 2016 and force another re-install to see if that "repairs" any wonky settings that I'm not seeing.</p>

            <p>Hi, Roger. I am running Windows 10, too. To get to the Properties for Outlook 2016 (yes, even under Win10 they are there; they have to be), try this (make sure Outlook 2016 is closed):</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click on Start</li><li>Right-click on Outlook 2016 and click on 'Open file location', which open the Programs shortcuts folder.</li><li>Find the shortcut to Outlook 2016, then right-click on it and select properties.</li></ol>
<p>You should be able to find the Compatibility tab and troubleshooter there and proceed with my other instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for the Windows 10 primer!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to get to the Compatibility Troubleshooter but that didn't fix the issue after launching Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll keep looking for alternative solutions (or hopefully Microsoft will find the root cause and fix it in a future upgrade).</p>

    <title>Corrupt document cache - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lorne50  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupt document cache</h2>
                    <p>Starting just over a week ago every time I reboot the computer I get a message about a corrupt document cache.&nbsp; Clicking repair allows the computer to start OK and I can use the office programs and they upload OK to skydrive but it is very annoying to have
 to go through the file recovery process every time.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Looking at the relevant folder it is full of files with names like OfficeFileCache - 2.old - more than one file for many days, 10 in total.&nbsp; I can open the files in notepad and can't see any problem (not that I know what to look for).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It may be coincidence but it seems to have started following an upgrade to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There are hundreds of posts on the internet about others with the same problem but I can't find any reference to a solution.&nbsp; Does anybody know how to solve it?</p>

            <p>Here's something that worked for me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have OneDrive and OneDrive for Business installed.&nbsp; It seemed to me that they are conflicting so I started digging in the settings.&nbsp; My hypothesis is that OneDrive is using the same document cache as OneDrive for Business and that is causing the errors
 we're seeing.&nbsp; When I disabled that "feature," my Document Cache stopped getting corrupted.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's some further reading on the feature you want to DISABLE:&nbsp; <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/office-2013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/office-2013</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To disable this in Windows 8, you need to install the desktop version of OneDrive (as referenced in the link above).</p>

            Much better choice than 17711.1000; would be nice to have an ISO that gets past the trials of the builds between 17692 and 17711.<br />

<p>I hope that the rework of the reworked of the updated 17713 is a better build than the broken original that was thrown at us with much fanfare.</p>
<p>I for one will be very wary of either using that .iso or recommending to others that they use it.</p>

                    Hello,<br />
Does Lumia 1020 have video lock features? Like if you play a video, you can lock the buttons/screen so that if you accidentally touch it, it won't interrupt your video.

            Hi, reenadeng4eva. This is currently not a supported feature in WP devices. However, I would strongly recommend raising this here:

IMO, this is a cool idea! :-)
