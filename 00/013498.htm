<h2>            Conflicting Changes don&#39;t make sense</h2>
                    <p>I've been getting the annoying Conflicting Changes notification on my phone when using One Note. I go to check what these conflicts are on One Note online...only to find that they are earlier versions of my documents, saved midway through a sentence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess I start writing something on my phone, midway through a sentence it saves to the server...then somehow thinks its conflicting with the finished document? I have no clue. But it happens on nearly every new note I write now. What's the point of
 One Note if it considers me adding new things to a document (in the same sitting as me creating the document!) as a conflict with a randomly saved unfinished version?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way of stopping this? It's only started happening within the last week or so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Vicky,<br />

<br />
The "conflicting changes" notification may appear for a few reasons. In order to isolate the issue, we'll need a few more details:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there changes made before the issue started occurring?</li><li>What is the make and model of your phone?</li><li>Is it possible to replicate the issue on a different device?</li><li>Were you experiencing Internet connectivity issues when you saw the notification?</li><li>Are your notes shared?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hi!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not quite sure what you mean on that first point, but I've never had the issue before. One day I just created a new note, started typing and suddenly it popped up with a conflicting change notification. And has done this for multiple notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on a Pixel XL (the original, not the Pixel 2) with the latest version of both my phone and OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it shows these conflicting version notifications on all my devices (phone, an android tablet, a Mac computer and my Surface 4) but doesn't seem to create a conflicting problem in a new note on any of them apart from my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No internet problems at any point when creating the notes (its about 4 or 5 notes that are having this issue) nor are any of the notes shared.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If there are conflicts for whatever reason there should definitely be a re-sync option from a selected device to all the other devices in a cloud connection.
</p>
<p>As the user I should have the option to select which copy is the one I want to keep and to sync to all others.</p>
<p>There should also be an option to recover the latest overwritten copy so that users are safe from accidental losses by false syncs.</p>

<p>Well, it's been a while and I admit that I stopped sing OneNote because the conflicting errors were so frustrating. Recently come back to it and the matter has gotten worse - no matter which device I'm on, the moment I make a change to a note, I get a banner
 telling me that there's a conflict - which turns out to be whatever new information I've added to the note. Beyond frustrating.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't change anything because OneNote doesn't save the most update version of the note, and instead compares it to an old version and deems the new version wrong. It's definitely a sync issue. I have tried the trouble shooting fixes you've offered. No
 luck. Now having problems on both an android device, and windows. No longer just my phone. And I still haven't shared the notes. It's just me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further suggestions? Having to copy over 'new' additions and delete conflicts is wearing thin.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
And the only way to clear it is to delete the "out of sync" version via browser and OneNote online.

<p>I deinstalled Office 365, but every time I try to launch Outlook or one of the newly installed Office 2016 Professional</p>
<p>like Word or Excel or Outlook, it keeps launching the Office 365 I deinstalled!</p>
<p>How do I get to use the new software I bought and stop using Office 365??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought when I deinstalled Office 365 it took care of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My reason for making the change is I want all my Outlook email files resident on my laptop, and not</p>

            Dear Joycelovesdogs,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />Please uninstall Office using tips in this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninstall-office-from-a-pc-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/uninst...</a> and make sure you have uninstalled all applications and both (Office 365 and Office 2016) are removed.
<br />
<br />Afterwards install Office 2016 <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/download-and-install-or-reinstall-office-365-or-office-2019-on-a-pc-or-mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/downlo...</a> and activate it using account for Office 2016 <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/activate-office-5bd38f38-db92-448b-a982-ad170b1e187e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/activa...</a>

            This may just be a branding issue. If you unistalled Office 365 and installed a stand-alone Office 2016, the About screen may still show "365", but it's cosmetic.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I had already uninstalled Office 365 when I did that in the Apps folder of the My Settings area on my laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what is currently on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- MS Office 2007 professional plus</p>
<p>2- Windows 10 operating software</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade was to be able to use Outlook on my desktop and keep all files resident</p>
<p>instead of the cloud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use the deinstall program you suggest, do I remove everything?&nbsp; And what happens to all</p>
<p>my folders in Outlook, MS Word, Excel and powerpoint that are from teh 2007 pro plus?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping when buying the MS Office 2016 Pro Plus that this would be an upgrade</p>
<p>and they'd all integrate as one.&nbsp; Or do I need to purchase the interim SW upgrades,</p>
<p>of MS Office 2010, and MS Office 2013?</p>
<p>

<p>It does not matter what type of license, its a users choice as to whether OneDrive (cloud) is used as the default storage location</p>
<p>If using MS Outlook the type of mail account used is relevent as to where the outlook data is stored, if the mail account is a pop type, data is stored on the local PC in a *.pst data file</p>
<p>There are no upgrade versions of Office, since Office 2010 all versions are full versions</p>

<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

            Hi, Shadowfixeruk.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your feedback. We're always looking for ways to improve our product around content management on the web portal. Keep an eye out for future releases of the product.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, the easiest way to this is:<br />
<br />
1. Go to "Connected Phones" on the Microsoft My Phone web portal.<br />
2. Delete your device.<br />
3. Delete all contents from your web account (make sure you purge them from the deleted items).<br />
4. Go to the My Phone client application and select the data-types you want to sync under Menu -&gt; Sync Options.<br />
5. Hit Sync on the My Phone client application.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Marco.

                    <p>For some reason "AutoSave" stopped working since several weeks.</p>
<p>I already tried the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reinstalling Office</li><li>Changed to different channels (Monthly, Insider, InsiderFast)</li><li>Installed it on a naked, not domain joined machine with a local administrative user</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently running the monthly channel on version 1801 (Build 9001.2171) and there are no updates available.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The documents are either stored on my OneDrive or on Sharepoint Online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an example of an opened document from Sharepoint:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f504e41-9221-4d33-bc09-f9234ff593ba?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f504e41-9221-4d33-bc09-f9234ff593ba?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>After pressing the "Edit Workbook" button</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/98d56bd3-53f0-42c0-a9e1-00c20915b995?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/98d56bd3-53f0-42c0-a9e1-00c20915b995?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>From time to time AutoSave completely disappears</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56c6301b-1ff6-4b4d-8cfa-0f2d1a8cc3f9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56c6301b-1ff6-4b4d-8cfa-0f2d1a8cc3f9?upload=true" /></a></p>

Microsoft Article</a>&nbsp;(<em>Last updated: February 5, 2018)</em>&nbsp;wich recommends an update to Version 1708... but I guess a downgrade from 1801 to 1708 isn't possible.</p>

<p>Hi Cliff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to fix it!</p>
<p>The solution was an old KMS key on my computer (<span>cscript ospp.vbs /dstatus)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I deleted it and auto safe was back! :)</p>
<p>

    <title>IE 10 not opening new Tabs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lcdohn  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE 10 not opening new Tabs</h2>
                    <p>So have done this both on a Windows 7 system and a Windows 8 System under IE 10.&nbsp; Do a search in either Google or Bing, click on the a link and it changes the same tab as opposed to opening a new tab.&nbsp; Check the settings under Tools&gt;Internet Options and
 they are set like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a new tab is opened, open:</p>
<p>The New Tab page</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a pop-up is encountered:</p>
<p>Always open pop-ups in a new window</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open links from other programs in:</p>
<p>A new tab in the current window</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable Tabbed Browsing is checked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was able to do this in earlier version of IE - perhaps this has something to do with compatibility MODE??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise if there is a fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>The only thing that this has to do with a change in IE is your Cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will have to redo your Preferences with both BING and Google to request that result pages be opened in new windows.&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternatively, I think that if you login to either service
 that they may remember your preferences that way without relying on saved Cookie data.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In any case, Cookies with Google are so unreliable and I use it so infrequently that lately I haven't bothered doing either with it.&nbsp; So, when I want a result to open in its own tab I just use Middle click on its link.&nbsp; In the case of the Microsoft search
 that procedure is now required anyway because the equivalent function in it has been removed apparently.&nbsp; That's a nuisance because it is the search that I use most and I still frequently forget to Middle click with it.</p>

<h2>            Zero Suppress</h2>
                    I know that I can go into the Options | Advanced and scroll down to uncheck a box to stop the zeroes from displaying in a worksheet. &nbsp;My question is whether or not I can make the default in Excel to not display zeroes? ... in other words, I would only
 have to go into the Options | Advanced to change the setting if I wanted zeroes to display. &nbsp;If it is possible, how do I do it so that the Excel default is to zero suppress? &nbsp;Thanks in advance.

            <p>You have chosen to have new workbooks contain only one sheet (the default is usually 3).</p>
<p>So in your case you would create a new workbook, set the sheet to not display zeros via the Options menu, save the book as BOOK.XLTX and as SHEET.XLTX as described.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was your assignment originally opened from an email or download? If so, unless you deliberately saved elsewhere, it would be in a Temp or Temporary folder or your Downloads folder. As Palcouk recommended, you should use Windows Explorer rather than Word
 to find files there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Knowing the name of the file will help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the search facility. Make sure that it is set to search in system and hidden folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more ideas, search this forum :</p>

            I'd be 99.9% sure there's no such registry setting. AFAIK these settings are hard coded and cannot be changed. I'll be happy to be wrong!

    <title>Auto-forwarding rule crashes Outlook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pdccnet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto-forwarding rule crashes Outlook</h2>
                    I'm running Outlook 2011 (14.1.3 [110805]) on an iMac (2.8 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 4GB RAM, 70GB free on HD). I have a rule set up to analyze inbound email and if it meets the conditions, forward that mail on to my assistant. The rule has worked fine for
 some time. But here in the last week or two, every time I receive an email that meets those criteria, it executes the rule... then Outlook crashes.<br />
<br />
It took a little bit to figure out that this rule was causing the crash. As part of the process, the emails would get filed in a folder and marked as read, so I didn't know they were even there at first. To me it just looked like Outlook was randomly crashing.
 I tried rebuilding my database but that didn't seem to be having an effect. I'd finish the rebuild and 30 minutes later, Outlook would crash again.<br />
<br />
But I have pretty well determined that it is the autoforwarding rule that is the source of the problem. Since disabling the rule, the crashes have stopped. And immediately after the most recent crashes, I could go to my sent items and see that the most recently
 sent items were emails that would have been forwarded by the rule.<br />
<br />
I've tried looking through the Console logs but since I'm not really sure what I'm looking for, I don't know how useful that is.<br />
<br />
I'd love to get this fixed but don't know if it's a problem with my configuration or if there is an issue with Outlook itself.<br />
<br />
Hoping one of the MVP's can shed some light or offer some direction.<br />

            I've seen rules get corrupt. You can try deleting the Rule and see if a new Rule works.<br />
<br />
Have you tested in a new Identity? Rebuilding often does not fix all issues.<br />
<br />
Do you get a Microsoft error that asks you to send to Microsoft? If yes, you can click on details and post that here.<br />
<br />
If it's an Apple error window, then it's not Outlook but a system error.

<h2>            Will the phone auto sync if locked&#63;</h2>
                    I had my phone locked with the screen off and I plugged it into my USB port.
<br />
<br />
The phone woke up but didn't sync. I checked my tasks and activesync on the phone was running in 'tasks'.
<br />
<br />
I then unplugged the phone and plugged it back into the USB and this time it auto synced.
<br />
<br />
Does this sound about right or should it have synced the first time?<br />
<br />

<h2>            Junk commands don&#39;t work in quick access toolbar - Outlook</h2>
                    I am running Outlook via the Office 365 software service and am currently running version 1711 (build 8730.2165 Click-to-Run) and the Junk command does not work in the quick access toolbar.&nbsp; I can see the icon, but it is grayed out and inoperable.&nbsp; If
 I put the cursor over it, the bubble shows up telling me what it is.&nbsp; In other words, it's there but I can't use it.&nbsp; I've tried repairing my installation, updates, etc. and nothing works.&nbsp; If I put the block sender command in the quick access toolbar by itself
 it does work.&nbsp; I want to be able to click on the Junk icon and mark things as block, allow sender, allow domain, etc. and have not been able to do that for months.&nbsp; I have read through all the threads related to this and none of the "solutions" presented work.&nbsp;
 Please help!

            None that I can specifically remember other than regular Windows 10 and Office updates.&nbsp; It's been a problem for at least 6 months and I've been working around it.&nbsp; I accidentally marked an email as "block sender" via what I had in the quick access toolbar
 which prompted me to start looking to see if it was just me or a problem for others because I couldn't quickly find the "never block" option for a sender.&nbsp; I really do not like the organization/ribbons of the Office products because I can never find anything
 and search is useless but that's an entirely different discussion.

    <title>Pro Plus Power Pivot keeping slicers from synchronizing when creating - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Pro Plus Power Pivot keeping slicers from synchronizing when creating Pivot Tables from same data source</h2>
                    <p>Have been using Excel Pro Plus/365 successfully for several months.&nbsp; I have a fairly large table (100,000 x 150) and have been using a single table to create Pivot Tables from the Power Pivot data model.&nbsp; I created a set of 10 slicers that were connected
 to about 8 Pivot Tables so I was getting synchronized data reports in different formats.&nbsp; In my project I needed to keep this set of slicers/Pivot Tables separate and created several new Pivot Tables (expecting them to create separate caches - I think they
 did).&nbsp; I then created several new slicers on the new Pivot tables.&nbsp; I'm finding that there is complete synchronization between the two sets of slicers.&nbsp; When attempting to debug this I found that there was an "I" icon (information) appearing in the Slicer/Pivot
 Table selection option window.&nbsp; When hovering over this icon I see the following "The following filter controls will all be connected to this report because they belong to the same hierarchy" and the named slicers (Area[Area] and Area[Area 1] are from the
 two different sets of slicers.&nbsp; I did not intend (or know how to create hierarchies in this environment and I have found the reference material regarding Slicers/Pivot Tables/caches/Hierarchies lacking - maybe I don't know where to look). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I help (or point to references) on how to create the second set of Pivot Tables and associated second set of Slicers without creating shared/connected slicers involving hierarchies.&nbsp; I saw one reference requiring the exporting of a table connection file
 (and several complicated steps) to disconnect a cache but not sure if this is the correct approach.&nbsp; One expert said just go back and create the Pivot Tables from the non data model table which will force a difference cache and keep the slicers operating separately.&nbsp;
 However, then I lose the performance advantages of the Power Pivot engine with my large data table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or comments would be appreciated,</p>
<p>

<p>Neha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying.&nbsp; This is exactly where I noticed the slicer synchronization.&nbsp; When I changed (the checked box) for any connections, but specifically on the slicer named Area when I changed the selections in the first set of slicers, the change was immediately
 noted in the second set of slicers.&nbsp; Both slicers were attached to tables that were created individually from a single table located in the Power Pivot data model.&nbsp; When hovering over the "I" (information) icon in the Report Connections window it noted what
 I stated in my original question, saying basically that both slicers were connected because that were part of the same hierarchy.&nbsp; I didn't intend or know how to create hierarchies in this instance and have been unable to locate reference information that
 indicates how this happened and/or how to eliminate this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I noted, a consultant suggested just set up the new set of pivot tables from a non Power Pivot table location.&nbsp; While this should work, it takes away (what I've been able to understand) the improved backend engine of the Power Pivot data model vs. the
 standard Excel pivot table engine.</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the test purpose, I created a table in Excel and inserted two pivot tables (<strong>Insert</strong> tab&gt;<strong>Pivot Table</strong>) in different sheets (Sheet 2 &amp; 3), source for both the pivots is same (sheet 1). In these two pivots, I then inserted
 separate slicers. When I go to <strong>Report connection</strong> by right clicking on any slicer, I see only one pivot table connection which is associated with slicer. If I change filter in one slicer, it does not affect the other pivot table.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further test this, I copied one pivot table and pasted in a new sheet in same workbook. Please note, I did not create new pivot using the
<strong>Insert</strong> tab on the ribbon, this time the pivot table was copied and pasted. Since the new pivot table was copied and when a new slicer was inserted, it showed two pivot tables connections associated with the table when clicked
<strong>Report Connections</strong> and any changes made in the slicer to filter, will affect the first pivot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, with my test, I presume you might have copied and pasted the pivot from one sheet to another which is resulting in synchronization of slicer. If this is the case, then please create a new pivot from the data source and then check if slicer still shows
 the same behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: I tested with latest <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
2016 versions of Office 365</span> Pro Plus (monthly channel).</span></p>

<p>Neha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really appreciate you taking the time to follow-up on my issue.&nbsp; With the Pivot Tables I'm talking about they were all created from the Power Pivot data model.&nbsp; I did copy the sheet with my first set of slicers to a new sheet hoping that by just connecting
 to the correct Pivot Tables I could save some time.&nbsp; Whey I found the synchronization between the slicers the first thing I thought was there was some connecting continuing through the copying of the slicers.&nbsp; So, I deleted a couple of the slicers and created
 them fresh from the new pivot tables, same resulting synchronization.&nbsp; In the past I think I ran the same test that you did, but was not using the data model and think I was able to get separate actions on using new slicers on Pivot tables that had a common
 source, but were created fresh and not copied through sheet coping.&nbsp; I'm beginning to think that because the "sheet" of slicers was copied there is some continuing connection even though I've deleted and created new slicers.&nbsp; I'm going to create a new sheet
 and establish completely fresh slicers.&nbsp; Using the same sheet might be the mechanism through which the hierarchies are being created.&nbsp; As I noted, I believe the hierarchies (which I didn't want) are source of the issue - Excel even tells me that directly.&nbsp;
 But as I noted, I've found very little resource information regarding hierarchies and how to deal with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will do as I noted and will post the results.&nbsp; Again, thanks for responding and putting me back to another approach for solving this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it works (starting a new sheet with new slicers), I will try just copying the slicers from the second sheet of slicers individually rather than the whole sheet. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Acrobat 9 Pro no longer works with Word 2010&#47;Windows7</h2>
                    
<p>I was successfully using Acrobat 9 to create PDF files from Word 2010 files by opening Acrobat and using the Create &gt; Create from File command (I was not trying to integrate Acrobat into the Word menu system). This was working well, until a Windows update
 where after the update I get a "Your Security Level is set to High" error message from Acrobat. I tried to set the Macro Security level in Word, but no help.</p>
The Word 2010 Save As PDF command does not work for me--it totally messes with my cross references and does not embed the fonts correctly.
<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Suzanne,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thanks for replying. Alas, I cannot print to the Adobe Printer.</p>
<p>Actually, the Adobe Support site says that you can use Acrobat 9 to create PDF files. However, it does not integrate with the new Word Ribbon (like older versions integrated with the Word menus).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here a couple of links to the Adobe site, they give a few ways to create PDF files from Acrobat 9 Pro. And I could do this, until a mysterious update occurred on my system!</p>

<p>Looks like I am out of luck with this. Too bad Word's Save As PDF does not really function (as I said, it really messes up my cross references!)</p>

            <div>It is unfortunate that Adobe seems to keep finding new ways to irritate Word users (and Microsoft finds new ways to thwart Acrobat). I recently upgraded from Acrobat 6 to 9 and immediately encountered a number of annoyances (such as being prompted to save
 Normal.dot every time I quit Word), but the last straw was when Acrobat just totally ate two lines of text at the top of a page. Nothing I did (in Word or Acrobat) made any difference. I ended up opening the Word 2003 document in Word 2007 and printing to
 PDF using Word's PDF converter, which produced the desired result. So it's kind of a cr*p shoot for any given document which solution will work.

<h2>            My Technical Preview Crashed&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;After over three months of trouble free usage of the Windows 10 Technical Preview, luck</p>
<p>would have it that my operating system crashed unexpectedly! I wasn't overly surprised&nbsp;</p>
<p>about something like this from happening since this operating system is pre-release software</p>
<p>and is bound for errors anyway. For mishaps like this, I have done the right thing by downloading</p>
<p>the iso file and burning it onto a DVD as a backup as opposed to installing tech preview directly</p>
<p>from this website. But due to the operating system crash, my once current build 9926 was&nbsp;</p>
<p>reverted back to the old build of 9841 from the DVD I made and reused to re-install Tech</p>
<p>Preview. Back to where I started in short. Were it not for my making that recovery DVD</p>
<p>from the iso image I downloaded, I would have been in trouble with my PC for real!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uneventful things like system crashes to me only strengthens my willpower to learn</p>
<p>how to troubleshoot and rectify problems with an experimental pre-release operating</p>
<p>system. I guess that's what being an Insider is really all about, or at least that to some extent.</p>
<p>Anyway, my PC and Tech Preview is once again up and running! So I can smile and carry on</p>
<p>with my little mission as being a Windows 10 Technical Preview Insider!</p>

    <title>Trouble moving Office 2010 from old to new computer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Trouble moving Office 2010 from old to new computer</h2>
                    I have Office 2010 Pro Plus on a Dell workstation running XP SP3. It installed, activated, and ran fine at the initial install a couple of years ago. Recently, I tried migrating to a new computer using the original hard drive on which the OS and Office
 were installed. The computer ran fine (after windows did its thing to verify I had a good license and I updated the drivers for the new computer). However, Office 2010 lost its activation. The old computer was offline and had no OS or any copy of Office running
 ... nor will it.<br />
<br />
I tried to reactivate Office via the web method ( I had good connection to internet) but this failed, repeatedly. I tried the phone method, twice, but it failed, reporting only the message that I needed to "return my software to the store" ... this was really
 weird.<br />
<br />
I assume the activation is tied into a serial number or something in the original CPU or mainboard where it was first installed ... if this is the case, and it can't be activated on a new computer, how do I ever move my Office software to another computer?
 I never had this issue with any previous version of Office ... is there some bug in the 2010 version?<br />
<br />
Note: I have this Office 2010 installed on only one computer and plan to keep it only on one computer in future per obvious license requirements. Do I need to "deactivate" it somehow before moving to a new computer? Note: I don't wish to completely uninstall
 / re-install Office so as to lose all my updates, settings, archived e-mails, etc.<br />
<br />
I cannot find any support documents on this topic, and the only advice I've received is "call Microsoft" ... surely, there must be standard procedure to uninstall Office software from an old computer and move it to a new one (without losing any settings, files,
 updates, and preferences) and be able to reactivate it again? The normal process does not seem to work.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any ideas.

Yes, I have the original Office 2010 Key, the physical DVD, and the original retail package all came with. As it is not the home use or academic version, I assume it is only good for use on a single computer, which is all I want and all I am attempting to use
 it for.<br />
<br />
I am able to migrate my hard drive between computers as I am not using the OEM Windows OS license since that was for Vista, which at the time had issues with some legacy software and devices I wanted to continue to use. So, rather than using an OEM version
 of Vista, I installed XP Pro, using my own physical retail disk and license, unique for this computer. For what it's worth, I am no longer using the OEM hard drive which has since been replaced with a larger capacity, server-class drive. Office 2010 was installed
 after the hard drive upgrade, so I am not sure if moving to a different hard drive (via a Ghost image) would have caused issues or not. The previous Office 2007 was just fine with this migration method.<br />
<br />
The comparable Mac versions of Office, 2008 and 2011, respectively, seem to act like their Windows counter-parts. Office 2008 would migrate between computers or between hard drives with no problem. Office 2011 refuses to work on a different hard drive, even
 if installed on the same computer (Mac Pro OS 10.6) ... there must be a way for Microsoft to implement copy / license protection so as to not punish legit users of their software wanting to upgrade to a new computer or larger hard drive.<br />
<br />
So, back to my original question, is there a deactivation step that somehow needs to be performed on the old computer to allow Office 2010 to be more easily moved (moved to, not duplicated on) a new computer without the need to completely uninstall it, rather,
 simply re-active it on the new computer? Adobe supports this method for their much more expensive software suites, so why not Microsoft? Thanks.<br />

After a long process of troubleshooting and several more calls to Microsoft support, I learned that my Office 2010 was disabled because the license key code was among those that had been assigned for developer use only, and had been subsequently blocked, preventing
 it from being reactivated on a new computer. The reseller from whom I bought on eBay thought it was "legit" software... it was not bootleg nor counterfeit, but apparently it was not intended for retail sale either. I had a physical package and disk that looked
 fully retail with no special markings, so there was no way for me to tell it had a developer license. I believe the same thing can happen if you buy a license key from a 3rd party, such as a seller on eBay, and even if download from the MS website, the key
 code may work at first, but later MS could block it.<br />
<br />
On my last attempt to activate by phone, I did not respond to the prompts, and the system eventually directed me to a live person. I was fortunate that I spoke with a very helpful MS support person, they directed me to the "how to tell" web page, but also told
 me to file a "counterfeit software report". I submitted a case and followed the instructions to return the software along with my purchase receipt, etc, etc. to Microsoft. About 2 weeks later, I received a new Office 2010 DVD and activation code in the mail
 at no cost, and everything is working fine. Despite the difficulty, I have to thank Microsoft for handling the resolution in a professional and prompt manner.<br />
<br />
Assuming you have a similar situation, I'd recommend not yet deleting your current XP installation, but try the counterfeit report process, and see if they give you a new activation code that allows a new installation. Good luck.<br />

I didn't really expect the editorial, but I believe you have not read my post closely. I stated the facts and details of my experience for the benefit of others who may run across a similar issue ... no need to attack me ... I fully support observing all software
 licensing and ownership rights. This is NOT a case of counterfeit software ... please read, point by point;<br />
<br />
<i>"Pro Plus is not a retail version, its a volume licence only available to persons who qualify for that type of licence"</i><br />
<br />
Yes and Pro Plus is comparable in content to that found in the HUP version that can be purchased from Microsoft (for persons who qualify for that type of license). The product I purchased online from a reputable seller on eBay was in a sealed, retail package
 labelled "Office Professional 2010", same as was screen printed on the label of the DVD.
<br />
<br />
The odd thing, based on the Office splash screen and all the extra components installed, the contents of the DVD included those for "Office Professional Plus", hence the problem.<br />
<br />
The DVD was factory pressed (not a DVDr copy, no paper labels) and included all the usual hologram images MS uses. There was nothing in the packaging; type of stock, the printing quality, etc. to differentiate it from genuine, typical MS-made product (no inkjet
 or photocopy box inserts, fuzzy type, or misspelled words)<br />
<i><br />
"There's a 99.99% certainty that any pro plus version offered on any auction site is a hacked copy"</i><br />
<br />
If this was a "hacked copy", it was a brilliant and very high-end, expensive fake. On the other hand, if this was indeed a developer's copy, not intended for retail sale, just as Microsoft support told me it was, then this makes sense. The shrink-wrap had bar
 coding, stocking numbers, and the name of a well-known distributor of software who primarily caters to the business community.<br />
<i><br />
"Your EBay seller is telling tall stories</i>"<br />
<br />
The eBay seller was not the source of my information, rather the information about what product I had came from Microsoft plus physical examination of the media and packaging as I described above. I have no reason to believe the eBay seller was the culprit
 as he is still in business with a good reputation and rating, rather, I suspect somewhere along the line, his source may have acquired it via "leakage" of product from somebody in the technical community or distribution channels not authorized to sell this
 product at retail.<br />
<br />
This experience actually gives me better confidence that Microsoft is diligent in policing the integrity of their products and at the same time is considerate of the end-user who supports them.<br />
