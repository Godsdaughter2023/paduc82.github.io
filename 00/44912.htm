<h2>            Moving One Drive to the Micro SD Card on Surface 3</h2>
                    I Just bought a 64 GB Surface 3 and a 128 GB Micro SD card to expand the storage capacity. I would like to move my One Drive to the Micro SD card since the total size of the files I have on One Drive exceeds the amount of space I have available on the
 C drive. Is there a way to do this? I know I can copy the entire One Drive folder to the SD card but I haven't been able to move it so that when I do update a document stored there, it will update it on the SD card. Does anyone know how to do this?

            does your 128GB micro SD card stay mounted when you copy folders from it to the Surface 3 SSD and when it awakes from deep sleep? Many people are having trouble with this. To answer your question, see

<h2>            user profile corrupted and access denied</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: more than just one problem than user profile and access denied</p>
<p>This adds to a couple of other posts in the past.To answer your questions,yes I set up the new account as an administrator acount.The 2nd question is a little more complicated.The old account(MountainMan)loads up and immediatly logs out in the same screen.If
 I use my master administrator account,that I used to only use in emergencies,I can access MountainMan account.Why it logs in and then right out I haven't a clue,as I had said earlier that everything seemed fine and I went to reboot and my computer went into
 repair mode,and created MountainMan000temp file.It no longer will boot to MountainMan account.I created MountainMan1 and was going to transfer all the info from MountainMan to MountainMan1,except for a couple of problems.1stwhen the computer boots up it is
 doing it twice.Meaning it goes the the boot prcess and the screen blanks out for a couple of minuites and then reboots againgoing through the same long wait,but on the 2nd time it then has the little round windows picture and slowlycomes on line.my anti-virus
 startsup and then 15 seconds later it shuts its rel-time protection off.I had the same anti-virus for years(system Shield which is part of Iolos' System Mechanic pro.I've asked there tech support but have not got any help for this).The 2nd problem is MountainMan1
 (which is an administrtor account)when I boot up with this account all I get is access denied on docs.,pics,music,vidios, etc.So I don't feel comfortable move any files to this account.I've followed all the different advice on access denied and it tells me
 I own all the files and I also followed the directions for unable to load profile.I did the .bak and .ba change it said to do.the temp file is gone,My computer is booting twice,MountainMan won't boot,I don't dare to use Mountainman1,and I'm stuck using my
 main administrator account I only like using for emergecies.I'm running windiws home basic vista on a Dell Vosrto 220 with 4gigs of memory 32bit,and a NVIDA Geforce 8400GS 512MB/MODDR2 DVI+VGA.Desktop is around 2 years old SP1 and 2I cann't think of anything
 I've left out.I hope someone is still watching this link and might be able to share some wisdom.Thanks MountanMan</p>

    <title>Redownloading a file - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Redownloading a file</h2>
                    <p>I tried looking everywhere including on the community post and somehow no one hasn't asked yet lol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my question is, is it possible to redownload a file you downloaded from the internet from the downloaded folder. Because I downloaded a file from the internet, I then cleared space so it can be on the computer but now I can't find a way to be able to
 restore the download or even redownload it.</p>

            Hi AlanJohns2 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. 
<br />
<br />Q. is it possible to redownload a file you downloaded from the internet from the downloaded folder
<br />A. It is possible if this information is retained in Browser (i..e) you have not cleared it.
<br />Open the browser which you had used &gt; Go to the Downloads of that browser. Let's take example of Chrome &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Downloads &gt; Now the file which you had downloaded will have the link where it was downloaded from &gt; Right click on that link &gt; Copy link address &gt; Now using this link address, you can re-download the file.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Alan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can try to download the file again from it's site which you can find in the browser history.  Make sure you chose the correct download link as many download pages are littered with false links to try to trick you.  If in doubt ask back.  
<br />
<br />If this fails again try another browser.  I would have several browsers on your task bar so there's always one that's best for the task.  I use Firefox, Edge and Chrome in that order of preference.  It's easy to share bookmarks between all of them in their settings under Import Favorites from another Browser, and Firefox and Chrome let  you sign in to sync your Favorites on any other device you sign into.  Set the preferred browser as Default in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<div>This doesn't happen every time, and it is not exclusive to certain types of errors. In this particular case, I am running Driver Verifier to isolate which driver is crashing my system, but I can't get any kind of minidump info because of this problem.
 Has anyone encountered this, and is there a way to correct it? I do have my page file enabled and set to a decent size, and enlarging that has not solved the problem.&nbsp;</div>

You can turn off verifier by typing verifier /reset<br />

            Hi again Zigzag. I think I meet those settings currently, which is why I'm confused.
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>My page file is on my C: drive, which is my OS drive. I'm considering creating a partition on C: for the page drive, but as I understand it, this would only improve performance, rather than affecting whether dumps are produced.</li><li>Page file size is set to 12288 MB min. and max . (8 GB system)</li><li>WER service is set to Manual (Trigger Start)</li><li>UAC is running</li><li><b>I have a hybrid SSD (seagate Momentus XT) - it's a standard hard drive with 8GB of NAND flash in which frequently used programs/files are cached. Maybe this is related?</b></li><li>CCleaner has not been run in 1-2 weeks, and I have it set to ignore Memory Dumps</li></ul>
<div><br />
<div>I've set the page file to system managed on the OS drive, and Kernel Memory Dump rather than Small Memory Dump, and will try verifier again</div>

            I just ran verifier again with your suggestions - the same problem came up. On the third BSOD, I left my system alone for over an hour and it still didn't produce a dump. I don't think it is a page file problem because dumps are still produced on some
 of the KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR crashes. However, they are never produced with the DRIVER_VERIFIER_IOMANAGER_VIOLATION error.

            <p>Hi Sachin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>The error code </span></span><strong><span>KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR STOP: 0x0000007A</span></strong><span><span>s<span>tates that the requested page of kernel data from the paging file could not be read into memory. It appears that
 there are some issues with the hard disk.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span><span>Use check disk command for any errors on hard disk -</span></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span>Warning:</span></strong><span> Microsoft does not recommend interrupting the CHKDSK process. Microsoft does not guarantee the integrity of the disk if the CHKDSK program is interrupted.<strong>For safety you can back up your data before
 using the check disk command.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Use the check disk commands as follows:</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><br />
&nbsp;1. Click Start. <br />
2. In search window type 'cmd' and ENTER. Right click and select 'Run as administrator'.<br />
3. Type at the command prompt <strong>CHKDSK /P</strong> and press ENTER to scan the disk.<br />
4. Then type <strong>CHKDSK C: /F /R</strong> and press ENTER to repair corrupt sectors, if there are any.</p>
</span></span>&nbsp;
<p><span><span><strong>NOTE</strong>: The root drive has to be C: and the command may schedule a task at the system startup, if it does, then press Y to schedule a task and restart the computer to perform chkdsk.</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><br />
Once chkdsk completes, boot to the desktop and then check.</p>
</span></span>&nbsp;

<h2>            Make Visual Studio 2013 connect to SQL Server 2016 RC0</h2>
                    Hi, Everyone! I recently downloaded and installed SQL Server 2016 RC0. When I tried to connect the Visual Studio 2013 to SQL Server 2016 RC0, the connection succeeded, but the data in the database was not available. VS 2013 prompted that an incompatible
 version of SQL Server was detect. It is OK when I connect VS 2015 to SQL Server 2016 RC0 with the SQL Server Data Tool 2015. If a tool is also needed for VS 2013, how can I find it on Microsoft's website?

<h2>            clean installed Win 7 and laptop overheating&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>ok just as the title says my laptops are overheating.&nbsp; ok list of things done</p>
<p>
</p><p>clean install win 7 on 2 laptops</p>
<p>cpu and heatsink brand new paste via using Artic Cool</p>
<p>Fans have been tested by a tech and they are in perfect working order</p>
<p>all dust or foreign objects have been carefully checked and removed if any</p>
<p>motherboard tested no defects</p>
<p>bios up to date</p>
<p>all drivers up to date</p>
<p>all windows updates are up to date</p>
<p>hdd and mem all check out ok</p>
<p>
</p><p>after my last encounter with Windows Update as of April nothing would work in Windows Update.&nbsp; Tried all fixes possible and nothing worked for both laptops.&nbsp; I could not take it anymore so I clean installed on both laptops&nbsp;Win 7 again.&nbsp; But after the install
 and the updates on 2 laptops they both have overheating problems.&nbsp; my cpu fans on both machines will startup with windows just fine and then after startup is complete both fans in 2 different machines will slow down to turtle speed and that's it.&nbsp; Normally
 fans speed up and slow down to cool the cpu but on my laptops they will not do that.&nbsp; They will spin really slow and its not enough to cool the cpu's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its kind of like the cpu and cooling fans are not talking to each other or they are getting mixed signals.&nbsp; All this from installing updates after a clean install.&nbsp; Again this is happening to 2 different laptops at the same time with the same problem so
 if someone can help please for gods sake let me know how to fix this</p>

    <title>Listing video &#40;avi&#41; files is slow in Explorer - It also - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spaldo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Listing video &#40;avi&#41; files is slow in Explorer - It also incorrectly gets not required information</h2>
                    If you disable the 'Length' column in Windows Explorer when listing multiple files in 'Details' mode it still gets the Length information when listing the Date.<br />
<br />
IE. Date should appear without delay, however, there appears to be a bug in Win7 where it takes sometimes minutes to display the 'Date' column in Windows Explorer 'details' mode.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you require more information, I am not sure how to pass on a bug report to Microsoft

Hi,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply... but... this has nothing to do with playing the file.&nbsp; As per my post/question, it is going slow when listing the movie/files in Windows Explorer in detail view.<br />
<br />
This is a brand new install of Windows 7 <br />

<p>Hi TopHatter,</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you trying to connect to Wired or wireless network?<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any recent changes made to the computer prior to the issue occurred?</p>
<p>First, make sure that the proxy settings for Internet explorer are not enabled. Follow the steps to check this.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Launch <strong>Internet</strong> <strong>Explorer</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <strong>Tools</strong> and click <strong>Internet</strong> <strong>
Options</strong>.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>Connections</strong> <strong>Tab</strong> and click on <strong>
LAN</strong> <strong>Settings</strong>.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure that below <strong>Proxy</strong> <strong>Server</strong> none of the options are checked. If anything is checked, please clear the box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I suggest that you check if you are able to connect to internet hardwired to the router.</p>
<p>If your computer is having problems connecting to the Internet, or to other computers on a network, try using one of the networking troubleshooters to fix the problem.</p>
<p>Open the <strong>Network</strong> <strong>troubleshooter</strong> by right-clicking the
<strong>network</strong> <strong>icon</strong> in the notification area, and then clicking
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong> <strong>problems</strong></p>
<p>Open the <strong>Internet</strong> <strong>Connections</strong> <strong>troubleshooter</strong> by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong>, and then clicking <strong>Control</strong> <strong>Panel</strong>. In the search box, type
<strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. Under
<strong>Network</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Internet</strong>, click <strong>
Connect</strong> <strong>to</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>Internet</strong>.</p>
<p>Follow the steps from the link below which might help you to fix the issue: <strong>
Open networking troubleshooters: </strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-networking-troubleshooters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-networking-troubleshooters</strong></a></p>

<h2>            Show Desktop icon is missing from Quick Launch toolbar</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows Search </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Windows XP, Home Edition, IE8, SP3, and I have lost one of my desktop icons that I use frequently. It's the icon that is always in the task bar, along with a few others. The icon is what opens&nbsp;up the desktop, whenever you click on it. It's a white
 square that looks like a desk paper pad, with a figure of what looks like a pencil and/or pen&nbsp;&nbsp;figure shown on it. &nbsp;Somehow, someway, it got deleted, and I can't find where to get it back. I've been in the control panel on "DISPLAY" and no luck there, also
 been in the&nbsp;taskbar and start menu , and can't find it there, &nbsp;checked a lot of menus that have the word "Desktop" in it and I clicked on many of these also without any luck also. Once again, it's a white icon, and is always in the taskbar at the bottom of
 the monitor screen. Does anybody know have to get this icon back......any and all help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi shanal263 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You should restore/reset your computer using Media Creation Tool. You will have to cut Media creation tool on another computer if you can't do this on your existing computer.
<br />
<br />Refer to the section"Use installation media to restore or reset your PC "
<br />
<br />Recovery options in Windows 10 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />Note - You will get the option to keep your files during reset. But it will remove third party apps including Microsoft Office which will need to be reinstalled. Default Windows 10 apps will be automatically installed. But non-defaults Windows 10 apps will need to be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Let us try repairing the existing OS.
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21284-enable-disable-fast-boot-uefi-firmware-settings-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21284-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help, consider doing a clean install after rescuing your files.

<h3> lawrencereid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Compatibility with windows 10 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>I have had Microsoft DIGITAL IMAGE SUITE 6 for quite a number of years and I have found it one of the best Photo software's around. I now find after upgrading to Windows 10 64 bit version that my software will not install and it is incompatible with 64 bit
 version but will install on 32 bit version.</p>
<p>I find it astonishing that Microsoft continue upgrading windows without allowing users to be able to install their software.</p>
<p>Is there any possible way to install my DIGITAL IMAGE SUITE on windows 10 64 bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel that the developers should address these compatibility issues when they supposedly improve Windows version.</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before assisting further, do you know the password of the administrator account that is prompted to enter on the screen?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>An administrator account is a user account that lets you make changes that will affect other users. Administrators can change security settings, install software and hardware, and access all
 files on the computer. Administrators can also make changes to other user accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You will be able to take/change rights to the account only if you are the administrator with complete user rights on the PC. If you are using a local or administrator with limited user rights
 account, you will not be able to delete, create or make changes to the account unless you know the administrator password of the actual administrative user profile.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to convert the user account to administrator account by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows</strong> logo key on the keyboard, type <strong>Control panel</strong> and click on the top most search result<strong>.</strong></span></li><li><span>Select
<strong>User Accounts</strong> or <strong>Change account type </strong>from the window and click on<strong>
</strong>your user account name<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></span></li><li><span>Select
<strong>Administrator</strong> and click on <strong>Change account type.</strong></span></li><li><span>Close the window and check if the changes are effective.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Write to us with the status of the issue on the same post for further assistance.
</span><span>Your reply is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p>On my Inbox window, I clicked the Accounts tab, then went to Properties and Advanced and there I saw that the 'Leave a copy of messages on the server." box was already unchecked.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I when I went to my mail server (Road Runner) site, I had no messages in my inbox, hardly any in the delete and sent folders.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I called Road Runner about the email message, they said the doubted it was sent from them because the 'from'&nbsp; was Admin&nbsp; with no rr email address.&nbsp; They had me forward the email to
</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;.&nbsp; I have not yet heard back from them on this.&nbsp; Road Runner had advised me to contact Windows Live Mail about it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Do you still think&nbsp; it is legit?</p>

            <p>It is a legitimate message from your mail server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My email is hosted by Time Warner Cable/Spectrum (TWC)&nbsp;which is/was affiliated with Road Runner.&nbsp; When TWC first bought our local cable company my email was initially hosted through a Road Runner email server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suddenly started receiving this message and Outlook&nbsp;has always been&nbsp;set to delete message messages from server after downloading.&nbsp; I logged on to my email account through webmail and checked the "Inbox", "Drafts", "Sent Mail", "Deleted Items" and "Junk
 Mail" folders&nbsp;to make sure they were empty.&nbsp; The usage indicator still showed that I was using over 70% of my allotted server space.&nbsp; I then noticed 2 links&nbsp;in small print below the button for "Manage Folders".&nbsp; These were labeled "Deleted Messages" and "Sent
 Messages" and are folders that I did not create.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Sent Messages" folder contained a copy of every email that I sent from my iPad.&nbsp; These messages had been deleted from the "Sent Folder" but something caused copies to be kept in this folder.&nbsp; It only kept messages sent from my iPad, not my desktop,
 laptop or Android phone.&nbsp; Since I don't have an iPhone, I don't know if it's an Apple issue or only something with my iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On webmail I deleted the messages from this "Sent Messages" folder which moved them to the "Deleted Items" folder.&nbsp; I then permanently deleted the messages from my "Deleted Items" folder and my usage indicator dropped to 0%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also deleted the "Deleted Messages" and "Sent Messages" folders (use "Manage Folders") and will check back in a few weeks to see if my iPad recreates them.&nbsp; If so, I'll have to manage these folders on a regular basis.</p>

            <p>JRW42,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i finally determined the the root cause of the problem and you're correct, it is a legitimate message from the time warner / roadrunner mail server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I found was that somehow my email account *on the web server* was set to a limit of 10 megabytes! &nbsp;No wonder when someone sent me an email with photos I'd go over the 10 meg limit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution was to go into the web server mail settings and change the limit to 1 gigabyte! &nbsp;No more over the mailbox limit messages!</p>

<p>The Microsoft Community Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your following up to check whether I have received any response. To date no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To add a bit more, I also tried the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant. After the first stage on checking compatibility, when I clicked 'next' the message was 'we can't connect right now (check your internet connection or try again)'</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means whether I try the upgrade assistant or directly from the DVD on windows 8 Pro that I purchased, (where I got the message as mentioned in the above), I am unable to proceed further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing I noticed was that I cannot open my Norton Antivirus even though it is running.</p>

<h2>            How to disable or hide the Search Box on the Windows 7 Start Menu with group policy&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Can anyone tell me how to disable and/or hide the Search Box on the Windows 7 Start Menu with group policy?&nbsp; I'm creating group policies to lock down the desktop so that users may select only a couple of shortcuts on the Start Menu: they don't need the Search
 Box.&nbsp; I've figured out how to lock down pretty much everything else, but there isn't any obvious setting to make the Search Box go away entirely.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for your time and help in these regards.</p>

<h2>            Modifying Windows 8.1 for those who want to ease into the new stuff... &#40;and extra tips&#41;</h2>
                    <p>**<strong><em>PLEASE NOTE</em></strong> **</p>
<p>This is posted just to have a place to discuss ways to modify the look/feel and such of Windows 8.1.&nbsp; It is not to complain about the way things are or c/should be: please do that elsewhere if you feel the need.&nbsp; Let's keep this as a discussion to direct
 people to who want to know methods of arranging Windows 8.1 features, functions and layouts that makes them more comfortable/gives them back familiarity while they choose whether or not to learn the new stuff included in Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to add the tips/tricks you have discovered in modifying Windows 8.1 for yourself of others that made them more comfortable using it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to not be the one that starts some flamewar because of a decision that it would be 'cute' &nbsp;('smart', etc.) to add, "I just switched to ____" or "____ sucks" or any other derogatory statement instead of something constructive for those looking for assistance.</p>
<p>**<strong><em>PLEASE NOTE</em></strong> **</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lots of complaints out there about the way Windows 8.1 looks and feels.&nbsp; Most of it usually centers around the "in your face" start menu screen or the gestures that seem to get in some percentage of people's ways because of mannerisms they have picked up
 over the years, etc.&nbsp; The good thing about Windows 8.1 is that there are PLENTY of choices you can utilize to easily return to something more familiar until you can adjust better to some of the new ways of doing things.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now I know some people may have seen/used the utilities that bring back the Windows XP-7 Start Button Menu amongst other things - and although you can install a third party utility to give you the functionality of the "Start Button Menu" back - it may or
 may not be something you need to do.&nbsp; I suggest *against* it, but as I know some will still want it - there are many utilities that add back the "Start Button Menu" as well as help one adjust other settings some find disconcerting in Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Here's a
 good list of some such utilities ...<br />
<a href="http://www.eightforums.com/customization/12971-list-start-menu-replacements-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eightforums.com/customization/12971-list-start-menu-replacements-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
</p>
<p>... to get you started.&nbsp; Some cost, some are free, etc.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However, I personally haven't seen the need for such a utility.&nbsp; Nor have many people I have upgraded to Windows 8/8.1.&nbsp; Many have found that they seldom utilized the "Start Button Menu" and thus they in-turn seldom utilize the "Start Screen Menu" in the
 same manner.&nbsp; I highly suggest you try the few tips here to get you started with Windows 8.1 as it will be better for you in the long run and better for your overall experience, in my opinion.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The desktop mode is still basically the same other than no 'start button menu' and a few missing "prettifications" like Aero Glass.&nbsp; The search is still generally the same as as Vista/7.&nbsp; Some interactions such as managing wireless network profiles, accessing
 certain "power-user" level features and the likes may be a bit different dependent on how you utilized Vista/7, but not really a show-stopper.&nbsp; It is understandable that all the new stuff presented at once can be overwhelming - but hopefully this discussion
 can help with that - getting you back to something more familiar.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Truthfully - making Windows 8.1 work in a manner that allows you to learn the new stuff at your own pace (if at all) could be here...<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
1. Create and utilize a <em>LOCAL</em> user account for most of your activities.&nbsp; There is little need to tie yourself to a Microsoft Live Account if you are not worried over "Cloud Storage" and all the synchronizing between Windows 8.1 devices, etc.&nbsp; You have,
 if you have been a Windows user up until now, always likely used a local account on your personal/home computers - there is no one FORCING you to do otherwise now.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Change it so the system boots and returns to the desktop by default.&nbsp; A lot of people complain the new Start Screen Menu is overwhelming and difficult to navigate with a mouse (or even touch screen for some) - so booting into and using the familiar desktop
 by default helps to adjust to the new operating system more quickly.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. *If* you miss/need the Start Button Menu - utilize the taskbar in desktop mode in the same manner you could in prior versions of Windows.&nbsp; Use the built-in Internet Explorer quicklaunch Toolbar taskbar and/or create a couple of taskbar folders to quickly
 access the old "Start Button Menu" structure you may be missing.&nbsp; It takes two folders to do this, but you could make a 'Library' out of these two folders and then just have one taskbar folder for accessing all that old structure.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Disable some of the gestures that seem to bother some percentage of users who seemingly routinely put their mouse pointer in the upper/lower corners of their screens.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Install all the same applications you are used to and USE them!&nbsp; Those that you can, of course.&nbsp; You aren't moving Outlook Express if you are coming from XP, really old software,different architecture dependent software, etc.&nbsp; However, if it ran on Windows
 Vista/7 - most of it runs on Windows 8.1 as well.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think that looks difficult/complex and/or looks like it will take a long time?&nbsp; It isn't and it won't.&nbsp; Below is some step-by-step instruction as well as tips later on to assist you along this simple journey and get you using your computer and learning
 the newer features and methods at your own pace.&nbsp; Essentially the numbered sections below explain in more detail the numbered sections above.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align: left"><strong><em>(1)</em></strong><br />
Many people didn't even know you could use Windows 8.1 with a non-Microsoft Live account - but you can, some might even say you should, but no need to digress.&nbsp; Make the switch to/back to a local account:<br />
<a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/windows-and-office/quick-tip-change-microsoft-live-to-a-local-account-in-windows-81/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/windows-and-office/quick-tip-change-microsoft-live-to-a-local-account-in-windows-81/&nbsp;
</a><br />
[ Why the web page link?&nbsp; Why re-invent the wheel?...&nbsp; The instructions are there, straight-forward and fairly simplistic. ]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<strong><em>(2)</em></strong><br />
Booting to the desktop is probably the most immediate gratification/relief that someone who is just irritated/confused or otherwise disjointed by the Windows 8.1 Start Screen Menu.&nbsp; This does not make it go away nor does it bring back a start button menu, etc.
 - but it does get you back to a familiar look.<br />

&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter Desktop Mode.&nbsp; It's an icon on the Start Screen Menu (labeled "Desktop") or press the Windows logo key
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2f6.2%2fmain%2faa922834-ed43-40f1-8830-d5507badb56c_91.jpg" />+D to get there.<br />
</li><li>Right-click the taskbar (bar at the bottom of the screen that has been there for MANY editions of Windows), choose Properties --&gt; Navigation.<br />
</li><li>Locate and check (<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fofficeimg.vo.msecnd.net%2fen-us%2ffiles%2f309%2f220%2fZA001117940.gif" />) the box for "When I sign in or close all apps on a screen, go to the desktop instead of Start".<br />
</li><li>Click OK.<br />
</li></ol>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/abae0284-9d4c-49d3-a400-ea2523e69f68" /><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Reboot.&nbsp; Notice the difference?&nbsp; Take a deep breath, things are getting more familiar already!<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><em>(3)</em></strong><br />
</p>
<p>Put some shortcuts on the desktop itself to the applications you installed/use often or pin them to the taskbar.&nbsp; You've likely done both of these things before in Windows Vista/7.&nbsp; Some of the tips below are generalized.&nbsp; You can pick and choose as you
 like from them (if at all) to better manage your desktop environment.&nbsp; Truthfully - you could use these even if you were using Windows XP, Vista, 7, etc. in many cases.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
I personally like to make my taskbar twice as tall as normal and use the Internet Explorer Quick Launch toolbar as it lets me put more in a smaller space.&nbsp; I've used this since Windows XP, at least.&nbsp; Of course, I use 24" and up monitors for my system, so the
 double-height taskbar may not be something good for you.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
For more information on the taskbar for Windows 8, check this out:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/use-the-taskbar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/use-the-taskbar</a><br />
&nbsp; <br />
Things I have found useful over the years and still in Windows 8.1 - and found on the web page linked above are:</p>
<ul>
<li>"To unlock the taskbar" under "Move the taskbar"<br />
</li><li>"Combine when taskbar is full" under "Change how taskbar buttons appear"<br />
</li><li>"To minimize all the open windows on the desktop" under "Take a look at the desktop"<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Resizing the taskbar height is just making sure it is not locked and clicking/dragging in the right place.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/resize-taskbar#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/resize-taskbar#1TC=windows-7</a><br />
[ Yes - Windows 7 link because the methodology is still the same for the task at hand.&nbsp; As it was in Windows XP and Vista as well. ]<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adding the IE quicklaunch toolbar is easy if you want to do it, but there are nuances ('Showing Text', 'Showing Titles', moving to the left or right side, etc.) so again I am deferring to a web link that has more space and better images.&nbsp; While this particular
 link is for Windows 8 - the same instructions work for Windows Vista, 7 and 8.1.<br />
<a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/5069-quick-launch-add-taskbar-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/5069-quick-launch-add-taskbar-windows-8-a.html</a></p>
<p>[<a href="http://youtu.be/bXH1HeMKaGE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Demonstrative YouTube Video">VIDEO LINK</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/bXH1HeMKaGE?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/bXH1HeMKaGE?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I don't personally miss the "Start Button" or "Start Orb" menu system, but some people swear by it - although I have found many can live without it once they have the links either on the desktop, taskbar or in the quicklaunch toolbar from above.&nbsp; You
 could use one of the many utilities already mentioned, but I just don't think there is a need.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is how to create a 'library' (an ability around since Vista, at least) that contains the folders (2 of them) that make up the content of the "Start Button/Start Orb menu": simply the list of applications and shortcuts that almost every application you
 install will likely still put there for a while to come.&nbsp; This is probably the most
<em>complicated</em> thing you might do to bring back some part of the older version of Windows, and truthfully, it's more lengthy in than actually complicated in my opinion.</p>

<ol>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
<li>Press the Windows Logo Key + S (or Q) on your keyboard and that should open the "Search" bar on the right side of the screen.&nbsp; It's probably looking "Everywhere" and that is fine.&nbsp; Type in the word:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; libraries<br />
<br />
and press ENTER.&nbsp; That should bring up the Windows Explorer window in "Libraries" view.<br />
</li><li>At the top find "New Item" and click on it to drop the choices down and choose "Library".&nbsp; You can name it what you want, I kept it simple and called it "Start Menu".<br />
</li><li>Now right-click on the new library you just created (should see it alongside the "Documents", "Music", "Pictures" and "Videos" libraries on the lower right part of the window you opened) and choose "Properties" from the menu that comes up.&nbsp; This is where
 you can add the multiple folders that this library will contain.<br />
</li><li>Click on the "Add..." button.</li><li>In the top address bar type in:<br />
&nbsp; %appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs<br />
Press Enter.<br />
</li><li>At the bottom-right part of the window, click on the "Include folder" button.<br />
</li><li>Click on the "Add..." button.<br />
</li><li>In the top address bar type in:<br />
&nbsp; %programdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs<br />
Press Enter.<br />
</li><li>At the bottom-right part of the window, click on the "Include folder" button.<br />
&nbsp; </li><li>Click OK.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>Now you have a Library that contains the two main lists of programs the old Start Button/Start Orb menu used to populate its list.&nbsp; You can now create a pseudo and simplified version of that Start Button menu list of installed programs on your taskbar if
 you like.&nbsp; Here's how:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click or press and hold on an empty space on the taskbar, click/tap on Toolbars, and click/tap on New toolbar.<br />
</li><li>In the top address bar, click and type in (replacing whatever is there):<br />
&nbsp; libraries<br />
... and press enter.&nbsp; You should see the list of libraries, one of which is the one you created above.<br />
</li><li>Double-click on the one you created from before and then click on "Select Folder" at the bottom right section of the window.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>Now you have a taskbar toolbar that has the text from the name of the Library and possibly two folder icons in it.&nbsp; If you resize that/move it around per the instructions from the "quicklaunch Toolbar" from above, it can look like a button menu-system.&nbsp;
 Later I will have a picture of this.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that was a lot of information - but again - you don't have to use it all, only the parts you like/want to use.&nbsp; Also, this part [(3)] essentially should work wind Windows Vista or 7 as well.&nbsp; Mostly work in Windows XP even.<br />

<li>Right-click on the taskbar and select Properties option.<br />

<li>Move your mouse cursor to top-right or bottom-right corner of screen and click on Settings icon present in Charms Bar.<br />

</li><li>Now go to "PC &amp; devices<strong> </strong>--&gt; Corners &amp; edges" section.<br />

<ol>
<li>Open the notepad application (Windows Logo Key + R, type in NOTEPAD and click OK.)</li><li>Paste the following into notepad:<br />
<br />
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
<br />
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ImmersiveShell\EdgeUI]<br />
"DisableCharmsHint"=dword:00000001<br />
&nbsp; <br />
</li><li>From the Notepad menu, choose "File" --&gt; "Save As".</li><li>Choose the "Desktop" from the left pane.</li><li>Change the "Save as type" and the bottom to "All Files (*.*)".</li><li>For a File Name type:<br />
DisableCharms.reg</li><li>Click on "Save".</li><li>Close the notepad application.</li><li>Locate the file (DisableCharms.reg) on your desktop and double-click it.</li><li>Answer in the affirmative to all questions.</li></ol>
<p>Now the upper and lower right corners are inactive for the charms.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can still open the charms by going to the lower/upper right corner with the pointer and dragging straight up/down.&nbsp; It's just a little more effort than hitting that corner was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><em>(5)</em></strong><br />
</p>
<p>The last thing I suggest is installing and using the same applications you used before.&nbsp; Sounds simple because... it is.&nbsp; It's an important tip, though.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you used and liked Mozilla Thunderbird or Windows Live Mail 2012 before - install and use them now.&nbsp; If you used Skype - download and install the desktop edition for Windows.&nbsp; If you have always used Adobe Reader for PDFs, download and install it now.&nbsp;
 Google Chrome?&nbsp; Mozilla Firefox?&nbsp; Google Earth?&nbsp; Paint.NET?&nbsp; OpenOffice or LibreOffice?&nbsp; Microsoft Office?&nbsp; iTunes?&nbsp; VLC media player?&nbsp; The list goes on and on.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is still Microsoft Windows - don't start treating it like a tablet because one screen and some gesture capabilities give you that OPTION now.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That could get you to a place where you are comfortable using Windows 8.1 without *ANY* third party applications, fancy registry hacks or anything other than, really, stuff native to WIndows 8.1 and stuff, in some cases, you could have done in Windows Vista/Windows
 7.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Here's a few random tips</span></em></strong><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>The lower-left section of Windows 8.1's main screen (the Windows Logo icon) has a lot of surprises when you
<em>right-click</em> on it.&nbsp; Try it.&nbsp; That's the mouse button you DON'T USE to make the selection, but to get more choices.<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b233d75d-00c7-4601-858d-4cc9ac83c905" /><br />
&nbsp; <br />
</li><li>If you have a bar pop-up or the start screen come up and you don't want it there - press the ESC key.<br />
&nbsp; </li><li>There are MANY ways to shutdown Windows 8.1.&nbsp; People seem to have trouble with this one, so...<br />
1. Pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL and clicking on the power button at the bottom right. [<a href="http://youtu.be/Q1T3H74pDwg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Demonstrative YouTube Video">VIDEO LINK</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/Q1T3H74pDwg?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/Q1T3H74pDwg?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>]<br />
2. Right-click on the Windows Logo in the bottom left of the screen and choosing a "shut down or sign out" option (conveniently I imaged this above.) [<a href="http://youtu.be/8WMd26xnO8A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Demonstrative YouTube Video">VIDEO
 LINK</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/8WMd26xnO8A?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/8WMd26xnO8A?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>]<br />
3. Launch the Charms bar, click on the Settings charm, and then select the Power icon. [<a href="http://youtu.be/9Hz6CzGvBug" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Demonstrative YouTube Video">VIDEO LINK</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/9Hz6CzGvBug?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/9Hz6CzGvBug?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>]<br />
4. I've used this method, but it's a little long; at the Start screen, click on your account photo in the upper right corner and then select the Sign out option. Click your mouse or tap any key to get past the Lock screen. At the log-in screen, click on the
 Shut down button in the lower right corner. [<a href="http://youtu.be/pjTx55MCGXU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Demonstrative YouTube Video">VIDEO LINK</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/pjTx55MCGXU?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/pjTx55MCGXU?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>]<br />
5. Just press the actual physical power button (not holding it down, just pressing it once and letting go to start the shutdown process.)<br />
6. For those that have a touchscreen (I don't usually) - perhaps this: open File Explorer and navigate to the Windows\System32 folder. Scroll down the folder's contents until you see a file called "SlideToShutDown.exe". Double-click that file, and the lock
 screen appears at the top half of the screen promoting you to slide your finger down to exit Windows. Just slide your finger to power down.&nbsp; To make this option more handy, right-click on the "SlideToShutDown.exe" file and select the option to Pin to Start.
 Now you have a Start screen tile that you can click on or tap whenever you want to shut down Windows. [<a href="http://youtu.be/-6AtUCwnDUE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Demonstrative YouTube Video">VIDEO LINK</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/-6AtUCwnDUE?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/-6AtUCwnDUE?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>]<br />
7. There is a power button at the top-right area of Windows 8.1 Update 1, the start screen menu, now.&nbsp; Click it, see your choices there.&nbsp; (You still click the username to the left of it for logoff type options.)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
</li><li>Ask.&nbsp; That's what forums like these are for.&nbsp; Ask your question (not this discussion specifically, this is a
<em>discussion</em>, not a place to reply and ask your question: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/page/faq#faqAskQuestion1">
How to ask a question</a>)<br />
&nbsp; </li><li>DON'T PANIC.&nbsp; It isn't that bad.&nbsp; It's a computer, it does what you tell it to.&nbsp; Deep breath, relax, figure it out.&nbsp; Don't go in expecting everything to be like it was.</li></ul>
<p><br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>&lt;extra images&gt;</p>
<p>In case anyone was curious what a Windows 8.1 system with the above modifications could look like (sans any fancy background image) - here it is:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/518e7e77-a2ce-4902-914a-f9c9fe2907b0" /><br />
<br />
All Windows 8.1 and no third party applications to change the look or feel; all built-in options, many of which were there in Windows Vista and Windows 7 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The home made "Start Button Menu" looks like this...<br />

<p>&lt;/extra images&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;Hope that helps someone!</p>

            <p>Thank you, Shenan.&nbsp; This has been the far most comprehensive and helpful post I've seen so far.&nbsp; Saved it - just in case.&nbsp; :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For all my b*tching and moaning about Win8, I have from the beginning been determined to not make this OS look like anything else old I'm familiar with, and muddle my way through it as is without downloading anything third party&nbsp;at all.&nbsp; I still don't like
 it but I've had some free time to futz around with it and while I admit I'm still irritated with it, I have figured out on my own how to make some of the very changes you suggest above to make life a little easier for me, without watching a single tutorial
 or reading any instructions.&nbsp; Got rid of most of the tiles, don't even boot to Classic, just made me a nice big tile for it on Metro and go straight there.&nbsp; Weather and a&nbsp;select few live tiles can be handy.&nbsp; I've even found a few occasions where touchscreen
 can be handy (though I still hate fingerprints on my screen).&nbsp; I came straight to Win8 after&nbsp;mostly using only XP since whenever that came out,&nbsp;and it really freaked me out - but so far there has been no computer I couldn't somehow fix / adapt - yet - in over
 twenty years. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!&nbsp; </p>

            <p><span>Hi SS – that is a pretty good rundown of getting 8.1 to work on the desktop. As we know from other threads, people tend to customize their desktops to suit their own requirements, or to add features they hear about that they think are useful. I would
 add/expand on a few of your ideas.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>While your approach to your start library is interesting, I think an equally good approach is to (i) Pin your key programs (Word, Acrobat, Firefox etc or whatever you use) to the taskbar, and pin often used files to each program, (ii) create a desktop
 toolbar, from which all other programs run, (iii) create a QuickLaunch toolbar from which all useful functions and features run and (iv) place shutdown icons on the taskbar (see below).
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Place shutdown icons on the taskbar. This allows you to shutdown or restart with one click.</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/594e8024-c9f0-4623-9821-a3d750e85957" /></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Navigate to the desktop.</span></li><li><span>Right click on the desktop and select New -&gt; Shortcut. A shortcut menu appears.</span></li><li><span>Enter shutdown /s /t 0 (zero) in the location box and hit Next.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Enter a name for the shortcut and click Finish. A new shortcut will appear on your desktop.</span></li><li><span>Right click on the shortcut and select Properties. A dialog box appears.</span></li><li><span>Click Change Icon under the Shortcut tab then Click Ok in warning box that says shutdown.exe contains no icons.</span></li><li><span>Select an Icon from the list of available images Click Ok twice (once to close the Change Icon window and once to close Properties window). Your shortcut will now have an icon.</span></li><li><span>Right click the icon and select Pin to Taskbar</span></li><li><span>Delete the shortcut from the desktop (otherwise it will be included in your desktop toolbar taking up useful space)</span></li><li><span>Repeat the previous steps to c
</li></ol>
<p><span>“shutdown /r /t 0″ in the location field.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>11. Hard shutdown “shutdown.exe /s /f /t 00″. This will shutdown the computer without asking you about whether you want to close particular programs</span><span><br />
</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>The QuickLaunch toolbar is particularly useful – you can put what ever you want in it. Mine is below</span>:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a7c3737-8841-4bc6-982e-b6435da7ce33" /><br />
</p>
<p>The beauty of QuickLaunch used like this, is that it can be copied to a new hard-drive or computer to re-establish all functions. It is best to store it in your data partition (if you have one) so that it is backed up regularly. Or back it up out of the
 Internet Explorer folder in Users.</p>

            <p>To anyone that might be having trouble with the physical power button on the computer: look for power options in control panel. Or, when you get to "system and security", there is a blue link labeled "change what the power buttons do." that is more direct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>bloated metro apps that came with the PC that you are never going to use can be removed very easily: just right-click their tile and select "uninstall".</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>BTW: Windows 8.1 preview never allowed a tester to make a local account during setup. Microsoft announced that a user would be able to make a local account in the final release, but, for some reason, they never got around to making it that way.</em></p>

            <p>It was nice that you posted about navigating with windows 8.1. </p>
<p>Frankly I regret getting windows 8.1 pro. It has been a total disaster. The worst of it is that I cannot connect my dlan TV, to my home network. I have tried everything that I have read here. It just does not work. What was Microsoft thinking. Did they really
 expect people to go out and buy thousands of dollars worth of new TV's with Miracast capability, just because they upgraded to windows 8.1? Really they should have made windows 8.1 DLAN friendly. After all that is why DLAN was created.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions as to how I can connect dlan devices to my computer, I would like to know about it.</p>
<p>Right now as things stand, I would advise every one not to get windows 8.1, if they have DLAN devices. unless Microsoft provides an update that fixes this problem.</p>

            <p>I think this fits here... Many people seemed to like the "Windows Experience Index" for whatever reason. &nbsp;Its removal from 8.1 struck a chord with some.</p>
<p>
</p><p>luckily - as with most of modern Windows - the GUI you see is just a front to some built-in command line commands and/or powershell script running in the background - most of the time whose variables you are choosing by checkboxes in the GUI - but I digress
 a bit there.</p>

<p>...</p>
<p>Here is how to get the WEI numbers via a simple script/command in powershell:</p>

<span>Right-click on Command Prompt and select Run as administrator from the context menu.</span></li><li>
<span>Confirm the User Account Control prompt by selecting Yes.</span></li><li>
<span>Type&nbsp;<strong>winsat prepop</strong>&nbsp;and hit enter.</span></li><li>
<span>It will run the Windows System Assessment Tool which may take a moment to complete.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>The scores are not displayed to you here. What you need to do next is to run PowerShell to display them in the interface.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Tap on Windows-X and select Windows PowerShell (Admin) from the context menu.</span></li><li>
<span>Confirm the UAC prompt.</span></li><li>
<span>Type&nbsp;<strong>Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_WinSAT</strong>&nbsp;and hit enter.</span></li><li>
<span>The Windows Experience Index subscores and base score are displayed afterwards.</span></li></ol>

<p><span>Note: Scores are updated regularly to reflect the progress made by new hardware generations. Basically, the higher the score the better. I would not put too much thought into the base score though, as it does not reflect the overall performance

            <p>Thanks for mentioning the physical power button.&nbsp; I know exactly where it is on the front edge of the machine yet&nbsp;it is so tiny&nbsp;it is difficult to push&nbsp;the little bitty thing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said somewhere earlier - the joys of Windows - having the ability to do&nbsp;many things&nbsp;in several different ways.&nbsp; I've unpinned / uninstalled tiles and moved them around and even created a few of my own.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate the charms and slide-out stuff.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>But.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever got off on the wrong exit and end up in bumfrak, wtf?&nbsp; Well, Win8 seems to be like that.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes I enjoy getting lost because that is how I learn to find my way around, and sometimes there's even scenery and you learn something along the way.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was suddenly stuck with Win8 when my beloved ancient XP machine&nbsp;chanced to croak at&nbsp;the worst possible&nbsp;time in my life when I suddenly desperately needed to crunch 24/7 with very little time.&nbsp; My old HP printer&nbsp;decided it&nbsp;didn't want to&nbsp;live anymore either.&nbsp;
 Murphy probably had something to do with this.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It was not cool and I was enraged at the complexity of this "intuitive" system.&nbsp; I'd never even seen a ribbon before but am in the process of fixing that annoyance also.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's okay.&nbsp; We'll make it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be happy to offer any advice - if I remember how I did it.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I usually do a quick google search and find something that solves my current problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shenan says well.&nbsp; Don't panic.&nbsp; It is still a computer that does what you tell it to.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we have to figure out how to talk to them in a modified&nbsp;language.&nbsp; It's all still there, it's annoying as heck, and I can b*tch about it all day long but
 this suits no purpose.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Live and let live.&nbsp; (and die),&nbsp; </p>

<p>Quite honestly, I would not advise any legacy user to get any&nbsp;version of anything past XP, but that is only my own opinion and probably not even possible anymore.&nbsp; I missed out on Vista and 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait until something better&nbsp;comes up, if you can.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently inherited a Toshiba laptop with Win 7.&nbsp; Ribbon.&nbsp; Huh?&nbsp; WTF?&nbsp; What an annoying piece of unintelligible clutter.&nbsp; &nbsp;Haven't used&nbsp;this machine&nbsp;in several months.&nbsp; Don't like it either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess I'm just an old grouch.&nbsp;&nbsp; I haven't "upgraded" to 8.1 yet, having enough &lt;cough&gt; fun with 8.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know what to say about your situation.&nbsp; In my case I have found solutions, some extremely expensive, to my Win8 problems.&nbsp; I am not happy at all about these&nbsp;massive expenses.&nbsp; Not thrilled with Win8 either.&nbsp; But somewhere if you dig around long
 enough, this OS isn't entirely useless. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can tell you is that somewhere in&nbsp;the software and settings of Win 8&nbsp;some useful stuff is still there.&nbsp; They made it a lot harder to find and renamed our old legacy terminology and some stuff like serial cables are getting really hard to
 find, as they we are "moving on" as is said.&nbsp; I've replaced my LP's with cassettes with CD's and guess what, I found record players at Walmart last week.&nbsp; After giving up a record collection that was well over 40 years old.&nbsp; Sorry, I'm rambling, but maybe
 somebody will get the point ...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the world is so much larger.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Just like Naman R&nbsp;and Mike Hall&nbsp;said, you can get them from the Windows Store.&nbsp;Solitaire and Freecell are bundled together in the

<h2>            System Restore Not Working in Windows 8.1 - Need Help&#33;</h2>
                    This is how it all started, I guess. Or, when I noticed the problem. I am not sure if one issue has to do with the other in this case, but I do know System Restore worked fine when I seemed to have issues after initially upgrading from Windows 8 to 8.1
 on my HP Laptop. One day, when I clicked my desktop shortcut to access and check-on Windows Update, the program seemed to lock-up; so I had to reboot to close it out. (I could still access Windows Update from the Control Panel, however). From there, I used
 the Update Troubleshooter just to make sure nothing was wrong with Windows Update. To make a long story short, the Troubleshooter indicated that it had fixed some issues, but when I went back to the Windows Update program, I had noticed that my Update History
 had vanished!!! The Troubleshooter seemed to have deleted my Windows Update History! So, when I went to do a System Restore to possibly get it back, I got some kind of error message indicating that the System Restore had failed, be

            <p>Yes, the error message that I have been getting is as follows: <em><strong>"System Restore failed while scanning the file system on the drive C:\ The drive might be corrupt. You might want to try System Restore after running CHKDSK/R on the disc. An unspecified
 error occurred during System Restore. (0x80070013)..."</strong></em> Now, per your response, I did an
<strong>SFC Scan</strong> and&nbsp;I sort of got conflicting messages. For instance, after the scan was completed I got this message:
<em><strong>"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them."</strong></em> But when I checked the log, it ended with this message:
<strong><em>"Verify and Repair Transaction completed. All files and registry keys listed in this transaction&nbsp; have been successfully repaired."</em></strong> The log to me is pretty much gibberish, and of course, very difficult to decipher, unless I guess you
 are a Microsoft Programmer. However, there is one thing that caught my attention that did&nbsp;seem to make sense, in a way. (For several reasons, maybe).&nbsp;If I am correct, from what I could determine, it seems that what it may not have been able to repair, was
 something in relation to my HP Printer Drivers, maybe. Because, besides the message that "all files and registry keys have been repaired", etc.&nbsp;it seemed to be unable to repair&nbsp;about 4 files; Which,&nbsp;all seemed to be in&nbsp;reference to the HP Drivers, I think.
 For instance, here is sort of like the summation message after each set of files that it was unable to repair:<em><strong> "This component was referenced by [l:186{93}]"Microsoft-Windows-Printer-Drivers-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.3.9600.16384.INF_prncacla"</strong></em>
 Now, I have no idea what that means, but I do recognize two words in that sentence: "<strong>Printer</strong>" and "<strong>Drivers</strong>". You see, I had noticed recently, that in the Device Manager, I also got conflicting messages about the Printer and
 Drivers. For instance, when I right click on the Printer icon there, it says that the device is working properly but has no drivers. But when I go to update the drivers for the Printer, Windows indicates that it has the latest drivers! I don't get it? Another
 kind of oddly related thing, is&nbsp;that I did notice that Windows Update (after the upgrade to 8.1)&nbsp;did notify me about Driver Updates for the Printer, but&nbsp;that particular update always fails. So, I had to hide the update, so that&nbsp;Windows does not keep attempting
 to install an&nbsp;update for&nbsp;the same driver over and over again, that it is really&nbsp;unable to install! (As was the message I was getting in the past).&nbsp;Can you make any sense of all this? Funny thing though, I think the Printer (thank God) still works fine, even
 though I haven't used it from the Laptop in a while. But anyway, the&nbsp;next thing I&nbsp;attempted to&nbsp;do, is the CHKDSK thing.&nbsp;In fact I wonder if the message I got from System Restore is any relation to your
<strong>Method 4</strong>?. (But that is&nbsp;what I have the computer set to do next).&nbsp;I was kind of afraid and hesitant about doing System Restore after the SFC Scan, because,&nbsp;to be honest, I didn't want to get too&nbsp;depressed about all this. (Life is just too short,
 man).&nbsp;I mean, the computer is not even a year old! It would really su*k if I had to get a new one already. But anyway, please try to decipher all this and let me know what you think. Thanks...
</p>
<p>Well anyway, I&nbsp;just rebooted my computer after scheduling it to do a: chkdsk/r and sure enough, it doesn't seem to work. (Surprise!!!).&nbsp;It&nbsp;seems to have gotten stuck at 11%. In fact, it&nbsp;stayed at 11% for&nbsp;something like 30 minutes!!!&nbsp;Had to use the Power
 Button several times to shut-down my computer to get out of chkdsk. But now, it keeps coming back everytime I turn-on&nbsp;the computer.&nbsp;The message about possibly bypassing&nbsp;chkdsk&nbsp;before it initializes is not clear, and&nbsp;goes by really fast.&nbsp;So, being that it does
 not seem to be working&nbsp;(which is now yet&nbsp;another problem), how do&nbsp;I bypass checkdsk from automatically starting once I&nbsp;boot-up my PC? Unbelievable...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            EXACTLY the same thing is happening to me on two Windows 8.1 Pro desktop computers, both HP. &nbsp;One one of the computers one of my Windows Security updates is failing. &nbsp;The trouble shooter says everything is fixed, but update still doesn't load. &nbsp;DISM restore
 health fails due to some missing resource. &nbsp;My CHKDSK /r is hung at 11%. &nbsp; &nbsp;On the other computer, which had 11 security updates that would not load, same thing, except CHKDSK /r hung at 12% until after a couple of hours it timed out (according to System Manage
 event log). &nbsp;I tried CHKDSK /r twice. &nbsp; System Manage event log did show re-occurring failure to load a print driver of some sort. &nbsp; I did a complete rebuild starting with my licensed Windows Vista disk. &nbsp;After returning to Vista, the CHKDSK /r did run and
 it DID report repairs regarding some file involved with printer drivers. &nbsp;I then successfully updated to Vista Service Pack 2, upgraded to my licensed Windows 8 Pro, and then to

            <p>Yea. CHKDSK definitely works differently in Windows 8 (or 8.1) as compared to how it was designed in Vista. Since this post, and after doing some further research online, I found something which Praseetha Nair failed to mention, and which could have saved
 me allot of headaches and even possible destruction of my computer, (sorry Praseetha), is that, it is perfectly normal for this utility to hang at 11%. Unlike CHKDSK with Vista, which gives you a step by step analysis of what it is doing, with Windows 8, there
 is nothing like that, and it just hangs at 11% for hours, but it is never-the-less still doing its job. Be patient, it just takes a very long time. My advice to you, is to perform the CHKDSK before you go to sleep and let it run through the night. (It takes
 that long!) And when you wake up in the morning, you should see the Welcome screen on your computer, and that CHKDSK has completed its job. Hope this helps, if you haven't already figured it out...</p>

            Thank you for your response. &nbsp;Well, we did what you suggested regarding CHKDSK yesterday on the still "broken" computer, but I have not yet tried to do a Windows Update. &nbsp;The unloaded Security Update is still there, but I had to go to work at that point.
 &nbsp; Unfortunately on my other PC (which has since been rebuilt) I tried CHKDSK /r twice. &nbsp;Each time it hung at 12%, then after several hours it (per the System Manage event log) timed out due to "no response". &nbsp; In both cases the repair evidently did not happen,
 and Windows Update still failed. &nbsp;It took Vista's CHKDSK /r to (and I saw the message) do the repair. &nbsp; Having an HP printer &nbsp;driver file corrupted probably also explains why &nbsp;an SFC.exe /scannow always give s clean bill of health.

            <p>Had a time to check. &nbsp;Windows Update still fails and DISM restore health still reports a resource is missing. &nbsp;In the System Manage event log, around the time the PC rebooted from the CHKDSK is the error message:&nbsp;<span><strong>The

            Yea, that definitely sucks. And can be very frustrating. I completely understand. You may need to consult a decent professional technician on that one, and/or inquire with someone at the store where you bought it. I know Best Buy for instance, has the
 Geek Squad at their locations and could have a look at it for you, as one possible solution. May be something to consider. Just sayin'...

<p>Hi Kerrimoon,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;What is the total size of the files?<br />
2.&nbsp;Which email program are you using?<br />
3.&nbsp;What happen when you try to just attach the files?<br />
4.&nbsp;How did you zip the files?</p>
<p>Each email program has its own restrictions on total size of file that can be sent as an email attachment.</p>
<p>There are some third party programs available online which would help you in zipping the files in more less storage space.<br />
Use your favorite search engine to search for such program which would help you to accomplish this task.</p>

<p>Hey BobLindquist</p>
<p>
</p><p>We really appreciate you posting on the Xbox Forums and providing that additional clarity as to what exactly we're attempting here</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to prevent the app from connecting to Xbox Live, you would essentially have to
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-on-windows/getting-started/signin-xbox-app-on-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
sign-out</a> of the app. "To sign out, go to the <strong>Settings</strong> screen in the Xbox app. At the top of the General tab, select
<strong>Sign out</strong>."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively you can choose to uninstall the app altogether, however this is only possible through the use of
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_comparison_operators?view=powershell-5.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
PowerShell commands</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Go ahead and give these a try and let me know what the results are&nbsp;on your end!</p>

<p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>depending on what you want to do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You can turn off the network connection from your Xbox network settings by choosing the option "Go offline"</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You can restrict your router from allowing the Xbox IP address, though I only encourage this option, if you know all about router configuration and network settings.</p>
<p>
