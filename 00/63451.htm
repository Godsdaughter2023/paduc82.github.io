<h2>            Windows Media Player problems after updates.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; After Installing the latest updates (13) today - 3-14-15,&nbsp; My desktop icon for WMP&nbsp;has been removed also I can no longer find Windows Media Player in my All Programs.&nbsp; I lost the icon and the listing for Windows Media Player in All Programs right after
 the needed reboot for the updates.&nbsp; A new reboot and a full shut off and power down doesn't correct anything to the way it was prior to installing updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Windows 7 - 64&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It is the same computer but I don't remember that post PA Bear.&nbsp; I installed the available updates today and when everything was done I noticed the icon for Windows Media Player was gone empty spot on my screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;So I figured I would find WMP in All Programs
 and send short cut&nbsp;to desktop and that was gone too.&nbsp; Since I've posted I found the WMP folder and right clicked and pinned wmplayer to start menu then dragged to desktop. So now I have a working icon on my desktop but Windows Media Player doesn't show up
 in All Programs anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Still at it PA Bear, you and I have spoken a few times all the way back to when Windows Defender had it's own newsgroup.&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember my good newsgroup friend Engel?</p>

            <p>I experienced the same problem, I restored to a earlier time and installed the updates one at a time.</p>
<p>The culprit was-KB3033929.</p>
<p>Used restore again, installed the other updates minus KB3033929 and have no more problems.</p>
<p>Hope this works for you.</p>

            <p>@ FrankPetherbridge,&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes apparently KB3033929 is causing lots of other problems also. Thanks for the help with finding that specific update:</p>

</p><p>COMMENT: FWIW all of the March updates for Win7 installed OK here. I remember that when I opened WMP the next day, it was like I'd never opened/used it before (e.g., I was presented with "make default for [extension]" and "media updates" options) but WMP
 icons&nbsp;hadn't gone&nbsp;missing. AFIK none of the Mar-15 security updates pertained to WMP &amp; I didn't install any optional, non-security updates. &lt;scratches head&gt;</p>

<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
<br />
The new Surface Pro with core i5 was not really designed for gaming and video editing. However, it has the components to support some of the recently released games depending on the system requirements. Since Age of Empire 3 is a game that was released years
 ago, there is no guarantee that it will work on a Windows 10 system due to compatibility issues. We suggest that you contact the game developer to find out if the game will work on Windows 10.
<br />
<br />
Most editing software recommends an i7 processor for faster video rendering especially in editing 4K videos. We also suggest that you check the list of supported hardware to run the GoPro video editing and playback apps by visiting the GoPro's support site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information about the technical specifications of the new Surface Pro, please refer to this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/devices/surface-pro/tech-specs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p>

            <div>AoE should work, although you may need compatibility mode on any Windows 10</div>

<p>I have the entire series (1 through 3 along with the expansion packs) and none of them will run in Windows 10 even with compatibility mode settings or using the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those, I have a Windows 7 laptop which I am using to run all of my old software with and when support for Windows 7 comes to an end on January 12th, 2020, I plan to shut off WiFi on that machine and just use it for old software.</p>

<p>There is a game as an alternative that you can try called "0AD" which is similar to AOE and the developers where involved with AOE II expansion pack and have a development history to AOE and the game is free.&nbsp; BUT!&nbsp; It is in 'Alpha' state but playable.&nbsp;
 However, from the tests I did with a Pro 3 is that the game is almost fully functional but scrolling to the right can be an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can read more about the game and get it from here: http://play0ad.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do remember that it is ALPHA!&nbsp; It works perfect on a Windows 10 desktop and laptop.</p>

<p>I thought to test some of the older programs on the Surface and I think with AOE, there is supposed to be a utility to download and install called "Play Now" in order for them to run.&nbsp; It does not come across with Windows 10.&nbsp; If I can figure out what/where
 "Play Now" comes from, probably can get it to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had found a brand new Acer Windows 7 laptop and thought to say "just heck with it" and use it for all of my old software.&nbsp; Some companies are still selling new Windows 7 machines and serves as an alternative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.: the Surface Laptop will be in my hands Monday afternoon and should be able to get a picture of the box label at that time.&nbsp; If the laptop doesn't work, it shows up just in time to be mounted on 20 bottle rockets for a 4th of July celebration!</p>

<p>Thanks for the link Barb, I will test that out a little later.&nbsp; DirectPlay is where "Play Now" comes from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, when I get the laptop, I will be keeping it with the normal Windows 10 Pro (after upgrading it) and will use it to test out the entire AOE series along with some other, older programs.&nbsp; That runtime system should also assist other software to function
 as well and not just games.</p>

<p>After digging around, a person has to go to Microsoft's Download Center and download "DirectX SDK" and install it and "THEN", for older games, using compatibility mode (Windows XP, SP3), the games should run.</p>
<p>

<br />
Hello to all, I have deleted the hearts,solitaire,,,(original games) on windows service pack 3.I did this accidentally last night and due to it going into power save mode constantly...I changed the battery on the motherboard today, so no restore points are
 available...my husband is so mad because he played those games...any suggestions?

            Perhaps you didn't really delete them (changing the battery on the motherboard doesn't have anything to do with this ... or with System Restore, but that's another issue).&nbsp; It's actually harder than you might think to delete these games.<br />
<br />
Click Start &gt; Search<br />
Click to search for "All files and folders"<br />
Set Look in to "Local Disk (C:)"<br />
Click "More advanced options"<br />
Click to search in system folders, hidden files and folders, and subfolders<br />
Search for sol.ex&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (that's right; omit the last e)<br />
<br />
If the search results include sol.exe, you're in luck.&nbsp; That file should be in C:\Windows\system32 AND C:\Windows\system32\dllcache<br />
<br />
You can do another search for mshearts.ex<br />
<br />
If you have the sol.exe and mshearts.exe files where they are supposed to be, all you have to do is restore the shortcuts to those files in the Start &gt; All Programs menu.&nbsp; Post back if you need help with this.<br />
<br />
If you really managed to remove all instances of sol.exe and mshearts.exe from your computer, you may still have found sol.ex_ and/or mshearts.ex_.&nbsp; If you are in this situation, post back and I'll explain what to do next.<br />
<br />
In order to follow the solution in the article suggested by Azam K, you'll need a real Windows XP install CD.&nbsp; My guess is that you don't have one.<br />

    <title>Windows 7 32Bit - DEP Blue Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sam nicholson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 32Bit - DEP Blue Screen</h2>
                    <p>m trying to disable DEP on my Windows 7 (32bit) installation, I am dual booting with 64 bit and every time I disable DEP upon restart I blue screen.</p>
<p>The blue screen message just says that Windows encountered a problem and recommends I run a CHKDSK which does nothing...</p>
<p>The odd thing I encourtered was when I disabled a setting in my BIOS called "Execute Disable Bit" then my 32bit installation blue screens with the same error (this is before I disable DEP ) then when I re-enable it no problems at all...</p>
<p>So I completely re-installed the 32 bit installation and disabled DEP then disabled that option in my BIOS and NO change.</p>
<p>I've of course Googled this but no solution has worked.</p>
<p>Any help would be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>You might have to do a repair install from the disk or possible have to reinstall the operating system.</p>
<p>1. Insert the Windows 7 DVD<br />
2. Restart your computer<br />
3. When asked if you want to boot from your DVD drive, do so.<br />
4. Choose your language, click Next.<br />
5. Click 'Repair your computer'<br />
6. Select operating system you want to repair.</p>
<p><strong>Also try these steps by JW Stuart [MVP]</strong></p>
<p>How to repair and reboot to Windows 7:<br />
<br />
a) Insert the Windows 7 System Repair DVD or Installation DVD and reboot.<br />
<br />
b) Select the correct keyboard input method and click ‘Next’.<br />
<br />
Note: If you are using the Windows7 Install DVD then at the 'Install Now' prompt (Do not pick the Install Now option) instead choose the 'Repair your computer' option located in the lower left of the dispay.<br />
<br />
c) The System Repair tool will search for a valid operating system and will report that “Windows found problems with your computer’s startup options. Do you want to apply repairs and restart your computer?”<br />
<br />
d) Click ‘Repair and restart’ and reboot again to the Windows 7 System Repair environment.<br />
<br />
e) Click ‘Next’ at the keyboard selection prompt and when the ‘System Recovery Options’ screen appears verify that the “Use recovery tools that can help fix problems starting Windows” is selected.<br />
Note that on your Dual Boot system there now should be only one operating system listed. Click the ‘Next’ button.<br />
<br />
f) Now from the menu list select the ‘Command Prompt’ option.<br />
<br />
g) At the DOS prompt type the following three commands:<br />
<br />
bootrec.exe&nbsp; /fixmbr<br />
<br />
bootrec.exe&nbsp; /fixboot (may return an 'Eliment not found' message)<br />
<br />
bootrec.exe&nbsp; /RebuildBcd<br />
<br />
h) Close the command prompt window and click the ‘Startup Repair’ option.<br />
<br />
i) The repair process may take some time, so wait until the process completes at which point you will see two messages “Windows cannot repair this computer automatically” and “Startup Repair cannot repair this computer automatically”.<br />
<br />
These messages are the result of the radical changes made by removing the other drive. Ignore the Send/Don’t send options.<br />
<br />
J) Close this message window by clicking on the X in the upper right corner of the Send/Don’t send window. Next click on the ‘View advanced options for system recovery and support’ option and from the main menu once again click ‘Startup Repair’. This time the
 repair process may only that a few seconds and when prompted “Startup Repair could not detect a problem”, click ‘Finish’&nbsp; and run the ‘Startup Repair’ option one more time, click ‘Finish’, and then remove the System Repair DVD and click ‘Restart’.&nbsp; Reboot
 the computer.</p>

                    <p>When I ran Skype today what came up is this screen</p>

<p>and there's no way to make or receive calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I run Skype so that I can use it for calls and never see the above screen again?</p>

<p>I'd like something clarified. What happened to the advance exchange program? I've had my&nbsp;<br />
One for 5 months and the PSU died on me last night. I set up a repair request and it's demanding I send the faulty product first. Every article written about these faulty consoles has stated that microsoft is issuing advance exchanges, but when I deal with
 customer service they act like I'm ***! After going through 4 360s, I wasn't going to dare this company again until the advance exchange program made it seem a safer bet. Now you have my money and won't follow through on promises? WTH?!</p>

Any accessories have the standard repair options that were previously available with the 360 console.

<p>This thread is quite a bit older. In order to set up Advanced Exchange, you'll need to reach out to <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us#4:0:4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Phone/Chat support</a>. They'll be able to best help out setting up a repair/replacement if Advanced Exchange is available to you. Please make sure not to bump older threads, as this thread is over a year old. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Why is my surface pro 4 flickering&#47;shaking and why doesn&#39;t Microsoft care&#63;</h2>
                    Surface pro 4 screen first started shaking in fall of 2017, 1 year and 8 months of use. It has gotten much worse since then, task bar, seconds on the time bar, etc now do nothing to help and I cannot use it at all. $1200 brick. I have not called microsoft
 because I do not want to pay $30 just for them to tell me to pay them $450 for a refurbished device. Terrible product, just posting so microsoft can see how dissatisfied their customers are. Welcoming recommendations for a good notetaking tablet with pen (preferably
 not the ipad.) Can't afford another 2 in 1 at this point.

            There are several flavors of screen flickering/shaking being reported. Customers who exchange their SP4's report that the exchanged refurbs start flickering as well. There is one flavor that MAY have a work around but it may not work for your case.
<br />   <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro4-surfdrivers/part-of-top-of-display-is-echod-onto-the-bottom-of/edc25f08-737a-4e8f-955f-8ffe106ffc26?messageId=2215bcf6-a032-4806-9bfa-adebae732df3">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/for...</a> - take a look at Hal's fix and see if this works for you. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft really doesn't have a solution for this - but if the fix to show seconds works, recommend you don't even consider an exchange (which you already said you won't do..)
<br />
<br />There have been over 1000 people complaining about flickering issues. The trade press has picked it up again last month. If you do a search, you will see what the press is saying. Here is the search to run: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=surface+pro+4+flickering&amp;newwindow=1&amp;rls=com.microsoft%3Aen-US%3AIE-Address&amp;biw=1329&amp;bih=655&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A12%2F1%2F2017%2Ccd_max%3A3%2F6%2F2018&amp;tbm=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/search?q=surface+pro+4+f...</a>   
<br />
<br />Microsoft outsourced agents are telling customers to reimage and jump through all kinds of hoops. No one has reported that reimaging resolves the issue. If you are in the US, you can try going to a physical retail Microsoft Store and asking to see the manager to see if they will swap you out, even out of warranty at no charge, or better, swap you for a newer Surface Pro 2017 (for an upcharge).
<br />
<br />I know this isn't good news. I've been trying to get Microsoft to say more than "we are aware of the issue" for over 6 months without success. It's obviously an issue that Microsoft doesn't want to really talk about (I don't work for Microsoft). 
<br />
<br />I'd recommend asking for recommendations in the Windows 10, Devices and Drivers category (as you won't get alot of recommendations in this Surface category) or better, check the reviews that are out there like <a href="https://www.cnet.com/topics/tablets/best-tablets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.cnet.com/topics/tablets/best-tablets/</a> - if you are in the US, visit a BestBuy Store or other retailer and try out a few demo models in the Store. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Please DO mark as Answer if it was of assistance (and best of luck).

<h2>            Tape Library SL150 with Hyper-V Guest VM 2016 Supported or not&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my office, i have Storagetek SL150 Tape Library, and then i have one Hyper-V 2016 guest VM using Windows Server 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have added virtual FC to that VM, and the Tape Library Drive appears in VM. In this time everything looks normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when this environment managed by backup software, in here i use Commvault, sometime it can backup, sometime cannot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error looks like VM cannot control the Tape Library, or Tape Library didnt respond the command of VM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the commvault technician thought that Tape Library isn't supported on Hyper-v Guest VM 2016. Is it officially microsoft Hyper-V 2016 limitation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because when i try to use this tape library to Physical server with Windows Server 2016, it works normally, but if it installed with Hyper-v guest VM, it will have a disruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please kinda help me to confirm the limitation or the solution. Correct me if i asked to wrong community category</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>How do I use Narrator for text-to-speech only&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jdt3  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I use Narrator for text-to-speech only&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10, to date no one gives a simple, or correct answer to the question "How do I use Narrator for text-to-speech only?) They either don't have the answer, or they forget the
<strong>ONLY </strong>word in the question, and send you to links that still doen't answer the question (&nbsp;How do I use Narrator for text-to-speech
<em><strong>ONLY)?&nbsp; </strong></em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">To explain further</span><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>...&nbsp;</strong></span></em><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I don't want Narrator to say anything
 other than what I tell it to read&nbsp;with the keyboard commands, like,&nbsp;read paragraph, read sentence, ETC. which is already in the program.&nbsp; Sorry, but I don't know how to make this question any plainer.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched the web for the answer&nbsp; and found everything but the answer to my question. I'm hoping that some one other than me has had better results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, can anyone answer this question for me, and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
please,</span> don't waste my time, <strong>or </strong>your time by sending me to a link unless you know that the answer to the question is there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: Although, I hope someone has the answer, there may&nbsp;not be one. Microsoft may not have included this feature in Narrator, because it was developed primarily for&nbsp; people with poor eyesight, and not as a convenience for people who like to study by reading
 something while it's being read to&nbsp;them at the same time, for better memory, and comprehension.&nbsp; I admit that I will probability need to go back to Chrome or Firefox and use one of the available add-in features (I found Speakit&nbsp; to work very well)&nbsp;for this
 convenience, although, I was hoping to work with the new Edge Browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, thank for reading my&nbsp; question&nbsp;and considering&nbsp;it, &nbsp;whether&nbsp;you&nbsp;have the&nbsp;answer or&nbsp;not.</p>

            <p>I think that you have actually answered your own question, in that Narrator was never meant for the purpose you want, and at best it would be a hard fit.</p>
<p>On this page there is a video that goes over use of Narrator (Note it is for Windows 8 since it hasn't be updated for Windows 10, but it should be about the same):</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hear-text-read-aloud-narrator#1TC=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hear-text-read-aloud-narrator#1TC=windows-8</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The one thing I notice is that with Narrator on there is a list of commands you can give it to read various things, so that looks promising, but fundamentally I think that if you consider its use case a person that can't see is always going to want it to
 let it know about what just got focus, and as such there is probably no way to turn the behavior off.&nbsp; What's more if I understand correctly a lot of people that do have limited vision also have much better programs for doing this kind of thing.</p>

    <title>How can I launch Windows 7 on a new computer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zayanhf  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I launch Windows 7 on a new computer&#63;</h2>
                    So, I bought a second-hand computer from a friend which needed me to transfer my drive (3tb Seagate if it somehow helps) which is partitioned with Windows 7 Professional. When I tried to launch Windows 7 on the new computer, it keeps going back to the
 menu saying that it couldn't launch because of modified hardware. Do I need to buy a new Windows license and reinstall everything, or is there a way to keep everything as is and fix Windows?

<p>When Windows is installed, it detects the hardware of the computer on which it is being installed and configures itself accordingly.&nbsp; You can't just transfer Windows from one computer to another; at a minimum, you would have to do a repair install (<a href="https://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/3413-repair-install.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/3413-repair-install.html</a>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting Windows to work with a new computer is only part of the problem, however.&nbsp; If Windows was pre-installed on the original computer, the license is an OEM license and not transferable.&nbsp; Windows will not activate.&nbsp; If the copy of Windows on your old
 hard drive is a retail copy, then you will be able to reactivate it on the new computer using the Product Key that came in the packaging when you bought that copy.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. The hard drive with the installed operating system on it won't boot in the new machine as the installed drivers on that hard drive's operating system&nbsp;are for the old motherboard.</p>
<p>And no you can't change them.</p>
<p>You clean install the operating system on a new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. You do not tell us what type of License you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Laptop/Computer came with the Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc) , that Product Key that came with the Laptop/Computer is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines)&nbsp;is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above&nbsp;rule also applies to OEM System Builders Licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Retail Operating System&nbsp;License, that you buy and install yourself, are allowed to be transferred to another machine.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;Retail Licenses can also only be installed on one machine at any particular time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3. And to install Windows 7 in any computer the computer manufacturer must support Windows 7 on that exact model number and supply Windows 7 drivers for it.</p>

<h2>            Is there any way to run old pc games&#40;32bit&#41; in Windows 8.1&#40;64bit&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    I am trying to install some old games like WWE RAW 2002 and road rash in my windows 8.1(64bit) computer but it says could not find display mode and for road rash it says aweman32.dll file missing. I also tried changing compatibility mode but it fails to
 start.These games worked perfectly in Windows 7(32bit).I also tried to change my display resolution still not working.So I decided to play this in virtual machine but in virtual machine also it didn't worked in full screen.Please tell me solution to run my
 favourite games.

            <p>"When you install software that uses the aweman32.dll dependency, the software should automatically register the file for you. In some cases your DLL file may not register properly, and as a result, will provide a "aweman32.dll not registered" error. Fortunately,
 you can use a built-in utility called "Microsoft Register Server" (regsvr32.exe) to re-register your aweman32.dll file.</p>
<p>How to re-register aweman32.dll from an elevated command prompt:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Start</strong> button.</li><li>Type "<strong>command</strong>" in the <strong>search box... DO NOT</strong> hit
<strong>ENTER</strong> yet!</li><li>While holding <strong>CTRL-Shift</strong> on your keyboard, hit <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li><li>You will be prompted with a permission dialog box.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>Type the following command: <strong>regsvr32 /u aweman32.dll</strong>.</li><li>Hit <strong>ENTER</strong>. This will <strong>UN-REGISTER</strong> your file.</li><li>Type the following command: <strong>regsvr32 /i aweman32.dll</strong>.</li><li>Hit <strong>ENTER</strong>. This will <strong>RE-REGISTER</strong> your file.</li><li>Close the command prompt window.</li><li>Re-start the program associated with aweman32.dll error.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>To run System File Checker (<strong>Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10</strong>):</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Start</strong> button.</li><li>Type "<strong>command</strong>" in the <strong>search box... DO NOT</strong> hit
<strong>ENTER</strong> yet!</li><li>While holding <strong>CTRL-Shift</strong> on your keyboard, hit <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li><li>You will be prompted with a permission dialog box.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>A black box will open with a blinking cursor.</li><li>Type "<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>" and hit <strong>ENTER</strong>.</li><li>System File Checker will begin scanning for aweman32.dll and other system file problems (be patient - the system scan may take a while).</li><li>Follow the on-screen commands."</li></ol>

            <p>Hi! &nbsp;Sorry for the late response. &nbsp;You can try performing a <strong>Refresh</strong> on Windows 8.1 to see if that fixes the problem.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows Key</strong> + <strong>I</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Change PC settings</strong> at the bottom right.</li><li>Go to <strong>Update and recovery</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Under&nbsp;<strong>Refresh your PC without affecting your files</strong>, click <strong>
Get started</strong>. &nbsp;Continue with any on-screen steps.
<ul>
<li>As a precautionary measure, you may want to back up your files. &nbsp;This can be as simple as copying your files to an external storage medium (e.g. external hard drive) or using
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Back-Up-Information-Using-File-History-in-Windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Back Up Information Using File History in Windows 8">

<p>==================================<br />
VOB is a file copied from a Video DVD. Try renaming <br />
the xxx.VOB file to xxx.MPG and it&nbsp;should play in <br />
windows media player.</p>
<p>Or you could download and install the freeware VLC <br />
Media Player and it will play the VOB file as is.</p>
<p>(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />

            Hi Landaman.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is it possible it signed you into a temporary profile?  We see this a lot lately.
<br />
<br />Check at C:\Users for your original named User account, then browse into the User folders there to see if you see the files.  Sometimes in File Explorer the folders under This PC or Quick Access are links that get broken.  
<br />
<br />If not did you have Windows Updates of a Version Upgrade recently?  Check at C:\Windows.old if the old install is archived there by version Upgrade. 
<br />
<br />What changed before these files disappeared?  Try to  System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Sounds like you have logged into a temporary profile. Try restarting your computer a few times. Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />At the sign in screen, click the power button, then click Restart. Do this a few times then try signing again. If the desktop still does not show up, then you will need to  create a new local user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Control + Shift + Esc
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Click Add
<br />
<br />Enter a user name
<br />Password, confirm it, create a hint
<br />Click Next
<br />Click Finish
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Sign into the new account.
<br />Open File Explorer on the Taskbar &gt; This PC 
<br />Open the drive where Windows is installed 
<br />Open Users 
<br />Look if your old account old is there with your files 
<br />
<br />If they are, you can copy them over to the new account.

<h2>            Microsoft sends back Xbox One X console unrepaired 5 times and demands 6th chance</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Pretty insane, mod closed my previous topic, so ill just re-open it. Seems Microsoft really does everything to cover this NO SIGNAL bug of Xbox One X. This issue should be freely&nbsp;discussed at these forums!!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>In addition to my previous topic I'd like to add I have had contact with Xbox Chat Support earlier today where the employer confirmed in his experience some people have to send in their Xbox One X in for repairs
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">EIGHT</span></strong> <strong>times before a working console is delivered. (prove included)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ca665f9-abd7-49ee-8cf3-166d2bf32aa6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ca665f9-abd7-49ee-8cf3-166d2bf32aa6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><strong>After that I was promised to be contacted by his superior but... surprise suprise... 4 hours later I still have not received a mail from his superior!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>---------------------------------</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to share my story with you all how unfairly Microsoft its customers service have treated me. I have never experienced such arrogance, incompetent and bad support as this. In fact, when I think about it, I can hardly believe I have really experienced
 this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally purchased an Xbox One X (scorpio edition) at launch day. This device started to suffer from the 'loud jet engine noise' bug a couple of weeks later. When I was playing Xbox One X randomly (almost every few minutes) the console's its fans went
 crazy loud for a few seconds. Very annoying, so I send it in for repairs and got a replacement console back a few weeks later.&nbsp;<span>This became the first repair.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>A few months later, at the day RDR2 released, I booted up my Xbox One X again to play RDR2. But instead of booting RDR2, I was shown a NO SIGNAL message. Only thing I could do was rebooting Xbox One X to get a signal back, but every time I booted RDR2 the
 NO SIGNAL message was displayed... I changed the HDMI cable multiple times, but nothing worked, I had to send it in for repairs again and received the console back a few weeks later.<span>&nbsp;This became the second repair.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it turned out NOTHING was repaired at all. Exactly the same issue, still a NO SIGNAL directly after I tried to boot RDR2. I contacted Xbox Support Chat to complain and I was promised when I would send in the console for another repair they would
 make 100% sure this wouldn't happen again. I didn't need to worry and was promised a compensation for my trouble&nbsp;<span>AFTER</span>&nbsp;I would have received back my FULLY succesfull repaired console. So I send in the Xbox One X console in for another repair and
 received it back a few weeks later.&nbsp;<span>This became the third repair.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This time I had received a replacement Xbox One X. I connected it to my tv (Philips 65pus8102/12) and booted RDR2 successfully. Finally I could start playing RDR2. Before starting playing I contacted Xbox Support Chat for the compensation I was promised.
 It turned out I wouldn't receive a compensation at all... only thing I received was an extension of Xbox Live Gold for the months I missed for what I was given the circumstances already legally eligible for. I felt pretty upset to be honest at that moment,
 I was promised a compensation for my trouble but Xbox Support Chat wouldn't say in advance what this compensation would be and now it turned out to be nothing at all.<span>&nbsp;Pretty misleading.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I continued to play RDR2 and after about half an hour to my big surprise my screen turned black and there it was again... NO SIGNAL. I was stunned, how was this possible? A few second later the NO SIGNAL message disappeared and I had signal again. However,
 this continued to happen randomly. Sometimes I could play for a few minutes, sometimes for an hour, but always a NO SIGNAL messages popped up every now and them. I found out it helped when I used a shorter HDMI cable, with a HDMI cable of just 20cm I didn't
 have NO SIGNAL messages anymore, the longer the HDMI cable was the more frequent the NO SIGNAL message popped up. I asked a friend to connect his Xbox One X to my TV to make sure it wasn't my TV or Receive that caused the NO SIGNAL, turned out his Xbox One
 X played perfectly all the time. So this Xbox One X was definitely faulty to.. so I went back to Xbox Support Chat to complain, received lots of excuses and send in my Xbox One X for repairs again to have it received back a few weeks later.&nbsp;<span>This became
 the fourth repair.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It turned out the Xbox One X got replaced again, I connected it to my TV and you won't believe what happened when I booted RDR2.... NO SIGNAL. I went absolutely crazy. Exactly the same problem as with the previous one, when I connected a HDMI cable of just
 20cm there wasn't a problem at all and the longer the HDMI cable got the more frequent the NO SIGNAL popped up. So I went back to Xbox Support Chat AGAIN.... same excuses, same apologies. I was promised again 100% sure this would't happen again, I was an exceptional
 case, never ever this happened before and I was asked to send it in for repairs again and got it back a few weeks later.&nbsp;<span>This became the fifth repair.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Again it turned out to be a replacement, connected it to my TV and you won't believe it... NO SIGNAL. I really exploded at that moment. In less then 1 year I have send in my Xbox One X for repairs 5 times, of which 4 times in the last 4 months and all 4
 with the same NO SIGNAL bug. How on earth could this happen? After all these useless promises it wouldn't happen again it again happened. 4 Xbox One X consoles in a row that have the NO SIGNAL bug. It started to look like this repair cycle would never end.
 So I went back to the Xbox Support Chat and complained. Same reply from Xbox Chat Support, same excuses, same apologies and same promises.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was asked to send my Xbox One X for the SIXTH time. I told them I would only agree if I was promised this would be the last repair, if the sixth one failed to I demanded to receive a full refund. Given the circumstances and after 4 failed repairs in a
 row I don't think that's an unfair condition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still can't believe what happened after that. I started to get treated extremely unfairly, rude and ignored most of the times. I was promised replies that didn't follow, I was promised deadlines that weren't met, I was promised another compensation if
 I would cooperate with a sixth repair but again they wouldn't discuss in advance what this compensation would be (of course its obvious and was confirmed later to me this would be another few months of Xbox Live Gold for the time my Xbox One X was away for
 repairs, so again no compensation at all, again I was lied to by Xbox Support.)&nbsp;<span>The most bizarre comment one of the Microsoft employer's made was the NO SIGNAL bug was definitely related to my modem/internet connection</span>. Even though I explained
 carefully it was a video signal, he was convinced I should change my modem in order to fix the issue. I demanded a conversation with his superior after that and his superior called me and to my big surprise his superior took it up for him, telling me his employer
 really did the best he could and was an excellent employer.&nbsp;<span>The incompetence is stunning, the NO SIGNAL bug is a huge problem on Xbox One X, many people on different social media (even this forum from Microsoft) experience this bug and Microsoft has
 employers that seriously relate this video issue to a modem/internet connection related problem and superiors actually defend this. Microsoft should really be ashamed to have this low level of employers working at the customer service, it's no help at all,
 it's an insult to every customer that experience this issue!!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In total I have contacted Microsoft more then 150 times on e-mail, chat and twitter only to be ignored. I now just send a reminder on twitter every day, only to continue to get ignored of course. Every e-mail I send, every tweet I tweeted, every chat I started,
 whatever I wrote I didn't receive a substantive reply. The only thing I received was a rude monoloog of the customer service what basically said I had to cooperate with a 6th repair with no consequences. If this 6th repair turned out to have failed to, I had
 to cooperate with a 7th repair, 8th repair, 9th repair and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you believe the arrogance after having failed 4 times in a row to successfully repair my console they don't want to bind to a final last repair? And on top of that only sending me a monolog, not replying to my mails at all. Today Microsoft even had the
 arrogance to cancel the 6th repair order!<span>&nbsp;I truly feel insulted, this treatment is given the circumstance below every you would've expected.</span>&nbsp;I have already contacted a lawyer and we're preparing to go to court and I will make sure my story will
 get published in the newspapers as well and known to the world. How Microsoft is handling this really goes back to the time when customers didn't have rights by law at all, luckily I have the EU law at my side now to enforce my rights. People should be aware
 Xbox One X has an obvious bug in its design what causes the NO SIGNAL bug so many people experience and people should also be aware how badly Microsoft treats this problem.&nbsp;<span><span>If you're one of the unlucky many with a faulty Xbox One X console, don't
 expect reasonable support at all and keep in mind you could be walking into an infinite amount of repairs and be prepared to be treated like&nbsp;<span>****</span>&nbsp;by the customer service.</span></span>&nbsp;Especially one employer really treated me badly, the first
 employer of a company I really started to hate because of the arrogance. Normally I never get mad at employers of a company, after all they're only doing their job, but this one... I have all the e-mail conversations saved and if you would take a look at that
 you will most likely understand why this is an exceptional bad employer. When I purchase a premium product for a premium price I'd expect a premium customer service too and if Microsoft isn't able to fix my consoles in a reasonable amount of time I have every
 right to demand a full refund. After 4 unsuccessful repairs I would say I have given Microsoft more then reasonable chances to fix it, really looking forward to what the judge will say about this.</p>

<p>That's actually not true, there is something that can be done in these forums and that's the reason I reopened this thread. We should be able to discuss this issue, exactly what this forums is meant for.

</p><p>Let everyone that experience this issue reply to this thread so it will become clear how large this problem is and Microsoft should response to it accordingly instead of downplaying the issue what it is doing now for months already. Trying to cover this

<p>Hello Braxn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With console repairs if you send it in for something, when they receive the console they will test it out see if it is working. If the console does work and find nothing wrong they will send it back. This is why multiples are done most times. Personally
 had to send one in twice. So this could be the case with yours. Is there a Microsoft store near you? Yo u can take it there and see if you can do an exchange. That would be up to the store itself. But as mentioned, you will need to keep going through support
 for the repairs. Reason why your other was locked is legal was mentioned. If you abide by the

forum guidelines</a> we will leave this discussion open for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Parity is correct. No one in these forums work in Xbox Technical Support, you need to speak to them. And Microsoft is not covering anything up. Whence why Brad and the support agent told you multiple repairs may be needed.&nbsp;</p>

            I believe I read in your other post that you have 4 different serial numbers. The repair center would not knowingly send out a non-working console. If the exact same issue keeps occurring with different consoles then I'd say there's something else going
 on. Trying different HDMI cables or different ports into the TV. Try a computer monitor instead and see if the issue still follows the device. Next would be the power there and the power supply. Again, same issue but the power supply may not be getting enough
 power or the power supply may not be providing enough power. Just to say its an issue with all Xbox One X consoles doesn't really work. I think there'd be more complaints than yours.<br />
