<p>
</p><p>What is the point of Quick Access when it doesn't keep the files you want quick access to pinned as you would like? &nbsp;I can only pin one folder, if I try to pin another the first disappears. &nbsp;It doesn't make sense. &nbsp;Is there a way to pull Favorites from Windows
 7 into Windows 10? &nbsp;It was actually useful. &nbsp;With Quick Access I have to drill down in files all day long.</p>

            <p>Thanks Keith. Two differences between our versions. 1) the Attributes 2) I didn't add Wow6432 stuff. Just wrote a post this morning (GMT + 5:30)<a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/pin-recent-folders-places-navigation-pane-windows-10-file-explorer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/pin-recent-folders-places-navigation-pane-windows-10-file-explorer/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Addendum: If one wants it in the Quick access section, and still want it to show up in Browse dialogs, setting the
<strong>Attributes</strong> alone will do.</p>

            Unfortunately there's no global setting for this: &nbsp;the program that is displaying the "open" dialog gets to decide where to show by default. &nbsp;Some programs are built to remember the last place you used, others are hard-coded to always open the same spot.
 &nbsp;But it's totally up to the program that's pushing open the dialog box.

<p>
</p><p>There is more to the problem...sometimes(not all of the time) when the computer is left on and is supposed to go to sleep, it cannot be woken....the only way for me to wake the computer is to do an extended shut down where i hold the power button down for
 30 seconds...only then does the computer restart....</p>

            <p>Have the exact same two problems. I am extending the screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) When I unlock the screen, all Application windows converge onto the primary screen. Have to drag them to the other screens and dock them.</p>

            <p>I would describe the behavior a little differently, but I think I am suffering from the same issue.&nbsp; I have a Surface Pro 4 with the Surface Dock, Surface Dock, MS Bluetooth Mouse and a pair of monitors connected to the dock via the two display ports.&nbsp; When
 I undock, it forgets my monitor configuration.&nbsp; When I re-dock, it takes about 15 minutes and multiple reboots to get the primary display back to one of my display port monitors.&nbsp; Often, they are reversed from what they were.&nbsp; It would seem like a simple thing
 to implement a set of hardware profiles so you could designate how to treat things like monitors, and other devices.&nbsp; I also have issues with it remembering headset, camera, and mike preferences for use in Skype between the docked and undocked setups.&nbsp; My
 memory is a little fuzzy, but I think Windows XP and earlier versions had some pretty good hardware profile controls.<br />
</p>
<p>I actually think that the real issue is a cultural think inside Microsoft's internal development community, and not really an engineering problem so much as a management problem.&nbsp; It's been increasingly clear for the past decade or so that they have allowed
 design to trump functional excellence which has resulted in poor products.&nbsp; In this area, they are emphasizing automatic setup detection because some design team has dictated that, even though it is a horrible mistake.&nbsp; You seen the same sort of misplaced
 priorities in the Office team, where the layout of menus and the use of colors has quite dramatically reduced usability.&nbsp; Nadella needs to knock the designers down about 20 pegs.</p>

<p>Hey guys, forgive me if this is in the wrong place. I can't navigate these forums for the life of me &gt;&lt;</p>
<p>I would like to preorder the Xbox One for day one edition, but preferably on the high street.</p>
<p>Is there anywhere that people think they might have stock left? I was going to try HMV tomorrow whilst I'm in town.</p>

<p>I know I left it late, it's just that I didn't know I had the money to buy a new console, until now.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance ^^</p>

<p>Regarding Phase 2 for the pre-orders, haven't both Microsoft and Sony said that there should be plenty more stock coming not long after launch? I remember an article on IGN where they said if you don't manage to secure a console for launch you shouldn't
 be waiting too long for the next batch.</p>
<p><br />
Obviously this could of all changed but I know both companies only recently have been talking how they are increasing production aswell.</p>

<p>I have a feeling there will be plenty available of both consoles, They just try and get you scared to make you place a pre-order. MS and Sony know the demand for their consoles, to not have some available at launch may lead someone to buy the other one which
 im sure neither company wants. Either way with only a month before xmas im sure there will be loads of stock available in between. I havnt pre-ordered but im confident i will get a console on release.</p>

<h2>            Japanese License Key to English media device installation&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
I'm in Tokyo Japan and I built a computer. I had no other choice but to buy a</p>
<p>Japanese version of a Windows Home installation USB. I couldn't clearly understand</p>
<p>the installation process since I was relying on google to translate the characters. I was</p>
<p>able to install and run Windows but there are settings that I want to change but can only</p>
<p>be set during the installation process. I want to reinstall my OS again using an English</p>
<p>media creation tool downloaded from Microsoft so I could set everything the way I really</p>
<p>want it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, will the activation code from my Japanese installer work on this&nbsp;</p>
<p>English OS that is downloaded from Microsoft?</p>

            Hi Stephen
<br />
<br />Your licence code should be fine for the English version as long as you install the exact Same Edition (Home, Pro, Single Language . .. etc.) as the licence is for . . .
<br />
<br />If you have any trouble accessing an English version of Windows 10, this is a reliable and safe method to create Windows 10 Bootable Media

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>So do you have verified security proofs on the account? If not, I would suggest adding and verifying some security proofs to the account using the steps here:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/my-account/security/add-security-contact-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../add-security-contact-information</a> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Once that's done, delete the profile from the console (profile only), clear the system cache, restart the console and re-download the profile.</p>
<p>Delete and re-download profile: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../profile-move-delete</a> </p>
<p>Clear system cache: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/system/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a> </p>
<p>If you still can't sign-in using the app password you created, I would turn off two-step verification and use the same password that works when signing into this website (xbox.com). Steps to turning of two-step verification is here:

    <title>XBOX One Controller vibration bug &#43; questions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xafrini  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX One Controller vibration bug &#43; questions</h2>
                    
<p>While coding controller support into a program of mine i hit a snag. When setting the rumble speed via SetVibration - the 360 controller motor never stops until I tell it to do so (desired behavior). However, the XBOX One controller will only rumble for
 a second or 2 until the motor stops on it's own. From the testing &amp; debugging I've been able to do, it appears to be an issue with the driver for the One controller. Could you please take a look?</p>
<p>I also have a couple of questions:</p>
<p>1. Is trigger vibration support (for Dev) to be added to the PC in the near future?</p>
<p>2. How could I go about joining the the XBOX Preview Program? I'm curious at the development possibilities of streaming to Windows 10.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>Xafrini,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately these forums are not for Development questions, and as most the people here are having problems with an Xbox product that has already been published, there will be little to no response here. I recommend starting with the link below and checking
 the MSDN forums for any development questions.</p>

<p>Sorry about that. Perhaps somewhere on the Developer home section there is a portal for peer collaboration. With the Preview Program you need a friend that's in it to invite you. I would ask some friends you play with if they're in it, and if they will add
 you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bought XBox One Controller for PC and found that when controller vibrates controller disconnects every time. I Have Win 7 64bit with lattest drivers. Of course it also has to be wired (USB) to PC for it to work since it has no wireless solution yet.
</p>
<p>Anyway, I gave up and went back to Xbox360 controller since it works either wired or wireless and stays working. I was using it on the game PC-Dragon Age Inquition 6/2015.</p>

    <title>Strategy Guides...do you use them&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bizarromantis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strategy Guides...do you use them&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Yeah, this question has been asked in the past, but I really hate rising old, dead threads that need to RIP.</p>
<p>I was playing Dragon Age Inquisition today and now that I'm about half way through the game I'm starting to think I really &amp;$^#@ up my game due to hasty, half-thought-out choices that I made and now it's getting a bit more complex with all these huge decisions.
 &nbsp;Sigh... &nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel like I'm playing a chess game and I'm juggling pieces, throwing them in the air, scattering them around, and balancing them on my head. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I may have ruined my game, but the alternative is following a guide that basically babies me through the whole game so all my chess pieces are carefully moved with great precision and thought.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One might say "Just use a guide when you need it." &nbsp;- is that really possible? &nbsp;Once your hand is held and everything works out great and you are hailed as the champion of Ferelden and confetti flies through the air, can you reeeeally put the guide down
 and try to think things out on your own and risk having all your companions disapprove of your choice and instantaneously going from a hero to a zero? &nbsp;Sure you can keep going back to an earlier save in a desperate attempt to make everyone happy... &nbsp;</p>
<p>In Dragon Age Origins, you can have a few possible endings and some are terrible and everything is dependent on choices you made. &nbsp;My ending was the worst of the very very worst and I sat in disbelief at how my choices has led to THAT. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Another game that comes to mind is Mass Effect Two when my poor choices lead to an empty ship and my friend laughing at me because he obviously enjoys my pain.</p>
<p>I have a verrrry bad feeling I'm heading in that direction with Inquisition. &nbsp;Maybe I have Bad Ending PTSD. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, anyway....guides or no guides? &nbsp;What are your thoughts?</p>

<p>Even with a game like Dragon Age, I only use a guide when I need it. Which isn't very often. Sure, the end result may not work out exactly as I wanted, but that's half the fun of having the option of choices. As long as I can do every quest and obtain every
 item then nothing else necessary. I can alter any choices I made in subsequent playthroughs and see if it turns out any better.</p>

<p>On play-through number one I try to avoid all spoilers, and I've never purchased a guide before. But if there's a big decision to be made that could change the landscape of the game, and the game is being vague about the consequences of my choices, I'll
 hit the Internet and see what each choice actually does to the game. Especially if it's open world and I have to do stuff in it after the end credits have rolled.</p>
<p>Or if I get stuck and I've run out of random head-to-wall strategies, I'll Google the title of the game, a swear word, and the names of the section, and characters involved. You know when a game has been designed badly in places when your vaguely annoyed
 search gets a wall of gamers all asking how to get past the same section. Heh.</p>
<p>I won't use a guide for character builds either. I'll have a character wear weak armour for the entire game just for the way it looks, and have stats at a disadvantage if it means the character is somewhat consistent. Some people would rather be covered
 from head-to-foot in clunky mismatched weirdness, with maxed skill points in everything... may as well play an action game. To each their... pwnage.</p>
<p>I lost Tali on both first runs of Mass Effect 2 and 3. With 2 I did everything right, and I replayed it right after I finished the game, with no changes, and she didn't die the second time! With ME3 I must have been confused about which mission would progress,
 so I essentially missed Tali's loyalty quest...</p>
<p>... and she topped herself, with me going, "Nonononono, what? Wait, whhaaaaaat!? Noooo! What are you, is she gonna?" - and I'm not gonna lie, I blubbed a lil dammit... then I contemplated reloading for about ten minutes, but I figured I wouldn't erase the
 impact the game had had on me by reloading, and I went on without her.</p>
<p>Soo yeah. I'll use a guide to grab collectibles after completing a game, and I'll check the consequences of choices rarely, and if I get stuck - and I'm pretty patient and I like being challenged so I mean really, this is stupid, stuck - I'll be online looking
 it up.</p>
<p>But I couldn't go step-by-step with a guide. There's no fun in that. =]</p>

<p>I'll use a guide if I am stuck and am beginning to get seriously annoyed with my lack of progress.</p>
<p>Now I'll always try for a while to get past the 'blockage' myself but in the end I am playing for fun and getting frustrated at a lack of progress isn't fun for me.</p>

<p>To the OP,</p>
<p>Just finish your first playthrough and then check up a guide for the next couple of playthroughs.
</p>
<p>To be honest. The achievements in the previous Dragon Age games never required me to use a guide, as the achievements sort of explained what you could do in the game. But I suppose for the mini secret paths then yeah it can be difficult to know whats going
 to happen.</p>
<p>I blame that though on the fact that BioWare never seem to be able to make a character all good or all bad. They always mess it up and so the way you answer someone could be totally different to how you would have intended it to come across in real life.</p>

<p>I'm like Sword - only use them when I need them. Guilty for looking up the intel locations in COD games if I really want to go for the achievement or looking up the answers to the classroom questions in Persona games to name two examples. But for story heavy
 games like Mass Effect, I just go by intuition. If I made a bad choice, tough choice Tyson - endure it.</p>

<p>The other option is to make regular game saves. (Something I forgot to do at one point in ME2 when I sided with Jack and lost the chance of bedding Miranda)</p>
<p>So when think you have made a bad choice or wrong move you can go back to the last save point and take the other option/options without ruining the whole game.</p>

<p>Well, unfortunately, I can USUALLY only play through a game one time. &nbsp;The only exception was in the two games I mentioned before when I got horrible endings. &nbsp;In those two games, there were some very specific things that needed to be done in order to get
 the great ending. &nbsp;Don't we all want the best ending possible? &nbsp;Getting a terrible ending where everyone dies, or the city explodes, or you are shamed and go from champion to outcast...who wants to get that after working so hard for 100+ hours? &nbsp;But I think
 I've made my decision... if I get a horrible ending I'm just going to accept it and move on to another game. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I don't think your choices can screw up the ending that bad in DAI. I made some pretty questionable decisions and everything worked out good for me. I guess I'll find out for sure when I inevitably play through it again.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface Pro has a problem, I cannot use it properly. It asks me to put the recovery key (BitLocker) when I want to turn it on. I have an ID Number and that's it. I cannot find my recovery key on my microsoft account... What is the solution to use my tablet
 again please ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to turn on my Surface while pressing the buttons ''Volume Down'' et ''Turn On'' but the menu for different solutions doesn't appear. I wanted to create a recovery image on a my USB driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks to find some solutions for me.</p>

            Hi camille.eischen,
<br />
<br />If you used this option and cannot find your recovery key that you'll need to reset your Surface to factory conditions using a downloaded recovery image -&gt; <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023512/surface-creating-and-using-a-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402351...</a> .

            Thanks for your answer. Problem is I cannot go on the recovery mode on my Surface. When I turn it on (Volume Down+Power) it only appears the Bitlocker Key issue, I do not have more options so I cannot plug my USB driver and re-install the Surface totally.

            I plugged my USB Driver with the recovery image, I went deeper in the process, I can now choose languages then I have options to select but no option for Troubleshoot... So neither for recovery by USB Driver..&nbsp;

 I try to install Extended Player it keeps telling me that I am missing a critical file. I have tried using the Microsoft Cleanup Utility, but Extended Player does not show up on the list. I don't know where to go to from here. Can I get some help please?

            Hi.  hotshot-gunner 
<br />
<br />I'm Charles, an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />
<br />	This mode is simple and practical, just follow these steps to make it appear:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•  Click on the Start menu, open the Control Panel and double-click on Sound and Audio Devices.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•  In the window that opens, check the box Place a volume icon in the taskbar and click OK.
<br />
<br />	The sound icon will already appear in the taskbar. Another suggested method to activate the volume icon in the taskbar follows these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Right, click on a blank space in the taskbar and from the pop-up menu select the Properties option.
<br />
<br />2. In the Taskbar tab, in the Notification Area section, click on the Customize button.
<br />
<br />3. In the new window, click on the link Activate or deactivate system icons that you find in the lower part of the window.
<br />
<br />4. There, click on the menu adjacent to the Volume icon and make sure it is marked On. Click OK and then OK. Verify that the volume icon appears normally in the taskbar.
<br />
<br />
<br />Best Regards,
<br />Charles.

<h2>            Laptop screen turns black with a blinking underscore up in the left corner at startup</h2>
                    
<p>Dear Sir,<br />
I am using asus N51V laptop and I upgraded its operation system to windows7 from vista a month ago. It is working perfect till friday. I am using my laptop for my work so it is working 24 hours in weekdays. Friday night I shutdown my computer normally and it
 shows no error. Today I started my laptop and after seeing the start up message from asus the screen goes black with a blinking underscore up in the left corner.</p>
<p>Then I entered the bios of my computer and change booting settings to cd-rom drive first. then I put my windows 7 upgrade cd on the cd-rom drive and restart my computer. First I tried to repare windows 7 files and it said that there isn't any errors in the
 files. than I tried to make a system reload to restore my past savings of a normal working date. It did and finished with a succesfull restored message. Than I reboot my computer and I am facing the same problem with a black screen flashing '-' sing upper
 left.</p>
<p>Also my computer has an express gate utility. I can start my computer with express gate and I can listen mp3, viewing photos and also I can surf on the net. But my computer can not start normally..<br />
<br />
Please help me to solve this problem..</p>

            I don't know what specs your Asus came with, but Windows 7 is the most greedy operating system yet. It&nbsp;needs about 1.75 gbs of RAM just to keep the screen active with a proportionate increase in power requirements and resultant heat, if your ASUS has less
 than 2gbs RAM or too small a CPU perhaps it just couldn't sustain the increased demands W7 makes on a system and has burned out its circuits trying. On the other hand if it has 3ghz processor and 4+ gbs RAM, think of the&nbsp;resultant demands on power with a proportionate
 increased heat generation - it isn't rocket science - go back to XP and get to use the extra RAM and BandWidth you will save&nbsp;doing things for you not MS. The option to have a desktop that changes wallpaper every 30 minutes is not really worth the increased
 electricity bill, reduced laptop life, or the environmental consequences.&nbsp;I could have made toast on my Dell with 64bit W7. If you do get W7 working again have a look at Desktop Gadgets and check W7's dreadful&nbsp;performance and operating inefficiency using the
 CPU/RAM&nbsp;monitor! Has Microsoft not heard there is a hole in the ozone layer we are trying to use less power not more.&nbsp;<br />

    <title>FIFA 13 freezing on startup, Microsoft essential component - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lerre  say:</h3>
<h2>            FIFA 13 freezing on startup, Microsoft essential component failure&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>This is the first time I've had to post looking for help, but I apparently need it now so I'll try to be as brief as I can.
<div>Last week I did a rollback on my PC for the first time, redownloaded and installed everything after making a list of what I needed. On that list was the EA application Origin and FIFA 13 among other things I had before doing the rollback. Now FIFA won't
 run, and it's the only thing that is having an issue on my computer since doing the rollback.</div>
<div>I was in contact with EA customer support (surprise, they were no real help) and the last thing they said after they had escalated me twice was this:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>"If following the steps above did not improve the situation, I would strongly recommend that you contact Microsoft support as I could not find any issue related to FIFA. I believe the reason FIFA is not running on your system is due to the fact that
 FIFA depends on Microsoft essential component which might be failing in your situation."</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Basically what he thought was that the windows errors I keep getting in my msinfo32 are the reason. So now my question is how do I fix this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Below are links to my msinfo32 in .txt and .nfo, and my dxdiag.</div>

            Hi,
<div>Thanks for your response.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. I don't have any issues with anything else. The only other games I play are Guild Wars 2 and F1 2012 and they run flawlessly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. I can't even really remember all the things I've tried but I'll do my best. I've tried reinstalling the game and Origin at least 10 times, run the repair tool on FIFA 13 several times doing things other people have suggested, such as deleting the .exe
 and a specific .dll file to force the repair tool to actually repair it. I've checked to make sure Windows Media Player is working correctly because apparently it can cause a similar issue. I've tried running the game offline, online, with different personal
 settings in Origin and even gone as far as using a crack.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was in contact with EA on the phone, their support chat and through email and they had me try different things that didn't work and/or that I had tried already.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My hardware drivers should be up to date. My video card driver was the first thing I updated when I did the rollback. I also just updated it yesterday because I found out AMD had released a new version of catalyst.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I couldn't find any events involving FIFA 13 or Origin in the event viewer and I'm not sure what else it is you want.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The only thing I can think of is that the errors in Windows Error reporting in my msinfo are at fault. That and/or a conflict causing FIFA to freeze.</div>
<div>I'll explain what happens: I start Origin, open the FIFA 13 launcher and launch the game without any issues. Then when the game is on it's startup screen (if you're unfamiliar with it it's a giant picture of Messi running and smiling) and nothing happens
 beyond that. Unless I leave the game open for at least 10-15 minutes, then it will have inched forward what would be about 5 seconds when the game runs normally. Beyond that I have no idea what happens because it's like there are milliseconds of activity every
 few minutes without any opportunity to actually try to move forward.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I'm simply at the point where I have no idea what could possibly fix it, so I have to try to look for outside help.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would sugget you to play the game and then go to event viewer window and collect the application logs and post the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Application (program) events: </span>Events are classified as
<span>error</span>, <span>warning</span>, or <span>
information</span>, depending on the severity of the event. An error is a significant problem, such as loss of data. A warning is an event that isn't necessarily significant, but might indicate a possible future problem. An information event describes the successful
 operation of a program, driver, or service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            local group policy&#40;restrict removable storage&#41; doesn&#39;t work in windows 7 pro</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to restrict the usage of removable storage, such as usb storage, cd-rom&nbsp;and so on&nbsp;locally.</p>
<p>So I tried to use group policy to deny read and write to a usb storage. </p>
<p>(like, gpedit.msc -&gt; computer configuration -&gt; management template -&gt; system -&gt; removable storage access-&gt; removable storage -&gt; deny read right, write right, execute right.)</p>
<p>(Because I'm using Korean version, specific words are likely to be wrong.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I found it not work. And the registry gpo modified were all modified by gpo.</p>
<p>(HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\windows\removableStorageDevices\{53f5630d-b6bf-11d0-94f2-00a0c91efb8b}\Deny_Write,Deny_Read, Deny_Execute:1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I can still write and read files on usb storages.</p>
<p>What should I do to enable this to work?</p>
<p>I am using windows 7 pro and installed all updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please teach me the way.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            I'm not sure how you got the Registry path, the problem is that you've created the keys in HKLM (HKEY Local Machine). But the policy supports only the user level, hence you're facing the issue. You can try the change in HKEY_CURRENT_USER or HKEY_USERS
 path and check.

<br />
<br />Click the link below to downlaod a batch file from DropBox
<br />
<br />When the file downloads, right click and choose 'Run As Administrator'
<br />
<br />When the script completes, restart your PC and Windows 10 Updates (including Store Apps) should begin to work again . . .

            So far this has seemed like a very common issue currently. Unfortunately a lot of common ways to fix the issues havent even been working. Due to the high number of issues I'd have to suggest waiting for Microsoft to release a patch or update to fix the issue. That being said you can always try the common troubleshooting solutions listed here: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-winapps-appother/unable-to-download-apps-from-microsoft-store/bc4d7256-3301-4924-a7f8-650f3d257c98">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

            <pre>Here are some standard trouble shooting steps you can take for store problems
Win10 Store apps  / Metro / Modern / UWA / UWP
In Windows 8.1, Microsoft introduced Universal Windows Apps (UWA), colloquially known as “Metro apps” or “Modern apps.” In Windows 10, Microsoft took the idea even further and ended up with the Universal Windows Platform (UWP).
Based on my own experience, and the reports of many others it appears that the store and it’s associated “environment” is rather fragile, causing various problems with the store itself and store applications. 
2018 01 13- MICROSOFT OFFICE FOR CHROMEBOOKS IS NOW AVAILABLE
https://www.groovypost.com/news/microsoft-office-chromebooks-available/ 
Android app support for Chromebooks has been under development for a couple of years now. With the latest Chrome OS update, apps from the Play Store have finally hit the mainstream for Chromebooks. If you have a Chromebook that supports Android apps, you can install apps from the Play Store just like you would on an Android tablet or smartphone. It’s confirmed that this now includes the Microsoft Office applications for Android. 
In the Play Store search for the (individual) Microsoft Office app you’re looking for. There’s Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Outlook, and Microsoft OneNote.
HOW TO FIX WIN10 STORE APP / METRO / UNIVERSAL APPLICATIONS – WINDOWS STORE RESET
2016 07 19- 5 TIPS TO FIX WINDOWS STORE AND APP ISSUES IN WINDOWS 10
https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-tips-fix-windows-store-app-issues-windows-10/ 
..0. Restart the computer
  1. Win Store Trouble Shooter
  2. Clear store Cache (WSReset.exe)
  3. Reset Windows update (use the tool in the following link)
  4. Reg hack for Connection errors
  5. Re-Register the Store
Here are some additional instructions for the 5 tips defined in the article above 
Remember to test the problem applet between each of the steps.
#0 RESTART THE COMPUTER
Simply restarting the computer is one of the simplest trouble fixes we have. But it is all too often forgotten or skipped.  Too often programs get “confused”. While restarting the program may clear the confusion, sometimes they have an unseen compenent constantly running in the background.  The easiest way to reset them is to restart the computer. 
#1 MS DOWNLOADABLE WIN10 STORE APP TROUBLE SHOOTER
http://aka.ms/diag_apps10 
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-run-the-trouble shooter-for-windows-apps 
Note: both of these links above should take you to download the same diagnosis “CAB” file. 
Use the built in Trouble shooter
Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot 
Scroll down to the bottom 
Click Windows Store Apps
#2 WSRESET.EXE – CLEAR AND RESET STORE CACHE
http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-clear-reset-windows-store-cache-in-windows-10/ 
Run as Admin.
Be sure to run the WSReset (Windows Store Reset) program AT LEAST 5 times. It appears to fix one problem per run, SLOWLY working thorough multiple problems in subsequent runs. Unfortunately the tool is poorly written so it gives the user no indication of what it is doing or if it was successful or not. All you can do is run it several times in the hope that you run it often enough for it to clear all of the problems.
#3 MANUAL RESET WINDOWS UPDATE SUBSYSTEM
the problems remain, you have to revert to a manual process to reset Windows Update
Check that System Restore is turned on and configured 
https://www.pcworld.com/article/2955023/windows/how-to-turn-on-system-restore-in-windows-10-to-protect-against-bad-updates.html 
https://www.tekrevue.com/how-to-enable-system-restore-windows-10/ 
Create a System restore point. (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point )
Use the following process to effectively delete the folders used by Windows Update:
Follow the instructions in this page: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components - How do I reset Windows Update components? (Win7-Win10)
The first paragraph in the above process includes a link to the Windows update troubleshooter. Make sure to run through it also.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6eHDtylDYo How to Fix Win Update Errors
This is a Video of manual process very similar process to the one described in the link to KB971058 (above)
After doing the process in the above link, including restarting the computer Check for outstanding updates:
. – in start menu search for Windows Update
. - click on “Check for Updates”
. – updates are often sequention, they require an earlier one to be present before being installed. So you should repeat checking for updates until you get no more updates

******************************************
****************************
RE-INSTALL ALL STORE APPS USING POWERSHELL
…*  In the Start Menu, search for PowerShell 
…*  right click and select "Run as Administrator" option.
…*  Enter the following commands one by one in the PowerShell window:
………  reg delete “HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\TileDataModel\Migration\TileStore” /va /f
………  get-appxpackage -packageType bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + "\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml")}
………  $bundlefamilies = (get-appxpackage -packagetype Bundle).packagefamilyname
………  get-appxpackage -packagetype main |? {-not ($bundlefamilies -contains $_.packagefamilyname)} |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + "\appxmanifest.xml")}
RESET ALL STORE APPS / REREGISTER / APPS MISSING FROM WIN START MENU
Re-register all store apps, so they appear again in start menu.  For that, open a PowerShell window as Administrator. Copy and paste the following line into the PowerShell window and press Enter: 
Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose } 
Note:	if you re-register all applications, all your apps are back, however all your pinned apps will be reset (the right panel will be empty) so you need to re-pin everything that you want. Personnaly I did a screen capture before, to remember what I pinned and where (use the “snipping tool” in startmenu/windows accessories, with a delay to be able to open the start menu before the capture)

            Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />Reinstall the Store:
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (Admin) 
<br />At the command prompt, type the following then hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />

    <title>Windows 10 print jobs disappear - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephen999999  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 print jobs disappear</h2>
                    <p>After updating from 7 to 10, my print jobs disappear. I deleted and reinstalled the printer. Running troubleshooter shows no problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I disconnect the USB cable, the printer shows offline, so the connection is good (as is was in 7).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing show up in the print queue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried changing the setting to print directly to printer, but still nothing prints.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can manually print a test page at the printer so it is working.</p>

<p>
</p><p>There is no way I will allow my office systems to be upgraded (not an appropriate description by the way when the service is worse) to Windows 10 if something as basic as the ability to print is so difficult to remedy.</p>

Do you have an internal or external media reader?<br />
<br />
If_Yes_try the following steps......<br />
<br />
Insert the Memory Card in your media reader and <br />
go to...Start / Computer.<br />
<br />
The media reader should be recognized as one or <br />
more Removable Disks and each will have a drive <br />
letter.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Removable Disk (F:)<br />
Removable Disk (G:)<br />
Removable Disk (H:)<br />
<br />
Left click each Removable Disk until you reveal the <br />
Root Directory of the Memory Card.<br />
<br />
OK...now that you know the drive letter...go to your<br />
Pictures folder...Start / Pictures.<br />
<br />
If you right click a selected group of photos or a complete <br />
folder you should be able to choose...Send to / Removable <br />
Disk (?:)...this should copy the photos to the Memory Card.<br />
<br />
Be sure the photos are in one or more folders because <br />
the number of photos you can copy to the root directory <br />
will be very limited. And you will receive the following error:<br />
<br />
"Cannot copy XXXX: The directory or file cannot be created"<br />
<br />
If you prefer to copy from Photo Gallery...right click a selected<br />
group of photos and choose...Copy. Go to...Start / Computer<br />
and right click the drive letter of your Memory Card and choose <br />
Paste.<br />

<h2>            How do I choose which location to install to software on Windows 10</h2>
                    I just got a new computer last night and I'm trying to install all the programs I use. The problem I'm running into is that I have two different hard drives. Drive C is an SSD drive with only 128 gb of hard drive space, and this is the primary drive. However,
 I also have a regular hard drive with 1 tb of space that is Drive D. I'm trying to get the new programs to install on Drive D and not C as I already ran out of space, since 128 gb is almost nothing. How do I get to programs to automatically install on Drive
 D instead of Drive C? I'm given no option to where to install something when it installs.&nbsp;

            Hi Kristena
<br />
<br />1.
<br />3rd Party Applications:
<br />
<br />Some 3rd party application installers will allow you to choose an alternate install location, for those, create a Program Files folder on your D Drive and install those into their own sub-folder of that folder
<br />
<br />Other 3rd party application installers will not allow you to choose an installation folder, for those, there is nothing you can do . . .
<br />
<br />2.
<br />Windows Apps or Windows Store Downloads:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (Gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to System - Storage - 'Change where new content is saved'
<br />
<br />Ate the top, from the 'New Apps will save to' drop down, choose your other drive (HDD)
<br />
<br />That's It!

<p>See DaveM121's reply, and let me add the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I'm concerned, 128GB is way too small for a C: drive, and I'm sorry to say that I think you made a poor choice in getting it. No matter what you do now, you will very likely run into the same problem in the near future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless of whether it's an SSD, an HD, or an HD Partition, I never recommend anything smaller than 500GB for C:, and 1TB is even better&nbsp; for most people. If you're up to spending some more money, you should replace it with a bigger drive.</p>

            <p>Hello Rajiv,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try the telephone activation by following below steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>·</span><span> Open run command (Win+R)</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span> Type "slui 4"</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span> Then you have to select your country or region</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span> A dialog box will appear and you can see a telephone number and an installation ID.</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span> Call that number and provide the installation ID for offline activation</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span> Then they will provide you a confirmation ID for activation</span></p>

<p>Option 1:</p>
<p>If the COA sticker is damaged, then you would need to use the recovery partition to reinstall Windows 7, this will exempt the need to use the product key to activate your Windows 7 installation.</p>
<p>Option 2:</p>
<p>If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee. This will exempt the need
 to use the product key also.</p>
<p>Option 3:</p>
<p>If the neither options 1 or 2 is possible, then you need to invest in a new retail full version license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try taking a picture of the product key, then blow it up on your computer to see if will be more visible.

<p><strong><span>Hi Tommy1203,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Are you able to boot the computer till the desktop loads?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>From the preliminary analysis it seems that there is some driver issue. Also
</span></strong><span><span>Blue screens (BSOD’s) are mostly due to hardware and sometimes due to incompatible software.&nbsp; In a lot of cases it is a corrupted driver or a driver conflict.&nbsp; The most common causes
 of blue screens&nbsp;are overheating, faulty RAM, and&nbsp;video card problem. <br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There is a setting that will prevent the system restarting immediately after a crash like that, and so allow you to see the BSOD. Refer to the steps
 below -<br />
<br />
1. Click Start and then click Control Panel<br />
2. Select the ‘view by’ option as small icons.<br />
3. Now select the option of System and select advanced system settings, (on the left).<br />
Accept the "Windows will need your permission to continue" if it appears<br />
4. Now click the Settings button under "Startup and recovery". <br />
5. In the new window, remove the tick for "Automatically restart" under System failure.<br />
<br />
This will at least let you see the BSOD message when the system restarts and will allow you to write down the full message. You will need to turn off the computer manually afterwards.<br />
Try to note the exact error message you are getting and notify us about it to assist you better.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Also I would suggest you to connect the minimum required hardware like a single RAM stick, monitor, keyboard, etc and then try starting
 the computer and check. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.<br />
Thanks, <br />

<p>Hi Meghmala, Yes It works fine. It shuts down with BSODs in the middle of the night or day I think it only has done it 1ce while I was working on it. It has been running hot 50-55c, 58c Max. I cleaned the CPU Fan today and it's running almost 20 Degrees
 cooler. I am&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;computer&nbsp;savvy. I am a Jr. Network Administrator. I disabled the auto shutdown so I could debug but cannot read the Mini dump file. I left the path to it on the first thread. I am going to see what happens tonight now that it is running
 a little cooler. thank you for the reply though. if you can take a look at the Mini dump file that would be great. If you can let me know what you find.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

 Marie</a>,&nbsp;I believe the issue was actually the processor overheating, But the minidump file says otherwise. I took everything apart and noticed that there was caked up dust all over the heat sink. I cleaned it out and had average temp drops of 25c. I haven't
 had a BSOD since. I could not believe the amount of dust that was on that heat sink!! This rig has only been up and running for a couple of months. But thank you for taking the time and analyzing the minidump file for me I appreciate it. Let me know what you
 think about it being the processor. I'm curios to know what you think.</span></p>

<p>Hi Tommy.&nbsp; You are welcome.&nbsp; You had already indicated it was running hot and that you had managed to lower the temperature by cleaning the CPU fan when I posted.&nbsp; Bear in mind that I was only commenting on the cause of the BSOD.&nbsp; "ERROR_CODE: (NTSTATUS)
 0xc000000e - A device which does not exist was specified" is a hard drive error.&nbsp; I have seen this error generated by drives that were overheating before and based on the information you posted, it seemed reasonable to deduce your drive was overheating too.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Did you run a diagnostic and check the S.M.A.R.T data?</p>
<p>Thanks for the update and I'm glad you resolved your problem</p>

<p>Set of test utilities for DIY computer builders:</p>
<p>Note: If you are OverClocking or use any automatic overclocking BIOS features then drop back to the stock speed as a starting point.</p>
<p>First try running <strong>Memtest86+,</strong> this runs from a boot disk or CD and should eliminate or<br />
confirm if your one or more of your memory sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.<br />
Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours, if no errors by then your ram is OK.<br />

Just choose to run the "stress test" option for 3 hours or more.<br />
If your PC can pass this test both your memory and CPU<br />
are fine (close the case cover to maintain proper ventilation)</p>
<p><strong>Core Temp: <br />
</strong>Monitor the temperature of each core of your processor. For non overclockers using the stock Intel/AMD heatsink and cooling fan you can expect a temperature of 35 to 40C at idle and up 60C to 65C when running Prime95.<br />
