<h2>            Signature Images in Windows 10 Mail App</h2>
                    <p>MICROSOFT:&nbsp; </p>
<p>Is there an update&nbsp;plan underway to allow Images and/or custom fonts &amp; formatting for the Windows 10 Mail App?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This really limits the usefulness of Mail App for business users (ie, logos and links), and it would be an important addition to the App.</p>

    <title>Access to shared printer denied from non-admin user - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jpk_asd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Access to shared printer denied from non-admin user</h2>
                    I have a printer attached to a VISTA computer. On the VISTA sharing of printers and files is on, and so is password sharing. I cannot access this printer from my Windows 8 laptop if I am logged on with a non-administrator account. I see the VISTA computer
 and its multimedia facilities, but I can't get to the files or the printer (Message 'access denied').
<div>If I log onto a user account with administrator rights, I can install the VISTA printer without being asked for a password - strange, considering password sharing is on at the VISTA computer! I can also print from the admin account. This proves that the
 network settings are up and working. However, the non-admin accounts still don't see the printer, although the admin account has installed it.</div>
<div>So I have two problems: how do I restrict access to files and printers in such a way that administrators need to know the password of the VISTA computer, and how do I make files and printers accessible to non-ADMIN users that do know the password?</div>
                </div>

I thought I had been clear in my message that I'd already gone through all this stuff. So this answer is pretty useless.</p>
<p>In the meantime I have discovered that only Microsoft accounts had access problems. Local accounts have normal access. So I have asked all the users of this computer to create local accounts and discard their Microsoft accounts. Problem solved. I only wonder
 why MS accounts are so limited in use.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here in this situation, I suggest you to create a new user account and check if the issue persists. This is to check if the issue is caused due to any user profile corruption or not. If the issue does not persist in new user account, then proceed with Steps
 2 and 3. This will help you copy the files from the old user account and delete the old user account.</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong>Create a new Microsoft Account.<br />
<strong><span>Create a user account:</span></strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8</span></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the new user profile works properly, then copy and paste the data files to the new user profile.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow the steps to copy the files from the old Microsoft account to the new Microsoft account:
<br />
</span>a) Press/tap <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows
</span></strong>and <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">x</span></strong> together and select
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows Explorer</span></strong>.<br />
b) Click/tap on <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">View
</span></strong>tab and click/tap on <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Options</span></strong> at the top right corner.<br />
c) Click/tap the <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">View</span></strong> tab, and then click/tap
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Show hidden files</span></strong>, folders, and drives.<br />
d) Uncheck the box which states <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hide protected operating system files</span></strong>.<br />
e) Click <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Yes
</span></strong>to confirm, and then click<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">OK</span></strong>.
<br />
f) Locate the <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">C:\Users\Old_Username folder</span></strong>, where C is the drive that Windows is installed on, and Old Username is the name of the profile
 you want to copy files from.<br />
g) Select all of the files and folders in this folder, except the following files:<br />
•<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Ntuser.dat</span></strong><strong><br />
</strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">•Ntuser.dat.log</span></strong><strong><br />
</strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">•Ntuser.ini</span></strong></p>
<p>h) Right click/tap and Select <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Copy</span></strong>.<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Step 3</span></strong>: If the new user profile is working fine, then delete the old user.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow the steps to delete the corrupted user account profile:<br />
</span>a) Login to your new User Profile.<br />
b) Click/tap on the “<strong>Windows logo</strong>” and type “<strong>User Accounts</strong>”.<br />
c) Now, select “<strong>Settings</strong>” and then select the “<strong>User Accounts</strong>” icon.<br />
d) Click/tap on “<strong>Manage another account</strong>” and then select the user account that you want to delete.<br />
e) Click/tap on “<strong>delete the account</strong>”.<br />
f) Depending on whether you want to “<strong>Keep the files</strong>” or “<strong>delete the files</strong>” choose the appropriate option.<br />
g) You can delete the other accounts similarly.</p>

<h2>            Windows 95, 98 &#38; NT and Microsoft Archives.</h2>
                    <p>I'm seeing these operating systems floating around online on Abandonware sites now. I know they are practically worthless for modern hardware and applications, but I'm still curious where Microsoft stands on the licensing. Obviously, reselling old software
 would be an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm curious what Microsoft's official stance on these Operating Systems is? I'm fairly certain a few industries still run older Microsoft operating systems, I remember an article recently about an outage at an Airport that run their primary software on Windows
 3.1 still. I'm very confident 2000 is still in use. Are these considered Abandoned at this point and free for personal use? Do they plan on releasing the application/source code in the future? I have been running 98SE on old retro gaming PC's, and it also
 runs well in VMware (with full VMware tools support), but I have the original license key still. The patches can still be found online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really feel like Microsoft is kicking the can down the road with these old operating systems, as much as Microsoft would like them to disappear, they come up time and again. It would be nice to get an official response from Microsoft so retro enthusiasts
 and testers know where they stand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it time Microsoft creates a legacy/archive site for these old operating systems, and maybe some of their old software?

            You'll get no official response from Microsoft here, but they've never shown an indication that they would at any time do what you're hoping for.&nbsp; The EULA terms for all Windows versions remain in effect.

<p>I almost get the impression that Steve Gates Microsoft (before January 13th, 2000) and Steve Balmer Microsoft (since 2000 - 2014) are two different companies with no real cross over. I doubt they'll open source any of their operating systems while there
 are still major organizations using them in production. </p>
<p>
</p><p>They are really missing an opportunity, I believe, to either put their foot down and capitalize on the demand for access to these products, or migrate all the legacy software and technet articles into a Microsoft Archive site, make it not for profit community
 and keep interest active.</p>

            I think that if there were significant demand and money to be made, something would have been done by now.&nbsp; Another factor to consider is that Windows (all versions) incorporates bits that are licensed by Microsoft but not originated by them.&nbsp; This could
 create a legal labyrinth of sorting out what actually belongs to whom, and how the licensing for those bits might be dealt with.&nbsp; It's not as simple as it might seem.<br />

<h2>            USB Composite Device with USB 3.0&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently bought a mouse (Mionix Castor) only to find that it is a USB Composite Device and doesn't work on USB 3.0 ports properly.</p>
<p>The software that comes with the mouse isn't recognising it because of this and I don't have any 2.0 ports.</p>
<p>Is there any way to fix this?</p>

<h2>            Want To Join An All Halo Clan&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>We are the founders of the Halo rings. We destroyed the flood and restored humanity. We lived and thrived before anyone. We are the earliest Halo players. We are Team Forerunner.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey! Spartan I043 here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning sound cool? Keep reading! I am&nbsp;currently in the process of recruiting for my clan Team Forerunner in Halo.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We play&nbsp;every Halo that was ever&nbsp;made:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Halo: Combat Evolved (PC)</p>
<p>2. Halo 2 (PC)</p>
<p>3. Halo 3</p>
<p>4. Halo 3: ODST</p>
<p>5. Halo Reach</p>
<p>6. Halo Wars</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will also&nbsp;expand to the upcoming Halo:&nbsp;CE Remake and Halo 4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ABOUT TEAM FORERUNNER:<br />
Team Forerunner is a clan where winning and losing don't count, where skill doesn't matter, where cussing hardly exists, and where fun is always in the game. If you cuss up storms, only care about winning, and are unsporting don't bother reading on or sending
 us friend requests. We DON'T want players that cuss up storms and we DON'T want players that are unsporting and only want to win. We want players that want to have fun, we want players that are good sports and we'd prefer players that don't cuss (we don't
 mind if a you can't help throw a cuss word in every now and then). We currently have about 70 awesome, official players in Team Forerunner! Team Forerunner only cares about having fun and if we win great. . . if we lose, oh well we have our chins held high
 ready to move on either way. We are very strict on players who only want to win, who are unsporting, and who cuss up storms (We banned two members because they were both cussing up a storm and one of them only wanted to win and was unsporting). Most of Team
 Forerunner's members rarely ever cuss (which is really nice) and we try to help each other rank up, complete challenges and become better players. Both guys and gals are welcome to join our clan. KillJoyseries89 made&nbsp;our websit &nbsp;where you can view more of
 Team Forerunner's information.</p>

<p>TEAM FORERUNNER RULES:<br />
1. Player must respect the leaders/co-leaders: Spartan I043, Iron Hawk II, Jakeylakes, Reydaitso, fishiesDONTswim, and Mr Silph (So far only two members have disrespected us and I don't want it to happen again)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Player must be a good sport whether it's win or loss. (In other words, have fun whether you win or lose)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Player must have a mic and must communicate to the team. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Player must be willing to participate in ALL Halo Reach game modes. (Slayer, Capture the Flag, Headhunter, Invasion etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Player must change their emblems to Team Forerunner's official emblem (No armor or gamertag changes are required, however if you join our clan, I ask that you put "Team Forerunner" into either your motto or bio so that way when our new members look at
 my friend's list, they will know who is in our clan and who isn't)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I allow ALL ranks to join so I will allow you to join whether you are a Recruit, Inheritor or anything in between. Currently our highest ranked officer is a Field Marshall and our current lowest ranked officer is a Warrant Officer (again these are official
 Team Forerunner members). And we have many ranks in between, so you should be able to fit right in!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER INFO:<br />
Players can also list a specific preference in which class they will be assigned. (All-Around, Heavy, Long Range, Close-Quarter, Vehicle Operator, etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Octagon backround with the Champion Star in the middle is the Team Forerunner emblem. The Colors are Steel (Backround Color), Silver (Primary Emblem Color), and White (Secondary Emblem Color). I no longer require the service tag to be changed, because
 it is hard to recognize teammates with the same service tags.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As said above I am trying to make Team Forerunner as fun as I possible can, and if there are any recommendations let me know. We also try to have clan battles every weekend, so if your clan wants to battle ours, feel free to contact our Clan Battle Organizer
 Jakeylakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER CONTACTS:<br />
You are more than welcome to contact any of the leaders/co-leaders listed above, but for the most part you will want to send me messages. You can contact me multiple ways:<br />
1. Xbox Live Gamertag: Spartan I043 <br />
2. Right here in the forum<br />
3. Send me a private message</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER MEMBER NEWS:<br />
We now have our very own clan meeting room! We hold meetings EVERY Saturday. You can come to these meetings and find out more about us if you wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, When you join Team Forerunner, don't only send me a friend request, but also send Iron Hawk II (Team Forerunner Leader), Jakeylakes (Team Forerunner Co-Leader and Clan Battle Organizer), Reydaitso (Team Forerunner Co-Leader and Secretary of Treasure),
 fishiesDONTswim (Team Forerunner Co-Leader) and Mr Silph (Team Forerunner Co-Leader) one. This way they will know you are wanting to join or have already joined. You can try to contact one of them if I'm not online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Iron Hawk II writes:<br />
"Hey guys, I am proud to be a Team Forerunner leader. I hope you have the best experience possible playing Reach in our clan.
<br />
This clan was built by Spartain I043 and myself and we want other Reach players to play to win, but also be good sports about losing because we will most likely not win every match. This has been a great experience for me. I hope to see you on the battlefield
 soldier. Iron Hawk II, signing out.<br />
PS: I appreciate my fellow clan members to be my friends and also if it isn't too much to ask, I would like a good rep. Oh! And one more thing I would appreciate as little language (cussing/swearing) as possible."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jakeylakes also writes:<br />
"Hey guys i'm Jakeylakes one of the members of Team Forerunner. I would just like to give you a heads up display of how great this clan is and I highly recomend that you join. Team Forerunner plays for fun, Team Forerunner accepts anyone who's willing to join.
 These past few weeks have been awsome, I have played so much now and my ranks are soaring through the roof because I can actually play Reach and enjoy. Team Forerunner has lots of members and there all fun to talk to. If you consider becomeing an honarable
 member of Team Forerunner all you need is a mic, contact Spartan I043( our team leader- also give Iron Hawk II respect aswell) or alteranativly you can contact me and i'll talk with Spartan I043. Many Thanks Jakeylakes Team Forerunner"

<p>ArmorLock4Noobs also writes:<br />
"I'm a new member myself, this is a great clan to join. Team Forerunner may put fun first, but don't let that fool you into believing we are not a serious clan. I have been in 4 clans spanning the past 7 years on XBOX Live and I am impressed with the level
 of professionalism on Team Forerunner. "</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other quotes by my members:<br />
1. "Team Forerunner is a VERY fun clan!" -Capt Dewy/ispartan365 <br />
2. "Team Forerunner puts the Team in Teamwork!" -Crazed So<br />
3. "I never plan to leave Team Forerunner!" -Untaimed Spirit<br />
4. "Finally a clan where winning doesn't matter!" -burningclod<br />
5. "Team Forerunner's guys are GOOD!" -SILENTxkiller</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONCLUSION:<br />
Believe it or not this is our (Iron Hawk II and me) first time running a clan as well as being in a clan. We must be doing a good job or our clan members wouldn't be saying these things. Personally we love to have fun, but we can get very serious (especially
 when it comes to recruiting and cussing players with unsporting attitudes). If you want proof that these guys have fun in Team Forerunner just send them a message and ask. They will tell you how much fun they have. We guarentee you'd have fun as well. If you
 want to join, but may be nervous if you were to want to quit and not disappoint me, don't worry about it. We don't force anyone to stay, nor do I force anyone to leave. It is completely up to you. We ask that you really think about joining. We have so much
 fun as a group and we want to share our fun with YOU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Team Forerunner is a clan where you want to find friends, play with mature yet fun guys that rarely cuss, have VERY GOOD sportsmanship, and have the teamwork spirit, then Team Forerunner is the clan for you, because Team Forerunner wants you to have a
 Halo Reach experience that you will NEVER forget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions and comments needed answered quickly about Team Forerunner should be sent to Spartan I043, Jakeylakes, Reydaitso, fishiesDONTswim and/or Mr Silph. Iron Hawk II is online when possible (not frequently) so only send him messages if necessary.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On behalf of Team Forerunner we hope that you join (quickly).</p>

<h2>            Installing Windows 8.1 on Surface 3 has bricked it.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface 3 (not Pro) and installed some stuff I wasn't happy with. So I had a new copy of Windows 8.1 lying around, and I installed it from USB&nbsp;(complete with it's own product key). I wiped the drive on the install, and just did it as a fresh install.
 This seems to have been a big mistake. The newly installed Windows doesn't seem to have any of the surface drivers (notably, no wi-fi driver, or any network drivers of any kind).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the handy website on how to install Surface 3 drivers (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/performance-and-maintenance/install-software-updates-for-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/performance-and-maintenance/install-software-updates-for-surface</a>).
 I tried the Surface3_150504.msi file. On running it, it goes&nbsp;through it's install steps, then it tells me "This System is not a Surface 3. Please choose the right device in order to proceed. Aborting this operation..." I then grabbed the zip version: Surface3_150504.zip.
 This has no msi or other installer files, but it does have a bunch of drivers and firmware. I tried going to the Wifi driver, right clicking the .inf file and installing it. After rebooting, I'm no better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go into the Device Manager, I see about 20 devices under "Other devices" that are unknown devices that need updating. Right clicking on them to update the driver and pointing at my newly downloaded and extracted Surface3_150504.zip directory doesn't
 find any devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help, how do I unbrick my new Surface 3?</p>

<p><br />
This sounds like a classic "phishing" scenario; the message is an attempt to get you to visit a corrupted website that will take your login details and most likely hijack your account on Hotmail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "shutdown in 3 days" warning is very likely a way to get you to act desperately, without thinking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's some quick 1-2-3 steps for detecting phishing attacks:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Is the sender even real?</em> <br />
Check that the email actually shows an address (not the alias, but the address beneath the alias) that ends with a sensible source; such as
<strong>@hotmail.com</strong> or <strong>@microsoft.com</strong>. If you see something completely different, then it's probably fake.</li><li><em>Does the provided link make sense?</em> <br />
These kinds of messages usually have a button or link, <em>don't click it!</em> Look closely at the link address to see if it goes to a site that makes sense. Most email apps will let you 'hover' on a button or link to view the address. If you see a web address
 for a site different from Hotmail or Microsoft, then the message is most certainly fake.</li><li><em>Is there really a problem with my account? <br />
</em>When in doubt, go to your account information using another way. Instead of using the link in the message, use your own bookmark or Favorite for it. In this case, you would just&nbsp;go straight to
<strong>hotmail.com</strong> and&nbsp;log in. Check your account status there. If there's no problem, then the message is
<em>positively a big fakity-fake-fake!</em></li></ol>
<p>Use these same steps for other suspicious emails that appear from time to time, there are a lot of them out there! Just be sure to check the details regarding the account mentioned; lately, there have been some attacks aimed at Facebook and LinkedIn as well.
 Above all, be sure to use common sense. If it doesn't make sense, then it's probably trying to fake you out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wanted to add something about reporting these kinds of messages. It <em>does
</em>have an effect. Even if it doesn't alert the FBI or bring the National Guard down on the culprit (wouldn't
<em>that </em>be great!?) reporting&nbsp;phishing messages should help the webmail (any of them) to filter-out those messages in the future. The effect may not be immediate, but it does count over time.</p>

<h2>            Transfering Video from Sony Camcorder to laptop</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello,&nbsp; Can anyone help me?&nbsp; How do I transfer video from my Sony camcorder to my laptop, so I can edit through a video editing program and burn to DVD? Sony is telling me that my camcorder is not compatible with Window 10 therefore I need to buy a new camcorder.
 I was hoping for a better answer then that as the Sony model is DCR-TRV27 I have used it probably 6 times. It has USB streaming feature of which was turned on. I tried using the USB cable for the first time that was provided with the camcorder along with the
 Pixela Image Mixer that included the cd disk with USB&nbsp;driver and that does not work with Windows 10 either. Is there a driver or program that will fix this problem.&nbsp; Thank you in advance for any suggestions.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a driver is not compatible with Windows 10, you may install it using <strong>

<h2>            Cascade&#47;Tile&#47;Etc. Windows seems to be offset by windows I can&#39;t see or interact with</h2>
                    <p><em>I've tried asking this question before, and the only responses back I got were "Upon checking and duplicating your concern, there's nothing wrong on how your Windows 10 behave with cascading windows." and "Just to follow up, has the issue been
 resolved?"&nbsp; Well, my system IS having the problem, and no, giving no help did not fix it.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>After a while of running Windows 10, when I try to cascade/tile/etc. the windows to arrange them better, they seem to be offset as if there were additional windows open that I can't see or interact with:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44ab6ff9-d439-4723-b74d-30fffbf83d87" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44ab6ff9-d439-4723-b74d-30fffbf83d87" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>As you can tell, the windows are being offset by something, and the amount they are offset seems to increase over time until I reset Windows. &nbsp;How do I get rid of this offset without having to reset Windows?</p>

 now". I am the administrator and I have tried numerous times. I Get Error code #1326. I have tried looking this up but can't find anything. How do I do it? What is wrong? Thanks

I'm getting the same issue. My desktop connects to the wireless network printer (hp photosmart plus) just fine with windows 7 but my new laptop on windows 8 that I just upgraded to 10 is still not connecting. I've spent hours on this and still nothing, &nbsp;it's
 really frustrating. I tried connecting with the USB cable but then says unable to communicate with printer when I try to switch it to wireless connection. It suggested I check the firewall in &amp; out bound- did that. &nbsp;Restart wireless modem and printer- check.
 &nbsp;Uninstall previous printer driver &amp; software then reinstall -check. I even tried connecting by wps pin but it connects as a device and not a printer. What am I missing?&nbsp;

            Check to make sure your laptop is part of the homegroup. I had the same thing, but it was apparently because my computer was seeing my network as public, which had disqualified the homegroup config, preventing me from accessing the homegroup shared printer.

            Hi.
<br />
<br />If you are talking about home group, unfortunately, HomeGroup has been removed from Windows 10 (Version 1803).
<br />
<br />More information you can find here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4091368/windows-10-homegroup-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/409136...</a>
<br />
<br />Options to share network printer and files are still available, the steps you can find in the p rovided article as well.
<br />
<br />If you mean network managing you should use this forum:

            Good Morning VOLODYMYRKHARCHENKO<br /><br />I'm a fellow Community member here to help when I can. I definitely feel your frustrations on this and you are not alone.<br /><br />The new version of Skype is currently very lacking in features and functionality and many users are facing this and other issues.<br /><br />Microsoft has dedicated a page to use your feedback and feature request as well as bug reports. And it can be found here <a href="https://skype.uservoice.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com</a><br /><br />while there has not been an official announcement yet as to when features will be updated in order to bring this version of Skype on par with the previous version, It is believed among community members that sometime within the next few weeks to a month at most we are going to start seeing updates rolling out on a very frequent basis in order to add features and functionality and get this version of Skype back to what user's expected to be.<br />

            Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<h2>            Unable to Update new Windows 10 version</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">So from the beginning,<br />
<br />
Yesterday I purchased a new Nvidia GTX 1070 graphics card, with my old one being an AMD card.<br />
Put it in and booted up the system and it all works fine, go to install Nvidia drivers and it tells me it is not compatible with this version of windows (despite being the win 10 x64 driver for a win 10 x64 system). After doing some research I found a thread
 that said if your win 10 version was 10240, that these drivers would most likely not work, and that the fix was to update to a newer version of windows 10 via the media creation tool or other means.<br />
<br />
I then tried this and it got all the way to restarting and upon restarting, asked for my password to login as normal (which seemed odd), and then after logging in I received the following message:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f8dc289-8732-4897-8cf3-ca47530a7d39" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f8dc289-8732-4897-8cf3-ca47530a7d39" /></a></p>
<p class="contentStandard">I have since been googling the various keywords and error numbers in this message and trying what people have suggest, but to no avail. I have currently got a flash drive installer for windows 10 that was created by the media creation
 tool, which is what I have been trying to trouble shoot with, but every time I get the same message.<br />
<br />
The following is my latest setuperr.txt file conents:</p>

            <p>Babu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your answer is another Microsoft Problem of downloading the Windows 10 by ISO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I downloaded from Media Creation Tool and did not take option of ISO but direct update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempts at using the Media Creation again are meet by "No Download" as my computer says problem with a download. So if there is a work around to Media Creation fine but at the moment I am stuck with a Win 10 without Update Service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 but your answer infers that I am trying to Download Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem as it appears to be by many others is there is "No Updates" being downloaded due to a fault which Microsoft with all the support advisers present can not sort out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can not get a download then Win 10 stays without. I believe Microsoft shortly will be sending a big download to upgrade 10 but if Updates do not work. There will be a lot of people very angry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping that somebody can issue a email with the correct method of either getting Win 10 ISO without Media Creation or a reply that has some substance</p>

            Babu,&nbsp; I have tried to install windows 10 from an iso DVD, an iso USB and from windows update.&nbsp; I have repeatably tried these methods AT LEAST 12 times.&nbsp; Absolutely no luck.&nbsp; I have checked the status of my windows 8.1 and everything seems to be O.K.&nbsp;
 So, instead of a runaround why not just say "I don't know" rather then perpetuating a lie.&nbsp; I did boot windows 10 into my system and it seemed to want to install but I stopped it when it asked for my validation key.&nbsp; Why spend over a hundred dollars for something
 I am supposed to get for free.&nbsp; If anyone comes up with a valid answer to my and numerous other souls installation problems please let me know.&nbsp; P.S.&nbsp; I have tried every option I and others suggestions have come up with to no avail.<br />

            <p><span>Hi Larry,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do you get any error message?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Issues with installation are being resolved by<strong><span>disabling the Antivirus software</span></strong> and also by unplugging
 the <strong><span>external devices</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to disable antivirus and check the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security
 threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your
 antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>Before updating, make sure you have installed all available updates to your PC.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also run a system file checker scan and check if there are any corrupt system files.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>SFC (<strong><span>System File Checker)
</span></strong>is a tool which scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Thank you for your reply;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Believe me when I say that I have tried every remedy I have read in Microsoft forums, tech help on line and various other sources.&nbsp; All without any luck at all.&nbsp; I tried your method of "msconfig", I hadn't heard of that one, and again no luck.&nbsp; I reinstalled
 Win 8.1 last night and by this morning I had updated over 150 items on windows update.&nbsp; Again, I ran sfc /scannow and came out clean.&nbsp; So with a pristine copy of Win 8.1, (I did a slow format of the hard drive with disk management and again during install),
 tons of recent updates and the windows update notification I tried the windows 10 update again...I got to 16% and then the reinstalling your previous version of windows.&nbsp; I have downloaded win 10 with the tool on 4 separate occasions and put the program on
 DVD and on USB with absolutely no luck.&nbsp; So, with my tail between my legs I am going to reinstall windows 7, hide all update notices for win 10 and pretend this never happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steve Jobs software is too expensive for me so I will settle for what I have.&nbsp; For now.</p>
