<h2>            Fallout 4 Season pass problems</h2>
                    <p>So I got the Fallout 4 Season pass a while ago as a gift,and I accidentally installed it on my brothers account,we both have fallout 4 and we share gold,and normally I'm able to use the dlc by signing in to his account,and enabling the dlc then switching back to my account to play. Recently he changed his Microsoft password and I can't access his account anymore,is there any way to let me use the dlc on my account without signing in to his? His profile name is "Zexorg49 " and mine is " Brendan742 ".</p>

<p>I have been having the same problem. I called my ISP and they had to reset my modem and then they explained I had to unplug it and leave it unplugged for 30 seconds, then they did some stuff to it and it worked fine. I would call your ISP and make sure your
 wireless router is working properly.</p>

            <p>Before this thread is being closed (all threads about banning close quite soon, not letting others express similar comments or complaints), I would say that Microsoft and Xbox is focusing too much in communication banning. Maybe it has to do with the federal law, I don't know, but seems there are also some victims suffered being banned by someone else who uses this as loophole making the others they don't like to be banned. I do hope that they have a nice and proper way to let the banned members launch petitions, but seems the Enforcement team would be busy for nothing.</p><p><br /></p><p>But come to think of it, would the Enforcement team investigate the case thoroughly before making any judgment, or just simply ban the suspect account first, then go back to check should they really receive any petitions? I bet so many members were just left banned but too lazy to launch petitions and just as well switch to the other gaming platform.</p>

            <p>The only way to contact anyone that can alter suspensions (or to appeal it or ask about it) is to contact enforcement through a case review: <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/howto#sub-topic0-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/howto#sub-topic0-6</a> Xbox support and phone support can not alter suspensions. Only enforcement can - and ONLY through a case review. To do a case review your suspension must be active, have been applied within the last year and be longer than 24 hours. You may have to do a quiz on the code of conduct before you can do a case review, and if you fail you will have to wait 24 hours to try again.</p><p><br /></p><p>If this isn't a suspension what error message do you get?<br /></p>

            BT, you have too many Antivirus products (ESET, Windows Defender)&nbsp;or elements of them, loading at the same time. Turn off WD, then uninstall and reinstall ESET or uninstall ESET and turn on Windows Defender and firewall(recommended).

                    <p>Hi, when I open microsoft picture it! photo standard 9, The top left hand corner</p>
<p>I click file, open. A box comes up, I select the file, click open and the program</p>
<p>shuts down! The same thing happens if i select get file from camera.</p>
<p>Twice I have uninstalled and reinstalled, not cluring the problem. never had this</p>
<p>problem before. windows XP. any suggestions. thanks</p>

<p><span>I got with the program on when I purchased the p.c. in 2004. yes it was a JPEG image (photo i took with the camera) on the disk there is an option to uninstall the program.
 which i did. rebooted the p.c.</span><br />
and then reinstalled</p>
<p>
<span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">1 hour ago</span></p>
<p>I used: www.revouninstaller.com checked the registry, removed an entry, removed an entry in<br />
program files. rebooted. inserted the install disk and it was recognising the fact that the program was still installed. I clicked remove. rebooted. re installed. problem still there</p>

            Hi,
<div>It was Team viewer 8! I experimented, team viewer 8 was running in the system tray (bottom right of the screen) I closed the program. Microsoft Picture it worked. I have sent a e-mail to the company&nbsp;</div>
<div>complimenting them on how good&nbsp;&nbsp;their&nbsp;software is and the fact that it conflicts with&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft &nbsp;Picture it</div>
<div>P.S. the company have replied to me and have given me instructions how to configure Team Viewer so that it does not conflict with Microsoft picture it. They both work now.</div>
<div>regards john&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Please help. False Tampering claim. ORIGINAL Elite purcahse brand new, 5 year member</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, a little confused where I should put this.</p>
<p>My name is Louie I am the original owner of this box and have enjoyed it for many years, it has previously been sent in for warranty I believe TWO OTHER times before this. When I received the console back over a year ago I noticed it had a new; warranty
 sticker under the faceplate, new disc drive? (no longer had holes in the tray), and a SCRATCH on the largest intake vent :(</p>
<p>Now fast forward to 13 days ago I send it in UNDER ACTIVE WARRANTY&nbsp; (until sept 12 2012) &nbsp;due to 2 red lights (overheating), and 13 days later (25th) I get an email saying;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We were not able to provide warranty service for your XBOX 360 console. Our standard inspection revealed that one or more of the following conditions exist, voiding the XBOX 360 Limited Warranty:<br />
<br />
· The anti-tampering label on your console is damaged or missing<br />
<br />
·We found pry marks, indications of forced entry, or other signs of tampering on the console<br />
<br />
The Xbox Limited Warranty states that the warranty shall not apply, and Microsoft shall have no liability, if your console has been tampered with or has been repaired, modified, or altered anywhere other than at a Microsoft authorized repair center. "</p>
<p>What!? the "pry marks" are from a previous repair and the sticker on the outside has ofcourse been replaced by a previous technician but was otherwise PERFECT.</p>
<p>I don't know the first thing about opening an xbox 360! I despise modders on XBL and am completely lost as to how I have been deemed a Tamperer other than our phone conversation of me arguing this point and them saying it was a "internal" seal? Well thats
 not what my email said and anyway how would I break an internal seal and not the outside one!? They gave me conflicting answers saying all I can do is do an out of service repair for $99 or take it to a "repair shop" outside of MS. After arguing the same points
 back and forth that I have dont nothing other than PLAY the console, ship it to AUTHORIZED REPAIR CENTERS. and have THEIR technicians work on it, I was HUNG UP ON MID SENTENCE... really professional.</p>
<p>I then chatted with support Instant Message and was assured a 2-3 day investigation is being launched on my console/account (which already has a fed ex tracking number?)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a completely innocent customer of 5 YEARS who has always renewed their service contract EARLY ( and can show you my PAPER copy saying sept 2012), and I have purchased a HUGE amount of content; software, hardware, DLC, zune hardware, zune passes etc.
 &nbsp;I purchased all of these things at MSRP the console alone being $399 at the time! and it is STILL the SAME console (serial number) over 5 years. Why would I void my own warranty of 5 years? Please please help me, the first people said my console has been
 flagged! and it is all wrong.</p>
<p>They say the technician's claim on my xbox; being "tampered" is FINAL there is no way to un-do it. How can this happen... I AM NO MODDER, I actually despise the people that go on live doing those sort of things. (and always report them) I feel as though
 I am being treated as a crook not a HONEST customer.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lou D</p>

<p>If they say that the Xbox system has been tampered with, they mean it. They don't say these things without reason. If you have purchased this console second handed, then there is a likelyness that it may have been tampered with. If your console breaks down
 your gonna have to go with the flow and purchase a new console.</p>

<p>The technician is mistaken. BRAND NEW CONSOLE other than being repaired TWICE by MICROSOFT. and yet they claim no record of these things? When they damaged my console? I have NEVER, WOULD NEVER violate my own service contract ive paid OVER $100 for! Sorry
 but I am beyond frustrated as a LOYAL innocent and honest customer of 5 years.</p>
<p>"go with the flow" so what as the point of me ALWAYS remembering renew my warranty EARLY?&nbsp;</p>

<p>They said it was an "internal" tamper? they suggested a seal/sticker on the inside being broken (yet the outside one was perfect when I sent it?) they assured me there is no way that can happen during shipping, well I am the only one to use it, and HAVE
 NEVER even THOUGHT about opening the thing. So that only leaves one thing;&nbsp; Authorized Technicians, no account for HUMAN ERROR?</p>
<p>or.....</p>
<p>Could there be evidence from being matchmade into a lobby of modders? I cant even count how many times ive reviewed players and quit games because of modding. Boot up Cod 4: modern warfare and watch all the people flying around the map and posting ingame
 messages right on your HUD. I dont know why that game is even still online. Or how about the time in GTA 4 in game that someone is modding? (I have been literally thrown to dashboard by someone getting to where they shouldn't be in GTA 4 buildings (map mods?)
 and then what I believe to be 'net tools' spamming me and our network until I was LITERALLY thrown to dashboard. Me AND a friend witnessed this, we were in private chat at the time.</p>
<p>possible? I mean I KNOW it happened ( he even msgd my friend saying "haha kicked ur friend offline") but is it possible for there to be evidence in the internal memory or something??</p>

<p>I understand you would be frustrated. The lable could have been damaged in many ways. When it was being shipped over etc... There is no way to tell. There is no way to tell if people are hackers. (Which I believe you aren't) You may just have to bite the
 bullet and purchase more warranty. I don't know if this will be allowed if the seal is broken as I believe it voids you warranty. Have you spoken to a Microsoft Support operator yet?</p>
<p>I don't know if there is any way to show that it wasn't you who has broken the seal, but I recommend always attaching Proof of Purchase as this will help.</p>

<p>Yes ive talked on the phone as stated ABOVE! was basically hung up on after a long conversation of running in circles on how when a MISTAKE like THIS happens theres "nothing she can do". I logged on to Instant message and they actually seemed like they cared.
 The lady on the phone mentioned nothing about launching an investigation and hung up on me mid sentence.</p>
<p>&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</p>
<p>It says on the website my warranty OF FIVE YEARS expired "January 1, 1900". A joke? 3 days ago on the 24th it said September 2012. &nbsp;The same date my HARD COPY service contract states, that is in my desk. It's like they are assuming their own repairs were
 someone else! its only been to WARRANTY DEPT's ordered over the phone. (they knew there were 2 repairs but knew no dates, expecting me to remember the day I got the console back "repaired" (scratched!) over 1 year ago.</p>

<p>Well the final email came through from MS corporate saying they are sticking by their claim of now what they're calling an "external tamper upon arriving at the repair facility"... and well now that I have thought LONG and hard about it I think I know what
 it could have been, from years past. Something I wouldn't necessarily deem a tamper, &nbsp;but I can see how MS would want to be putting an end to it.</p>
<p>And I have learned from my mistakes! :) If anyone wants to talk more about it they can PM me?</p>

On my secondary xbox, everything has been fine and every game plays fine, EXCEPT Rocket League. I get "0x803F8001: Do you own this game or disc" and I can't play. I've owned the game for almost three years, I called Microsoft, they confirmed that, had me do
 something to my Mac address, reinstall my profile, soft reset my xbox, power cycle, unplug xbox for 10 seconds and replug, to no avail. Lastly, they suggested I ask for a refund (what?) and then repurchase the game.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
Last I played was probably a 3 weeks ago and it was fine. Anything else, PUBG, COD, Overcooked, etc all works fine. Anyone have any advice this issue?</p>

<p>Hey there living! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you have run into this issue, Now if Customer support has already confirmed that the license is indeed in your account and they have asked to process a refund to re purchase the game that's more than likely to re establish the license to your
 account as something could have gone wrong. I know I have run into a similar issue myself and doing this definitely worked out for me. If you are able to get a hold of
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Customer Support</a> again I would advise you try and get it settled this way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps! </p>

    <title>Target did not activate my Xbox live prepaid card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drewdog890  say:</h3>
<h2>            Target did not activate my Xbox live prepaid card</h2>
                    So I bought a 3 month subscription for XBox live. I got home tried to redeem the code and it stated that the retailer did not activate the card. I waited the 24 hour period and tried again and it still did not work. I went back to Target and she said she
 was unable to help and that I needed to contact Microsoft. So here i am back at square one. Any suggestions on how I can resolve this.

            I think that only the retailer where you bought the code can activate it,. you can also try to contact support at

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry about this issue. First of all I suggest you to follow this guide:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/prepaid-codes/prepaid-code-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/billing/prepaid-codes/prepaid-code-errors</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe it can helps. If you find out that the code isn't active, you should come back to the retailer and ask him to check again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Yeah,denis97g is right.You need to go back to Target &amp; they have to activate the code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If they refuse again ask politely to speak to the manager &amp; explain the situation to him/her.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is really only Target's responsibility. Microsoft can't know if the store forgot to activate the card, or if the card is actually stolen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Microsoft can't activate the card for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to return to the store with a proof of purchase (i.e. the receipt), and THEY have to activate the card or talk to Microsoft on how to resolve that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Drewdog890,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you was charged for and it was not activated you need to go back to the store and speak to the STORE manager.&nbsp; They would be able to assist you more than a manager.&nbsp; If they don't help you need to contact the Target corporation.<a href="https://contactus.target.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://contactus.target.com/</a>&nbsp;
 Someone will help you.&nbsp; I deal with stuff like this all the time because I work as a customer service rep.&nbsp; There are plenty of times a customer comes back to store after they were charged for a card that wasn't activated.&nbsp; They have a way of seeing if the
 card was activate or not. This is why it important to speak the store manger and if they don't help call corporate on them.</p>

<h2>            Account has a directory under &#39;Users&#39; but does not show up on lock screen</h2>
                    After doing an update to Windows 10, my computer created a temporary account that it signs me into because of a failure of my original account. My files are still available, but are all under the 'Users/kelvi' folder. The temporary is called 'Users/kelvi.KELVINYEPC'.
 My original account does not show up on the lock screen, and I could not find any answer as to how to get into it. I also am unable to do a system restore to an earlier point because of the new account creation. (you have to delete any new account created
 after the update, but the account it asks me to delete is the only one on the computer.) Is there any way I can get back into my original account without moving everything over to the temporary account and starting over?

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;WHAT ARE THE USER NAMES SHOWING (HOW MANY) ON THE SIGN IN SCREEN. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Dude I explained it to you, the kelvi.KELVINYEPC' temp folder is just that, just leave it alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the kelvi is now your user folder because you chose Microsoft account on the update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>well I do not know exactly what you did or if corruption occurred and when.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That folder, kelvi tells me it is your new account folder</p>
<p>which I assume you mean C:\ Users\ and your user account folder named kelvi.KELVINYEPC, that is temp as you stated</p>
<p>
</p><p>which the KELVINYEPC is the name of your PC located in system properties or settings&gt;&gt;system&gt;&gt;about</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe you had mapped network drive previously or&nbsp;did something for this to happen. or just windows encountered an error during install or update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>lot of things to look for and know to check and to do to fix it or set back and start over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and then another&nbsp;user account&nbsp;labeled Administrator</p>
<p>can you log on to the admin user account from sign in screen with or without a password?</p>
<p>
</p><p>does this admin account have your same desktop icons and everything like your user account????</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can first run these 2 commands in command prompt as ADMIN, press enter after each one.

<p>First of all, the Blue Pulsating screen does not just happen when you start the install, it also happens before you get to sign in screen. Depends on Clean, Upgrade, or Creators Pack.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next is important, when you used the upgrade assistant, which I would never do, use media creation tool and burn to DVD or USB, DVD is better.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Key point here:</p>
<p>When is was getting everything ready and then went to sign in screen or back to your desktop,, how long did this take, did the PC restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, this is the reason. The update has not happened. It has backed up all your files and settings so after the upgrade to 1709, it would then restore your user files and settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is what to do, go to this link below and follow it.</p>
<p>Except, a system restore may not be possible. So do a RESET PC and save your files and settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and then put in the DVD you create from link above and install v1709 and you should be all fixed up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then on the link I give you, after 1709 installed, go to the Windows update history page and download and&nbsp;install all updates for 1709 until you have build 16299.248.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start from the last one on update page and go up. Only get updates for 64bit OS, no 32bit or phone updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install one at a time and restart PC after each.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or after you get 1709 installed, use windows update to update with current 1709 updates. But too many people have problems updating using windows update, so do it manually if you choose to do so.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>_______________________</p>
<p>_______________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I want to add. If you are signed into your Microsoft email account and do the UPGRADE to 1709, your new user folder may be 5 letters, which are the 1st 5 of your email address, but will show your real name on sign in screen and your user folder for access
 with your real name is located in the photo above.</p>
<p>You may be asked during upgrade to set up your PC using and signing into PC account with Microsoft account, which is your email address and email password, so look for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I know it was a quick getting it ready and then back to desktop, says the upgrade install never happened yet</p>

            The problem fixed itself. I dont know if it just took a couple restarts before the account got recognized, or it was one of the solutions I found on another thread. But after this one restart, my account showed on the lock screen, and all my shortcuts
 were back on the desktop.

            no it just got it all prepared and backed up as I said and then restarting it continued the actual installation. That is all it was.

<h2>            Very slow internet access to some sites using IE8 and Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've recently bought a new Dell PC with Windows 7 (v6.1)&nbsp;and IE8 (v8.0)&nbsp;installed.</p>
<p>Mostly my internet access speed is great, but with a few sites (including many Microsoft ones) the access is so slow it timeouts. With a few I get into the page after about 5 minutes. There does not appear to be any relationship between the sites I cannot
 access.</p>
<p>It makes no difference if I'm connected via cable or wireless, I've another laptop in the house and it works great on all sites using wireless, XP and IE8.</p>
<p>I've tried a lot to fix it at his stage including :-</p>
<ul>
<li>Resetting IE8 </li><li>Running many malware/spyware programs (all clear), </li><li>Checked for the latest drivers for my network adapter (Broadcom Netlink Gigabit Adapter)
</li><li>Completely disabling McAfee Security Centre including the firewall </li><li>Disabling IPV6 </li><li>Changing DNSs to Publinc DNSs </li></ul>
<p>It's driving me up the wall! Anyone any ideas? They'd be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks, Simon</p>

<p><span>Hey Simon,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are few steps to increase the speed of Internet connection in Windows 7. Hopefully one of these steps should help you in boosting the speed
 of the connection.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Register actxprxy.dll from the command prompt.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Close Internet Explorer and access an elevated command prompt.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to Start and type
<strong>cmd</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click on cmd and select
<strong>“Run as administrator”.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Once you have your elevated command prompt,&nbsp;type the following and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>regsvr32 actxprxy.dll</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>A confirmation window will appear. Click the OK button.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Disable reserved bandwidth.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Using Group Policy Editor.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Group policy editor is available
 only in Professional, Ultimate and Enterprise edition of Windows 7. If Group Policy Editor isn’t supported in your version of Windows, go to Method 2.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to Start-&gt; Run-&gt; and type
<strong>gpedit.msc</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Expand the
<strong>Administrative Templates</strong> branch.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Expand the
<strong>Network</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Highlight
<strong>QoS Packet Scheduler.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click on
<strong>Limit Reservable Bandwidth </strong>and click on<strong> Properties.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Check the box
<strong>Enabled<span> </span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>and type the
<strong>Bandwidth limit </strong>0%.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Using Registry Editor.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:
</span></strong><span>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly.
 Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the
 windows help article below.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Back up the registry</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Back-up-the-registry</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to start and type regedit.exe.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to:
<br />
<strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the left pane, right click on Windows and click on New and Key.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type
<strong>Psched</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the right pane, right click on a empty area and click on
<strong>New</strong> and <strong>DWORD (32-bit) Value</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type
<strong>NonBestEffortLimit</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on
<strong>NonBestEffortLimit</strong> and click on <strong>Modify</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To
<strong><span>disable</span></strong><span> the reserved bandwidth, type 0 in the value data.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>9.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Close regedit.</span></p>
<p><span><span>10.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer to apply the changes.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi Shinmila,</span></p>
<p><span>Many thanks for the reply and help. </span><span>I've registered actxprxy.dll and disabled reserved bandwidth but no luck I'm afraid.</span></p>
<p><span>I've tried to isolate the problem as much as possible and found the same few sites cannot be accessed through Firefox or Chrome either. All 3 browsers just sit there with a line in the bar at the bottom saying
<strong>Waiting for </strong><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://www.linkedin.com/</strong></a><strong>...</strong> for example. Linkedin is one of the sites I can't access on the PC, it will sti there waiting for 10-15 minutes before returning
 an&nbsp;<strong>Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage&nbsp;</strong>error. It seems not able to connect to these few sites.</span></p>
<p><span>I've tried booting in <strong>Safe with Networking</strong> mode but still the same result.</span></p>

<p>After hours upon hours of fighting this problem, here is my solution.&nbsp; Hope it works for you.</p>
<p>1st.<br />
Run your command prompt as administrator<br />
type:&nbsp; netsh interface tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled<br />
You should get a response that reads "Ok."</p>
<p>2nd.<br />
Disable in the network properties those features you don't use or need:<br />
tcp/ipv6<br />
link layer topology<br />
QoS packet scheduler<br />
<br />
3rd.<br />
Give your pc an ip address rather than using dhcp<br />
then<br />
Try using&nbsp;public DNS Servers<br />
208.67.220.220<br />
208.67.222.222</p>
<p>do all of the above and then see if the browser picks up speed...good luck.</p>

<h2>            Clan members &#40;age 11-13&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Me and my two buds made a clan and we need more people to advance a division in clan wars.We are from ages 11-13 and want people within that restriction. We mostly play extinction and multiplayer for clan wars. We are clan level 12 and have won one clan
 war so far. I honestly don't care about your K/D and W/L ratios.(We are good players with terrible K/Ds)&nbsp;Try and be friendly and we will win lots of cool patches, characters, skins and reticules! I am on almost always&nbsp;so message me with your age and then&nbsp;we
 will arrange a sort of tryout (I would let you in immediately, but my buds insist on it) Thanks!</p>

<h2>            .NET Framework Error &#40;Event ID&#58; 1026&#41;</h2>
                    I recently installed Win 8.1 Pro (x64) and set up some programs and games.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recorded some gameplay with DxTory and it worked fine - used RawCap format to record the footage.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I exited the game and then tried to build the footage using DxTory's built-in "RawCapConv.exe" (Purple Icon), it crashed immediately. I tried about 10 times and every time, it crashes immediately.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I checked Event Viewer and saw the following:</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
</div>
<div>Event Viewer says the error is from .NET Framework <b>v4.0.30319.</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does that mean I have to install .NET Framework v4.0 separately? I thought Win 8.1 has .NET v4.0 automatically since v4.5 is the latest?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help as I need to resolve this issue ASAP.</div>

    <title>A goodbye letter to Xbox. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flea redeemer  say:</h3>
<h2>            A goodbye letter to Xbox.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm a huge Xbox 360 fan. I've bought close to 400 games for my 360 (80% of them brand new) But I'm a Game Collector, I collect Vintage game systems from all over the world. And I buy systems and games knowing one day they will become collectors items. Now
 I've never post on Xbox forums before, but once I heard about the Xbox One I felt like I had to express my feeling on this.</p>
<p>But Microsoft has come out and said that used games will not work unless you pay a fee and you have to be online to register a new game in order for it to work.</p>
<p>Well guess what, us collectors look at this as a horrible thing, this means any game i buy after the system is not supported anymore many years from now will not work on it. With 400 360 games I have many I never ever opened yet. So if this happens with
 the Xbox One once the system isnt online anymore... it's junk.</p>
<p>Games will have no value once this system is replaced. And to honest who wants to buy a used game and then pay a fee. so a $20 game will cost $25-$30?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know many collectors and They feel the same way, and most will not buy this system till this issue is corrected. I own a PS3, Wii and WiiU and I always bought games on the Xbox 360, now once the Xbox One and PS4 is released, I will buy a PS4 and pass on
 the Xbox One. If I buy one it might be far later once the price drops and I'll only buy the few games I want to play. Not as a collectors item. And I sure wont buy any Collectors editions, (hint the world "Collectors") and unless you want the statue it will
 hold no collectors value.</p>
<p>Microsoft has shot them selves in the foot with us collectors. I was a huge supporter of the Original Xbox and even stuck up for the Xbox 360 when systems where getting the Ring of Death I still loved my Xbox360 (which I had to replace 5 times) I even bought
 two Collectors Edition Xbox 360's on top of the 5 basic systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I must say the system looks cool, and sounds like it has some cool features, but the can't play new or used games unless your online makes me think this system is not worth investing my hard earned money on. So until I hear an official statement from
 Microsoft that this feature is removed. And this hurts me to say this, I will not buy an Xbox One.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will still play and support the 360 as long as it lasts (and after) but I have to say goodbye once the Xbox One is released. Any new game after that I will be buying on PS4 or WiiU. But if you guys have a change of heart, I will be buying an Xbox One on
 launch day. If not I can't support this as a collector.</p>
<p>Goodbye Microsoft it was fun while it lasted.</p>

<p>I'm in the same boat with the used game but for the reason i have kids and that means i have to buy the game and pay extra for my kids to play it. With the whole kinect on 24/7 recording what goes on in my house doesn't sit well with me at all either and
 from the sounds of it you HAVE to have it on. I was all about 360(went through 7 myself) this last cycle but as of today it's all ps4 unless something changes with M$ on the way to launch. You have the gamerscore to show how dedicated you were to the system
 i'm in the same boat as well I have a strong feeling alot of the guys that are hardcore gamers are going to be taking a looonnnggg look at this new xbox if things don't change</p>

<p>Some people are shouting back at comments like yours saying if you want to play 360 games then keep your 360. But I think this sentence says it all 'even stuck up for the Xbox 360 when systems where getting the Ring of Death I still loved my Xbox360 (which
 I had to replace 5 times)'.</p>
<p>The 360 collapsed and failed so many times for me that I feel like an idiot for sticking with it. I am an idiot for sticking with it.</p>
<p>I can't afford full price for all the games I want. I can't afford full price plus extra fees for my kids to share these games with me.</p>
<p>I will be leaving consoles behind come the end of this year and I'll put up with the draconian licensing that Steam on the PC demands instead.</p>
<p>'bye bye Xbox.</p>

<p>@That 1 Dude</p>
<p>Agreed if Backwards Compatibility was such a big deal the current gen Xbox list of BC games wouldn't have been so small and the PS3's BC abilities wouldn't have been Patched out of the system completely</p>
<p>the Used game Fee was a rumor and was denied earlier today &nbsp;</p>

<p>[quote user="Kowtowner"]if Backwards Compatibility was such a big deal the current gen Xbox list of BC games wouldn't have been so small[/quote]Small? It's 50% of the total number of XBOX titles.[quote]and the PS3's BC abilities wouldn't have been Patched

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BC can&nbsp;matter at the start of a console, otherwise there is precious little to play. At least with PS4 and Xbox One, there's a good chance at tons of PC ports since the CPU and GPU are similar.</p>

<p>Why do ppl want bc.With new systems coming PS3s and 360 will get severe price drops and will be supprted for years.Why would anyone want to play a game on an emulator.As a gamer wouldnt you want to play a game on the console it was designed for? Emulators
 ruin games.I got Jade Empire to play on the 360 and it glitches bad..</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Homegroup issue - Cant Fix</h2>
                    <p>After two days of gleeful experience with WIndows 10 - I found a major flaw </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted the ids files, etc - much of the other help points toward windows8.1 which does not apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Homegroup was working before the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only have two computers on homegroup - and they both go into an endless loop trying to verify password - without even asking for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the homegroup and network tools - to no avail</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have rebooted the machines after deleting C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Roaming\PeerNetworking idstore.sst</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cant someone please fix this issue correctly and easily.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This appears to be a rampant issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas ?? (please don't tell me to turnoff my anti-virus software) </p>

            <p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the editions of Windows 10 Computers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure you create a Home group from Windows 10 professional and join the same Homegroup using Windows 10 Home.</p>
<p>

            <p>These steps did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried both troubleshooters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted the "sst" files</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted the users from net share users /d</p>
<p>
</p><p>and a handful of other suggestions from users&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both of my pc's are brand new within the last year</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant create a homegroup - because it "sees" the old one - and I cant delete it - and of course - it spends forever trying to verify password.</p>
<p>

            I my case&nbsp;since I&nbsp; already have windows 10 in my Laptop , the issue presented itself&nbsp; when I upgrade my Desktop, so what I did was to revert to windows 7 using a disc image back up that I have even before the windows update have the readiness&nbsp; update to
 reserve windows 10 , because it appears that once that is install somehow it blocks incompatible apps from been installed and restore points stop working also, after that I was able to quit home group in my Desktop and my Laptop show no longer been in the
 desktop home group&nbsp; so instead of creating a home group in my desktop I created it in my Laptop&nbsp;which already have windows 10 and then I join it in my desktop pc , and that so far have taken care of it, is not an easy way but since I can't find a real solution
 even do I tried some suggestions here and other forums , nothing like an image in a back up that has worked for me many times before, so I&nbsp;strongly recommend to have a image back&nbsp;up done before&nbsp

            <p>I had a similar problem,&nbsp; I have 2 computers one Win 7 ultimate Sony all in one&nbsp; and Samsung laptop Win 8.1.</p>
<p>Homegroup had an issue with the Win7 Sony system (Homegroup master), couldnt&nbsp; connect from the&nbsp; Samsung using Homegroup.&nbsp; Unable to change, delete , print password or create new Homegroup on either PC.&nbsp; The Sony had the original Homegroup created on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I was able to connect to files via normal sharing, Homegroup wouldnt work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Win 10 and was unable to share files at all on the Sony PC with my Samsung.&nbsp; I was unable to share with or without Homegroup.&nbsp; Although I could see the Sony PC under network in file manger but unable to connect.&nbsp; I was able to Ping each PC
 and see them from the router, Internet was working also .&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried removing the IDSTORE files but it didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figured if I could&nbsp; get one of the PC's to let me create or remove the Homegroup It would work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running 1gb Ethernet (wired) connection.&nbsp; Both system have Wifi disabled, my network is segmented from the Wifi network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shutdown the Sony (Homegroup master) and disconnected the Ethernet cable.</p>
<p>I did the same from my Samsung laptop.&nbsp; I rebooted the Samsung laptop and disabled the Ethernet network and enabled Wifi and connected to the Wifi network.&nbsp; With the WIFI connection working, tested connecting to the internet.&nbsp; I did (control panel) (Network
 and Internet) (Choose Homegroup and Sharing Options).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my surprise all the Homegroup options were available,&nbsp; I created a New Homegroup and wrote down the Code/Password.&nbsp; I then booted the Sony PC and did the same, after disabling the Ethernet connection and enabling Wifi I was able to join the new Homegroup
 (entered the new password created on the Samsung</p>
<p>&nbsp;laptop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I could share/access/ see files across both platforms.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I had to see if it would work on the Ethernet side.&nbsp; I Shutdown the Sony PC and reconnected the Ethernet cable (I did not boot, wanted to boot Samsung first).&nbsp; I did the same on the Samsung laptop and rebooted.&nbsp; After the Samsung was signed on and Ethernet
 enabled/connected (tested by connecting to the internet) I booted the Sony PC and enabled/disabled Ethernet/Wifi.&nbsp; It showed the new Homegroup and my Samsung Laptop but I couldnt connect from either system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebooted my Samsung laptop and everything worked, I could share and access files from both systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far so good,&nbsp; although if I didnt have the network options (Ethernet and Wifi) I would of probably deleted the Ethernet Nic card in device manager and reinstall it.&nbsp; I would of had to wait until the weekend since my systems are needed for internet access
 during the week.</p>
<p>Cant jeopardize downtime.</p>

<p>Thanks for the hint, that has worked to mate my PC and my Surface Pro 3. </p>
<p>I set up the homegroup on my main PC before switching on the Surface tablet. Once my&nbsp;Surface started up, and having navigated to Homegroup settings, I was then asked to
<strong>join </strong>the homegroup by typing in the password.</p>

            I swear it is like you are telling my very same issue or issues. I just bought a brand new HP in Nov. and I swear this mess caused my hard drive to crash, it was within the "exchange" policy agreement so I just got a new computer. Then after my husband
 got a new printer, I'll be damned if the same **** didn't start in again. Troubleshooting till I was blue in the face, I'm no the most tech savvy person in the world but I know when something is not right with my computer and I'm seeing files and **** that
 I' like where the **** did that come from, so I delete the home group and like you said start over, things are ok for a minute, then it starts in again. Had to do a restore, almost damaged my hard drive yet again. I think I finally got it fixed after everyone's
 help on here. Thank you because I honestly was at my wits end and don't have $250 to shell out to have a brand new computer be fixed. I've had more than this problem with Windows 10 causing an issue somehow some way it seems like all the

<h3> pietro manciati  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bitlocker Key Recovery &#40;The worst customer experince since xbox 360 security code nonsense&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Well its funny, I'm enjoying my&nbsp;Surface&nbsp;2 and have received freezes, glitches, overheating, and arguably Xbox music closing on me time to time. This is not the case here as I'm trying to start a discussion along the lines of something that quite frankly,
 does need&nbsp;to exist in the&nbsp;Surface community. I am talking about the dreaded Bitlocker Key Recovery. Many if not all of you have experienced this on reboot of the device asking you to simply put in a 25 number&nbsp;code to resume your usage of the Surface. Sounds
 fairly simple, right? Wrong, you will need to access another computer or preferably a smart phone in my case the Nokia 920. The next step is to enter a website that will again ask you to sign in and input a key number. After inputting that number you will
 then proceed to type in a 25 (no really) a 25 number code into your Surface 2 to resume your usage.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Again this wouldn't be much of a problem if asked once but unfortunately you will have to do almost every time the device is&nbsp;rebooted which for most people is a major pain and frustration. An excuse to 'verify' that this is your computer and no one else
 is using it. Are you kidding me?&nbsp;What&nbsp;do you guys think that we're&nbsp;going to&nbsp;leave our&nbsp;Surfaces 2 on the train? That maybe the thief will reboot it and facepalm that he can't use it? This is simply not the case, this is merely another attempt to make sure that
 the user is using&nbsp;his or her device and not anyone else's. I could understand Microsoft to&nbsp;push for security features like the Xbox 360 security codes that I still have to enter my own cell phone number or email every month or so.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The main problem here is that most people do not appreciate this kind of precautions and most do not feel it to be necessary, we're not idiots and we don't need to be 'verified' upon command to do so. We understand Microsoft is pulling back updates because
 they are hurting more people than helping and we understand why. To whom is reading, Microsoft support team. Simply pull back Bitlocker Key Recovery and you will make many (if not all) very satisfied, satisfied that we never ever need to worry about this upon
 rebooting our devices. Thank you for reading, I hope I have made a point here.</p>

<p>'Failed to format the selected partition. [Error: 0x80004005]'</p>
<p>
