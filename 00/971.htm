<h2>            Office 365 - Email send failure - SPF record</h2>
                    <p>We are using a domain with the DNS record managed by Office 365 and when sending an email via the online Outlook webmail or via desktop based Outlook we are receiving delivery failures relating to the SPF record.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have checked the SPF record produced automatically when setting up the Office 365 account and it appears to be correct as
</p>
<div>
<p>TXT-<span><span>@</span></span><span> v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all</span></p>
<p>On the account we have multiple domains and are getting the same error with more than one account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do not use on site Exchange servers or other SMTP accounts, everything is routed via the Office 365 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anyone please advise how to resolve the issue.</p>

            <p>We are receiving a bounce back report from the receivers email domain which says.</p>
Why did SPF cause my mail to be rejected?
What is SPF?
<p>SPF is an extension to Internet e-mail. It prevents unauthorized people from forging your e-mail address (see the
<a href="http://www.openspf.org/Introduction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
introduction</a>). But for it to work, your own or your e-mail service provider's setup may need to be adjusted. Otherwise, the system may mistake you for an unauthorized sender.</p>
<p>Note that there is no central institution that enforces SPF. If a message of yours gets blocked due to SPF, this is because (1) your domain has declared an SPF policy that forbids you to send through the mail server through which you sent the message, and
 (2) the recipient's mail server detected this and blocked the message.</p>
<div>
An SPF-enabled mail server rejected a message that claimed an envelope sender address of
<em>steve@***.co.uk</em>.
<p>An SPF-enabled mail server received a message from  that claimed an envelope sender address of
.</p>
<p>However, the domain  has declared using SPF that it does not send mail through
. That is why the message was rejected.</p>
If you are <em>steve@***.co.uk</em>:
<p> should have given you a way to send mail through an authorized server.</p>
<p>If you are using a mail program as opposed to web-mail, you may need to update the "SMTP server" configuration setting according to your ISP's instructions. You may also need to turn on authentication, and enter your username and password in your mail program's
 options. Please contact your ISP for assistance.</p>
<p>If you run your own MTA, you may have to set a "smarthost" or "relayhost". If you are mailing from outside your ISP's network, you may also have to make your MTA use
<a href="http://www.openspf.org/Best_Practices/SMTP_Authentication" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">authenticated SMTP</a>. Ideally your server should listen on port 587 as well as port 25.</p>
<p>If your mail was correctly sent, but was rejected because it passed through a <em>
forwarding</em> service, as an interim solution you can mail the final destination address directly (it should be shown in the bounce message). See the
<a href="http://www.openspf.org/Best_Practices/Forwarding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forwarding best practices</a> (or refer the recipient there) for the discussion of a proper solution.</p>
<p>If you need further help, see our <a href="http://www.openspf.org/Support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support</a> section for free support and professional consulting services.</p>
<div>
If you are confident that your message did go through an authorized server:
<p>The administrator of the domain  may have incorrectly configured its SPF record. This is a common cause of mistakes.</p>
<p><em>Here's what you can do:</em> Contact the  postmaster and tell them that they need to change
's SPF record so that it authorizes . For example, they could change the record to something like</p>
<p>If you refer your postmaster to this web page, they should be able to solve the problem.</p>
If you did not send the message:
<p>SPF successfully blocked a forgery attempt; someone tried to send mail pretending to be from
, but the message was rejected before anybody saw it. This means SPF is working as designed.</p>

<p>Hi Monique</p>
<p>
</p><p>The orginal SPF TXT setting was just the standard default SPF value as setup automatically when we migrated to office 365. No I havent created any additional TXT records for SPF, just left it as implemented during setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue happens when sending from at least one other domain on our account.</p>

<p>Hi Ron,<br />
<br />
Focused and Other inbox are the new features of Outlook.com where it sorts your emails and focus on what matters most. Regarding your concern, it turns out that you disabled this feature on your account that's why Other inbox did not show up. To sort this out,
 we just need to enable it by performing the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From Outlook.com, open gear icon.</li><li>Select <strong>Options</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Layout</strong>, select <strong>Focused inbox</strong>.</li><li>Tick "<strong>Sort messages into Focused and Other</strong>".</li><li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, please check if Other inbox shows up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your update.</p>

    <title>WLAN connection problems on S60 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tvk65  say:</h3>
<h2>            WLAN connection problems on S60</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I had an E60 phone for about one year and could not understand what problems with connectivity people have on this forum. I have read a lot of messages about problems with connection to different WLANs - open, WEP/WPA, TLS protected and so on. My E60 worked
 well at my home (Linksys WRT54G WPA2-TKIP+AES), at work (Cisco 802.1x with Windows authentication) and had no any problems at airports/hotels open netwworks (I travel a lot)<br />
Yes sometimes I've seen errors like "No gateway reply", but normally refreshing the page I could get what I wanted.<br />
<br />
Some other reasons (for example, unavailability of v3 firmware for my E60 model code for a long time) forced me to buy E65<br />
<br />
<br />
And I've got problems! Actually problems were not related to CONNECT to the WLANs, but to connect to Internet over it. My problems were getting premanently "No gateway reply" in majority of networks I tried to connect. And funny thing that two phones laying
 side by side old E60 and new E65 with same one-to-one settings had shown different results: E60 worked perfectly while E65 was showing only "No gateway reply"<br />
<br />
Being intrigued I started investigation why it's so. First, I installed IPInfo utility
<a href="http://tinyhack.com/freewarelist/s603rd/2007/03/09/ifinfo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://tinyhack.com/freewarelist/s603rd/2007/03/09/ifinfo/</a><br />
which had shown one difference between phones: E60 had a valid IP address with valid DNS names for that WLAN and E65 had not.Of course, if E65 had not proper DNS servers it couldn't find any web page.<br />
<br />
The multiple advices on this topic on this forum to setup static IP worked, and I understand why. But you know which static IP address, mask, gateway and DNS servers only for your home and work networks. For public hotspots they are not available and DHCP should
 work for them to get connected.<br />
<br />
So first my finding was - E65 do not receive IP address from DHCP server.<br />
I started dig in that direction. I've installed MS Network monitor on my laptop and captured packets on WLAN from E65 and DHCP server.<br />
My second finding was that proper sequence of packets between E65 and DHCP server was not ended properly. Honestly, it was ended properly several times (when E65 could connect properly and get IP address) but the ratio was about 1/10 (one good try from ten)<br />
And this was not only for my home network, but for work network too, with another ratio (about 1/4)<br />
Normally the DHCP sequence should consist of 4 packets<br />
1 Client broadcast packet to find DHCP server<br />
2 Server responses broadcast with its address<br />
3 Client asks specifically server to assign IP addres<br />
4 Server acknowledges requested address or if it is used already assign one from a pool<br />
<br />
After this sequence client sets assigned IP address and continues to work. Together with IP address DHCP server sends network mask, default gateway, DNS servers and possibly additional information asked by client.<br />
<br />
I've looked into packets, everythings looked OK. But 4th packet from DHCP server was not sent to E65 resulted in problems.<br />
<br />
I was stucked a little bit and started to thing that problem comes from my LinkSys router. But the same situation in a powerfull corporate environment.<br />
<br />
Then I discovered my third finding: WLAN driver on the phone has TWO IP Addresses on one MAC address!You can see it via IPInfo or Ipconfig utility on the phone. E65 and E60 both had a second IP address in their MAC interface. It was from 169.254.x.x network.
 People working with MS Windows auto IP adresses knows what it is ;-)<br />
<br />
Nothing criminal in that. All computers can have two IP addresses on the same network interface. One only thing - they should be set manually, not using DHCP.<br />
<br />
Looking through catched packets I saw that phone periodically sends ARP (Address resolution protocol) packets from its 169.254.x.x. This is simply broadcast packet showing IP and MAC addresses and other hosts on the network can build ARP table where IP address
 corresponds MAC address. This is basis of Ethernet networks.<br />
<br />
Catching that I looked more carefully on the tracing and found, that if after sending DHCP request packet (part 3) and before receiving DHCP ACK packet (part 4) phone sends ARP packet from 169.254.x.x address DHCP do not provide last DHCP ACK packet. In my
 understanding DHCP server when receiving ARP packet which show that particular MAC addres alreay has 169.254.x.x address do not send last packet with acknoledge.<br />
<br />
If no ARP packet in between - phone is getting proper IP address from DHCP server and works properly<br />
<br />
I beleive, that due to nature of working on shared media (radiochannel) and due to Ethernet standards (if collisions happened packet resent after delay) in busy WLAN networks such as corporate, public hotspots, ARP packets are sent less often and chances to
 get proper IP address increase. That's explain why success ratio in my case is higher in corporate network.<br />
<br />
The fact that older E60 get IP address more often that E65 can be explained that E60 is a little bit slower and therefore ARP packets are generated rarely. Or maybe something was changed in FP1 (E65)<br />
<br />
And my last finding was that despite of DHCP server sends every IP address details according to the standard phone do not set proper default gateway, leaving it as 0.0.0.0.<br />
It is working in principle, but better to follow DHCP standard.<br />
<br />
So, summary (apart from problems with connectin to secured networks - WEP/WPA preshred keys, certificftes so on):<br />
<br />
1. WLAN on S60 (checked on E60,E65) has default address 169.254.x.x. (not clear for me why it is)<br />
2 WLAN driver on S60 tries to get dinamic IP after connecting to the WLAN. It sends proper sequence of DHCP packets<br />
3 Phone periodically broadcast ARP packets. When such packets wedged in between DHCP REQ and DHCP ACK packets, DHCP do not send last DHCP ACK packet. Phone do not get proper IP addres, DNS server and other settings.<br />
<br />
I consider it as obvious bug in Symbian.<br />
<br />
Questions to Nokia:<br />
1. Why they need two IP addresses?<br />
2. Why ARP packets are sent so often?<br />
3. Why WLAN driver do not set gateway address received from DHCP?<br />
<br />
Guys, if you could read all of this - could you please make additional tests? I mean for all S60 phones with WiFi check what I've found?<br />
<br />
It would be nice to get this confirmed and then to send mutual request to Nokia to refresh their firmware ASAP.<br />
<br />
I send this info to local Nokia, they responded that somebody will get back to me. Two weeks passed - no reaction.

            Hi vadimt<br />
<br />
When you say you contacted local Nokia are you referring to your local Nokia Service Centre or your local Nokia office ?<br />
<br />
I don't know this for a definite fact but I'd imagine the staff at your local NSC don't work for Nokia directly, and you'd have more joy contacting Nokia directly.<br />
<br />
You can find Nokia's contact details here :<br />

            I contacted local Nokia office, not service center. I beleive it should be communicated through Nokia engineer working at Nokia office.<br />
In Nokia service center they proposed to update firmware, but as that is brand new phone with latest frimware there were no sense to do that.<br />
<br />
More over as far as I can see this is related not only to my E60 or E65, but also other models. Try to read posts on this forum and you will recognize all symptoms of that problem.<br />
<br />
Let's just wait when others will do the similar exercise with other models.<br />
<br />
I can be wrong, but if so I would like to have answers on my questions from Nokia

            In you've contacted Nokia directly all that I can suggest is that you wait for someone to contact you back.<br />
<br />
These forums are an end to end user support mechanism so you won't receive any feedback from Nokia directly here.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm having exactly the same problem with WLAN connectivity as you are (my phone is E61 with the latest firmware). Your troubleshooting looks pretty impressive and makes a lot of sense.<br />
<br />
When I get back home (my AP is A-Link RR24 configured to use WPA-PSK and hidden SSID), I'll try to manually assign IP settings instead of relying on DHCP and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
Btw, have you tried if public SSID makes any difference?

            Aaargh! Just noticed that you can't edit your posts (or I must have missed something), otherwise I would have deleted my remark about SSID as it wasn't mentioned which setting was in use (public/hidden).

            Hi,<br />
<br />
type of WLAN (public or hidden, WEP or WPA, etc) has nothing common with DHCP problems. You can be coonected to the network but still do not receive proper IP address.<br />
<br />
I've made a simple experiment which seems confirms my findings.<br />
If you have met NO GATEWAY REPLY condition try to reconnect your phone to your WLAN and at the same time try to browse any big enough web page from your notebook or other device (even another phone) via the same WLAN. Just to make load on WLAN. YOu can get
 success connect ratio up to 8/10 from 1/10. :-)

            Hello,<br />
<br />
I've a e61i and I experience a similar problem. My phone work very well on WiFi network with no encryption as well as 64-bit wep.<br />
<br />
At home I've 2 wireless routers, both encrypted at 128 bits, one with WEP and the other with WPA. On both of them I can correctly obtain an IP thru DHCP, but the traffic do not go thru.<br />
<br />
By using IfInfo I think I discovered the reason of the problem (unless IfInfo is not working properly...) and it seems a bug related to the netmask, broadcast and gateway settings. The router is 192.168.15.1 and this is what I get:<br />
<br />
1) DHCP case -- I get two IP adresses: the 169.254.x.x and the one assigned to the router. DNS is also set properly, but both gateway, broadcast and netmask are set to 0.0.0.0 for both IPs.<br />
<br />
IP Addr: 169.254.162.106<br />
Netmask: 0.0.0.0<br />
Broadcast: 0.0.0.0<br />
Gateway: 0.0.0.0<br />
DNS1: 192.168.15.1<br />
<br />
IP Addr: 192.168.15.100<br />
Netmask: 0.0.0.0<br />
Broadcast: 0.0.0.0<br />
Gateway: 0.0.0.0<br />
DNS1: 192.168.15.1<br />
<br />
2) Static IP 192.168.15.64, netmask set to 255.255.255.0 and gateway and DNS set to 192.168.15.1. The 169.254.x.x disappears and I get only one IP which is set to:<br />
<br />
IP Addr: 192.168.15.64<br />
Netmask: 0.0.0.0<br />
Broadcast:192.168.15.255<br />
Gateway: 192.168.15.1<br />
DNS1: 192.168.15.1<br />
<br />
So in conclusion, it seems that with 128bit encryption, in the DHCP case gateway, broadcast and netmask are not assigned correctly! While in the Static IP case the netmask is still not assigned correctly!!!<br />
<br />
Hope this can help...<br />
<br />

            Based on my short tests at home yesterday, I'd actually think that there might be a connection between DHCP and hidden SSID. Others have similar thoughts:<br />
-----------<br />
"I've had the same problem, and resolved it by broadcasting my SSID instead of hiding it. With my SSID hidden, three other wireless PC's and a wireless printer connected to the hidden SSID, but not the N95.<br />
Sounds like there is a problem with hidden SSID's and DHCP."<br />
<br />
source:<br />
/discussions/board/message?board.id=connectivity&amp;;message.id=6964&amp;view=by_date_ascending&amp;page=9<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
At home I have two wlans, both using WPA-PSK, but one has public SSID and the other one has hidden SSID. Now I changed AP settings in E61 so that it has fixed IP for the wlan with hidden SSID. For the wlan with public SSID, my E61 still has DHCP enabled.<br />
<br />
Now E61 works fine with both networks. As said, my tests were short, but results were promising :)

Btw, with "static IP", do you mean a case where router's DHCP server assigns a specific IP for a certain MAC?

<h2>            how to stop install of technical preview &#40;Win10&#41;</h2>
                    Hello people, I need to know how to stop the install of the technical preview. Basically I downloaded and started the install thinking it was a download manager for the .iso however as you may know it uses windows update to install the preview. I'm running
 Win7 Ultimate and now windows update keeps pestering me about the technical preview, which I actually wanted to install on another SSD. Before anyone asks, I have tried Show all available updates, then hide update but it keeps coming back. Anyone with the
 same issue? Anyone able to help?

<h2>            Recovery Drive fails to find USB stick</h2>
                    <p>I'm using an iMac with Parallels with a Windows 10 Pro activated installation that's been upgraded once from the initial purchased disk installation to 10586.3. The USB stick (64GB) is seen by File explorer. When I try to create a recovery drive Windows
 fails to find the USB stick. I've tried many times, rebooting and reading through the questions on this forum but cannot find a solution. Must be a bug, since a number of people get the same problem with no apparent solution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know of a solution that works?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your prompt reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've two VMs, one Windows 10 Pro and another Windows 10 Home, so I thought I'd try creating a recovery drive from Windows 10 Home, it did so successfully, a bit slow but that's not a problem. So success there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried again to create a recovery drive in windows 10 Pro and get the same problem a window opens asking me to insert a USB drive as before. I used the same USB stick for both tests.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure that this is a Parallels problem, the USB Drive works and Windows finds it, but Pro stalls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't be hardware or the VM as both are the same, same machine, same OS, WMs set up identically, there must be a solution, others here have reported the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for replying, it did prompt me to try Windows 10 Home.</p>

<br />how do I retrieve old emails from external hardrive?
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />For a more definitive answer, you'll need to provide how these files are stored as in - in a PST file (from a POP3 account, an archive file, an exported file etc etc) or an OST file (from an Imap or Exchange account).
<br />
<br />Is this "external hard drive" one from a failed system or a stand-alone external harddrive (i.e. such as a MyPassport drive)? Reason for question is that if it's from a failed system, some folders may be hidden using conventional procedures.
<br />
<br />The generic answer most commonly provided is to search for PST files on the external hard drives to locate what you're looking for and then add that file to your Outlook profile via File --&gt; Open &amp; Export --&gt; Outlook Data File --&gt; browse to the location where the PST file is located.
<br />
<br />If your data is stored in an .OST file, you're going to need a 3rd party OST2PST conversion program.

<br />.I am not technical enough to move these back to Outlook profile? What does profile mean?I
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />In simplified terms, an Outlook "Profile" is where information is stored that is used by Outlook when it's opened. There can be many profiles. The "default profile" is the one used when  you open Outlook. For the sake of this question, not something you need to be concerned about.
<br />
<br />In terms of moving PST files back................
<br />
<br />If your WD drive is permanently connected (i.e. not something you constantly connect/reconnect - again for the sake of this answer) then the way to open a PST file is as follows
<br />
<br />1) From within Outlook, go to File --&gt; Open &amp; Export --&gt; Outlook Data File
<br />2) Browse to the PST file you want to open and select it
<br />3) It will now appear in the Outlook Navigation Pane where you can check the folders within the PST file to confirm it has the information you're looking for
<br />
<br />Now the next question is "what do you want to do with the email items once you have them in Outlook?, as in, do you just want to have the items accessible or do you want to copy them somewhere?

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />If you "lost" the file on your external hard drive AND you opened the PST file in Outlook as per the provided instructions - then it means you "moved" the file from your hard drive to some location on your local hard drive as opposed to "copying" the file. Unfortunately, it's completely unclear as to what the current state is since you don't indicate what problem(s) you encountered.
<br />
<br />If you actually opened the PST file in Outlook by going to Outlook menu --&gt; File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Data Files tab --&gt; take note of the folder path/file name of the file in question.
<br />
<br />As for anyone at MS dealing with this, not sure that this is the type of issue that they would deal with (just a personal opinion) but in any case, the MS contact phone numbers are listed on the page below - just pick the one applicable to your region

                    <p>Hello, I purchased the band to monitor my hearth, in the app or online I was only able to find some info on the how to compare section.</p>
<p>Is the a page that I have yet to discover or an app that will show me more detailed information on my hearth?</p>
<p>I'm looking for patterns, skips, spikes, lows etc. Just to see if there is any anomaly.
</p>
<p>Maybe some indication on what is healthy vs not normal and so forth.</p>
<p>I'm wearing the band 2 all day with exception of when I shower</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any reference is really appreciated.</p>
<p>Best</p>

            <p>You can have slightly more precise HR tracking if you monitor an exercise, which increases the measurements frequency.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you will be disappointed to know that there are no patterns or&nbsp;skips detection. You can usually see the highest HR measured during an exercise and the average HR but, that's about it.</p>
<p>Remember that the Band 2 is not a medical device.</p>

<h2>            How to pull in Live mail sub folders and all other emails that are not in the Inbox&#63;</h2>
                    I bought Office 2011 because the default mail program did not sync with my live mail well at all and the biggest problem is all the subfolders I have created did not show up so those emails are unreachable using the computer app. &nbsp;However, I am having
 that same issue with Office 2011. &nbsp;It pulled in the emails I have in my Inbox but anything else including subfolders, sent messages, and deleted messages don't sync. &nbsp;Am I doing something wrong?

The option, "BY ALBUM", is only available when you select an artist(s)/album(s).

            This is what I did for a client earlier this afternoon: Sign out of iCloud - when asked to backup calendar and contacts locally, say No, then sign back in (and don't sync any local folders to iCloud if asked). It will sync everything back down to Outlook.

            Yes, that is how it was with my client. Only Outlook on his windows desktop had duplicate events and the error message when he tried to delete them. He signed out of the icloud app and signed back in - this deleted the icloud from Outlook and reloaded everything in the icloud.

                    <p>How to overcome the issue of threshold limit 5000 in SharePoint Online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried different options to overcome this issue, it is working but only if my filtered result contains less than 5000 records.&nbsp; My real problem is that when my filtered result is more than 5000 then I am getting the error message regarding the threshold
 error.<br />
<br />
I have tried,<br />
<br />
- Creating index column and filter<br />
- Recursive call on SharePoint list using rest API (getting top 5000 records)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you suggest me the different options that I can try?</p>

<p>Hi Krunal,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to explain that it is an expected behavior to get an threshold error when your filtered result is more than 5000 in SharePoint Online.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The List View Threshold is approximately is 5000 items by default
</span><span>and is set to allow users to work with large lists, but keep good performance. And for SharePoint Online, this limit can't be changed.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To work around the limit, please refer to the actions suggested in this article:
</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-large-lists-and-libraries-in-SharePoint-b8588dae-9387-48c2-9248-c24122f07c59" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Manage large lists and libraries in SharePoint</span></a><span>.</span></p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have rows of data that should be nested with some rows being subsets of some row above them:&nbsp; L1, L2, L3 column headers.</p>
<p>I was hoping to create the nesting relationships by outlining, in order to show a printed diagram of the dependency links.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I couldn't figure out how to get the outline relationships to print out, I went a different route by creating a separate Smart Art document tree diagram as a horizontal hierarchy with lines showing which records depend on higher level records.&nbsp; That's
 the output I want, but I would rather have it be part of my familiar data rows where I track many other details about each item, rather than having it be a separate diagram.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>I am currently counting 5 different threads relating to users getting HTTP 500 Errors when trying to access there hotmail/outlook.com accounts - but yet none of them have received a response. Hey forum moderators, what's going on? Don't give me, they are
 all answered in order because clearly that is not happening here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is going on upwards of 9 days now without service and no response from Answers.Microsoft.com. I would go to the Hotmail server status page to see if this is a system wide issue, but I cannot access that either, go figure. Would be great if someone could
 provide a little insight into what is going on here. moderators?</p>

<h2>            Using Office 2010 to open and to convert Office 2003 documents.</h2>
                    
<p>I am running XP Professional. I downloaded Office 2010 and the installations seemed to go smoothly.</p>
<p>However: when I click on a 2003 Powerpoint file to open it, I get the message: "This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action. Create an association in the Folder Options control panel."</p>
<p>I can open the 2003 document when I first open 2010 and the go to File&gt;Open. Then when I save the original document as a Powerpoint file (not as a 2003 doc) it converts the file as an unrecognizable document and saves it as such.</p>
<p>I'm also having problems with Excel, but one thing at a time. Word 2010 seems to work fine.</p>

    <title>Excel Stock Data Type - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coachmrj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Stock Data Type</h2>
                    <p>I have been working with the stock data type for the last few days and noticed a couple of things (Excel 2016, Win 10).&nbsp; There are some mutual fund symbols that will not work with the data type.&nbsp; I noticed the data source is Morningstar so directly searched
 on their site by the symbol and they&nbsp;work fine. (2 examples LZOEX, DIISX).&nbsp; Not sure if they should work or not.&nbsp; I am guessing the success of this feature will depend on the&nbsp;ability to identify common US funds.&nbsp; Is there a way to identify/use these funds?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, when I open my&nbsp;workbook the spreadsheet tabs no longer show at the bottom.&nbsp; I am guessing something&nbsp;this obvious does not occur in every workbook.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I close the warning message about "Financial market information is provided as-is..." the tabs
 reappear.&nbsp; I can also adjust the screen size and then maximize the screen again to resolve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall - thanks for the stock data type.&nbsp; I can't wait to see what else is coming for rich data types.</p>

<p>Hi Coachmrj,</p>
<p>First, thanks for being an Office Insider and providing feedback! I'm seeing the same behavior for those funds - I'm not able to get anything to return when I search for those in Excel.&nbsp; You were correct to check for them on Morningstar since they
 are the provider of the data, and in the future you can also look on MSN Money.&nbsp; Unfortunately, seeing something on one of those sites doesn't guarantee that the same data will be available in Excel, but we're trying to get as close to 1:1 parity between MSN
 Money and Excel as possible.&nbsp; But there are also some cases where we're simply not able to for licensing reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the "Financial market information..." bar - thanks for letting us know.&nbsp; We're looking in to this and hope to have a fix for it soon - this is definitely not expected behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>Similar problem … Yesterday I installed the Excel 365 update to get access to the new data types. After creating a table of about 300+ equity positions and applying the Stock data type, all 300 of them with the exception of two, KDP &amp; DLPH populated as expected.
 Both of these stocks trade on the NYSE. Checking with MS Money, Schwab &amp; Merrill Lynch both symbols retrieved the correct data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing a manual search on the Data Selector pane also did not return any usable data.</p>

<h2>            Stereotyped accumulators and the strange attitude to them of representation Nokia in Russia</h2>
                    I live in Russia, in Siberia. Recently has got in "authorized point of sale" the counterfeit accumulator. On this incident has informed in a support service. Also has received from them the strange formal reply: " As our service is not engaged in realization
 and has no direct communication with dealers, unfortunately, your question is outside of our competence. " If Nokia cares of the image why till now in "authorized point of sale" counterfeit accumulators are on sale? Why seller do not deprive with authorization?<br />

<h3> wehttam&#96;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blackjack II, Exchnage 2007 SP1, Prompting to reboot every 20 min</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Samsung Blackjack II that approximatly every 20 min is giving me a pop-up that states:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Recent changes to your device require a restart. During this process you cannot make or receive phone calls, including emergency calls. Restart your device now? "</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is only affecting this one 6.1 device. We have another Blackjack II running WM6.1 that is connected to our Exchange 2003 server that is not experiencing this either.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought the cause might be the "Refresh Interval (Hours)" setting on the server, but it is set to 4 hours.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did a google search for this issue, but my 'Kung Fu' must be weak as I only found 1 relivant response and it did not have a solution, other than stating the manufacture believes it&nbsp;is an issue with the Exchange Server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for you help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I couldn't figure out a way to look at the policy settings but I did contact our Exchange Server Administrator.&nbsp; He informed me that they were aware that this is a problem with WM 6.1.&nbsp; They finally updated some settings
 yesterday so that my phone is no longer being forced to restart.&nbsp; So my Blackjack is working fine now.</p>
