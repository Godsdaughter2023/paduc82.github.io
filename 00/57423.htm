<div>Thanks for your reply,</div>
<div><br />
<div>After searching, I know we can change this image by replace&nbsp;<b>bootres.dll </b>
(A:\Windows\Boot\Resources - &nbsp;A: Windows installation local disk). Do we have some other ways or software<b>&nbsp;</b>to see, view and change properties of this dll?</div>

<p>In other words they don't want their logo's to be taken away by anyone that actually owns their own computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They want to keep everyone as corporate as possible, it's the same reasoning behind the use of Metro, they don't care about people being human beings, and would rather that people become lobotomized robots following what the corporation want's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if people have told them time after time that Microsoft have made computing as ugly as possible with the train station toilet door look of their icons, no one likes their utilitarian approach to computing that they seem to be trying to follow, and having
 the interface also on a phone just means to customers that they consider that computers are now just glorified phones.</p>

            And that they made Windows 10 use all the same tiles/iconery is just prooving they are following their own agenda of not caring about what people tell them, but they did fire the last guy that made window 8,, so will they follow the suicide machines pre-set
 and do the same to who ever put's out windows 10 ?<br />

<h2>            How find outlook.pst and archive.pst in Windows Explorer &#63;</h2>
                    we just got a new PC with WIndows 7<br />
<br />
I'm trying to point my backup program to where my outlook.pst and archive.pst files are located, but they are not visible when I go down the tree.<br />
<br />
when I do a search in Explorer, it locates the file as being located in C:/Users/MyPC/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Outlook<br />
but when I go to look for it, there is not folder called "AppData" in the location C:/Users/MyPC/<br />
<br />
where can I find the files I'm looking for ?<br />

            If you cannot set PS 2018 as default then be aware there’s currently a bug where the default file type cannot be set to a program/app, Microsoft are working on a fix.
<br />If this isn’t the problem in your case can you elaborate as to what you’re doing &amp; what exactly is/isn’t happening?

            My apologies. This is one of the bugs which has been caused by new Windows update. File association has been giving this problem. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft is well aware of this issue and has been working to fix this issue. I think next build may have this fix in place.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, I would recommend that you submit this issue as a feedback to Windows team through Feedback Hub

<h2>            Win 10 1903 Cortana not available</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader1">The issue</p>
<p class="contentStandard">My tower running Win 10 with the latest updates to this date (7/7/2019) doesn't have Cortana. It's a shame not to utilize all of the features offered by Windows, so I'd like to have it enabled.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">The machine was upgraded from Windows 8.0 up to the latest version with updates.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentHeader1">Note</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I also own a notebook, with the latest Win 10 updates, which runs Cortana without any issues.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Both machines were purchased in Czechia, although the notebook is imported from France.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentHeader1">My steps</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Since I've received both of my machines in non-English language cultures, I had to change the region, display language, preferred language and speech-language to English (United States).</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Doing so on my notebook enabled Cortana, didn't work for the tower.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentHeader1">The current state</p>
<p class="contentStandard">After the latest update, my tower now displays a Cortana icon in the settings. Before 1903 it wasn't there and the only place where I could find any references to Cortana was in permissions.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Subissue</p>
<p class="contentStandard">From time to time I get a weird bug where I have English (United Kingdom) and English (Czech) alongside my selected languages - English (United States), Czech, Russian.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Don't know if this could have an effect on the Cortana situation, but I decided to mention it anyway. I may have fixed the issue by installing the UK language pack, setting it to default, the setting the USA one to default and uninstalling
 the UK pack. Can't confirm yet as the mentioned language issue appears randomly (couldn't figure out an STR).<br />
</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">Cortana</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I've tried to set everything up again like I've mentioned above in #My-steps after the update. In the Cortana settings page, I only have a Language ComboBox with a selection of different English versions and English US selected.
 Below that a Default language button. Nothing else.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Pressing the Default language button clears the language ComboBox - content changes to "Choose one...", and the Default language button disappears.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">When I decide to reselect my previously selected language, English US, is not present in the options.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I only have English UK, English Canada, English&nbsp; Australia, English India.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentHeader1">A cry for help</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Yes, I've googled around and I can confirm that I'm not the only one with this issue. Some people just forgot to add Cortana to the taskbar, others had to run scripts in the PowerShell and/or do some regedit magic.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">None of that helped me and so here I am... Asking for help to activate Cortana...</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">And no, reinstalling Windows is not an option for me.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Thank you for any help and suggestions.</p>

            Hi Denis
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />I recommend you remove all additional languages except for English United Kingdom and US. 
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Time &amp; language &gt; Language
<br />Under Preferred languages, select Russian and Czech
<br />Click Remove 
<br />
<br />It is also possible you might need to install the Speech Pack for the US if it is your default language in your system.
<br />
<br />In that same window, click on 'English (United States)'
<br />Click Options
<br />Under Speech, select Download. It may take a minute or two for the speech pack to load.
<br />
<br />Sign out and then sign back in for the new speech pack to be added to speech options.
<br />
<br />Go back to Settings &gt; Time &amp; language &gt; Language, select your new language, and then use the up-arrow button to move it to the top of the list and make it the default.
<br />
<br />Go to Speech, and make sure the Speech language setting is aligned with the previous settings.
<br />
<br />Sign out and then sign back in for the new settings to take effect. 
<br />
<br />These are all the supported languages. 
<br />
<br />Australia: English
<br />
<br />Brazil: Portuguese
<br />
<br />Canada: English/French
<br />
<br />China: Chinese (Simplified)

    <title>Xbox one achievements not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox one achievements not working</h2>
                    
<p><span>So this is is the problem I am expierencing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I previously owned destiny for the xbox 360 and unlocked something like 26 achievements.
</span></p>
<p><span>yesterday I bought destiny for the xbox one and I started playing. After the very first mission I unlocked all 3 achievements on my xbox on. When I checked my achievements I received a blank black screen saying error. After a half hour I was able to
 check my achievements and I noticed I unlocked 3. Then when I scrolled through the list I also noticed I unlocked all of the same xbox 360 destiny achievements and received zero gamerscore for them.
</span></p>
<p>its so easy to see for your selves. When you view my xbox account you can see my destiny xbox one achievements and it shows this exactly. 3/41 achievements unlocked. 70/1000 gamerscore. And it also shows 26 achievements unlocked. My gamerscore only went
 up by 70.</p>
<p>What seems to have happened is my xbox one confused destiny xbox 360 achievements for xbox one achievements. I have called xbox live support many times on this topic and they all told me to post on the forums. &nbsp;basically I have no way of earning the xbox
 one achievements until they are either removed or another solution is given.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The systems seem to be having troubles processing achievements of late. Don't give it to much worry though. Give it a week or two and they will all appear out of nowhere. I do understand the confusion though, I have had the same issues a while back. It was
 annoying &gt;.&lt;</p>

<p>Sorry to say there spyro but it's not that they aren't appearing it's that I earned 26 achievements from doing the first mission in destiny. That should not have happened. Not only that but they didn't give me gamerscore. And now that they show unlocked,
 I cannot attain them until they are corrected and removed from my xbox account. </p>

<p>Any one who wNts to see the issue please click my gamer tag and look at my achievements. Then go to destiny xbox one. Look at the stats and the achievements I have unlocked. Then compare that to my gamerscore. It is far from right. I am extremely frustrated

<p>Maybe you should try to delete your profile of your console and re-download it again (don't worry, you won't lose anything). That way it might get rid of the glitched achievements. I had the same problem with Black Ops II on the 360 and back then it worked
 for me. (I unlocked the achievements but they didn't show up in my profile, so I re-downloaded the profile and earned them again, the second time around they did unlock properly).</p>

<p>(Make sure you know your email and password because you're going to need them when signing in again).</p>
<p>I don't know if this is going to work but you might give it a try.</p>

<h2>            Problem with program startup and slow PC&#33;</h2>
                    My problem is the following:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A few days ago my computer began to slow down. As usually a ran some optimizer programs to speed it up. I didn't help and my PC just went MAD! When startup my PC it takes a lot of time to load. When I log into my User the Gadgets on the desktop DON'T load,
 but other programs do start. When I want to surf the web I use Safari (one of the few programs loading on my PC) and it takes a lot to load. Microsoft Office starts and the Windows Explorer. When I want to open iTunes it doesn't load. A funny thing is that
 on the Task Manager appears the process "iTunes.exe" has if the program was running but it doesn't show ANYTHING related to iTunes. Sometimes the menu on the Windows logo freezes and it's unaccesible. The Wi-Fi logo on the notification bar appears as if it
 was loading, but my PC is already connected to the internet. VLC Player opens with NO PROBLEM, but Windos Media Player won't start (the same as iTunes). The Windows Explorer freezes sometimes. When I want to log out and shutdown the PC it gets stuck and won't
 shutdown. WHEN IN SAFE MODE I can open iTunes and some other programs. When I want to install something I CAN'T, just in Safe Mode.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I ran a few error check test and defragmented the disk with "Advanced SystemCare 4", I cleaned the registry with "CCleaner". I don't know what to do..... HELP!!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Some info: I use Windows 7 Professional on a desktop with a Core 2 Duo 2.8GHz and 4GB RAM with 500GB of memory. The computer was running fine until a few days (maybe a week) ago. I recently move around 100GB of files to an external harddrive. HELP!!!!!!</div>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Ditch Advanced System Care and similarly over-hyped programs&nbsp;whiich are like snake-oil and will
<br />
cause issues while fixing nothing. CCleaner is&nbsp;a fine utility&nbsp;for cleaning the file system however even
<br />
its registry cleaner can cause issues.<br />
<br />
===================<br />
<br />
Use the Clean Boot and other methods to try to determine the cause of and/or eliminate the issues.<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER<br />
had on this machine including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which can&nbsp;cause<br />
strange issues).<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>Do these :</strong></p>
<p>Try these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.<br />
<br />

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />
reference (if you have a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check that).<br />

===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods
<br />
above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are
<br />
found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

    <title>Adjusting Apps, Games Family Settings for a Child. Adjust the age 16 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rxgadget  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adjusting Apps, Games Family Settings for a Child. Adjust the age 16 or 17 but allow&#47;specify certain games such as Doom or Wolfenstein able to play</h2>
                    <p>Thank you ahead of time for any assistance as I have gone through every support item I could think of or find to help me adjust this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a mature 15yo and is under Family as Child as I would like to have some monitoring if necessary.&nbsp; Although I have not been given any reason to have to prevent anything so far.&nbsp; I specifically purchased Doom and Wolfenstein for them to play.&nbsp; I set
 the apps, games restiction to 16 then 17 and no access is allowed..&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have verified there are no Blocked games including the mentioned ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Directly below the list of games it show the ability to ADD Games to play which to me means avoid the age restriction for certain games I feel he is able to handle.&nbsp; Again I only have the restriction just as a fail safe because he is a teenager.&nbsp; While there
 is quite a bit of blood and gore as other concerns other parents may have with Doom and Wolfenstein I have played both and feel he is able to handle playing the same.&nbsp; However as I mention being a teenager and leaving open access gives the ability to wander
 and try something that he may not realize what he is choosing to play and be exposed to something much more inappropriate that he may be uncomfortable with.&nbsp; I restrict access to certain websites for the same reason or more commonly&nbsp; because of the ads that
 are on them lead to an inappropriate site or video that I would not want to see myself nor anyone else.&nbsp; but those ads are out there and so are those games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I explained this properly..&nbsp; I want him to enjoy playing on his new XBox One S.&nbsp; I want him to be able to also come to me if he wants to play something that may be restricted and talk about it.&nbsp; If I get on my account and play it and feel he can play
 it I would let him watch and make sure he is comfortable playing it knowing it is a game and it is not real life in both of these cases.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello RxGadget,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm glad to see you getting involved in the Xbox universe. Welcome aboard!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's plenty we can do to give you control over the Xbox One system. To get started, lets talk about the parental control options available to you, and how you can access them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox One has one of the most vast set of protocols currently available on a home console.<br />
<br />
To start, make sure that your child already has a Microsoft account on the console, you can always create one if necessary. Next, we will be adding your child account to a family package. To do this, venture to the home screen on your Xbox One, and make sure
 you're signed in as yourself (not your child).</p>
<p>
</p><p>From here, click on&nbsp;<strong>My games &amp; apps</strong>, then select <strong>Settings</strong>. Then, under account scroll over to
<strong>Family Settings</strong>. From here you can select <strong>Manage family members</strong> and add your child's account to a family.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Microsoft privacy statement should pop up, click next to continue or privacy statement if you want to learn more information about Microsoft's privacy policies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, you should be able to click the child's account under the family settings page and click set parental controls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are three types of content restrictions: Access to content and apps, Web filtering and descriptions in OneGuide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Access to content and apps, you can choose Child Defaults, Teen Defaults, Adult Defaults or Custom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking Custom will offer much more customisation, you'll have to scroll to the right to see them all. There are too many possible protocols to list here, but you'll be able to control whether your kids can purchase content, use Skype, access social networks
 or share their information with friends or random players online. You can also control if they can purchase or view purchasable content, join multiplayer games, add friends, and much more. If you decide they can add friends, you can even set it where you have
 to approve them manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Web filtering is much simpler: You can select one of six filtering systems, which range from Designed for Children, which only allows kid-friendly sites, to Warned on Adult, which displays warnings on adult content but does not block it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With these tools at your disposal, you can ensure that each member of your household has an Xbox One experience suited to his or her needs. Even better, unlike PS4 sub-accounts, which stay linked to a parent's account in perpetuity, Xbox One accounts can
 be delinked once a child is ready to fly the coop.</p>

    <title>emails missing after outlook express compacting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlstandifer  say:</h3>
<h2>            emails missing after outlook express compacting</h2>
                    <p>On Saturday afternoon. I was in my OE inbox. Doing stories. But when I closed it. The same pop up messages pops up"to free up disk space on your c disk outlook express can compact your folders. This might take a few minutes". So I did and clicked on yes.
 But I wanted to restart my computer. After the first folder was finished. Theres a usual error message in red pops up"this folder is being used by outlook express or by another program"...So I click cancel. Then I restart my computer. Then I open OE. I should
 have done what I did before. Move some messages to the "draft"...folder. But that was my mistake. So I closed OE and the pop up message pops up..."to free up disk space on your c disk, outlook express can compact your folders". So I clicked yes. But most the
 folders some reason takes a long time to compact. But then the error message in red pops up. So I click ok. And I watch and wait for the compacting to finish.</p>
<p>But when it finished. I opened my inbox...and I notice a year of messages just somehow missing. How do I get them back or is there a way? Lots of messages I had was important. Need help if can.</p>

    <title>Windows Internal Security and Rundll&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bonsaibill40  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Internal Security and Rundll&#39;s</h2>
                    I had a call from e-supportlive telling me that I had a virus on my computer. I understood that they were calling on behalf of MS. I foolishly let them have control of my computer after they gave me their phone number and website. They showed me a directory
 containing a number of Rundll's saying that these were viruses. I think that the company may be legit but selling unneeded services.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me if the company is legit?<br />
<br />
They showed that MS Internal Security was not activated and needed a key to activate. I use MSE now along with Avasti. Is Internal Security needed too? They were going to help me to activate it for $170/yr. I could get lifetime service for $270 plus get a tablet.<br />
<br />
Finally, they showed me a bunch of services that were stopped, telling me that more would be stopped and shut my computer down. I have automatic updates to Win 8.1 and keep antivirus program updated. Is there&nbsp; some program other than MSE and Avasti to ensure
 that my computer is clean?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any comments.<br />

<h2>            Random &#34;Restore Down&#34; Issue</h2>
                    So far I have not noticed any common thread as to how or why it happens, but when using any application on my Vista Home Premium, 32-bit, laptop the "Restore Down" option will randomly be triggered and I can not figure out why as of yet.&nbsp; I will update
 if I notice anything but if anyone has any shots in the dark let me know.<br />

<h2>            How to disable spell checking in onenote&#63;</h2>
                    OneNote is a great app for Windows 8 but I need to disable the automatic spell checking. Seems like it can't be done through the options menu but there must be a "pro" way to get rid of it.<br />
<br />
Anyone who can help? <br />

<h2>            School and Work account &#39;error&#39; notification - how to turn off&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi... I've recently been getting a notification keep coming up about School and Work account set up. Message goes something like this "There is a problem with the work/school account set up we need to fix... It then comes up with a sign in box for an account
 I no longer have. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The sign in box is indicating something about having to log in to use Office 365 etc. If I attempt to sign in with the email address which is there automatically I get a message along the lines of 'this does not work with xxxx (some program/programmes I
 know nothing about)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I *think* this *may* have something to do with a *Go Daddy* account I set up over a year ago and did not renew.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be able to stop this annoying notification from coming up. When I get the notification again I will try to update this thread with a screen print if possible.</p>

<p>I fully appreciate that you are unable to advise/assist without the *exact* details and/or a copy of the notification message 'and' error regarding the account email automatically generated in the log in box and error message when attempting password/log
 in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed the email account from the computer when I cancelled the Go Daddy web account months ago. The email address was *only* linked to the Go Daddy account... It was never used by me in any communication as I did not make use of the Go Daddy website.
 I do *not* use Outlook for my email account/s - the only time was via linking with the Go Daddy account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'notification' only started to come up about a week/10 days ago... Since contacting you here about it there has *so far* been no more notifications about it - even with closing down the computer and rebooting three times since contact. It *may* just
 have been some computer gremlin/glitch...</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Should* it re appear I will definitely add to this thread.</p>

<p>Since responding to Michelle Vil and giving a 'helpful' vote I seem unable to reply via the posts I received - - - so another post. As I was unable to respond via the first post made and unable to paste screen grabs (maybe later ???) I am repeating the 'text'
 that appears in the screen grabs I got 'earlier' and saved to a MS Word document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As error message I got/get when submitting via posting a new Q (through Firefox [?]) shows the following text:
</p>
<p>ErrorMessage:</p>
<p>IsError: &nbsp; &nbsp; false</p>
<p>V Result:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; message: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Message must be 6 to 60000 characters long. "</p>
<p>Success: &nbsp; false</p>
<p>CorrelationVector</p>
<p>
</p><p>My message text is (obviously) more than 6 characters long... So...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This last couple of days I have had the message/notification appear at the bottom left corner of the task bar - then accessed via the notification panel it brings up the *log in* box 'after' the *Settings*/shared experiences' page - email address automatically
 generated in the box under *Let's get you signed in* / *Work or school, or personal Microsoft account.*</p>
<p>Selecting Next the log in box changes to display (under the email address)&nbsp;shows in RED; "Are you sure that's the right email address? This organisation doesn't support joining Azure AD."&nbsp;Then below is "Which account should I use?" and then "Sign in with
 the username and password that you use with Office 365 or other business services from Microsoft".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I *will* update when able to next grab/paste screen shots *unless* someone from support give me an email address to then be able to send the MS Word document I have with the screen grabs I got *before* getting the error message posted above about *message
 length*</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Michelle... thank you for merging my posts :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again unable to use Firefox to respond - selecting the 'reply' button the reply area text box just 'fades' and I am unable to enter anything. If I try to use another 'reply' button on the post I am informed with a message that I already have a reply window
 open... ???&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As in other replies I was/am unable to verify the email account name because of the messages that appear when selectin 'next' for the password entry for the 'name' shown for the account. I do have screen grabs of these in a Word document as explained earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following your guide to access this in the "Settings" window I can view the 'account name' that has been being auto populated in to the log in box to sign in.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although using MS Edge browser to respond, I again seem unable to grab a screen shot to paste here... but I expect that you are aware of the layout and 'text' for this setting; 'Connect to...' etc. 'Get access to...' etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below that is a grey box with a + symbol then Connect - obviously to 'connect'/add another email account and then, below that, the MS four squares logo in a light grey box with an account email name, and 'manage your account' in orange text below it, and
 a darker grey box with 'disconnect' bottom right corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Selecting the +connect brings up a login box with "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" - so no auto email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Selecting "disconnect" brings up a text box with "are you sure you want to..." etc., etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to use the *disconnect* to then see if that will remove the account and STOP this message notification from continually coming up... hopefully it will. If not then I will be back to update this. So... selected the *disconnect* then read confirmation
 text for what this will do. Having then confirmed the *disconnect* account the email address that was showing has now disappeared - so *end of problem*? We will see... :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is annoying that I am now seemingly unable to paste 'any' screen grabs in Edge or make any reply with screen grabs via using Firefox as I was able to do so before... although able to paste the screen grabs in to a Word doc. ?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Minesweeper is not in Windows Store anymore&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I tried to look for Microsoft Minesweeper from the Windows Store in Windows 8 but it's not possible to download it.<br />
<br />
Its webpage is still there anyway:<br />
http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/it-it/app/microsoft-minesweeper/45ac18d7-e742-494f-a1b1-009aa412a179/m/ROW<br />
<br />
But when I click on it, I'm taken to the home page of the Store.<br />
I set it to show all languages content, anyway it is also in italian, so it should appear even if I let only Italian language apps to appear in the Store...<br />
It's not a language problem, I think.<br />

            Hi,
<div><br />
1. Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. Is the issue confined only when you print from Word, Corel, pdfs and paint?<br />
3. What happens when you try to print?<br />
4. Do you receive any error message?</div>

    <title>ntoskrnl.exe Blue Screen of Death - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevietnz88  say:</h3>
<h2>            ntoskrnl.exe Blue Screen of Death</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop came with Windows 8.1 installed, and naturally once Windows 10 was offered as an upgrade, I upgraded (vs. a clean install) to 10 Home 64-bit.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But ever since then my laptop would randomly power off, and a few seconds later power back on every few days. In Event Viewer, the only listed item around the time of turning off was the machine unexpectedly shut down (or words to that effect).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled the automatic restart, so now I get 'blue screens of death'. I found a helpful program called 'BlueScreenView' which kindly shows me that when I get these screens, the faulty driver is ntoskrnl.exe, with bug check code '0x00000050', and bug check
 string as 'PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can be done to fix this issue? I've seen some solutions that ask to repair boot.ini, but at a risk of deleting (some or all) HDD content (e.g.
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/bsod-help-support/23643-ntoskrnl-exe-bsod.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sevenforums.com/bsod-help-support/23643-ntoskrnl-exe-bsod.html</a> -- but that applies to Windows 7, not sure if applicable to Windows 10 also). If possible I would like to avoid that route.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you require more details, please do let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for any assistance,</p>
<p>Stevie</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Stevie,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>Apologize for the difficulties that you're experiencing in Windows 10.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Not to worry, we’re here to help you out.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>A blue screen error (also called a stop error) can occur if a problem causes your PC to shut down or restart unexpectedly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>The PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA bug check has a value of 0x00000050. This indicates that invalid system memory has been referenced.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let us try the following steps as a workaround and check if it makes any difference.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong><span>: Initially, I suggest you to start your computer in safe mode with Networking and check if the issue appears there as
 well. If it does not appear in safe mode with Networking place the computer in clean boot state to identify the culprit program running in the background creating this error.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Safe Mode
</span></strong><span>is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Start your PC in safe mode in Windows&nbsp;10</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong><span>:
</span>Let us follow the steps suggested in the following article and check if ti helps in resolving the issue.

            Also, can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?
<p>
</p><p>Here's a couple of links on using OneDrive (SkyDrive):</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time</p>

<p>
</p><p>I shall report back once I look at, and complete, what is stated in the 2nd link.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for that. I have updated my Broadcom wireless driver to version 7.35.308.0 dated 27 August 2015 (I note this is different to the version listed on the link, with the version being
<span>7.35.290.0 Rev.A but released 27 July 2015. Not sure why the version I have hasn't superseded the version on HP's site.).</span></p>

            <p>Hi again auggy</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I am still experiencing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I had to attend an appointment, so locked my computer around 9.30am. When I came home after midday there was a black screen which made me power off then on the laptop. This occurred around 12.20pm (as you will see the minidump file was created
 at that time, although the crash occurred around 10.40am).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last 10-15 mins, I experienced the same crash. This is twice in a day! The minidump files for both crashes -- ~10.40am and ~5.30pm -- are available here:
<a href="http://1drv.ms/1ITxJof" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://1drv.ms/1ITxJof</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unsure if I roll back the wireless driver it will go to version 6.30.223.245. Perhaps it may be available for download on the HP website; or would it be wise to contact their support to discuss why the driver is causing havoc? (Unless I uninstall the
 device in device manager, restart, and upon reboot re-install and the version will be 6.30.223.245)</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Aswin</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try installing the latest driver version, however the issue still persisted. Last night I asked for help on HP's forum --
<a href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/Broadcom-Adapter-Driver-Issue/m-p/5400532#M297028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            We couldn&#39;t install this update, but you can try again &#40;0x80244018&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I tried installing feature update to Windows 10, version 1903. It was downloaded to 100% but somehow failed to install it on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restated my device and it says "Feature update to Windows 10, version 1903 (a caution sign in yellow colour) We couldn't install this update, but you can try again (0x80244018). The next version of Windows is available with new features and security improvements.
 When you're ready for the update, select "Download and install now"."</p>
<p>
</p><p>And there is a Download and install button below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know why I need to download the whole update again which had already cost me about 3 GB of data on a metered connection. Where that update file has gone? Why is it asking to download it again?</p>

            Hi TanujKumar
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You should upgrade to 1903 through Media creation tool. Execute the below steps to go to 1903 
<br />
<br />1. Windows Key+X &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />Type following (or copy and paste following) one by one and Enter
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />net start cryptSvc
<br />net start bits
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />2. Type following in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) and hit Enter %systemroot%\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log to something else.
<br />If it doesn't allow you to rename - Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update, SFC etc)
<br />

<br />
<br />3. A. Optional but recommended step - Take a backup of your computer before you proceed.
<br />B. Disable any third party Antivirus (After update is successful, you can enable it again)
<br />C. You can go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />You can download the latest Windows 10 package from this link (media creation tool) and follow the instructions there to upgrade. Use the very simple instructions given under Using this tool to upgrade this PC to Windows 10
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Tanuj
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Also, this will mean the update just has to download once, so this method will not waste your data in the future . .. 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            Hi Tanuj
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.

<br />We are aware of reports from users experiencing problems installing the latest Feature Update, version 1903 which is in the process of rolling out.
<br />
<br />A couple issues we are aware of that might block the upgrade include the following:
<br />
<br />- You need to ensure you have 10 to 16 GBs of free space.
<br />- If there is a SD card installed, uninstall it or disable it.
<br />- Disconnect any usb drives.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
