            Nokia released a software update almost a month back.&nbsp; <strong>
1600.2487.8107.12070</strong>&nbsp;. I updated it and the problem is gone. The other fixes that have gone in are, better battery, better bass in audio and the back, start and search keys are lit according to brightness settings. Do connect your phone to your PC
 and get the update through zune.

<p>I suggest when we are getting a message unable to save work book you should provide a reason not simply to download a copy.
</p>
<p>The intention to have this file in the cloud is for our staff to share and update a specific file.
</p>
<p>after a while a new message Reconnecting to server came up and the connection was not possible , why not show this message right away?</p>

    <title>Foxit PDF Reader not working with IRM protected PDF files downloaded - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prabhatsingh22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Foxit PDF Reader not working with IRM protected PDF files downloaded from OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've configured IRM policy on my OneDrive on Office 365 tenant. It's working fine with Office files such as Word, Excel etc.</p>
<p>However, it's not working at all with PDF files. I found an article on Microsoft stating the supported PDF readers and I've tried both Foxit PDF reader and Azure information protection viewer. Issue that I'm facing is as follows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 10 PDF files in my OneDrive along with a few Office files. I've applied IRM policy to restrict editing and printing. I have Full Control permission on all my PDF files. Now, when I download any of the PDFs and try to open then using Foxit reader,
 it shows that I need permission to open this document and whether I want to request permission from &lt;URL of my OneDrive Documents library&gt;. What I don't understand is if I have Full Control permission then why would I need to request permission from my own
 OneDrive. Please note that I've added my OneDrive library as a location on Foxit reader using my Office 365 tenant credentials. Since the file is not even opening, there's no way to check permissions for PDF file either. Please suggest a way out because it's
 going to severely impact on what we're trying to achieve as far as IRM is concerned.

<p><span>Hi </span><span>Prabhat</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my test steps, please have a look:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Sign in my account and enable IRM in Admin center&gt;SharePoint Admin center.</span></li><li><span>Enable IRM in OneDrive setting.</span></li><li><span>Create Permission Policy and description as below:</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5925a264-2750-4fae-9be6-98da468acdf6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5925a264-2750-4fae-9be6-98da468acdf6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Download one pdf file from OneDrive and select Foxit Reader to open it.
</span></li><li><span>Follow the prompt info to install the Active Directory Rights Management Services client.</span></li><li><span>Type my account and password to open that file.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>According to the prompt info "</span><span> I need permission to open this document and whether I want to request permission from &lt;URL of my OneDrive Documents library&gt;</span><span>" that means your credentials
</span><span>is not recognized</span><span> by Office 365.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'd like to suggest you sign out your account from your browser then sign in your account and open your pdf again to see the outcome. For your reference:

<p>
</p><p>Besides, please also share with me more info as below to let me have a better understanding of your scenario:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Settings of your IRM Permission Policy.</span></li><li><span>Screenshots of the prompt info you encountered.</span></li><li><span>Have you installed Active Directory Rights Management Services client?</span></li><li><span>I noticed I can only add OneDrive personal in Foxit Add Place page, please share with me the steps about how do you add your OneDrive library
</span><span>as a location on Foxit reader</span><span>. </span></li></ol>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you have known, Office 2013 will have no more feature release updates. As the latest version for 2013 was released this February 2017.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you mean updating the version from 2013 to 2016, you need to uninstall the 2013 version on your computer and then install Office 2016. You can follow the article given on my previous
 post.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

<h2>            Outlook opening email, etc. only in full Screen - will not memorize &#34;Restore Down&#34; button</h2>
                    Running Outlook 2013, within Windows 8 Pro, simply opening an email, it displays full screen. &nbsp;I can hit the button in the upper right "restore down", but at the point, the next email I open, opens at full screen. &nbsp;It should remember my last window size.
 &nbsp;BTW, that goes for everything only in Outlook. &nbsp;Open a contact, full screen. &nbsp;In 2010, it would remember that the window size I opened last. &nbsp;Works fine within Windows 8 opening a file folder. &nbsp;Any fix out there?

<h2>            datediff&#58; interval&#58;&#61;Day vs. Day of year</h2>

http://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/18065/sql-server-datediff-hows-dayofyear-different-from-day/18068</a>, it makes no difference whether one specifies d (for Day) versus y (for Day of year) for the Interval argument of DateDiff.&nbsp; I'm wondering if something
 is missing from that answer.&nbsp; It doesn't make sense that two specifiers are defined for the same thing.

<h2>            No Windows 8.1 update for my UK EE-locked Nokia 1020 yet&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Nokia 1020. It is to be upgraded to Windows 8.1, possibly because it is an EE locked model and awaiting provider to approve update (available on friends' unlocked models). anyone else in similar position with EE locked Nokia? any idea when 8.1
 will be available for us? thanks

            There s no date yet published for when Windows Phone 8.1 will be on general release.&nbsp; As far as we know, it'll be around the 24th June (when official support starts).&nbsp; As before, you may not get the update on release date as the update is being phased
 according to carrier/region/handset.

    <title>Nokia C5 - Lock when tyring to call - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Nokia C5 - Lock when tyring to call</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My dad has bought a new phone a few days ago (Nokia C5-00). Everything is working</p>
<p>fine, but on some occasions he isn't able to receive text messages. It's also</p>
<p>impossible to receive phonecalls, sending messages and calling people is</p>
<p>impossible aswell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried to go to Contacts, then call our home number, but for some reason an</p>
<p>open lock appears next to the name of the person you want to call. When I turn</p>
<p>off the phone, everything works fine again for a few hours. The lock dissapears,</p>
<p>but when my dad comes home from work again, the problem starts again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's getting kinda frustrating, been searching for a solution for hours now. The</p>
<p>only thing I can come up with is a possible Simlock, since we bought the phone</p>
<p>from a different provider. Maybe my dad visits places where there's no signal during</p>
<p>work, and the phone starts acting weird because of that. Those are the only things</p>
<p>I can realy think of. He's not that handy with new technology, so maybe he pushed</p>
<p>a wrong button, but I can't find any feature on the phone that prevents you from calling/</p>
<p>texting (except for the offline mode maybe, but he just uses the standard profile).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you guys can help me with this, because I'm tired of searching hours for a</p>
<p>problem that hasn't got a solution so far. Ofcourse I'm the one to blame in this situation</p>
<p>aswell, so a solution would be welcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your time and effort.</p>
<p>P.</p>

            the keypad lock thing just indicates that your call connection is not secure. its nothing to worry about<br />
for your messages contact your current provider and ask them for the correct message center number.<br />
ask your provider to send you all the settings required for the network as the old ones are probably there this is whats causing some troubles<br />
the messages come via text when you get them save as default<br />
the restart your phone.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Sorry, something went wrong" page only happens when your PC does not meet the requirements for the Windows Insider Program. If your current build is still the 1607 (Anniversary Update), we recommend updating it first to build 1703 (Creators Update)
 before signing up for the preview build. To update, check this page: <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10 Creators Update now available</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you have other questions in mind. </p>

            <p>Hi SimonRobichaud,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Support.&nbsp; I understand your HTC HD7 no longer outputs any sound.&nbsp; Seeing as you've already tried a factory reset with no changes to the device, it's going to be a hardware issue that needs to be addressed.&nbsp; Your best bet
 would be to try reaching out to either HTC for additional troubleshooting, or reaching out to the retailer you purchased the phone from for a replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Chanh S.</p>

<p>I am not sure if I explained wrong or not, but I did have the 11.19.856 version of Skype, (which I did not like as defaulted to recent activity when opened, not contacts)..&nbsp; I then downloaded the link given above
<a href="http://www.skype.com/go/getskype-full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.skype.com/go/getskype-full</a>. before completing download I was asked if I wished to download the latest version or the current one on the screen...&nbsp;&nbsp;as I could see the one on the screen was what I
 called the old version.(the one I liked) I clicked no to the new version..... I now am running 7.4 version.......

<p>Hi Arne Est</p>
<p><span>I had no problem accessing my email accounts on other devices, only on my Lumia 535 immediately after the update. As explained above
</span>I did a reset and restore from a pre update backup. No change at that point. I gave up on Outlook and downloaded MetroMail app which worked straight out of the box.
</p>
<p>The next morning I found Outlook was somehow back to normal without any more intervention on my part.
</p>
<p>I am keeping MetroMail, as I don't trust Microsoft not to mess up Outlook again next update.</p>

<h2>            Format Painter do not work on date.</h2>
                    After changing the system format in Region and Language from one to another, the dates of the existing data and some new data randomly show dd/mm/yyyy or yyyy/mm/dd.&nbsp; I try to use the Format Painter to get those in yyyy/mm/dd converted to dd/mm/yyyy to
 be consistent with the old data but it doesn't work at all.

            Since I changed the system format, the date format dd/mm/yyyy is no longer available for selection. However I can enter the date in the format dd/mm/yyyy manually.<br />

So does it mean the Format Painter won't work on dates?<br />

<br />
If you look at the cell format (right-click, click on Format Cells, Number), I suspect you will see the format that you expect.<br />
<br />
The problem might be that some of the "dates" are actually text.&nbsp; (We can enter text into cells that have numeric formats.)<br />
<br />
If the current short-date form in the Regional and Languages is now dd/mm/yyyy, any pre-existing date that Excel recognized as a date is unaffected.&nbsp; However, its appearance will be determined by the pre-existing format, not necessary the short-date form.<br />
<br />
Note that Excel stores recognized dates as an integer.&nbsp; The format merely affects the appearance of the date, not the value of the date itself.<br />
<br />
However, if you now enter or import text of the form yyyy/dd/mm, that will be treated as text, not a date, because yyyy is presumably larger than 28 to 31, and/or dd might be larger than 12.<br />
<br />
If you have a column of "dates", some of which are text of the form yyyy/dd/mm, try using the Text To Column feature to convert the text to bona fide dates.<br />
<br />
When you get to the last TtoC menu, select Date and YDM for the column format.&nbsp; TtoC should then convert the text of the form yyyy/dd/mm to a bona fide Excel date, formatted as Date, IIRC.<br />
<br />
After exiting TtoC, you might also need to assert the desired date format (dd/mm/yyyy) on the entire column or selected range.<br />

            Where an Excel document has dates of both formats which is the issue I am tackling, I select them and I pick Format Cells.. from the popped up context menu, both show they are definitely in date formats.&nbsp; They are neither Number nor Text.<br />
<br />
I don't quite follow your statement of "<i>If the current short-date form in the Regional and Languages is now dd/mm/yyyy, any pre-existing date that Excel recognized as a date is unaffected.</i>"<br />
<br />
I try the Text to Columns conversion on one cell but it doesn't work.&nbsp; I have 2012/12/3.&nbsp; I select {none} for Text qualifier.&nbsp; When the conversion is finished, I somehow get 2012/12/20.<br />
<br />
I am not too sure what you mean by "assert the desired date format".&nbsp; I suppose you mean the select the whole column and select the appropriate date format from Format Cells.&nbsp; If that is what you mean, it works.&nbsp; I was wrong when I say "the date format dd/mm/yyyy
 is no longer available for selection" because I've just noticed that I can change the Locale (location) in Format Cells.<br />
<br />
However having changed those with format yyyy/mm/dd to dd/mm/yyyy, I've found those changed from yyyy/mm/dd do not line up with those come with dd/mm/yyyy at the outset.&nbsp; I select the cells that have just changed, I found they still show yyyy/mm/dd on the top
 next to <i>fx </i>though they show dd/mm/yyyy in the actual cells.&nbsp; Whereas those not changed show dd/mm/yyyyy both in the cells and on the top next to
<i>fx</i>.&nbsp; How could I have both the same, i.e. dd/mm/yyyy, throughout so that they look consistent in the cells?<br />

<p><br />
Cells contain only numeric values or text values, or they are empty.<br />
<br />
You can confirm this by using formulas of the form =ISNUMBER(A1) or =ISTEXT(A1).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>[EDIT] </strong>Cells can also&nbsp;contain Excel errors like #VALUE, which you can confirm with a formula of the form =ISERROR(A1).&nbsp; But that is not germane to the situation.<br />

<br />
One possible explanation is that one form is text and the other form is numeric.<br />
<br />
It is difficult for me to help you further since you seem to have difficulty understanding instructions.<br />
<br />
The best way to get help is&nbsp;for you to upload an example Excel file (devoid of any private data) that demonstrates the problem to a file-sharing website.<br />
<br />
Then post the "shared", "public" or "view-only" link (aka URL; http://...) in a response here.<br />
<br />
The following is a list of some free file-sharing websites; or use your own.<br />
<br />
Box.Net: http://www.box.net/files<br />
Windows Live Skydrive: http://skydrive.live.com<br />
MediaFire: http://www.mediafire.com<br />
FileFactory: http://www.filefactory.com<br />
FileSavr: http://www.filesavr.com<br />
RapidShare: http://www.rapidshare.com<br />
<br />
In addition, it would be helpful if you tell us what the short-date form is on your computer according to the Regional and Language Options control panel.<br />

            Thanks!&nbsp; I have learnt something.&nbsp; I have checked one example of each scenario with =ISNUMBER(A1) and =ISTEXT(A1) and =ISERROR(A1).&nbsp; There is no error.&nbsp; Having all in the form of dd/mm/yyyy with conversion on some and where they don't line up, with your
 suggested formulas I found the one in yyyy/mm/dd is number, and the one in dd/mm/yyyy is text.<br />
<br />
The short date format of the system is yyyy/M/d.&nbsp; I didn't change it.&nbsp; It is the default of the system format.<br />
<br />
What I didn't understand from your statement of "<i>If the current short-date form in the Regional and Languages is now dd/mm/yyyy, any pre-existing date that Excel recognized as a date is unaffected.</i>" is "<i>any pre-existing date that Excel recognized
 as a date is unaffected</i>".&nbsp; What is not affected? It is not clear to me.<br />
<br />
As what I can see with my Excel documents, some of them has all the dates automatically changed to yyyy/mm/dd and some don't after the system format change.&nbsp; Those rows of data exported after the system format change are in dd/mm/yyyy in some cases whereas
 yyyy/mm/dd in others.&nbsp; Seeing the random format I am still trying to figure out when and how they are supposed to be affected.&nbsp; I am looking for some consistency.<br />
<br />
By the way, the files are saved in XLSB.<br />
<br />
I am trying to avoid sharing the file, only if I have to.&nbsp; For I want to understand and fix the problem so that I can address the similar issues in the future.&nbsp; I do not want the problem fixed without understanding.&nbsp; Then I would not be able to fix similar
 problem by myself in the future.&nbsp; Moreover I have many more files that exhibit the same phenomenon and your system environment and mine are in no way likely identical, so we could need more information anyway.&nbsp; Anyhow I thank you for your patience and tolerance
 as well as magnanimity.&nbsp; Nevertheless, if the problem is still unfixed after your response to this post I will share an example file.<br />

<br />
If that were your only reason for not sharing, your concern is unwarranted.&nbsp; The purpose of providing the file is so that we can cut through the inescapable ambiguity of English descriptions; that is, so that we can see the data for ourselves.&nbsp; No reputable
 responder is going to correct the problem without explanation.<br />
<br />
However, now that you have discovered the mix of numeric dates and text that look like dates, I think we are now on the same page.&nbsp; It still might be prudent for you to upload an example Excel file, just in case some ambiguity or misunderstanding still remains.&nbsp;
 It might save time by avoiding unnecessary back-and-forth chit-chat.<br />

<br />
Of the short-date form, you say now, "I didn't change it".&nbsp; That contradicts your original posting in which you said, "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">After changing</span> the system format in Region and Language from one to another".<br />
<br />
My previous comment that you do not understand is moot if you did not change the system short-date form.&nbsp; Ignore the following if that is true after all.&nbsp; Skip to the "in any case" below.<br />
<br />
Assuming that you did change the short-date form as you stated originally, I was trying to explain why you see "the dates of the existing data and some new data randomly show dd/mm/yyyy or yyyy/mm/dd".<br />
<br />
If the original short-date form were d/M/yyyy or the equivalent, then you changed it to yyyy/M/d, the pre-existing dates would still be valid numeric dates because Excel had already created them as such.&nbsp; Their appearance would depend on the numeric format,
 be it Date or Custom d/m/yyyy or yyyy/m/d.<br />
<br />
However, "dates" subsequently entered in the form d/m/yyyy would be treated as text because yyyy is presumaby larger than 28 to 31, depending on m.<br />
<br />

<br />
In any case....<br />
<br />
How we got to this point is unimportant.&nbsp; (Only you can know how that happened.)<br />
<br />
The important is:&nbsp; dates entered in the form yyyy/m/d will be recognized as real (numeric) dates; but "dates" entered in the form d/m/yyyy will be treated as because yyyy is presumably larger than 28 to 31, depending on m.<br />
<br />
It is not "random" behavior.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
The other important point is:&nbsp; for the cells that contain <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
text</span> in the form d/m/yyyy, simply changing the format to yyyy/m/d will not correct the
<br />
This is not a limitation of Format Painter, as you subject line asserts.<br />
<br />
Instead, it is simply due to the fact that numeric formats (which Date and Custom yyyy/m/d are) affect only numeric values, not text.<br />
<br />
As I suggested previously, you might be able to use Text To Column to change text "dates" of the form d/m/yyyy to true numeric dates whose appearance is affected by the numeric format of the cell.<br />
<br />
It is unclear whether you understood my previous instructions for how to do that.&nbsp; So let me demonstrate.<br />
<br />
Suppose you have the following in A1:A3:<br />
<br />
A1:&nbsp; 2012/12/24<br />
A2:&nbsp; 12/24/2012<br />
A3:&nbsp; 1/1/2013<br />
<br />
Note that A2 and A3 are text, whereas A1 is numeric.&nbsp; Then the steps are (see the graphic image below):<br />
<br />
1. Select A1:A3.<br />
2. Click on Data, then Text To Columns.<br />
3. In the TtoC wizard, be sure Delimited is set, then click on Next.<br />
4. Be sure Tab (e.g.) is set, then click on Next.<br />
5. Select Date and MDY from the drop-down list, then click on Finish.<br />

            As suggested I have uploaded a condensed example file to Public - SkyDrive.&nbsp; Here is the link: https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=1183D8DE80B543F5!234&amp;authkey=!AEDLo_mm98VU8sI.&nbsp; I have condensed and remove unnecessary superfluous data.<br />
<br />
The original system format is English (Australia) where the short date format is d/MM/yyyy.&nbsp; For the purpose of some research outside of Excel files I have very recently changed the system format to Chinese (Simplified, PRC) where the short date format is yyyy/M/d.&nbsp;
 All the time I never changed the short date format.&nbsp; I never changed in both cases in that I simply take the default short date format that comes with the system format.&nbsp; That was what I meant when I said that I didn't change it".<br />
<br />
Anyway, I have stumbled on a local setting with the Excel file, at Format Cells - &gt; Locale (location).&nbsp; I have then since changed the those dates in the format of yyyy/M/d to d/MM/yyyy by changing the locale to English (Australia) at the EXcel file.&nbsp; I presume
 this local setting should take precedence over the global settings as how most software applications work.<br />
<br />
Now I have managed to change them all to d/MM/yyyy.&nbsp; Only visual difference is they don't line up as reported before.&nbsp; I theorize that those dates downloaded or exported from the Internet and then copied and pasted are text.&nbsp; As soon as they are re-processed
 with formulae or functions they become numbers. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
So when they are numbers they are right-justified, otherwise left justified.&nbsp; I CAN'T find any function or formula to change the date from one to another, number to text or vice versa.&nbsp; However I can simply change the alignment of the contents of the cells
 to make them look the same though I would love to make them identical in the backgrounds as well if possible and worth the hassle.<br />
<br />
Dates entered manually are numbers?&nbsp; That's what I presumed when I saw the pattern.&nbsp; However, having entered the three dates you suggested, they are not all numbers as tested with given formulae.&nbsp; So they defeated my theory.&nbsp; Anyway by default I always seem
 to get the local format that dictates.&nbsp; It doesn't matter which way I enter the dates they can be numbers or text unlike what you suggest unless I prefix the date with an apostrophe.<br />
<br />
Out of the three dates the last one 1/1/2012 is already assessed as a number though you say it is text.&nbsp; I can't reconcile this with your explanation.<br />
<br />
I entered the three dates plus one with an apostrophe prefix to ensure it is text, '2012/12/24.<br />
<br />
I followed your illustrated instructions and process them with Text to Columns.&nbsp; The results are on the uploaded worksheet.&nbsp; One of them is still not a number.<br />

<br />
It was an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">hypothesis</span> to try to explain why some of the "dates" are treated as text -- and might have over-simplified it.<br />
<br />
In my (US) version of Excel, Excel is tolerant of dates entered in the form yyyy/m/d even though my short-date form is m/d/yyyy.&nbsp; That might be why 1/1/2012 is interpreted correctly on your computer even though the short-date form is yyyy/m/d.<br />
<br />
My point was:&nbsp; some of your "dates" are text.&nbsp; You seem to have confirmed that.<br />
<br />
How they got that way might still be a puzzle.&nbsp; One thing to check:&nbsp; be sure the cells are not formatted as Text before you paste into them.<br />
<br />

<br />
I cannot explain that.&nbsp; I can only imagine that you made a mistake.&nbsp; Obviously TtoC treats all cells with '2012/12/24 the same way.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this is as far as I can go with this.<br />
<br />
Because of the dependency on the short-date form and perhaps the language option and/or locale format option, I cannot duplicate your situation.&nbsp; When I downloaded your Skydrive file, the cells were formatted with Armenian(!) locale on my computer, which is
 different from the locale you mentioned.<br />
<br />
Hopefully someone else will be able to help you.<br />

            Thanks for your patience and tolerance as well as perseverance anyway.<br />
<br />
All in all to my experience, to have at least the same formats I have for testing if you like you can simply change the system format and Excel local format on the fly to match mine, that is without restarting the computer or the program.&nbsp; I have found they
 take effect straight away.&nbsp; I do not know if the office software distributed in United States is any different from those in Australia where I reside.&nbsp; I incline to think not, for the language is the same though some spellings and some idioms could be different
 but they should not have any bearing on how the software should operate.<br />
<br />
What I would like to know now is how to convert the date from text to number.&nbsp; I have expected the format painter would do the job at one swoop.<br />
<br />
As to the Text to Columns process I have followed your instructions to the letter.&nbsp; Have you tried them again on my worksheet?&nbsp; I had supposed the delimiters should be '/' instead of Tab as you advised.&nbsp; Anyhow I followed your steps regardless.<br />
<br />
By the way, I have looked up the help.&nbsp; I don't seem to be able to see that the Text to Columns process is for converting text to number.&nbsp; I wonder...<br />

    <title>Adding contacts in Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> evastreeter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding contacts in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>This is a new Skype account on a new Win 10 machine. I have used Skype on Vista machine for years, no problems.</p>
<p>I need to make calls to landlines of people who do not have Skype. I dial the persons number on the dial pad and it is added to the "recents" panel. Now, how do I attach a name to that number so that when I want to call the same person in future I have the
 name shown on a list of contacts, which is how it used to work on the Vista machine?</p>
<p>If the "recents" panel only shows numbers I have to memorize the number associated with the name of the person I want to call and that is not practical if I have many people&nbsp; that&nbsp; I call but are only shown by number.</p>
<p>If I cannot attach a name to each number I will need to go to another provider than Skype.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading,&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Slow Startup With Build 10565 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gerardkeeley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow Startup With Build 10565</h2>
                    <p>My PC normally starts up fast but has been very slow at starting up with the last couple of builds. I haven't mentioned it hoping the problems would pass but the problem hasn't gotten any better. And even though it takes a minute or so to load up task manager
 bios time is 12.9 seconds. So it seems it's booting fast but taking for ever for the screen to populate.&nbsp; In other words the little swirly circle spins for over a minute for the lock screen to appear when it normally takes&nbsp;under 13&nbsp;seconds or so. I have a
 4770 cpu with 16 gb of memory, solid state hd plus 2tb so I doubt it's my PC. Anyone else experiencing this or has seen it that can help please?</p>

<h3> robfm  say:</h3>
<h2>            My &#34;&#43;&#34; for a subdatasheet disappeared when I split my Access 2003 database into a front and back end</h2>
                    I have created an Access database for managing my department's purchase requisitions.&nbsp; The database has a table called RequisitionsTbl that contains a record for each requisition.&nbsp; There is a second table "LineItemsTbl" that has all the individual items
 being purchased (each item is a record).&nbsp; They are linked through a field called ReqID such that each ReqID can occur only once in the RequisitionsTble, but can occur in many records of the LineItemsTbl.&nbsp; I basically copied the design from some the examples
 available in Microsoft's website.<br />
<br />
When I open the RequisitionsTbl, there is a small "+" in the far left column that opens up a subdatasheet and displays the individual line items associated with that specific record.<br />
<br />
This was working fine up to the point where I decided to split the database into front and back ends.&nbsp; I used the wizard to make the split and it seemed to go OK.&nbsp; I used it for a few days and everything works, but then I noticed that the subdatasheet is no
 longer available in the RequisitionsTbl.&nbsp; I went to design mode and opened the properties sheet to look for an explanation.&nbsp; The subdatasheet property is set to [auto] and it will not allow me to save any different setting.&nbsp; I also opened the back-end file
 and the property is also set to [auto] in that file.&nbsp; I tried changing that to specify the LineItemsTbl, but it switches back to [auto] when I close and re-open.<br />
<br />
So, my question:&nbsp; Is it possible to use a subdatasheet in a database where the front and back ends are split, and if so how do I implement?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

            I rarely use the subdatasheet feature because I almost always use a subform and LinkMaster/Child properties.&nbsp;But, form my little experience, I think you can only set the subdatasheet properties in the table's design in the BE database.&nbsp; The FE database
 only contains a&nbsp;link (Connect property)&nbsp;to the real table in the BE so, AFAIK,&nbsp;you can't do anything with the table's other properties such as Relationships, Indexes, etc.

<h2>            Outlook 2016 unable to create events on shared calendars but OWA is fine</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have subscribed to several shared calendars in my outlook.com account and have full access to them.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I use outlook.com, I am able to add/modify/delete entries without issue.&nbsp; If I use the
 built-in Calendar app on Windows 10, I am also able to add/modify delete entries without issue.&nbsp; This proves that my account does indeed&nbsp;have&nbsp;full access to the shared calendars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if I use outlook 2016 it doesn't work.&nbsp; When I&nbsp;try&nbsp;to add/modify/delete an entry,&nbsp;I just get the message:</p>
<p>"You don't have permission to create an entry in this folder. Right-click the folder, and then click Properties to check your permissions for the folder. See the folder owner or your administrator
 to change your permissions."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This seems to prove that the problem is within outlook 2016 itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot locate any settings within outlook 2016 that control this.&nbsp; Making changes within the Properties dialog to enact any sort of full access seems to have no effect on the problem no matter
 what I try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My outlook.com has been upgraded to the new experience and I have received the email instructing me to re-create my outlook 2016 profile, and I have done so several times now.&nbsp; I have also re-subscribed
 to the calendars several times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can somebody please assist me?&nbsp; This used to work great before the upgrade to new experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Michael, thank you for responding to my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read the web link, that is interesting and I was unaware of those issues and I took the steps recommended in the article.&nbsp; Unfortunately the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The article says that slower machines, slow connection, or too many shared items.&nbsp; I have a haswell-based Intel NUC and a fiber-to-the-home connection, so I doubt my machine nor connection is the issue.&nbsp; Regardless, I have left Outlook 2016 open overnight
 to make sure it had plenty of time to sync if that was the problem.&nbsp; In the morning, the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However,&nbsp;my outlook 2016 is configured to access 2 outlook.com mailboxes and 12 shared calendars.&nbsp; Is that too many?&nbsp; Note in&nbsp;my test results that the Win10 built-in Calendar app works successfully and has no problem with 12 shared calendar\s.&nbsp;&nbsp;So because
 of this&nbsp;I think it's unlikely that desktop Outlook 2016 Professional Plus would have trouble with 12.&nbsp; Does this deduction&nbsp;make sense to you too?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nonetheless, I followed the article instructions and didn't find any excess accounts or &lt;AlternativeMailbox&gt; section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I misunderstood something, I'm happy to be corrected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, what other suggestions can you offer me to help get this fixed?&nbsp; To recap, Outlook 2016 is unable to modify/add events to shared calendars from the Internet.&nbsp; But outlook.com and the Win10 Calendar app have absolutely no trouble doing so on the
 same machine with the exact same calendars.&nbsp; I conclude that something is wrong with the Outlook 2016 configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Jayvee,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s not feasible to globally (within the domain) changing the default reply button to
<em>"reply</em>" only instead of "<em>reply all</em>".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you think this feature is important and want Microsoft to include it, please provide your suggestions or feedback via the link:

    <title>How can I stop Multi-Level List Styles with Hanging indents of 0.5cm - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> esjaysj  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I stop Multi-Level List Styles with Hanging indents of 0.5cm from reverting to 0.63cm in MS Word 2007&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My query incorporates, styles, templates&nbsp;and multi-level lists. I have created a template and have numerous styles for different lists eg List Bullet for levels 1 to 8, List Dash for levels 1 to 8 etc. Here's an example of the List Bullet styles settings:&nbsp;List
 Bullet 1, has an outline level of 1, an indent of 0, hanging indent of 0.5cm &amp; tab of 0.5cm; List Bullet 2, has an outline level of 2, an indent of 0.5, hanging indent of 0.5 &amp; tab of 1cm etc. So I'm working with 0.5cm increments. List Dash or List Number&nbsp;styles
 are the same except I use a dash or number instead of a bullet. Randomly,&nbsp;each style converts back to a default of 0.63cm hanging indent, which in turn effects the normal indent size and the tab size.&nbsp;Here's what I've tried to no avail: I've used various combinations
 of the same style, normal, or none for each of the settings for&nbsp;"style based on" and "style for following paragraph". I've selected/deselected:&nbsp;&nbsp;"new documents based on this template" &amp; "automatically update". I have assigned outline levels, I've taken them
 off again. No point in updating default para to hanging indent of 0.5cm in my normal template - cos I don't want all my paragraphs to have a hanging indent - just those for lists. I'm having to update about 30 different styles each time it goes awry. Argh!
 If I can't fix it, then is it better to base for instance List Bullet 2 on the style of List Bullet 1 (base one level on previous level, same bullet type); or List&nbsp;Dash 1 on List Bullet 1 (base level on equivalent level with a different bullet type)? I have
 scoured similar forums to no avail. I hope someone much smarter than I can help. Thankyou in advance. SJ. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Indents in numbered and bulleted styles must be set in the numbering dialogs, not in the Paragraph dialog. Assuming that this is outline numbering (or outline bullets), you must set up the Multilevel List as explained in
