    <title>New Windows 10 Update made my new microphone not work anymore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matasmazeika  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Windows 10 Update made my new microphone not work anymore</h2>
                    <p>There was a new Windows 10 update that was issues a few days ago which basically made my new gaming headset's microphone not work anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried every means of trying to fix it as I've looked across the internet to see if I&nbsp; can do something but nothing seems to fix it. It hasn't even been a month since I got my Logitech G430 and it was working fine a few days ago before the update. I
 was even able to communicate with some of my friends who I played games online with. I think that this problem has got something to do with the new voice recognition that Microsoft introduced in the new update because when the updates finished it asked me
 to answer a few Yes/No questions regarding my location and such. I answered them how I wanted to and then there was a "Do you want Voice Recognition enabled" to which I answered No. Now, when I logged onto my PC everything seemed fine however when I went to
 play with my friends on League of Legends, I noticed that I couldn't hear them and they couldn't hear me (I could see my friend was talking because I saw the green colour indicating that he is talking around his icon, but I did not have one of these even when
 I tried to talk). My headset itself works fine as I can hear everything from YouTube videos, to Windows Notification to Game Sounds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go and try to work with the Speech Recognition on Windows I'm met with a "The Wizard could not start" "Make sure your audio hardware is working properly and check your audio configuration in the Audio Devices and Sound Themes control panel." Now when
 I do find the Audio Devices application, it allows me to click it however nothing opens up for some reason. I've tried running the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter and restarted my computer however nothing helped. I also tried uninstalling the one of the
 two sound options in "Sound, video and game controllers".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for more information regarding my problem is that the two options are named:</p>
<p>Intel(R) Display Audio&nbsp;</p>
<p>Realtek High Definition Audio</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the Intel one because the Realtek High Definition Audio is just regarding sound and other options.</p>

            Just noticed this Problem.. I was charged on July 11th but it says I don't have a membership on my xbox and charge said pending under orders and its been over a week. I was able to download a game on the 12th so I am not sure what the issue is. Also may
 have messed up the billing thing by canceling and turning on recurring billing. Course it now says I will be billed on July 12 which was 6 days ago.....

    <title>Turtle Beach XO Seven Making Controller Freeze - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cmuchippewa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turtle Beach XO Seven Making Controller Freeze</h2>
                    
<p>Every once in a while the controller will stop working with the console (usually right in the middle of a game). &nbsp;The Xbox light is still lit on the controller, but it won't respond when I press buttons. &nbsp;I have to take the battery pack out and put it back
 in so I can restart the controller. &nbsp;Is this an issue with the headset, or is this a possible bug with the new controller update? &nbsp;Has anyone else experienced this?</p>

<p>I've got the same problem and so do many others it's not just XO7's people with polk 4 shot and A40's are posting the same problem.I Think it's something to do with the chat adapter update.I updated my day one controller via the system settings menu but
 when i put the new chat adapter that came with XO7 headset in it forced another update.Now when using the headset with the controller I get frequent disconnects,the controller light is still on but the only way to make it go again is to pull out the batteries
 and put them back in again.I tested my other controller with XO7 headset last night and no problems at all I only updated that controller in the system settings it didn't get forced to update with the chat adapter.Also my day one controller seems to work fine
 without the headset or headset adapter plugged in,I used the same official MS plug and charge kit batteries in both controllers.I contacted Turtle Beach and they said to contact MS because it's most likely a controller issue.I've posted in several support
 forums around here no official response yet. </p>

    <title>Lexmark printer 1400 and update to win 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisbakarr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lexmark printer 1400 and update to win 8.1</h2>
                    My computer no longer allows me to print to my printer (Lexmark 1400 series). It shows in the devices but says does not have a driver.&nbsp; I needed a hard copy and was not able&nbsp; to get my work done today,&nbsp; This was working with no problem prior to upgrading
 from WIN 8 to WIN 8.1. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;The Lexmark site just shuttled me off to something called driver tuner that wanted 29.99 to update what looked like all my drivers???????&nbsp; Despite the computer being almost new this site claimed that there were 4 errors they needed to fix.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;This sounds more like a scam than something a legitimate Co, would participate in.&nbsp; The site claimed to have the driver I needed although I was not able to locate it directly from the Lexmark system.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;The driver appears to have been wiped from my computer in the upgrade as I have not been able to find it pushed aside to another place on my system.&nbsp; I think I can find the license key in the log notes when the original driver was installed,<br />
<br />
&nbsp; The computer now wants to download everything to One note which is no help to me if I can't print anything.&nbsp; Actually the file was supposed to be stored in Excel after printing which was easy prior to this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have never used onenote and it will take a
 bunch of new learning about onenote to know how to use it which I don't have the time for.&nbsp;&nbsp; Extremely frustrated after several hours trying to find and restore the driver.<br />
<br />
XXXXX Finally got a driver to load after visit to Lexmark site and general driver download for my series .&nbsp; Unplugged and replugged several times and did not work finally on a reboot the whole thing appears to be working .&nbsp; Don't know what step worked but printer
 is now appearing on computer just fine and am able to give printer usual directions<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I had a similar problem with my Lexmark... After uninstalling the software\drivers, rebooting, and then attempting to reinstall, I received the message that the drivers were already installed.</p>
<p>My only options were to install another copy, or update the existing ones... Neither worked.</p>
<p>After 2 days of trial and error this is what got them to install....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It has to do with the Print Spooler interfering with the uninstall\reinstall process. I had read about a recommendation to turn off the Print Spooler before uninstalling the software quite some time ago, and I had tried that, but it didn't work. Here are
 the tricks to get it to work if it isn't too late for you.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Note: Bidirectional Support is needed, and for some reason the upgrade process turns it off. This may also be related to the Print Spooler....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1) Turn on and hook up your printer... This needs to be done just this one time to get it to show up
</p>
<p>in Devices and Printers.... Otherwise, all I get with my machine is the Lexmark Fax, and as a result, you can't "Remove" the printer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2) Once the printer is visible in Devices and Printers, physically unhook it..</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3) "REMOVE" the Lexmark Printer and Lexmark Fax (if you have one) in Devices and Printers.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4) Stop the Print Spooler in "Services"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>5) Uninstall the software\drivers... In the process of doing this, I got two popup Security messages from Windows Firewall concerning "Allowing" Printer Communication... I selected "Allow".
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I then ended up with two printers in Printer Preferences...</p>
<p>I started over, and unchecked the "Shared" box on the first message... Only one printer this time...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>6) At the prompt from the Lexmark uninstaller, Reboot.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>7) After rebooting, STOP the Print Spooler again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>8) Reinstall software\drivers... I used both XP SP3 and Vista Compatibility Mode on different attempts, and both worked... Hook the printer back up when prompted by the installer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>9) Unhook the printer again and reboot. Bidirectional Support must be Enabled, and the setting won't stick if the printer is hooked up.. You need to reboot to clear things up before the next step.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>10) Enable Bidirectional Support and Reboot. To do this, go to Devices and Printers and select "Printer Properties" and then the "PORTS" tab... The check box is near the bottom.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>11) Set any Printer Preferences you use, if any, and it's ready to go.</p>

<p>For incoming server address:&nbsp;<strong>imap-mail.outlook.com&nbsp;</strong>and check the SSL box. For outgoing server address:
<strong>imap-mail.outlook.com</strong> and check the SSL box.</p>

<p>Were you also seeing error 0x800488A6? And had your account been upgraded to Outlook Mail (Preview)? I'm keen to establish if that is what the error code means.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>For outgoing server address: <strong>imap-mail.outlook.com</strong> and check the SSL box.</p>

<p>I don't think that will work. The corresponding SMTP server is <strong>smtp-mail.outlook.com</strong> - or just
<strong>smtp.live.com</strong> as it always has been.</p>

    <title>missing system info at startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ranger_535  say:</h3>
<h2>            missing system info at startup</h2>
                    <p>Greetings. I&nbsp;seem to have lost the file that shows system information. That shows up at every boot. 'System info missing or corrupt.'</p>
<p>So I have no apparently pertinent info(product key)&nbsp;to activate windows. I have win 7 with sp1. I have a dv6 hp notebook about 6 or</p>
<p>7 yrs&nbsp;old. Never had this problem b-4. May be&nbsp;because I never had to do a re install. So no warranty. No readable product key on old</p>
<p>faded label. I was wondering, since recovery is on **** D, is it possible to somehow copy pertinent&nbsp;missing files from&nbsp;disk D to disk C?</p>
<p>Sure I have recovery disks available but my disk drive busted and came out a few years back. Perhaps an external dvd drive might help? Anyway, this blasted product key business&nbsp;has me at a stand still. No key, no activation. And so, can I copy missing system
 info from D to C, since they're both on same hard drive? I may be showing my lack of computer knowledge here but that's why I'm here.</p>
<p>Laptop's running fine btw, but the countdown to activate or bust continues. Yikes. Thanx.</p>

            <p>I should mention, and not sure if this even applies, but I found the system info folder msinfo32, created in 2010.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;the properties box I clicked on previous version and it came up with an msinfo32 from 2009.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;wondering if</p>
<p>that can be reused? In other words can I roll back to the 2009&nbsp;(original) version and perhaps have all necessary</p>
<p>system info that is now missing, as stated in my previous post.&nbsp; I'm no techy but is that workable or laughable, haha.</p>
<p>Just wondering.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To activate Windows 7, product key is always necessary. We suggest that you contact your laptop manufacturer and check if they can still provide you the product key of your laptop. You can also use an external USB DVD Drive to run the recovery disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you have other queries or concerns.</p>

<h2>            Laptop battery &#34;Plugged in but not charging&#34;</h2>
                    Hi, I have a Lenovo Yoga 500 and I started having problems with my charger not charging my laptop. I replaced the charger but the problem persisted. Now my laptop only runs when plugged in and the battery icon always displays "Plugged in not charging".
 When I click to expand the battery info, it says that the battery is 100% charged. However, as soon as I unplug the charger, the laptop shuts down.&nbsp;

            Hi KarinaNPF. it is more likely your battery has failed, rather than the charger . . .
<br />
<br />However it is also just as likely this is a Windows 10 issue . . .
<br />
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />
<br />Expand the Batteries section
<br />
<br />For each device in that section:
<br />
<br />Right click and choose Disable
<br />
<br />Then right click and choose Enable
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager
<br />
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Run these troubleshooters
<br />
<br />Hardware and devices
<br />
<br />Power

            Hi Karina.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Check the manufacturer's Support web page for your full model number to  see if there is a battery issue or recall for it.   
<br />
<br />Run the battery recalibration here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/172271/how-to-calibrate-your-laptops-battery-for-accurate-battery-life-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/172271/how-to-calibra...</a>
<br />
<br />Then generate a battery report and post it back here:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/generate-battery-report-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/generate-batte...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click Start to open Device Manager, under Battery choose the battery device, then Driver tab, then if available Roll Back the driver.  If not available, choose Uninstall Driver, restart PC to reinstall. 
<br />
<br />If this was caused by April Version 1803 update can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then you might need to replace the battery. However I will tell you that most OEM after-market batteries and chargers have problems so I would only buy the official manufacturer's battery from the PC maker to be sure.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            This most probably is due to a faulty charger or a battery.

From ASUS site (Laptop FAQ Battery)<br />
Why doesn’t the battery charge when power level is above 95% with AC adapter connected?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This is a normal condition for battery protection, and there is no problem in either battery itself or charging function.<br />
When battery is charged up to 100% , the notebook will automatically stop charging. At this time, battery will self-discharge very slowly owing to the chemical characteristics of Li-on battery even though the notebook doesn’t consume any battery power.<br />
The current design of ASUS Notebook comes with built-in RSOC (Reconfigurable SOC) and the purpose is to prolong the lifespan of the overall battery.&nbsp; Below description explain this phenomenon:<br />
1. When the battery capacity is below 95% with AC adapter connected, the battery would be charged to 100% then stop charging.<br />
2. When the battery capacity drops from 100% down to 99%~95% with AC adapter connected, the battery would not charge until power level drops below 95%.<br />
3. When the battery capacity remained around 94% to 97%, battery would not charge with AC adapter connected. You can unplug and re-connect the adapter for several times to resume charging to 100%.</p>

<h2>            flash player issues in Microsoft Edge</h2>
                    One day Flash player works when using Edge, another day it wont. Adobe says it is disabled, Edge says it is enabled. This is extremely discouraging for the latest operating system to have this issue. I'm not happy. I've tried downloading adobe flash uninstaller,
 running it, then reinstalling flash. Doesn't help. I like to see my daily power usage, but the power company requires flash player to be installed. The website tells me I don't have it. What is up with this? Can anyone help me?

<p>Thank you for the reply and suggestion. It did not work. Other videos will play in Edge. The problem does not exist in Internet Explorer.&nbsp; There are no error messages. Instead,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to view my power usage history (a feature on the Alabama Power website that requires Flash) the graph will not build and I get a message that says, You must have Flash Player installed to view this page.&nbsp; Additionally, when I go to Adobe's website
 and try to test Flash, it tells me Flash is disabled. When I check the Edge browsers settings, it tells me that Flash is enabled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have toggled Flash on and off, rebooted and a variety of combinations thereof and to no avail.

<p>Thank you for the reply and suggestion. It did not work. Other videos will play in Edge. The problem does not exist in Internet Explorer.&nbsp; There are no error messages. Instead,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to view my power usage history (a feature on the Alabama Power website that requires Flash) the graph will not build and I get a message that says, You must have Flash Player installed to view this page.&nbsp; Additionally, when I go to Adobe's website
 and try to test Flash, it tells me Flash is disabled. When I check the Edge browsers settings, it tells me that Flash is enabled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have toggled Flash on and off, rebooted and a variety of combinations thereof and to no avail.

<p>This did not work, I downloaded and ran the app checker. It detected nothing. I contqacted Alabama Power and explained the problem to them See response below:</p>

<h2>            Getting error &#34;failed to query TCP&#47;IP settings of the connection&#34; when trying to repair 1394 net connection after Windows XP reinstall</h2>
                    Hello Everyone,<br />
I recently reinstalled Windows XP SP 2 as my PC was very sluggish and I don't recall ever doing a reinstall since I bought this PC six years ago! I ran the File and Settings Transfer Wizard prior to my reinstall. The install went smoothly and I transferred
 my original setting back to my PC after the install. However, since the reinstall I'm unable to connect to the Internet and I'm also having problems connecting my wireless printer. I connect to the Internet through a cable modem.&nbsp; I also have a NETGEAR wireless
 router which connects my laptop and my Canon Pixma MX860. I can still connect to the Internet with my laptop and can access the web as well as the Optonline.net mail server. I ran the new connection Wizard selecting "connect to the Internet" then "set up my
 connection manually" then "connect using a broadband connection that is always on". The next screen read "completing the new connection Wizard, your broadband connection should already be configured and ready to use…". However, when I use Internet explorer
 to try to access the web I get an error message that reads "the page cannot be displayed, the page you are looking for is currently unavailable…". This same error message also recommends checking the option to "automatically detect settings" which I already
 had checked.<br />
<br />
I've also done the following but still cannot connect:<br />
<br />
- I right clicked the 1394 network connection and clicked "repair" and got the following error "failed to query TCP/IP settings of the connection".<br />
<br />
- I looked at my bios settings to ensure that the integrated NIC card was set to "ON".<br />
<br />
- Per a user that was having a similar problem, I renamed my TCPIP.sys files to TCPIP.sys.old and rebooted and retried the new connection but still had the same problem. I did notice that new TCPIP.sys files were created.<br />
<br />
- I deleted the 1394 net adapter in the settings under system/device manager and reinstalled it by right clicking "network adapters" and selected "scan for hardware changes".<br />
<br />
- I noticed there are all yellow question marks next to "other devices" and all the devices listed under that including ethernet controller, multimedia audio controller, multimedia controller,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PCI modem, and video controller.<br />
<br />
- Unplugged and then plugged in my cable modem to reset it.<br />
<br />
I noticed when I right-clicked Network Connections/1394 communication 3 properties/Internet protocol (TCP/IP) there is a button to "install" as well as "properties" but the "uninstall" button is grayed out, does that mean that TCP/IP is not installed on this
 PC? When I click "properties" the option to "obtain an IP address automatically" was checked off. Does this mean that TCP/IP is in fact installed on this PC? The Uninstall button being grayed out leads me to believe TCP/IP is not installed on the PC. Does
 all this have anything to do with why I can't get my wireless printer to connect wirelessly? The only other thing I can try is to reinstall the operating system but I'm trying to avoid that as it takes so long. Regarding the reinstall, I was doing it from
 an Dell OEM disk which had an option to install other Windows components and IIS was one of those components. I don't recall the exact description however it had something to do with Internet connections and TCP/IP. However, when I tried to install it I was
 prompted for a second Windows install disk but my PC only came with the one install disk. Is that IIS software something I can download from Microsoft and will that fix my problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any info you can provide! <br />
<br />

<p>You don't need to set up a new connection to connect to the Internet through a cable modem using the computer's built-in NIC.&nbsp; Remove the broadband connection that you created.</p>
<p>You can ignore the 1394 net adapter, because the cable modem doesn't use it. The 1394 net adapter is used to connect to a network through the computer's IEEE 1394 (FireWire) port.&nbsp; The cable modem uses the computer's Ethernet port (NIC).</p>
<p>You don't need to install IIS (Internet Information Services). That program has nothing to do with connecting to the Internet. It lets you host a web site on your computer for other people to access.</p>
<p>The problem is that drivers haven't been installed for the Ethernet controller (NIC).&nbsp; If you have a driver installation disk that came with your computer, you can use that.&nbsp; If not, use another computer, go to the computer manufacturer's web site, and download
 Windows XP drivers for your computer model for all of the devices that have the yellow question mark. Use a flash drive or CD/DVD to transfer the drivers to your computer and install them.&nbsp; Once the drivers are installed, there will be a Local Area Connection
 that the cable modem uses.</p>

<h2>            &#39;Go Back to Windows 7&#39;</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded my system online from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10. However after upgrade my Kaspersky internet security 2015 did not work. I re-installed with updated KIS 2015. After reboot, I am stuck with login screen and not able to login to my system.
 I tried all the recovery process, but failed. I cannot reset my system because I get the message that 'Windows folder is locked'. However one method for login into the system worked. That is, when remove the power cord and boot the laptop in battery mode,
 I am able to login and use the system. </p>
<p>Now I would like to Go back to my previous OS i.e. Windows 7. But 'Go Back to Windows 7' in UPDATE &amp; SECURITY --&gt; RECOVERY is not working. When I click on 'Get started' nothing happens. Neither 'Reset this PC' nor 'Go Back to Windows 7' works for me.
</p>
<p>

here.</a> I can't recover back to 7. Finally managed to restore back to 1st restore file right after getting Win 10 installed. I had to delete my antivirus (Avast) to get restore to work. It kept hanging each time it would reboot. Still can't go back to Win
 7. Click on the box to recover to it and it appears to be working but hours later, still nothing. Good luck. This "upgrade" appears to be a hit or miss for most people. MS tech support never followed up with me after their suggestion didn't work. I do have
 the full Win 7 discs and will end up having to copy all my pics and files then do a complete format and reinstall of Win 7. They can keep their Win 10. I guess you get what you pay for.

I would doubt it.&nbsp; You would have to strip the laptop down and that would void warranty.&nbsp; Then you would have to be very knowledgeable about cpu sockets, chip sets, etc.&nbsp; Then you would have to make sure HP makes a driver and BIOS for it, etc, etc, etc<br />
<br />
If you are going to need a lot more horespower your best bet is to buy a different class of cpu from the start.<br />

<h2>            Surface RT Auto correct</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Over the past year or so I've made various spelling mistakes but Surface has done a good job at correcting them. Until recently where it remembers what I have previously spelt incorrectly! I'm not sure if this is my fault, maybe I added something to my dictionary
 but it is very annoying and as a result I have had to turn off auto correct! </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For example: Haha now corrects its self to Hah a. Not major put it's annoying.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there any way to edit/refresh my personal dictionary on Windows Surface RT?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>R ckick next to the miusspeled word typing does not work for me ... frankly SURFACE AuotCorrect is the worst Microsoft feature I have ever experienced .. it costs me at least 3x more time than correcting my relkatively few typos .. I have actively recommended
 others don't use a SURFACE because of this annoying feature ... <br />

<p>If such a game were a sauce it would be called "Amazing Sauce".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Loved "Space Marines".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would love to se a "Space Marines" themed MMO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would it be based on the Warhammer and Games Worshop complex tabletop strategy game (i.e. an attempt to make a simulated version) or would it simply be an MMO thought up in the Warhammer Universe?</p>

<p>Not just that but you get your army codex, half the figures get released then they release s new edition and tell you you need a new codex and new figures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Apart from that I love Warhammer. The MMO THQ was working on obviously got scrapped but this is a new one from another studio that picked up the license.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Behaviour has it? I just looked at their track record of games, and it seems all they really did was ports and movie tie ins. I've played some of them and none of them were ever favorites, just okay games. Hopefully this is the game that makes them step
 it up a little more.</p>

<p>On the page listing all current xbox one titles in development it says 2015.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I saw it lists Project Spark as 2015 too. That's quite disappointing. &nbsp;I was hoping it would be out sooner.</p>

            Hello cdl1246,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your question to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
Since you are having a problem after installation of Adobe 9.1, I would uninstall the reader and then go to Adobe.com and download the correct
<br />
version. You may not have installed the correct version for Windows Vista.<br />
<br />
Click on the link below for the Adobe Reader 9.1 download.<br />
<a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/otherversions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://get.adobe.com/reader/otherversions/</a><br />
<br />
Then check and see if there is an update on the right hand side of the page.<br />
<br />
Please reply back and let us know if this resolves your issue or if you still need further assisance.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,
