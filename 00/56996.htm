<h2>            Windows failed to start. Recent Hardware</h2>
                    Once I turn on my Windows 7 computer, I get the error message:&nbsp;
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>windows failed to start.&nbsp; A recent hardware or software&nbsp; change might be the cause</strong>
<p><strong>If Windows files have been damaged or configured incorrectly, Startup repair can help diagnose and fix the problem.&nbsp; If power was interrupted during startup, choose Start Windows Normally.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(Use the arrow keys to highlight your choice.)</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Launch Startup Repair (recommended)</strong></p>
<p><b>2. Start Windows Normally</b><br />
<br />
Upon choosing the first option, it ran the repair and after it finished I went and used my computer normally. The next day, the problem occurred again. This time I selected the second option and it booted right up and ran just as good. Well for the past two
 weeks, regardless of which option I select, my computer runs fine. But this message continues to pop up. I have pressed F8 and ran the system repair that way. I have selected a last good boot up option. Neither of these seemed to fix the problem. I tried putting
 my Windows 7 disk to do a repair that way, and my disk doesn't have the "repair windows 7" option like I have seen tutorials. The only thing it shows is "install windows 7."&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have ran a windows update through the control panel and have seen a couple of things that may be the cause of this, I am not too sure. I ran some windows 7 updates and came across the option "fix problems with windows update." Once I clicked that, it scanned
 my computer and said something along the lines of "windows start up repair" and asked me if I wanted to fix it, and I said yes. I thought that would have fixed it, but upon starting my computer again, the same error message appears.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also, I saw something somewhere about a "net frame" or something like that. I forget what I did or what I was trying to do (I have tried fixing this every day) but there was something up with the ".net frame" or something. I thought it ran a repair and fixed
 it, but the messages are still there.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This problem shouldn't be THAT serious as I am using the computer right now. It runs just fine. It's just on the startup, the same message appears when I turn it on. I don't recall downloading anything to cause this to happen, but you never know. It doesn't
 show the message EVERY time. If I turn my computer on, and get the message, I could choose start windows normally and it boots just fine. If I turned my computer off and back on, the message won't show up. If I turn it off for the night, and turn it on the
 next day, it will have the message. Any help would be appreciated as this is quite annoying when I try starting up my computer.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question. I will surely help you to find a resolution regarding the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model of the computer? <br />
<br />
2. Are you aware of making any changes to the computer prior to the issue? 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Perform an SFC scan on your computer. Refer to the following link:</span></p>
<p><b><span>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista
 or on Windows 7</span></b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:
</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to
</span><span>scan the computer for error. Follow this step to do the same:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start<br />
2. Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD-&gt;Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
3. At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct
 them.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span>
 While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally you may refer the following link for more information:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check a
 drive for errors</a></span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Also, check if there’s any error message in the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Event Viewer</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Event Viewer is a tool that displays detailed information about significant events (for
 example, programs that don't start as expected or updates that are downloaded automatically) on your computer. Event Viewer can be helpful when troubleshooting problems and errors with
</span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span> and other programs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, see:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What
 information appears in event logs (Event Viewer)?</a></span></p>
Hope this information helps. Please reply back with the status so that we could help you further.

            I have a custom made computer, AMD Phenom II, MSI Mainboard.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I tried method one and said something about finding no violations. I ran method two and after a couple hours of running, the scan was complete. I don't THINK it found anything wrong. If it made repairs, it done so without notifying me or me noticing. I won't
 know until I turn on my computer tomorrow afternoon as it always shows the message when I leave it off for a while.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If there are any other steps, they are welcome. But I will reply with the status of my computer as soon as I find out if the messages are appearing or not. Thanks for the help so far.&nbsp;

<div>It looks like the firewall feature from Kaspersky seems to be blocking the App.</div>
<div>You can contact Kaspersky and have them help you make an exception to let the Calendar App through the firewall.</div>
<div><a href="http://usa.kaspersky.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://usa.kaspersky.com/support</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Windows 8 has an inbuilt antivirus software called Windows Defender that would let you use the Calendar and have an active antivirus.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let us know if you need any other assistance. Feel free to use the forum for any other Windows questions you may have.</div>

</p><p>Now I tried restore that didn't do nothing as it didn't go back far enough. Thought about going back to an earlier build but didn't know if that would wipe out 1/2 the stuff on my HD.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did learn that you can do a re-installation of Windows 10 But even if you tell it to keep your files it wipes out over 1/2 the stuff on my hard drive. my games, utils etc. What good is telling it to keep the files if it's just going to delete them anyway?
 That would give me more work and more headaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What problems would I have with MS if I were to go to another drive that I did a full drive copy the game saves over Wipe out this drive. Copy the cloned MS windows 7 drive back onto this one and down load Windows 10 again?</p>

            <p>My Original posted problems have yet to be fixed and still need help with them. I'm left with one of two options I guess since I've searched everywhere on the net including here and still nothing to correct this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two things for which I can do is: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; A re-install of Windows 10 telling it to keep my files. But if that is like the "Restore" where it wiped out all my book marks and my saved passwords. I could lose all of my files. And will have to do #2 anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;2. Format the drive and copy my stable Windows 7 drive back over and re-download 10. At least doing it this way I won't have top re install all my drivers and programs that Windows 10 threatens to delete by doing #1 above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It gets me all these supposed MS people on this site and they have no way to help fix this problem. I think if I end up having to do #2 I will just leave Windows 10 drive alone and work on the Win 7 drive till the 1st Service pack comes out. As far as I
 can tell Windows 10 is far from being ready to be installed. </p>

    <title>Child and parent microsoft accont for using Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adds21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Child and parent microsoft accont for using Skype</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a real problem allowing my child to use Skype on their Android.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, I've set up their MS account as a child account, and mine as the parent.&nbsp; I can't remember exactly when I did this, but probably to allow them to use Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to login to their Skype, I get told I (the parent) need to verify, from&nbsp;a browser,&nbsp;their ability to use Skype.&nbsp; So I login to their account at account.live.com, and are then asked to login as the parent.&nbsp; I login as the parent (me), and are asked
 if I give permission for them to use their MS account.&nbsp; So far, so good.&nbsp; I say "yes", but am then told that I need to be in the same country as my child.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are both in the UK, but presumably that my child's MS account thinks, incorrectly, their in the US.&nbsp; Problem is, I can't change that because I can't login to their account to change it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I've tried going to familysafety.microsoft.com, but can't login in at all because I'm not running Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really very, very frustrating.&nbsp; I remember having similar issues when trying to use Xbox.&nbsp; Can anyone help?!&nbsp; All I want to be able to do is Skype my child when I'm away for work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h3> willsmith69420  say:</h3>
<h2>            CPU is always forcing to 100&#37;</h2>
                    <p>So my cpu is always forcing itself to 100% for example with Microsoft edge open it forces edge to use 85% cpu to make the total up to 100%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried resetting my windows but only on my C drive which only really had windows on as I install the majority of my programs on another drive.</p>
<p>I'm using a 7700K.</p>
<p>Ive updated my motherboard drivers tried updating my gpu drivers.(1070)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've messed around with the power settings im currently on balanced and have tried power saver.</p>
<p>On my resource monitor it says 104% cpu usage and the main two at the top are memory compression and system even after reset. and max frequency is 103%. Strangely however on CAM which I have to monitor my hardware it said that my usage was hovering around
 20-30%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really no idea how to fix this any suggestions?</p>

            Hi WIll.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) See fixes for high CPU usage here:
<br /><a href="https://fossbytes.com/how-to-fix-high-ram-and-cpu-usage-of-windows-10-system-ntoskrnl-exe-process/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://fossbytes.com/how-to-fix-high-ram-and-c...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-high-cpu-usage-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-high-c...</a>
<br /> <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-high-cpu-usage-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-high-cpu-usag...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />3) Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   
<br />
<br />5) I would not install programs to another drive, since they write keys to the Windows registry and should remain a part of the C drive for imaging purposes.  If it's an SSD you also lose the speed benefit if apps are on another drive.  
<br />
<br />What you can move to another partition or drive are user files including some or all of the User folders as shown here:  <a href="http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/windows-10/how-to-change-the-location-of-user-folders-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-syst...</a>
<br />
<br />Then  if Windows ever becomes irreparable you can restore C in 20 minutes from recovery media, and your files will be current and safe in their own separate partition.  If they are left on C they will be dated from when the image was taken.  
<br />
<br />The best free imaging app for saving the backup image externally is here:

<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>HDD Bad Sector - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> natanielpapalangi  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDD Bad Sector</h2>
                    <p>I found my windows late this week stop working, so i get to the power button and shut it down and then sh*t happens.</p>
<p>i can't load my windows anymore cause it stuck on the repair boot and keep looping for days. when i finally figured out that my drive has a bad sector i decided to do a clean install.</p>
<p>after i do that clean install i found out that there is free space on the disk that i can use to install a new windows so that i can use it to recovery before do the clean install. when it's all done i got 2 windows running on the same drive and guess what's
 happen? it's running on slow motion like super slow motion video.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>my question is, when that disk (in this case "1 partition") got problem does it affect to all disk even the free space, and what can i do to get all my data back without loss anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>help me please!!!</p>

            <p>HI,<br />
<br />
Checkdisk can find some bad sectors and mark them or repair them using CHKDISK C: /F /R<br />
(where C: is the drive you want to check).<br />
<br />
However your description would lead me to want to use the more efficient methods I posted in my last reply.
<br />
<br />
If those seem to work with in the maker specs then I would re-install Windows by re--partitioning and formatting the drive. Of course that removes everything on the drive so you need good backups of programs (to re-install) and data (to restore)&nbsp;off the main
 drive.<br />

<span>Hi Nataniel!</span></p>
<br />
I am not sure what your question is exactly, but one thing I'd recommend for sure will be to look for a replacement drive since there is already a bad sector on your current one.<br />
<br />
Basically there are two kinds of bad sectors - hardware and software:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Hardware ones are caused by physical damage or becoming magnetically fixed, and they are unrepairable. In short, once they appear it's only a matter of time (no way to say how long) until the HDD fails.</li><li>Software bad sectors on the other hand occur when something called an Error Correction Code (ECC) doesn't match the contents of the hard drive. These can be repaired by overwriting the data on the drive with zeroes (a.k.a. low level formatting) and sometimes
 by running a **chkdsk [write the letter of the drive:] /r** in the CMD.</li></ul>
<br />
As for getting the information from the drive if one of the partitions fail, most likely you won't be able to, which is why I'd suggest to make a regular backup of your most important data.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps and feel free to ask any questions you may have.

            Checkdisk can take a long time especially if there are error and/or on a large disk.<br />
<br />
So I would certainly use the maker's diagnostic tool to see if the drive can be saved.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Only using copy and so on. <br />
<br />
Have you tried the maker's diagnostic utility? If do so as it may mark the bad sectors such that you can access the drive. Just do not use any option that is destructive. Ask their support is you have any issues or questions.<br />

            Depends on what you do or what it takes to repair the drive and even more on what conditions Windows is in before and after your attempts. In short be careful however no way to know without trying.<br />
<br />
Check with your system maker to ensure you are using tools for your hardware.&nbsp;Though many, such as SeaTools, should work on a lot of drives.<br />

            Thats really unbelievable, you can't fix that and have to reinstall Windows which takes like 6 hours incl. Visual Studio and all the SDK's... Thinking seriously of switiching to Linux.&nbsp;It can't be that you deploy a Windows Version which makes someone unable
 to work and don't even come up with a fix for that Problem.

</p><p>I can't deploy any app to my local machine from Visual Studio and I keep getting the exact same error. I am about at the point where I am going to reinstall Windows because I've been messing around with different suggestions for about a week. I honestly
 feel like I could have posted exactly what you said myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't want to reinstall but I feel it is my only option left.</p>

            <div>I think Microsoft does not care about users as it should. In a critical situation that should come in a forum like this and say "Guys, it seems that we have a problem in the last update X. We are investigating and we will give a solution soon."</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>But no, it leaves us killing ourselves.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>In fact I noticed a serious problem with this proposed new "Windows as a service", automatically updated without that I can decide on updates: When an update gives a problem on my computer I need to find a solution alone. Or install another operating system
 in the event of not finding a solution.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>With me it was an update "wonderful" that dropped the Internet randomly, until I could get the idea of reversing a previous driver version. But there was no solution for it anywhere on the web.</p>
<div>I have a friend is with some operation problems after last update, and has restored the Windows, but unfortunately it updates itself again. He is in doubt expected a correction (which may not exist) or exchange the O.S.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try a few steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Set your joystick’s USB selector (3) to the “PC” position.&nbsp; <br />
2. Connect the USB connector (2) to one of your computer’s USB ports.&nbsp; Windows will automatically detect the new device.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
3. The drivers are installed automatically. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.&nbsp; 4. Click Start/Settings/Control Panel and then double-click Game Controllers.&nbsp; The Game Controllers dialog box displays the joystick’s name with OK
 status.&nbsp; <br />
5. In the Control Panel, click Properties to configure your joystick. Test device: Lets you test and view all of your joystick’s functions.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMPORTANT NOTES FOR PC&nbsp;&nbsp; - Your joystick’s USB selector (3) must always be set to the “PC” position before connecting your joystick.&nbsp; - When connecting your joystick: Leave the handle, rudder and throttle centered and do not move them (to avoid any calibration
 problems).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>TROUBLESHOOTING AND WARNINGS&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
• My joystick doesn’t function correctly or appears to be improperly calibrated:&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>- Switch off your computer or your console, disconnect your joystick, reconnect your joystick and then re-launch your game.&nbsp;&nbsp; - When connecting your joystick: Leave the handle, rudder and throttle centered and do not move them (to avoid any calibration problems).&nbsp;
 - Exit your game, disconnect your joystick, verify that the USB selector (PC / PS3) (3) is set to the proper position, then reconnect your joystick.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;My joystick is too sensitive or not sensitive enough:&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>- Your joystick self-calibrates on its own after you have made a few movements on the different axes.&nbsp; - In your game’s “Options / Controller / Gamepad or Joystick” menu: Adjust the sensitivity or dead zones for your controller (if this option is available).&nbsp;
 - Adjust the handle resistance using the dial (9) located under your joystick’s base.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find the manual here:</p>

    <title>Ctrl key annoying problem, How can I fix it&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> colbarr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ctrl key annoying problem, How can I fix it&#63;</h2>
                    For the past few weeks&nbsp;the Ctrl key on my acer Aspire 5739G&nbsp;has decided to affect every keystroke I make. If I press it once, it acts as if I have Sticky Keys turned on. For example, if i press Ctrl and then the "A" button, it gives it an accent like this
 "à". If i press Ctrl and then "Spacebar" it adds a quotation mark `. If I Press the Ctrl key twice i get two&nbsp;Quote marks&nbsp;``. Does anybody know what the problem is?<br />
<br />
There is one thing to note. Prior to this happening, my keyboard stopped working altogether, I couldn't even type my password to get into my user account. I left the laptop off for a few hours and when I turned it back on, everything was back to normal apart
 from the Ctrl key problem.<br />
<br />
`1`2`3`4`5`6`7`8`9`0`-`=`q`wè`r`t`yùìò`p`[`]à`s`d`f`g`h`j`k`l`;`'`#`\`z`x`c`v`b`n`m`,`.`/`<br />
<br />
That was every key pressed following the ctrl key.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.

Ensure that you have the correct language installed.<br />
<br />
If the above doesn't cure the problem, consider getting your keyboard checked out at an Acer service centre&nbsp;

<p>I've just discovered a potential cause. I think the Ctrl button has taken on a second function as the button that's just below the esc key and beside the 1 key. I think it's called the grave accent key. It's a dead-key that modifies the&nbsp;carachter pressed
 immediately after the grave accent key.&nbsp;Anybody know why this might have happened and any way to fix it? The Keyboards and language method didn't work.</p>

<p>Nice catch, it's a - yes, you guessed it -&nbsp;<strong>scam</strong>. There is no such thing as the Bill Gates Foundation&nbsp;so don't reply or click on any links, otherwise you will almost certainly&nbsp;receive many&nbsp;more of these e-mails (now they know they have found
 a susceptible&nbsp;person)&nbsp;and you may potentially be infected with malware if you click the link.</p>

                    <span>
<p>I have a WordPad File (Rich Text Document) that contains information copied from a variety of on line sources of information on line, such as Message Boards. I now see most of this information as unreadable. The file size is 48.1 MB. The file opens without
 error but there is a definite pause now before the information diplays.</p>

<p>Here is a sample of what I see:</p>
</span>
<p><span><span>\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</span></span></p>
<p>Not all of the file contents looks like this...just most of it!</p>

Hi ForrestRanger,</p>
<p>1. Did the file display its contents correctly prior to the issue?<br />
2. Do you remember making any changes or settings within the file?<br />
3. Did you try to open the file using Microsoft Word?</p>
<p>We recommend you to use Microsoft Word to open the file and check if it opens fine. If you don't have word, then install Word viewer and check the result.<br />

<p>Thanks for your advice.</p>
<p>Syed V- 1. Did the file display its contents correctly prior to the isse? Yes it did, many times. I have added and saved information into this file for over 1 month from a variety of sources. But only text and links to references that were included in the
 text. Never added photos. I was careful to always "SAVE" any additions that I made. Using File&gt; Save from the toolbar. 2. Do you remember making any changes or settings within the file? As mentioned, I added information to the file almost every day, sometimes
 many times a day. Saving after each addition. I was careful to keep the information sectioned by paragraph. I would frequently reduce or increase the text size of some of the copied information to keep the text size somewhat uniform, usually to size 12 or
 14. I kept my default settings at Time New Roman and Western and sometimes I would use Italic, Bold or Underline specific information for emphasis. I have trouble reading from my pc's monitor so I often print out my Wordpad Document so I can read it from paper
 at a later date. 3. Did you try to open the file using Microsoft Word? No. I don't have Word on my PC.</p>
<p>So far I have tried to cut and paste the readable information from the corrupted document to another Wordpad document to see if by reducing the size of the file I would realize some improvment but this did not have any benefit. I have also re-started windows
 hoping that this would help but that did not do anything either.</p>
<span><span>
<p>I took your advice and downloaded and installed the Microsoft Word Viewer 2003 (11.8169.8172) SP3 and tried to open the file. I saw a progress bar open and the note that "Word Viewer is converting the file (file name)" appeared but the progress bar stalled
 after less than 10% completion. I waited over 10 minutes and was about to hit the Exit option thinking the "conversion" had failed when my telephone rang. I left my work desk to answer it and when I returned my entire file was readable again!</p>
<p>I cannot thank you enough! This file of mine had a least 1,000 hours of work contained within it. I had procrastinated about backing it up to a thumb drive almost every day for the past month!</p>
<p>Can you advise about what might have happened? Could I have reached a limit to the amount of information that 1 wordpad file should contain?</p>
<p>I have saved 1000's of hours of information to my computer as wordpad files and I keep them on my hard drive that way. I run Windows XP and have automatic updates enabled so I am up to date. Ditto with MSIE 8.0. My anti-virus is also current.</p>
<p>Thanks again for saving all this work for me. If you can suggest a "How To" regarding the use of the Word Viewer I would again also be very grateful to you! All my wordpad files are now opening as Word Viewer files now so I would very much like to know how
 to use it.</p>
<p>Wunders- thanks for your thought that my problem might be disk corruption. I do use the Microsoft Disk Cleanup and Disk Check on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy Holidays!</p>

                    I have used Windows 7 for years. When I right click on my desktop and go to the new tab, folder is not one of the options anymore. The same is true if I use Control, shift N. Any ideas?

            <p>Do, or did you have Chrome installed? It appears a Chrome update, (circa mid April, 2013), is responsible. Here are two fixes.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade - Files Missing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade - Files Missing</h2>
                    <p>Many people seem to have a problem with missing files after the Windows 10 upgrade, but none were quite like my issue. &nbsp;I installed Windows 10 using Windows Update, and the installation when smoothly. &nbsp;However, after the reboots, and the very slow screens
 that say "We have updated your computer" and "Your files are just where you left them", I got a the default background screen instead of my old one, and my files were NOT where I left them. &nbsp;After extensive searching, I did find the files, and moved them so
 they would be in the This PC locations for documents, pictures, videos, etc. &nbsp;So all my files were accessible -- after a lot of work. &nbsp;The next day, I had to restart my computer to reinstall an application, and I got the slow screen again, and the message
 that my computer had been updated. &nbsp;I got my old screen background back, and the previous arrangement of icons on the desktop -- but now the folders that I have moved were no longer in the This PC locations, and they were not in the location where I had found
 them before (the windows.old folder). While I have backups for most of the files, there are some that I don't have. &nbsp;If they were on the computer yesterday, they must still be on there today -- somewhere -- but no amount of searching in the C: drive has located
 them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced this restart issue, or have any knowledge about where the files might be located, or how they might be recovered? A call to Microsoft Support yielding nothing -- they don't support issues with file backups, according to the support
 person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help from anyone would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) When have you upgraded to Windows 10? </p>
<p>2) To which location you have moved your files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur if the upgrade to Windows 10 has not been done correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have upgraded to Windows 10 before 30 days, then the files which are there in Windows. Old folder will be lost, since after 30 days system will run automatic disk clean up and deletes all files from Windows. Old folder.
</p>
<p>I suggest you to check the files in the other drives as well. If it is available in the computer drives then try to move them in external hard drive or other drives so that when ever an updates run in the computer it will not get deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>c:/ drive consists of files related to Operating System. So, if any changes made to the computer it won't effect the files which are stored in the other drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also recommend you to download an ISO file and create a backup of an image file.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>To download an ISO image refer to the below link:</span></span></p>

            Thanks for your thoughts. &nbsp;I did the update on 1/2/16. &nbsp;I did not have a problem with the initial update, other than the fact that my files did not show up in the Documents/Photos, etc. libraries of This PC. &nbsp;I was able to locate the files and move them
 to the new library folder locations. &nbsp;The problem occurred the next day, when I needed to restart the computer for the installation of an application. &nbsp;Instead of just restarting, Windows went through the same opening screens as it had for the update the day
 before. When the restart was completed, my files that I had moved were no longer in the libraries on This PC -- and were no longer in the Windows.old folder where I had found them the previous day. &nbsp;I think the restart should have been the final part of the
 original update, but it was not done automatically, nor was I prompted to do it. I say this because after the restart, my original desktop background picture returned -- which did not occur after the original

            <p>I solved my problem but the solution was a little different and completely my fault; can't throw Microsoft under the bus on this one. After installing the upgrade, I was prompted to login within my user id and password. I saw some of my files but were missing
 a lot! I searched the entire PC using wildcards and extension wildcards but could not find the files I really needed. SOLUTION: I have two different Microsoft IDs; one for work and one for personal. I had logged in under my personal ID initially. After switching
 users to my work ID, I thankfully found all of the files I needed, resting safely and exactly where I left them. Microsoft 1 : Brother Bill 0. Hope this helps someone.</p>

<h2>            Issues with the Fn key - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having trouble with my Samsung Ultrabook ever since I installed Windows 10. The keyboard light doesn't turn off and all the shortcuts I had at my disposal have been unassigned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means that I can no longer adjust the screen brights, keyboard light, select main screen or secondary screen, and other shortcuts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have similar problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I solved the fn key problem by desactivating Synoptics pointing (go to "show hidden icons" on the bottom right) then we are able to uninstall Synoptics pointing device in "install/uninstall programs".</p>
<p>Restart computer and the keyboard will work again as before Win 10.</p>
<p>I hope this will help you.</p>

 I cannot go download to my laptop since it wouldn't let me go to the login page nor the desktop, I download the media creation tool file to my other laptop and transferred it to my USB. Here's the error on Software Restore "The instruction at 0x00007FFD01946B8C
 referenced memory at 0x0000000000000008. The memory could not be read. Click on OK to terminate the program".<br />
<br />
Do I use the option "Use a device" in that section and use EFI USB Device and activate the tool there?</p>

<h2>            Resetting my Windows 10</h2>
                    Hi, I have a huge question. I am in need of a reset of my Windows 10 Laptop. I go to Reset it, but it never resets. I let it sit overnight to reset, woke up and it was still on the screen of " This will take a few minutes and your PC will restart." I am
 getting frustrated that it won't reset and I feel that there might be something wrong with my laptop. Plz help :-)

            Hi Chris, try starting the System Reset from the Windows Recovery Environment:
<br />
<br />Start PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset
<br />
<br />
<br />If your system still wont reset:
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10

            Hello, 
<br />The reset Image might be corrupt so try pointing the recovery image to a different media.
<br />Make sure you have Windows 10 ISO file and has install.wim in Sources folder.
<br />Point recovery image using the following article:

<p>It looks like that is a very outdated version but the place to check for older versions would be here:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vbasic/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vbasic/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>Otherwise, since your school has the requirement they should provide the software so ask them.</p>

            The website seems to only be about VB 2008 onwards, which is not compatible with VB6. I still can't find where to download the full version. I can only find updates and stuff like that.

            You would probably need an MSDN or TechNet subscription. Again, you will need to check with your school to get this obsolete version of Visual Basic. If MS doesn't offer it for download then there is nowhere legal to get it.

<h2>            Windows 10 Update Caused Programs To Not Work Properly</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently updated to the latest version on Windows and at least two of the programs that I have been using perfectly well up till now have stopped working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hill Climb Racing, (which I use rarely but occasionally as a distraction), to all in tense and purposes,&nbsp;has stopped working at all.&nbsp; This used to work absolutely fine before the update, but now all I get is a splash screen, the bottom ads and a blank screen.&nbsp;
 I've tried contacting Fingersoft, but so far they are unable to ascertain a problem. It's the latest version (of HCR), so there should! be no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have used MS Office (particularly Word) 2000 for years, and certainly just before the update.&nbsp; Now, when I try to save a file and I click on the Desktop icon on the left hand side, for instance, or the address bar's down arrow, the program crashes.&nbsp;
 The only way to save is to carefully use the 'folder up' arrow to locate the drive and navigate down from there.&nbsp; Again, this problem has only appeared since the latest Windows update.&nbsp; (To pre-empt a possible option - I have no intention of upgrading to a
 newer version of Office, as I detest the newer layout (ribbon, etc.), and the cost, and have up&nbsp;until now had a perfectly good version to work with.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Matt</p>

<p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One of the factors that have may triggered this error was a corrupted system component. It is possible that there was a software conflict which lead to the file corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can start by running the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows app troubleshooter</a> to correct this error.</p>
<p>

</p><p>The Windows App Troubleshooter&nbsp; asks me to log into my Microsoft account.&nbsp; Doing this directly on my computer (as opposed to gaining access to a website such as this) always makes me nervous, as I have had trouble with logging in and out previously, and
 in one instance I have been completely locked out of a computer due to an error with the account details - not my fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll have to dig out the disk for the Office one.</p>
