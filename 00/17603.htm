<h2>            Yammer Javascript SDK app Single Sign on with Office 365 without local Active Directory</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I developed a custom Yammer feed using Javascript SDK on SharePoint Online (we need to do CRUD, so impersonation is not the way out), for which I simply use Script Editor to show the custom feed on certain pages. Now the problem is even if I am signed in
 to Office 365/SharePoint Online, I still need to use "yam.platform.login" to show a pop up to enter my email at least then the feed will show data. What I expect is the custom feed doesn't ask for user to login through a pop up, instead it directly shows up
 data with user has already signed in to SharePoint online. Any solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ares</p>

    <title>Copying contacts from phone to PC Suite - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Copying contacts from phone to PC Suite</h2>
                    I am trying to discover how to import the phone numbers of contacts I have on my 6500 into PC Suite, so that I can text using PCS. It would save typing the phone number of each text recipient into PCS each time. Maybe I'm being stupid but I can't see a
 way to do it.<br />
<br />
Any advice much appreciated. The contacts' details are on the SIM and the phone.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Have you tried using Nokia Communication Centre which is part of Nokia PC SUite???

            I have, of course - it is from the CC that I can't find any means of importing the contacts.<br />
<br />
All I need to do - which should, surely, be really simple - is to copy the names and mobile phone numbers I have in my phone/on my SIM to the Communications Centre in PC Suite. There just seems no way to do it.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1) How many contacts do you have on your phone memory?<br />
2) Does those contacts are visibile in Communication Centre(Contacts available in phone memory are visible in Communication centre and not the contacts stored on your SIM)?<br />
3) If those contacts are visible on Communication centre, select all contacts and go to File option in communication centre, there you will have the options to import/export contacts.<br />
<br />
From Communication Centre's help menu, please check the following :-<br />
<br />
You can import contact data from other Personal Information Management (PIM) applications in the following file formats:<br />
<br />
comma-separated values (.csv)<br />
plain text (.txt)<br />
electronic business card vCard (.vcf).<br />
<br />
For more information on how to create the text file, see the instructions in your PIM application. For instructions on creating the text file in Nokia PC Suite, see Exporting contacts to a text file.<br />
<br />
To import contacts, do the following:<br />
In the Contacts view, select File &gt; Import. The Open dialog box is displayed.<br />
<br />
Browse for the file you want to import.<br />
<br />
Click Open.<br />
<br />
The contacts are imported to the Contacts view.<br />
<br />
If the import fails, check the following things and try again:<br />
<br />
Check that the file format is correct. For example, an .msg file extension is not allowed.<br />
<br />
Check that the separator character used in a .csv file is correct. You can define it in the Regional and Language Options dialog box of your Windows Control Panel.<br />
<br />
Exporting contacts to a text file<br />
You can export contact data in the following file formats:<br />
<br />
comma-separated values (.csv)<br />
plain text (.txt)<br />
electronic business card vCard (.vcf).<br />
<br />
When working with a .csv file, define the used list separator in the Regional and Language Options dialog box in Windows Control Panel.<br />
<br />
To export contacts, do the following:<br />
In the Contacts view, select one or more contacts.<br />
<br />
Select File &gt; Export.<br />
<br />
From the Save as Type field, select the file format to use.<br />
<br />
Option<br />
Description<br />
<br />
.csv<br />
A contact's information is listed on one line, with values differentiated by a separator, such as a comma. Select this file format if you want to transfer the export file into an Excel spreadsheet or into a database.<br />
<br />
.txt<br />
Each value is on a separate line. The field names and values are separated by a tab.<br />
<br />
.vcf<br />
A contact's information is exported as an electronic business card. If you select only one contact, this format is used automatically. Select this file format if you want to include thumbnail images in the export file.<br />
<br />
<br />
In the dialog box, select the target folder for exporting and give the file a name, if needed.<br />
<br />
Click Save.<br />
<br />
The export file is created in the target folder.<br />
<br />
Tip:<br />
You can also drag contact information to other applications or into your PC's file system. In this case, the contact file is automatically created in the vCard format and named according to the contact's full name.

            1) I have around 150 contacts - names and numbers only, no other details.<br />
<br />
2) They are on my phone memory and on the SIM and they are not visible in Communication Centre.<br />
<br />
3) Does not apply. I am not attempting to import contacts from another program such as Outlook - merely from my phone to PCS's Communications Centre.<br />
<br />
Thanks anyway.

<h2>            Need help with recovering account with barely any details</h2>
                    Hello, I need help with recovering my Mothers Microsoft account since my Brother and I need the account to log back into Xbox Live since it's the parental account for it. We've tried to recover the password through the filling out of the forms but since
 my mother didn't use any credit cards or actually use the account for email we can't fill the details for that. She also had forgotten the security question answer and so we're at a stand still for the moment since we can fill out the basic information but
 that's not enough apparently.Also we don't know what email address gets the recovery password (most likely another old account which we've forgotten about !).Strangely enough we have access to the actual email (which is Blue-yonder) though Virgin Media &nbsp;but
 it's a different password to this Microsoft account. I know that this is inconvenient but is there anyway for the recovery password to be sent to the actual Blue-Yonder email or anything as easy as that ? We can detail the Xbox

<h2>            Transfer of favorites from old computer to new computer</h2>
                    I have a new computer, which I think uses IE11, just as my previous computer did.&nbsp; I want to transfer my IE favorites, or bookmarks, for use in the new computer.&nbsp; Earlier today I made both computers part of a homegroup.&nbsp; Apparently, my favorites have turned
 up, without my input, under OS (C:) users user, as favorites.&nbsp; Fine.&nbsp; Now I'm trying to get them to IE, and I'm using the import/export feature of IE, next to Add To Favorites.&nbsp; For some reason, it doesn't recognize the favorites, even when I put them into
 my Documents folder but as Favorites.&nbsp; Should I have names the folder bookmarks?&nbsp; Is there something I'm leaving out?

            Hi williamproud,
<br />There could be many factors that cause this error. 
<br />Run the System File Checker
<br />Press Windows + X keys and click command prompt (admin).
<br />Type the following command in command prompt and press Enter.
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />System file checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files
<br />
<br />Once that is completed Repair Office application
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair...</a>
<br />Let me know the results if it doesn't work I need to know more information
<br />Type of Program and version. What type of account is it exchange IMAP? When does the error occur? 
<br />Regards,
<br />Sam

    <title>2010 Outlook auto reply problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> b kirby  say:</h3>
<h2>            2010 Outlook auto reply problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I am trying to set up an auto reply in Outlook 2010 to let people know my email address will be changing in the new year.&nbsp; I have followed the steps and set up a template (open new email, save as oft, press save).&nbsp; I have then set a new rule which says
 when people send an email and my old email address is&nbsp;in the recipients address then outlook should reply using the template&nbsp;I set up.</p>
<p>When someone send me an email the aut reply email is generated but just sits in my outbox with the address field blank.&nbsp; What am i doing wrong? Thanks</p>
<p>(NB, out of office works but i would rather not use this to generate the response as people tend to delete out of office replies without reading them.&nbsp; I am hoping to use auto reply rule instead.)</p>

            I'd seen that link and have tried to recreate the rule about four times but still had the same problem.&nbsp; The rule itself seems to be properly contructed but it doesn't work.&nbsp; I also get an error message soemtimes saying it cannot send the email.

<p>You're talking about the "Out of Office" feature; can I assume you are using an Exchange account?</p>
<p>In that case, use the rule; "have the server reply with 'a template'".</p>
<p>Also, verify with your Exchange administrator that the Exchange server has been configured to allow automated messages to be sent outside the domain as well.<br />

            Yes, i'm using an exchange account.&nbsp; I've got the auto-reply working now but the response is sent everytime i receive an email.&nbsp; I need it to respond only when someone send me an email through my old email address which is soon to be switched off.&nbsp; This
 seems to be the drawback of using the rule 'have the server reply with a specific message'.&nbsp; Is there any way to make it work using a client based rule - i.e. 'reply with a template'?

<p>Has this old address been configured as an alias on your mailbox or as a separate contact or user in Active Directory which forwards the messages to your mailbox (ask your Exchange admin if you do not know this). In case of the last, then you can set a condition
 on the rule to check for that address.</p>
<p>If you want to do it via a client-only rule, then try changing your message format of your oft-file from HTML to Plain Text. Another possible cause for the rule not to work is because your virus scanner is in the way. Disable/uninstall its Outlook integration
 components and try again. See;<br />

            <p>Now that I read the thread, I see my problem is different. &nbsp;On Windows 10 install and with the latest update as of last Saturday the 31st of January, 2015. &nbsp;My Internet as well as my lan access is stopped working. &nbsp;Windows network Diagnostics says "local
 area connection" doesn't have a valid IP configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This pc is cat-5 only. &nbsp;No wireless. &nbsp;All my wireless devices work perfectly as does my laptop also on Cat 5. &nbsp;Computer has been cycled several times as has the modem. &nbsp;The cable company has done line diagnosis and sees no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems the system sees a Lan, but doesn't identify the "Alpha" label that identifies the workgroup. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened at the same time the activation notification became active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has an Asus VI gene motherboard with 32Gb ram. &nbsp;A 256gb sd drive and several peripheral drives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has 2x AMD R295 video cards &nbsp;driving a 3 monitor eyefinity set up. &nbsp; And an Intel i7 cpu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For obvious reasons it does not see the wireless printer. &nbsp;Incidentally the eyefinity has not been working right. &nbsp;I can get by with it but it doesn't display the task bar on the bottom of the middle monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it weren't for the coincidence with the Windows 10 install completion I would suspect the motherboard lan hardware has failed. &nbsp;I have a wireless pci card coming over tonight that may support that idea. &nbsp;But I just don't buy it would coincidentally fail
 at the exact same time Windows 10 completes its install upgrades.</p>

<h2>            Windows Defender clean up then reinstall</h2>
                    Due to a screw up of mine trying new registry cleaning software I screwed up and Windows Defender got uninstalled or uninstalled with leftovers.&nbsp; I was getting Windows update errors when I'm was told that Win Defender couldn't update...because it's not
 there!&nbsp;What I was going to do was uninstall MSE, which should turn Win Defender on, but&nbsp; I couldn't find it&nbsp;to uninstall Win Defender (not on list of installed programs) and reinstall. Well it's not there to uninstall. So I'm sure what I need to do is reinstall
 Win Defender, and/or&nbsp;clean up the leftovers and reinstall,&nbsp;however it's part of Win 7 and I can find no clean up tool or a way to reinstall, nor a way to reinstall. I went to Microsoft "Fix-It" site to no avail which surprises me. What led me to this was the
 fact that when I had MSE installed I kept getting windows download errors when it was trying to update Windows &gt;&nbsp;Win Defender.&nbsp; Then I knew when I uninstalled MSE and win Defender didn't come up and the computer couldn't find Win Defender I was in trouble.
 If I can clean up win Defender leftovers then reinstall I'm sure all will be okay, but can't find how to do that. I found how to fix register at: Windows Client&gt;Windows 7 IT Forum&gt;Windows 7 Security&gt;"<u><strong><em>Windows Defender Won't Start</em></strong></u>"
 (as Google Search), and I'm ok doing register stuff with a good back up, but the instructions confuse me because some of the commands in the directions use "notepad D:\fix.reg" ..what's with "D"- there's no mention of&nbsp;using drive "D" (DVD) in the instructions.
 There dot to be a way to uninstall/Clean-up/ then reinstall Win Defender. I can get by without it using MSE and malware-bytes, but would like to eliminate the constant download errors fro Defender.

You don't need Windows Defender if you are using MSE.</p>

<p><span>If you managed to uninstall WD (MS says you can't uninstall WD from Vista or Win 7) from the Win 7 OS using Registry Cleaners
 you probably need to reformat/reinstall your operating system since you&nbsp;possibly wreaked havoc on other parts of the OS as well.</span></p>

    <title>Windows Live&#47;Hotmail Continuous Synchronising Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cm8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live&#47;Hotmail Continuous Synchronising Problem</h2>
                    <p>This is the second time I have had a problem with the connection to my Hotmail/Windows Live Account on my Lumia 920.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has worked fine before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically when I go to my main Windows Live Account in settings, or to my Hotmail, it keeps on just synchronising... but doesn't fully connect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first time (about&nbsp;a week ago)&nbsp;it affected most of my phone, including my contacts, facebook messaging service, etc. I cantacted&nbsp;a Microsoft tech advisor and we tried many different ways to solve it, but eventually I had to do a full restore. This worked,
 but I lost almost everything and had to re-install all my apps and change all my settings, etc. again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now a similar thing is starting to happen again, only its just the hotmail so far, which just keeps on&nbsp;saying synchronising...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's now showing that I have one new email, but it won't come through properly...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried a soft restart, but that doesn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully Apollo Plus/Portico Update will arrive soon for my Nokia 920 and solve this problem.................................................................</p>
<p>(and maybe even it could&nbsp;improve the calendar, so that we can actually read somthing on the month view and/or week view)</p>

<p>Hi Deepak,</p>
<p>If you mean you have downloaded the preview from <a href="https://preview.onedrive.com/sync/setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://preview.onedrive.com/sync/setup.html</a> , I’d like to know more details about the situation. Otherwise, we recommend you install this newly released version.</p>
<p>1. Does your Mac meet the system requirement? For Mac, we will support Mac OS X 10.9 and higher.<br />
2. Have you removed all other versions of OneDrive from your Mac?<br />
3. Have you configured the preview client according to the <strong>OneDrive for Business Mac Configuration Guide</strong>?<br />
4. Could you show us the detailed steps before the crash? What’s the error message when crashing?</p>
<p>Related screenshots are highly appreciated. To upload screenshots, you can click
<strong>Use rich formatting</strong> at the bottom and then click the icon of <strong>
Insert Media</strong>.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Echo</p>

<p>I have received your private message but I cannot find the domain name “el***u.com.au” verified in Office 365 for Business. I can only find the domain name “el***u.com” at the backend and already verified the other tenant information.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the tenant information in PM, I have released tenant IP not accepting traffic issue at the backend. It may need up to 24 hours to take effect. Please keep checking it and feel free to post back in the forum if the issue persists
 after 24 hours. </p>

<h2>            Re&#58; Figure Captions - Two Ways to Insert Captions - Differences&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings All - </p>
<p>My question is in regard to inserting Figure captions in MS Word 2013. </p>
<p>In my office, documents go through several sets of hands and eyes prior to submission.
</p>
<p>This can sometimes result in odd things happening to the documents, including figure captions that start to "float".</p>
<p>
</p><p>My immediate supervisors have reached the conclusion that Figure captions are more stable when inserted via the references tool bar,
</p>
<p>rather than right clicking on the figure and using insert caption from there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now going through a process of clearing the formatting on hundreds of Figure captions, deleting them, and then re-inserting them using the "Reference" tool bar icon, rather than the right click and insert caption method which I had initially used.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF this makes the documents more stable, I am willing to do it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>That said, I do question whether this instruction, which will take hours if not days of work, is actually based on real differences between the two methods of inserting captions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is not, can someone suggest another way to prevent the "floating captions" issues that sometimes occur when I get my documents back?
</p>
<p>I have been roundly criticized for documents that look perfect on my screen, but terrible on those of reviewers.
</p>
<p>There was a history of that problem being due to differences in MS Word versions, I was unfortunate in that my MS Word was updated before that of others in my office. Then when theirs was updated, I had compatibility mode checked, and they did not., which
 also caused problems. </p>
<p>At this point, I believe all of us are using the same version of MS Word, with the same compatibility mode settings, but the problem of captions that start to "float" after passing through multiple hands remains.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>The reverse of your supervisors conclusion is actually the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you right click on the figure and select Insert Caption, if you select Below the figure, the paragraph that contains the figure will be formatted to be kept with the next paragraph, which will be the one containing the caption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you select for the caption to be placed above the figure, the paragraph is inserted above the figure to contain the caption and that paragraph is formatted to be kept with the next paragraph, which is the one that contains the figure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you insert the caption via the References tab, it is necessary for the user to apply the required paragraph formatting to keep the paragraphs containing the figure and that containing the caption together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above is all based on the figure itself being inserted inline with text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to be able to drag the figure and its caption about in the document, the best thing to do is to insert the figure and its caption into a one cell table for which you uncheck the allow row to break across pages, and then to drag that table to
 the required location.&nbsp; It then doesn't matter which method you use to insert the caption.&nbsp; You can remove the borders of the table by using Ctrl+Alt+u.</p>

<h2>            USB device not recognized in Lumia 640XL</h2>
                    <p>I have lumia 640 xl with windows 10 OS build:10.0.10586.164. I have windows 7 in my PC, when i plug in USB cable and attached my mobile with desktop PC the system says Usb device not recognized. Then, I had googled this problem and it says that you have
 to download and install a software name <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-pk/how-to/wp8/basics/sync-my-windows-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Phone Desktop App</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After installing this program, I opened and and attached my cell phone with usb, mobile sounds looks that it but the Program that i have downloaded say that a phone is not attached with the software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other OS are very easy to use when we attach the usb with those phones they give many options whether you want to transfer files or any other work. But I dont know why this happens with Microsoft Lumia.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the problem.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/235eb977-c617-44bd-9814-c0be9eff48f0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/235eb977-c617-44bd-9814-c0be9eff48f0" /></a></p>
<p>I hope that my issue will solve soon and i will listen from you a positive response.</p>
<p>Thanks for your anticipation.</p>

<h2>            Locking a picture into place - EXCEL</h2>
                    <p>I have office 13.</p>
<p>I am a noob.</p>
<p>Here is the problem.</p>
<p>I am making a worksheet for may pals. A tracker of sorts. I have managed to make dropdowns and such. I have a sheet where everything is recorded, aka, raw data. This is just the beggining.</p>
<p>I am planning to LOCK TOP and BOTTOM ROWS so that we can only see where we need to input the data. All in all there are just only THREE ROW Visible. LOCKED TOP and BOTTOM ROWS and a MOVABLE MIDDLE ROW, which we can scroll up or down.</p>
<p>However, I can only LOCK the TOP ROW. And reading on forums LOCKING SEPARATE ROWS is IMPOSSIBLE.</p>
<p>So, now what I am planning is to LOCK AN IMAGE into place so that the MIDDLE ROW is the ONLY PLACE where we can input the data.</p>
<p>Also, I want it to be that even though those ROWS are only visble. I have tried PAGE BREAK REVIEW and it looked like it work, however, I cannot see the rows beneath the 3rd row? Confusing? It is so hard to explain.</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>• How to lock an image into place so that even the Worksheet is SCROLLED DOWN/UP it stays in place. STUCK in VIEW of sorts that it is not attached to any cells of sorts.</p>
<p>• Any way that we can only see THREE ROWS at a time and if we SCROLL DOWN/UP it still stays THREE ROWS? I am looking at tmeplates and seems nothing is there to answer it. :(</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Only 3 Rows are visible everytime, even when scrolling up or down it is still 3 rows. Like a TYPEWRITER. Only one line is visible even though your move the paper up or down. :P</p>
<p>• One picture on top is locked even when scrolling up or down it stays on top, like floating.</p>
<p>• One picture at the bottom is locked when scrolling up or down it stay at the bottom, like floating.</p>

            Please repost your question selecting Excel as the program of interest, rather than Microsoft Office Access; you'll get some real Excel experts answering. Access is quite a different program.

            <p>In the Print dialog, under Zoom: Pages per sheet, choose "2 pages." This will reduce your A4 page to A5 size and print two pages side-by-side on a landscape A4 sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You must do this every time you print; in future, you might want to use the "2 pages per sheet" option under "Multiple pages" on the Margins tab of Page Setup, which allows you to create A5 pages to begin with; they will also print two-up on a landscape
 A4 sheet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that if you want to print a single page twice on a sheet, you must enter the page number twice in the "Pages" box (for example,"1,1" ).</p>

<p>We have two staff members that had their Office 365 passwords expire.&nbsp; We performed a password reset, forcing them to change the password upon login.&nbsp; They can now go online just fine but when they open an Excel spreadsheet or Word document they are being
 challenged to "we want to make sure who you are"? and it is not recognizing their new password.</p>
<p>They are also unable to open a file in OneDrive and edit it in the client application.&nbsp; Editing in Excel online works fine but if they try to open it in Excel desktop&nbsp;client, they get the above issues.</p>

<p>Hi Bill,<br />
<br />
To further investigate the issue, I'd like to confirm the following information:<br />
1. Try signing out of Excel, Word, etc. first and log in again with the account to check the result.<br />
2. Try resetting the password again and see the outcome.<br />
<br />
Moreover, please provide some screenshots about "new password not being recognized by Excel, Word, etc."<br />
<br />

<h2>            Cannot login to Lync... Bis</h2>
                    <p>Hello there</p>
<p>I read this discussion: "cannot login to Lync" and I would have been really pleased to know how the person solved it...</p>
<p>I have exactly the same issue. I tried everything described in the different posts, reinstalled several times, no success.</p>
<p>I am able to connect to my account with a Lync windows client, I am even able to connect from my iPhone but no success from my Mac.</p>
<p>Office is up to date, Lync is up to date (14.3.3), Mac Os is up to date (10.11.4)</p>
<p>My company deployed office 365 end of last year, I was one of the first trying it and Lync for Mac was working up to &nbsp;2 weeks ago.</p>
<p>What could have happened ? I had to change my password in AD (company policy). And I think I got a Lync update at the same time. But since at least the password change I am no more able to connect (with the new password of course). &nbsp;successful connection
 from PC and iphone are witth the new password of course. no pb to connect to office 365 online, with outlook, ... from my Mac.</p>
<p>I have the same issues than those mentioned, "service unavailable or not connected to Internet". Of course I am connected (regular skype working).</p>
<p>logs show:</p>

<p>Hi Pascal,</p>
<p>To better understand the situation. I need to confirm some information:</p>
<p>1. Refer to this <a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/I-can-t-sign-in-to-Lync-3CDA8A29-2ACE-4AE1-AC19-68BEEC6B8E0D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> and see all the settings are correct.<br />
2. If you try the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2629861#bookmark-signin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
manually configuration</a>, does the issue persist?<br />
3. About “I had to change my password in AD (company policy)”, may I know if you’re using pure Skype for Business Online, Skype for Business on-premises or hybrid environment?<br />
4. If you change the password again, may I know if there are any improvements?<br />
5. In which procedure did you encounter the error message?<br />
6. Try clearing cached data and corrupted certificates in Lync to check if there is any improvement.</p>
<p>First, delete the following folders:<br />
<strong>Users/Home Folder/Library/Caches/com.microsoft.Lync</strong><br />
<strong>Users/Home Folder/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Microsoft Lync History</strong><br />
Then, delete any corrupted or cached certificates. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
(1). Open the Keychain Access certificate management utility. To do this, in Finder, click
<strong>Applications</strong>, click <strong>Utilities</strong>, and then click <strong>
Keychain Access</strong>. Or, search for Keychain Access by using Spotlight.<br />
(2). In the left pane, click <strong>login</strong>, and then click <strong>Certificates</strong>.<br />
(3). In the right pane, find a certificate that's named <strong>Unknown</strong> or
<strong>Communications Server</strong>, select it, and then delete it.<br />
<strong>Note</strong> You may have to unlock your keychain by using your password.<br />
(4). Close Keychain Access.<br />
(5). Restart Lync for Mac.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, let us know and we will further assist you.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />
Aaron</p>

    <title>Document version history - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevin abraham  say:</h3>
<h2>            Document version history</h2>
                    I am a teacher that uses electronic documents. These documents are stored as individual files (not SharePoint) and I was wondering if I can look back in the document history beyond the File&gt;info data that shows who created the document and who was the
 last person that saved it? What I want to see is if someone completed the document then gave it to someone else and then they saved when they put their name on the front of it, then sent it in to be marked as their own work.

            Hi Kevin,
<br />You would need to use tracking or save the file to onedrive, which would allow you to see older versions.

<p>Definitely maybe ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you are talking about is "file forensics".&nbsp; Digging in to the history of the file to see what secrets you can uncover. Reporters, and lawyers, etc are constantly finding "inconvenient truths" buried inside files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It depends on where the file is saved. And it depends on the people involved. If they are smart, they can defeat the file history.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is saved entirely in OneDrive, there is a fairly full file history. But if it is created in one persons's OneDrive, then copied over to another person's OneDrive then copied over to you, that history is broken.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A key clue are the timestamps on the file. There are create/modified timestamps inside the file, in file info, but there can also be different ones save outside of the document. Word has a total time edited file property. Is the total editing time improbably
 large, maybe the file has been handed down over a number of years. This article gives you some clues of what to look for and how to analyze what you find:</p>

<span>As a Forensic Investigator it is crucial that any investigation of a case is thorough and done to the best of an individual’s ability. In the interest of time there can be a temptation to delve deep enough to find the required evidence, report
 it, then move on to the next case. People may, in fact, be under very real pressure to do this. Sometimes doing such things can cause problems for a case in the future when another expert potentially reviews and comments on your own findings.</span></p>

<span>&nbsp;</span>1:35pm<br />
</span><span>Microsoft Office, the product that includes Microsoft Word, is being used by over 1.2 billion people in 140 countries, according to Microsoft’s website<br />
When the origin of a document is a mystery or in dispute, there are several ways that forensic document investigators can use information from Microsoft Word to piece together a document’s “life story.” This week I spoke with digital forensics investigator
 Greg Kelley from Vestige Digital Investigations about the inner workings of Microsoft Word and how data from Word can be analyzed by law enforcement and others wanting to get to the bottom of a document’s digital history.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>One really good place to look is any images embedded in the document. If they are taken with a camera / smartphone, there is often a lot of "XIF" information embedded in the photo itself. There are tools to clear this info, but if it is not cleared there
 can be a lot of useful info. Specific info about the camera used to take the picture, including camera settings, "geotags" identifying the exact location and time the picture was taken.&nbsp; Maybe details in the photo contradict the description in the document,
 such as when and where the picture was taken. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are tools you can use to analyse the language used in the document. Writers have "fingerprints", specific phrases, word use and so on that carries over between documents. These tools are often used search for content that has been copied from the internet,
 either as unattributed content or whole papers from "paper mills". </p>

Microsoft Office documents typically contain a great amount of metadata, some of which can be instrumental in computer forensics. While e-Discovery and computer forensics software can handle extracting and displaying most of the metadata, I found that a crucial
 piece of information is usually not extracted: Microsoft Word last 10 authors — also known as Word save history.</span></p>

DOCX is the file format for Microsoft Office 2007 and later. <span>&nbsp;</span>DOCX should not be confused with DOC, the format used by earlier versions of Microsoft Office.
<br />
DOCX is written in an XML format, which consists of a </span><span><a href="https://forensicswiki.org/wiki/ZIP_archive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="ZIP archive"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">ZIP archive</span></a>

<br />
<strong>Metadata information are usually stored in the folder docProps. Two or more XML files are stored inside that folder, app.xml that stores metadata information extracted from the Word application itself and core.xml that stores metadata from the document
 itself, such as the author name, last time it was printed, etc.</strong></span></p>

    <title>upgrading from Office 2010 64 bit to Office 2013 32 bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sinecure99  say:</h3>
<h2>            upgrading from Office 2010 64 bit to Office 2013 32 bit</h2>
                    <p>When I installed Office 2010 on my desktop in Win 7 &nbsp;I inadvertently installed the 64 bit version and have been using it for some months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just bought a Win8 laptop and taken the 30 day trial of Office 2013 365 and it is 32 bit. I have decided I should activate the 365 (pay for it) on both&nbsp;the laptop and the desktop&nbsp;so that means installing it on the desktop.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am afraid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dealing with the desktop (the laptop seems fine)&nbsp;- If I completely uninstall the 64 bit version and then install the 32 bit-365 (still in Win 7) what happens to the most important thing of all - my full Outlook record - the pst. Can I import it or will the
 program import a saved version of it - or some version of it. Even though the pst was made on a 64 bit platform will the new Office be OK with it and on my Win 7 desktop. I am not worried about my other Office program files (Word, etc.) as they are well backed
 up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I am going to lose any of my Outlook emails and address book then there is no way I can go with Office 2013.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advise someone. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thanks for this and I am starting to feel better but a bit unclear on some points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to get main stream so I will want to install the 32 bit version of 2013 on the desktop.</p>
<p>1) Do I uninstall the 2010 64 bit version fully first?</p>
<p>2) If not - when should I or do I have to?</p>
<p>3) If I do uninstall 2010 first will 2013 still be able to find the pst file or should I save it somewhere on my data drive and import it somehow. And since I am not yet familiar with 2013 does it clearly have a provision for importing a pst.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note I have spoken to some friends on this and they are equally confused so maybe the issue needs more careful addressing.</p>

            <p>I have installed Office 2013 32 bit on several of our laptops at work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are running Windows 8 64 bit on all of them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I highly recommend that you completely uninstall any and all previous versions of Office before attempting to install the new one, especially if you are moving from a 32bt to 64bit version, or you will come across a message stating that you cannot continue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will save you time, headaches and much frustration.&nbsp; Make sure that you backup your Outlook.pst file on a USB thumb drive, as well, because it will be located in a totally different location once 2013 is installed.&nbsp; (In the User/Documents folder) Thus
 you will be at a loss to find what you need and add it back in.&nbsp; Of course we don't use Outlook without an IMAP account so there is always a backup, anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck</p>

            I want to urge caution here when messing with Outlook pst files.&nbsp; When I imported a pst file recently I lost all my contacts in the Address Book and had to manually add all the contacts one at a time ... very time consuming and irritating.&nbsp; Just not enough
 cautions listed when importing pst's.<br />

            <p>You don't Import any pst file, you simply open it in outlook, or set the old pst as the default during the outlook setup.</p>
<p>And since the address book is simply a filtered view of Contacts that have an electronic address, then those Contacts are contained within the pst file</p>

            <p>Are these values in a text field? If yes, you simply run an Update statement: create a new query, select the table, switch&nbsp;the Query Type&nbsp;to an Update query, and drag the field to the grid. In the Update To line, write "dup" &amp; [customerID]</p>

            <p>Thanks Tom.. I tried these steps but it does not seem to&nbsp;prefix the values with "dup". I am not getting any errors when I run it but the value has not changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes the field is text and the domain values are alpha numeric.</p>
<p>I have different versions of the same access file and each version will have different suffixes (for e.g. dup, run1, run2...etc)&nbsp;added to the customerID&nbsp;based on an analysis I am doing. I basically use this file to&nbsp;run it through a vendor&nbsp;application and
 I can track a run based on a&nbsp;RunID.&nbsp;In order to not&nbsp;have a conflict with customer ID already strored in the application from the previous run(customer ID with prefix as "dup)"&nbsp;I had to do this approach. The prefix lets me tell from which run the customer ID
 is associated with.</p>
<p>for e.g. </p>
<p>version 1 - "dup"</p>
<p>version 2 - "run1"</p>
<p>version 3 - "run2"</p>
<p>etc....</p>
