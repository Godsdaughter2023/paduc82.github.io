            Hi<br />
<br />
There is No info about your system and the hardware involved.<br />
<br />
<br />
Assuming that the Router's Wireless is configured correctly that there is a strong signal and the Wireless card on the Computer is<strong> physically on.</strong>
<p><strong>Maybe this can Help.</strong></p>
<p>Go over these steps and tell us where the breaking point is.</p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wireless card entry.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a></p>
<p>If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wireless card's Drivers.</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Wireless Network Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a></p>
<p><br />
------------------</p>
<p>Many Wireless cards' drivers also install the vendor's Wireless utility.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure that if there is a vendor's Wireless Utility is Not Running together with the Windows native Wireless utility</strong> (WLAN Service) .</p>
<p>----------------</p>
<p>Make sure that No Firewall is preventing/blocking the Wireless components to get to the Network.</p>
<p><em><strong>Some 3rd party Software Firewalls/AV/Security suit,s keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled).</strong></em></p>
<p>If possible configure the Firewall /Security suit correctly, otherwise totally uninstall it, and get rid of its residual processes to allow clean flow of local network traffic.</p>
<p>If the 3rd party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>
<p>3rd party Network mangers like Bonjour, and NetMagic can block local traffic too.</p>
<p>---------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Working TCP/IP stack should look this way.</strong></p>
<p>Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/status-nic.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/status-nic.jpg</a></p>
<p>Description is the card manufacturing data.</p>
<p>Physical address is the card's MAC number.</p>
<p>The xx should be a number from 0 to 255 (all xx same number).</p>
<p>yy should be from 0 to 255</p>
<p>zz should be from 0 to 255 (all zz the same number.</p>
<p>The lease date should be valid to the current time.</p>
<p><strong>*Note 1. IP that starts with 169.xxx.xxx.xxx is not valid functional IP.</strong></p>
*Note 2. There might be an IPv6 entries too. However, they are not functional for Internet traffic or LAN. They are needed for Win 7 special HomeGroup configuration.
<p>---------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>A message in the Wireless little Window that says Connected does not means that your are really have a valid functional connection.</strong></p>
<p>If everything above is OK you have to be able to connect to the Router.</p>
<p><strong>Connecting to the Router means that you can enter the Router's core IP into an address bar of a browse, be able to connect, see, and configure the Router's menus.</strong></p>
<p>If it does not connecting to the Router, log from any computer that can connect to Wireless Router with a Wire, disable the Wireless Security, make sure that the Wireless broadcast SSID is On,&nbsp; and try to connect with No Wireless security.</p>
<p><strong>Enable the Wireless security after you mange to establish a functional connection.</strong></p>

            <p>Hi </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply had already done all this sorry, did not fix problem. I have an</p>
<p>ACER aspire running windows 7, HUAWEI 3g mobile broadband card, Atheros wireless network card AR5005gs. If I plug the moble broadband into laptop have exactly the same problem, when I connect to wireless lan I can not connect to internet even though when
 I plug in broadband stick it is recognised and I get a IP address from the internet 220.xx.xx.xx all valid and if I turn off my conection to the wireless lan I can instantly connect to the internet. I have no problems connecting to my wireless router when
 the mobile broadband is turned off and I can see both my laptop and pc on the network.</p>

    <title>Smart Card Logon Testing is failing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcos1979  say:</h3>
<h2>            Smart Card Logon Testing is failing</h2>
                    <p>Hello, we are currently in the process of testing user log-ins via smart card authentication on a closed network and we have had no success logging on with our smart cards on test workstations.&nbsp; We've received the domain controller certificates from an external
 domain, along with two root CA certs and two intermediate certs.&nbsp; The workstations output an error of:&nbsp; "The system could not log you on.&nbsp; You cannot use a smart card to logon because smart card log on is not supported for your user account(Windows 7)" or
 "The system could not log you on.&nbsp; The server authenticating you reported and error (0xC00000BB).&nbsp; You can find further details in the event log.&nbsp; Please report this error the system administrator (Windows XP)".&nbsp; There are no useful errors to review from the
 workstation event logs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the domain controllers, the following errors appear in the System logs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>EVENT ID 19:&nbsp; Source:&nbsp; Kerberos-Key-Distribution-Center&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This event indicates an attempt was made to use smartcard logon, but the KDC is unable to use PKINIT protocol because it is missing a suitable certificate</p>
<p>
</p><p>EVENT ID 29:&nbsp; Source:&nbsp; Kerberos-Key-Distribution-Center&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Key Distribution Center (KDC) cannot find a suitable certificate to use for smart card logons, or the KDC certificate could not be verified.&nbsp; Smart card logon may not function correctly if this
 problem is not resolved.&nbsp; To correct this problem, either verify the existing KDC certificate using certutil.exe or enroll for a new KDC certificate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the item i've checked/verified so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; Opened up ther Certificates.mmc snap-in and verified (under the Computer account)&nbsp;the DC certificate is located in the "Personal" certificates, the Root CA certificates are located in the "Trusted Root Certification Authorities", and the intermediate/subordinate
 certs are located with the "Intermediate Certification Authorities" folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>2)&nbsp; Modified the Default Domain Policy and ensured the certificates were imported to their respective folders as well.&nbsp; Ran a gpupdate /force on my test workstation and verified the policy works and the certs were loaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Ran certutil -viewstore -enterprise NTAuth and verified the certificates were published.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4)&nbsp; Copied the DC cert to my workstation and ran from command prompt the following command:&nbsp; certutil -verify -URLFetch DC.cer</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The common results were:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Element.dwInfoStatus = CERT_TRUST_HAS_KEY_MATCH_ISSUER (0x2)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Element.dwInfoStatus = CERT_TRUST_HAS_PREFERRED_ISSUER&nbsp; (0x100)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Element.dwErrorStatus = CERT_TRUST_REVOCATION_STATUS_UNKNOWN (0x40)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Element.dwErrorStatus = CERT_TRUST_IS_OFFLINE_REVOCATION (0x10000000)</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>6)&nbsp; From my regular user account, I am able to verify that the CDP URLs are correct and can download the CRLs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope I provided enough detail.&nbsp; My colleagues and I are stumped as to what is preventing the revocation checks and going out to the CDP URLs which are valid, ultimately preventing us from logging on with our smart cards.&nbsp; Has anyone ever ran into this
 issue?&nbsp; Your help is appreciated in advance.</p>

<h2>            0&#37; Available &#40; Plugged in  , Charging &#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have an Hp Pavilion&nbsp; Windows 10 laptop&nbsp; that is almost 2&nbsp; years old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system has been off for sometime and not in use with the battery life low and now plugged in the notification bar has the battery icon not indicating&nbsp;that the battery is actually&nbsp;charging and when hovering over the battery icon It says, '0%
 available (plugged in, charging)'</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the power adaptor is removed from the power the battery appears to have no power available and the when plugged back in the power system does not actually recharge.</p>
<p>I have tried installing and re-installing that Microsoft ACPI -Compliant stuff then shutdown and start again but still the same thing.Battery starts charging for few minutes and it stops indicating&nbsp;<span>'0%
 available (plugged in, charging)'</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you think maybe the issue here with this system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Hi Florence.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Have you checked the HP website for your model or Serial number (on sticker) to see if it has known battery issues or a recall?
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Run the battery recalibration here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/172271/how-to-calibrate-your-laptops-battery-for-accurate-battery-life-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/172271/how-to-calibra...</a>
<br />
<br />Then generate a battery report and post it back here:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/generate-battery-report-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/generate-batte...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click Start to open Device Manager, under Battery choose the battery device, then Driver tab, then if available Roll Back the driver.  If not available, choose Uninstall Driver, restart PC to reinstall. 
<br />
<br />You can also try a System Restore to a point before this occurred:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows Media Player won&#39;t open in Windows 7</h2>
                    I have tried all the suggestions that Shekhar S from Microsoft posted regarding Windows Media Player not working (including the clean reboot, uninstalling-reinstalling) and it still doesn't work. I just bought s new laptop with Windows 7 and WMP won't
 open at all. I finally got fed up and downloaded another media player from the internet. If Microsoft gets this figured out I'd like to know.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:<br />
</span></b><span><span>I would suggest you to first check if Windows Media Player Network Sharing services are running. If not, then start the service and then check
 if you are able to open Windows media player successfully.<b><br />
</b>a. Click Start, type services.msc in the search box and press Enter.<br />
b. Search for the service: Windows Media player Network Sharing service.<br />
c. If it is not started, right click the service and click Start.<b><br />
<br />
Method 2:</b><br />
I would suggest you<span>&nbsp; </span>to re-register wmp.dll from an elevated command prompt and check if you are able to open.<br />
a Click Start, type cmd.exe in the search box and right click that and Run as administrator.<br />
b. In command prompt window, type regsvr32&lt;space&gt; wmp.dll.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;<b>Method 3:</b><br />
I would suggest you to open &nbsp;Windows Media Player in&nbsp;a new user account. You can refer the link:<br />

            Hi,<br />
Thanks for your response. actually, I read that someone else with the same problem resolved the issue when they uninstalled McAfee. I had been trying to uninstall the preinstalled version of McAfee that came with my computer because I prefer AVG. I had some
 difficulty, but when I finally managed to get rid of McAfee, Media Player worked instantly. Microsoft should look into this.<br />
Regards,<br />
Rita<br />

<h2>            administrator password works for login but not in standard user account when prompt for confirmation</h2>
                    I have an administrative account with a password. This password works when I log in to my adminstrator account. But when I login to a standard account and try to change things it prompts for my administrator password. I type in the same password but it
 won't accept it. I have no clue what the problem is. I am a novice to this account setting business so if anyone has a solution please let it be in plain English with as much details as possible. Thank you kindly.

    <title>Errors in adding ipp printing in Vista Business 32bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neviom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Errors in adding ipp printing in Vista Business 32bit</h2>
                    
<p>Windows Vista Business 32bit.<br />
I been attempting to add 2 Brother printers (MFC9880 &amp; MFC8860DN) for IPP printing to various notebooks which use Windows XP Pro, Home and Vista Business 32bit; these are PCs for our reps in the field who need to print selectively to either of the 2 printers
 in our office.<br />
I have been successful installing both printers to the Windows XP PCs but only the MFC8860DN in the Vista PCs.<br />
The command in the Add Printer functions for the MFC9880 is: "http://ip_address:ipp_port/ipp" where the ip_address is the DNSDYN address (then translated in our router to the internal fixed&nbsp;ip_address of the printer,
 the ip_port is 8019 redirected to port 631 in our router.<br />
Vista returns the following error "Windows can not connect to the printer. Operation could not be completed (error 0x00002ef3)". The same command works fine in XP and also to add the other printer (MFC8860DN) in Vista Business.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help<br />
<br />
Nevio</p>

<h2>            problems with 2d shooters like Axiom Verge</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem regarding video games like Minecraft/2d side scrollers on my laptop with W10. I use WASD, to move, space to jump. and E to fire. Well, if I hold W+D (aim up to the to right, or move forward to the right), and then E to fire/bring up my inventory
 in MC, nothing happens. Yet, if I rebind fire to anything besides E, no problems. This is the weird part. I get the same issue in: Minecraft, AM2R (Another Metroid 2 Remake), and Axiom Verge on Steam, and even weirder, it works with my usb keyboard, not my
 laptop's on board one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trouble Shooting I tried with same result:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- ran AM2R with a friend's laptop</p>
<p>-tried a different usb keyboard,</p>
<p>-ran updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>Through this reasoning, I believe something with MS' newest update is screwing up my key bindings. Can anyone try and replicate these problems and help me out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Guys :)&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Excel shutting down constantly</h2>
                    <p>Hi, among the many, many problems I've had since I installed this operating system, the most recent and daunting is that my Excel shuts down constantly</p>
<p>The screen goes gray (something I'm painfully used to with this atrocious O/S), and a window pops open saying that Excel has stopped working and that Windows (so nice of it) is looking for a solution. It then brings the workbook up with its version prior
 to the last save. This is happening constantly. Any ideas? Thanks</p>
<p>John</p>

            I don't mean to question your status as a community star, but I seriously doubt this is an Excel problem per se; I'm not asking how to work formulas or do exotic calculations. When a program itself shuts down every three minutes, one is inclined to think
 it is the operating system

            <p>Event Viewer Reports</p>
<p>1. Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution. Most system
 related errors are logged and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding the reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</p>
<p>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes System is
 by far the most important.</p>
<p>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window
 select Windows Logs and System. Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Column Header to sort. You may need to click a second
 time to see the latest Report at the top. </p>
<p>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Click on the Copy button
 to place a copy on your Clipboard and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</p>
<p>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports that offer the
 best information but occasionally Warning Reports provide useful clues. </p>
<p>6. All reports have date and time stamps and when troubleshooting it is important to concentrate on more recent reports. Study reports
 since the point when the computer was last booted and then check whether a similar report appeared in the previous session. If errors do not repeat investigation as to why they occurred is wasted effort.</p>
<p>7. Within individual reports the more important information is Event ID and Source as these help when looking for help on the internet.
 The description is equally important and copying the exact text for use as the search criteria greatly helps getting better results when using Google. Do not paraphrase descriptions when asking others for help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>Results verified by WinDBG, DumpCHK, and BlueScreenView.<br />
</strong><br />
There were 6 different Bug_Checks 0A (2), 1A (2), 50, C5, D1 (2), and 101.<br />
<br />
Some of the Bug_Check CAUSE were Windows components which means something <br />
else drove them into Fault.<br />
<br />
These are just a few of them :<br />
<br />
BugCheck D1, {0, 2, 8, 0}<br />
Probably caused by : dxgkrnl.sys ( dxgkrnl!VIDSCH_EXPORT::VidSchDdiNotifyDpc+11 )<br />
MODULE_NAME: dxgkrnl<br />
IMAGE_NAME:&nbsp; dxgkrnl.sys&nbsp; (See ATI below)<br />
<br />
PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (50)<br />
SYMBOL_NAME:&nbsp; dxgmms1!VIDMM_GLOBAL::TerminateOneAllocation+57<br />
MODULE_NAME: dxgmms1<br />
IMAGE_NAME:&nbsp; dxgmms1.sys&nbsp;&nbsp; (see ATI below)<br />
FAILURE_BUCKET_ID:&nbsp; 0x50_dxgmms1!VIDMM_GLOBAL::TerminateOneAllocation+57<br />
BUCKET_ID:&nbsp; 0x50_dxgmms1!VIDMM_GLOBAL::TerminateOneAllocation+57<br />
<br />
BugCheck A, {bb4004, 2, 1, 82c76b95}<br />
Probably caused by : memory_corruption ( nt!MiGetWorkingSetInfoList+7d9 )<br />
IMAGE_NAME:&nbsp; memory_corruption<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
That is a lot of different Bug_Check so the 1st thing to do is update the <strong>
BIOS</strong>, <strong>low level<br />
chipset drivers</strong>, and<strong> other</strong> <strong>major on-board</strong> and
<strong>separate device drivers</strong>. Many of the<br />
drivers seem to have been updated recently however double check them all using the<br />
manual methods in the previous message above.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Remove ALL power and remove and reseat the cards, memory, and cables (on both<br />
ends when possible)&nbsp;- actually remove and replace - do not just snug. <br />
<br />
<strong>2A.</strong> As indicated it is very important to update the system.<br />
<br />
BiosReleaseDate = 04/21/2010&nbsp; &lt;-- chipset is probably this old (there may be no updated<br />
to BIOS and chipset however you need to check)<br />
SystemManufacturer = BIOSTAR Group<br />
SystemProductName = A780LE<br />
<br />
BIOSTAR<br />
<a href="http://www.biostar-usa.com/app/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.biostar-usa.com/app/en-us/</a><br />
<br />
<strong>2B.</strong> ATI video driver - 4/19/2011 - this is very current however there have been issues with
<br />
this driver&nbsp; so check with ATI Support, their on-line drivers, and ask in the ATI Forums. There<br />
may be newer drivers however you may need to revert to an older model.<br />

--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Think Video drivers mainly though it can be others. See the driver section in my generic bluescreen<br />
troubleshooting methods below. BIOS, low level chipset drivers and antivirus/antispyway/security<br />
programs can also cause this. Check the troubleshooter and when you get to the driver and memory testing sections refer to the generic methods in next message and then return to the troubleshooter<br />
if needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high.</p>
<p>This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.</p>
<p>If the first parameter has the same value as the fourth parameter, and the third parameter indicates an execute operation, this bug check was likely caused by a driver that was trying to execute code when the code itself was paged out. Possible causes for
 the page fault include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The function was marked as pageable and was running at an elevated IRQL (which includes obtaining a lock).
</li><li>The function call was made to a function in another driver, and that driver was unloaded.
</li><li>The function was called by using a function pointer that was an invalid pointer.</li></ul>

<br />
<strong>BCCode: 101&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000101<br />
<br />
</strong>Bug Check 0x101: CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT</p>
<p>The CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT bug check has a value of 0x00000101. This indicates that an expected clock interrupt on a secondary processor, in a multi-processor system, was not received within the allocated interval.</p>
<p>Important Information If You Have Received a STOP Code </p>
<p>If you have received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer,
 call the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact information for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Contact
 Support</span></a>.</p>
<p>If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</span></a>.</p>
<p>The following actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors. </li></ol>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p>The specified processor is not processing interrupts. Typically, this occurs when the processor is nonresponsive or is deadlocked.</p>

<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050<br />
<br />
References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before these started? (Check<br />
Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there about the time this started)<br />
Main likely culprits are Video driver, other major drivers, memory, and antivirus/antispyware/security<br />
products could be at fault as well as drive issues.<br />
<br />
Use the troubleshooter below and refer to the next message for drivers and memory when you get to<br />
those sections and then return back to the troubleshooter as needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong><br />
<br />
The BCCode&nbsp;50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure<br />
of installed hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or
<br />
video RAM).</p>
<p>Another common cause is the installation of a faulty system service.</p>
<p>Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p><em>Resolving a faulty hardware problem:</em> If hardware has been added to the system recently,
<br />
remove it to see if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace
<br />
the faulty&nbsp;component. You should run hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer.
<br />
For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a faulty system service problem:</em> Disable the service and confirm that this
<br />
resolves the error. If so, contact the manufacturer of the system service about a possible
<br />
update. If the error occurs during system startup, restart your computer, and press F8 at
<br />
the character-mode menu that displays the operating system choices. At the resulting
<br />
Windows Advanced Options menu, choose theLast Known Good Configuration option. <br />
This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</p>
<p><em>Resolving an antivirus software problem: </em>Disable the program and confirm that this resolves
<br />
the error. If it does, contact the manufacturer of the program about a possible update.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a corrupted NTFS volume problem:</em>&nbsp; Run Chkdsk /f /r to detect and repair disk
<br />
errors. You must restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition. If
<br />
the hard disk is SCSI, check for problems between the SCSI controller and the disk.<br />
</p>
<p>Finally, check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help
<br />
pinpoint the device or driver that is causing the error. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS
<br />
might also resolve it.<br />

</strong>Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) -<br />
actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Make sure the vents are clear and that the<br />
fans are working. Even though the temp is OK do not assume heat can't affect the video,<br />
sound or other system functions it those get to hot. Try adding a small fan blowing into<br />
the vents as a test. (Those are mostly for a PC not a laptop.)<br />

<p>Drivers could be at fault however disk issues or antivirus/antispyware/security products are<br />
just as likely to be the root cause as they can force a driver to corrupt or go out of bounds.<br />
The video driver or something affecting it would be very suspect.<br />
<br />
Be sure the drivers, BIOS, and low level chipset driver are all updated by manually checking<br />
at the System maker and device makers's sites. <br />

<p>Bug Check 0xC5: DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL</p>
<div>
<p>The DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL bug check has a value of 0x000000C5. This indicates that the system attempted to access invalid memory at a process IRQL that was too high.</p>
Important Information If You Have Received a STOP Code
<p>If you have received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer,
 call the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support.

<strong>Cause</strong>
<p>The kernel attempted to access pageable memory (or perhaps completely invalid memory) when the IRQL was too high. The ultimate cause of this problem is almost certainly a driver that has corrupted the system pool.</p>
<p>In most cases, this bug check results if a driver corrupts a small allocation (less than PAGE_SIZE). Larger allocations result in<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff560239(v=VS.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>bug check 0xD0</span></strong></a>
 (DRIVER_CORRUPTED_MMPOOL).<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution</strong></p>
<p>If you have recently installed any new software, check to see if it is properly installed. Check for updated drivers on the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>To debug this error, use the special pool option of Driver Verifier. If this fails to reveal the driver that caused the error, use the Global Flags utility to enable the special pool by pool tag.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Task Scheduler Security Changes Vs Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Task Scheduler Security Changes Vs Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have a Windows 7 solution applied to 1000+ laptop computers that allows a standard user to call devcon.exe to remove a specific device (by device ID) and rescan device manager for new hardware, allowing them to resolve unspecified device/printer
 issues.&nbsp; For the users, all the have to do is click a shortcut on their desktop.&nbsp; Behind the scenes, the shortcut is calling a scheduled tasks running with SYSTEM permissions that calls a Windows Powershell script.&nbsp; The script calls devcon.exe to remove a
 specific printer by device ID and then rescans.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 7, scheduled tasks using accounts with elevated permissions can be used to allow standard users to complete administrative functions, when needed and designed by the administrator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're cutting over these computers to Windows 10 and it it appears that standard users can not see any of the tasks running with elevated permissions or with specific accounts (like SYSTEM), they therefore can't be called to run specific things designed
 by administrators. I can't find any other way to work around this issue for 1000+ users due to Windows 10 security changes.&nbsp; In this instance, I need standard users to be able to complete this function without having to call me or other administrators at all
 hours of the day and night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What options are there with Windows 10 for something like this?&nbsp; Was this an intentional move by Microsoft, or a bug?&nbsp; I'd really like to see this functionality restored, you're making managing computers very difficult...<br />

<h2>            Logitech Clicksmart 310 driver for Windows 7 &#63;</h2>
                    Looking for drivers for Logitech clicksmart 310 or Logitech quick cam.<br />
<br />
Viruses wiped out my XP computer. After days of trying to fix it, I just went out and bought a new computer with Window 7. The computer the was wiped out only ran a web cam and another camera through a tv card, FTPed them to a server for a web cam page. Windows
 7 won't run the TV card or any of the stack of web cams I have. Or the program that ftps them to the server. So after days of frustration and several hundred dollars I still can't do what I need to. Any help on these drivers would greatly be appreciated. Thanks

    <title>Ark Survival Evolved Console Commands for Xbox One on PC dedicated - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ptfobigby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ark Survival Evolved Console Commands for Xbox One on PC dedicated server not working&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using my PC to host a dedicated server for my friends and I, but play it through my Xbox One. I'm having an issue with the bloom and the light shafts and the sky quality causing issues with visuals due to their brightness. I've tried logging admin cheat
 commands for bloom quality and light shafts and the sky quality while in single player, and they work. I've been told that doing this in single player, then joining another server should carry these settings over, it is not doing this for me when I switch
 to my server. I've also tried using the admin cheat commands while in my dedicated server, before and after designating myself as an admin for the server, and nothing happens except the little chat box command showing that an admin command was attempted. I've
 tried it without "cheat" in front, I've tried it with "cheat" in front, and I've tried it with "admincheat" in front of these commands, still nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>How do I get these commands to work in my situation?
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Please don't just tell me to do any of the things I've listed above that I've already tried.</span></strong></p>

<p>Hi PTFOBigby&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know exactly what you're talking about. My friend and I recently got back into Ark and experienced the same thing. The commands did work at one point because that's what we did so I can verify that is correct. However it seems they've taken that luxury
 away and unfortunately we have yet to figure out how to correct the issue. It seems an in game problem and not so much an Xbox issue which we have yet to discover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck</p>

            Lame... Thanks for the reply. Hopefully they fix the issue since PC can just toggle it on their options menu from what I've seen. The bloom has ALWAYS been an issue in this game since they put it in, and it's ALWAYS been a complaint of everyone who plays
 yet they still keep the default setting to blindingly bright instead of what everyone wants, which is basically, no damn glare. Oh well... Maybe one day they'll fix it.... Ha... Ya right...

            If you haven't figured it out yet, place <em>admincheat</em> in front of the command, ie

            1. I just checked windows update, it says "Your device is up to date. Last checked: Today, 10:31 AM."<br />
<br />
2. I couldn't create a new account in the settings, so I made one online. I was able to add it under "other users." However, I was not able to change my local account with that new account.<br />
<br />
3. There is no error code. All is says is "Oops something went wrong. Whatever happened, it was probably our fault. Please try again."

<p>
</p><p>In this case it is best to perform Reset of the PC. Resetting lets you choose whether to keep your files or remove them, and then reinstalls Windows. Make sure to take a back up of all your files and documents before performing Reset. Follow the steps from
 the link below and refer to <strong>Reset your PC:</strong></p>

</p><p>Also I was wondering if the reset was successful, wouldn't I have to reinstall windows 10( my laptop came with windows 10 installed, but I'm not sure that it's the original windows). Thus, since the free download of Windows 10 is over, wouldn't I have to
 pay?</p>

    <title>Windows Store and Calculator suddenly not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Store and Calculator suddenly not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 in July. Initially everything was working fine. However, some time back, windows store suddenly became invisible from taskbar (but there is empty space on the taskbar to mark its absence). It is searchable through
 the start menu. But clicking on the application icon does not do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Few days back, same issue happened with calculator app as well. There is an empty space on taskbar instead of calculator icon. The app does not launch or throw any error whatsoever. It doesn't show up in the list of installed apps. But it is searchable through
 start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not found any solution on forums that resolves this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not able to identify what is the cause behind this issue. I do not have virus. Plus, I can not create another user account as that will completely mess up the ecosystem across various Microsoft services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no solution found yet, is there any acknowledgement from Windows 10 team about this issue? Is troubleshooting in progress? Can I check back after some time or at some different place to know when a solution is released? Losing calculator app
 is already creating problems in my daily office work and if this repeats with one of the core apps I have to use, I won't be able to work at all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am attaching screenshot of all three locations.</p>

            Mine is not working as well. It looks like the touch screen is inactivated after the computer goes into sleep mode and is not activated again. However I cannot find how to change this behavior. After rebooting everything works fine again.

            <p>I changed it back to the default and everything is working fine now. The only other option I changed was in the Samsung utility / power management setting I enabled the battery life extender. In control panel I used Balanced. When I first got it I changed
 how it went to sleep etc.. Once I changed it back I have not had the issue. Maybe if you change the power settings then reboot then change it back to default it will fix it. Its been working for days now with no issue.

 I uninstalled the on-board graphics driver and disable it on the BIOS before I installed the AGP card.<br />

What should I do? Is there a compatibility issue?

<p>Hey Ezkleen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out! Could you clarify what is going on exactly? I understand you are playing MW3 on both your Xbox One and Xbox 360 at the same time. Just so you know, when playing this game simultaneously, you will see different interactions since
 the game will be split into a Xbox 360 lobbies and Xbox One lobbies. Hope we hear back from you soon! :D&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Changed primary MS Account Alias &#38;amp&#59; Password, now I have - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark robitaille  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changed primary MS Account Alias &#38;amp&#59; Password, now I have auto sign-in issues on Xbox One and 360.</h2>
                    
<p>So I changed my MS Account's primary alias to my new Outlook address (from my old gmail that I don't use), and along with that I made a new secure password for the account. For some reason though, both my Xbox One and my Xbox 360 no longer auto sign me in
 anymore, and when I manually sign it it asks for my password every single time I try to. My password is really long, and typing it in constantly on the controller is quite possibly the most frustrating thing I've had to do in a while. I've checked every sign
 in setting on the Xbox One/360, but even with auto-sign in turned on, password saving on, and the security settings put to no barriers it still asks for it (and doesn't sign me in automatically). Also, on both Xboxes it strangely lists my old alias, my old
 gmail account, as my MS account's email. Note: I do not have any of these issues on the mobile Xbox apps, Skydrive, or my Windows 8 laptop.</p>
<p>I thought maybe removing the account and subsequently re-adding it to both Xboxes might help, but I'm worried I might lose saves or have to redownload hundreds of gigs of games. How do I fix these issues? :(</p>

<p>1. Xbox One:</p>
<p>You may remove your account from the One and then re-download it again. As all savegames are stored in the cloud they will not be lost. Same thing with the installed games and dlcs.
</p>
<p>2. XBox360:</p>
<p>Here the savegames are stored locally usually and would be lost if just removing your account. So I would suggest to clear the system cache as first step and see if this already fixes the problem. The cache can be cleared by going to system / storage. Choose
 the harddrive and then press Y for device options and clear the cache. If that doesn't help, you can move the savegames files to an USB stick or to the cloud. But this must be done for each savegame separately. Some games (like Forza) have some more account
 specific files which have to be saved, too. </p>
<p>Usually on the 360 it should not be an issue like you are experiencing, on the One is only working with removing the profile afaik.
