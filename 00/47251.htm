<p>3) disabling everything in msconfig and rerunning install</p>
<p>4) downloading the windows 8 drivers(starts but of course cant install due to os check)</p>
<p><span>5) I tried the c50 AMD patch but this didnt help</span></p>

<h2>            How to activate the 1 year subscribtion to office 365 without the original office app installed</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a surface 3 yesterday in Spain where I live and work. However I want my surface and all apps and programs&nbsp;in English. After a quick skim over some instructions on how to get office 365 in English I decided to uninstall the Spanish app, and reinstall
 it in English before activating the subscription. Big mistake it would seem since that app doesn't seem to be available to download. I now have office installed under a one month trial but I can't find a way to change this to the one year trial I got with
 the surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone provide some advice on how I can now activate the one year subscription to&nbsp;office 365?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks!</p>

            there should be an Office tile app - if you tap it and are signed in with your Microsoft Account you will get some options online. If you have an existing Office 365 Home sub, you should be able to take the 365 Personal and add 9 months to the existing
 subscription (as opposed to 12 months for Personal).

<p><strong><span>Hi, I'm trying to forward all my received faxes to my email address. I've set windows fax and scan to automatically send delivery receipts and include the fax as
 an attachment. I'm using windows live mail as my mail program.<br />
<br />
I can forward the fax as an email from within the fax but it doesn't do it automatically<br />
<br />
Can anyone shed some light on this?<br />

<p>The ability to do it automatically with Fax and Scan is not available.&nbsp; It must be done manually.</p>
<p>There are 3rd party software programs that do provide this functionality&nbsp; Here's one listing I found.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.freevistafiles.com/Fax-Tools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freevistafiles.com/Fax-Tools/</a> They don't all do it and most are shareware (meaning they
 cost money) but if you check and you're willing to pay you may find what you need.&nbsp; You use 3rd party software at your own risk - I do not know how it will interact with Vista or with the Fax and Scan Software already installed.&nbsp; It may work fine or it may
 cause a lot of problems or even delete some files so that some functions no longer operate properly (probably the fax and scanning function and/or your e-mail).&nbsp; The decision is yours.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 nightmare</h2>
                    <p>Terribly frustrating user unfriendly experience. </p>
<p>Alienware 17 running Windows 10 (came originally with Windows 7)<br />
My son uses it for university work too sometimes and I wanted to set it up to use it for business work. Recently signed up for Office 365 subscription.
</p>
<p>Logged in as one of the Admins.&nbsp; Was connected to the Internet through both WiFi and Ethernet. I turned off the WiFi. It went into Airplane mode. Used Ethernet alone for a day or two and tried to turn WiFi back on from the settings page. The slider
 would quickly turn back off saying it is in airplane mode. When I went to airplane mode settings I could not turn it off!&nbsp; I tried to go to the network adapters and ran a check for the Ethernet controller and the WiFi and turn it on and could not. I checked
 the modem and it worked fine. I ran a Windows diagnostic check on all network adapters. It said everything was fine,&nbsp; could not find a problem. It said it could not identify the problem. The only option left was to reset the network adapters. I thought I would
 give it a try. Now my PC is in a horrible state - after logging in it soon shows an error dialog box titled "TightVNC Control Interface" saying&nbsp; "Failed to initialize WindowsSocket".&nbsp; I&nbsp; closed the dialog box .<br />
Then it failed to load OneDrive and soon said something has gone wrong and&nbsp; the system would shut down in one minute! And then showed a few more dialog boxes.
<br />
The system then reboots and it is a repeating endless loop with the machine useless now!
<br />
I called Dell support first and they patiently went through over an hour with me on the phone, ran diagnostics and the machine is apparently fine. Windows apparently has to be reinstalled and apparently possibly the original Windows 7!! They have offered to
 send me a quote for Windows!!</p>
<p>Why can we not have a user friendly way to guide the user when needing to change settings?&nbsp; Why cannot Cortana step in and ask to guide if they have admin privilege?&nbsp; Or simply tell you cannot change if not admin?&nbsp; How come one can get the whole
 PC into an unusable state so easily doing what seems reasonable to a user??</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is particularly embarassing for me with my son since I used to work as a test engineer for Microsoft for a fair while in the 90s and talked up Microsoft and Windows over other alternatives to my son since he was a kid! Now Microsoft support,&nbsp;
 please help regain some pride and respect at least in your response and help fixing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft support please contact me and I&nbsp; can provide more details on my machine and snap shots and video of the bug reproduced with more error details .</p>

Hello together</div>
<div>@StaticRich: Thank you for the approach, this has help&nbsp; me to find the solution.</div>
<div><br />
1.&nbsp; Take Ownership of a File or Folder over C:\Program Files\WindowsApps include the subfolders for the Group "Administrators"</div>
<div>2. delete all C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.ZuneMusic_* folders</div>
<div>3. run powershell command as Administrator: get AppxPackage * zunemusic |. Remove AppxPackage</div>
<div><br />
4. open store and then reinstall Groove music</div>
<div>private Note: I think it's shameful of Microsoft to provide customers a so poorly designed app and offer&nbsp; no correct solution since November. Since November, I've been using spotify. But now i come back to groove music

up to the next error. We know MS, this&nbsp; will surely come :-)</div>

<h2>            How to save all the windows updates in external drive</h2>
                    Hi There .. <br />
<br />
Please advice me on how to preserve all the windows updates to a external drive. <br />
I am thinking of going for factory reset of my laptop, before I do that, I want to make sure I have all my windows updates over several years are retrieved to
<br />
a external drive.&nbsp; This way I can get back all my windows updates SP2, SP3, .Netframeworks and hundreds of updates ready.<br />
<br />
2. Please can you also tell me how to install those updates as well, I am not sure if they are .exe or .MSI.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
<br />

            <p>It seems the UNSECURE Edge has given my machine a virus when trying to download a TV show.</p>
<p>I have the new Real Times(Real Player) for Windows 10. So I thought I'd give it a go to see if it did indeed work in 10.</p>
<p>I clicked on what I wanted to watch and another tab opened because of the site.</p>
<p>I closed it immediately knowing this site has malware injected onto it's page either intentional or hijacked by hackers.My FAULT for sure,no doubt there and no one to blame but myself&nbsp;for curiosity and experimentation. :P It closed immediately no problem.However
 when I clicked to watch the actual show another tab opened. And&nbsp;CORTANA,went nuts and went into a loop of a warning: I may have been infected with a virus&nbsp;or malware;adware,I believe it was actually statement and to call a toll free number on the display that
 popped up.I did NOT call but the tab&nbsp;refused to close this time at all! I had to use the Task Manager in order to stop the process!!!Which worked fine. I did not restart nor shut down as asked until I had run whats next...</p>
<p>I immediately checked for any new intsalls,ran Windows Defender,SAS,Advanced System&nbsp;Care 8.4 Pro and Bytedefders free online scan in IE as well.Nothing showed,yet my computer is sluggish and is acting like I am indeed infected! :(</p>
<p>IF I reinstall or revert if my time isn't up can I reinstall 10 again for free.Is this a one time deal as I saw nothing that stated I would only get one free installation in the Agreement!</p>
<p>Yes I read the whole thing before allowing the install. ;)</p>
<p>If not;If I use a .iso for Windows 7,will it allow me to install 10 again as well?</p>
<p>I'm afraid to try the built in reinstaller and keep my files because I have no idea other than it may reside in System32s Hidden or unhidden&nbsp;Files! Perhaps my Files or even in Edge' files,as I have no clue as to where to actually look for said infection.If
 I am indeed infected.I may also just be having a "bad session" as I used my PC quite a bit today before this BS happened! :P I'll try clearing my cache on all browsers EDGE first then the 3 others and see if it helps,before resorting to drastic measures! lol
 ;)</p>
<p>Or will it indeed clean the infection if I do keep my files.Most are from when I had 7;which it clearly stated would not be installed to begin with! :/ I show Windows and Old Windows in File explorer!???And have my desktop and all files from 7 too.Except
 of course those which 10 does away with.</p>
<p>Once again the infection if I truly have one is in my 10 files,not in 7s.I have no ideas also if any of those were affected as well. I'd love to keep them insead of having to reinstall all my stuff once again,doing so takes 6-12 hours depending on what I
 get and if I use&nbsp;fdm.org or not.And a USB to help me keep the said 7&nbsp;files .exe files!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Help!!! I'm baffled at this point.Very little information on 10 out there yet!&nbsp;lol</p>

<h2>            EventID 9019 Desktop Windows Manager error</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I uninstalled Adobe Type Manger Pro 4 from my Vista Business system. After the uninstall i was prompted to restart which i did. Upon logging in, i noticed that the appearance of my desktop fonts had changed. I went into the color and appearance advanced tab
 to try to change the font but the drop down was ghosted. I checked the event viewer to see if there were any errors reported and saw this:<br />

<p><span>Hi
</span><span>socalsin,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft answers forums!</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following information
</span></p>
<span>Step 1: To check if a driver is faulty</span>
<p>
<span><span><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</span></span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Device Manager by clicking the
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span> button</span></span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>, clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span></span><span><span>, clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>System and Maintenance</strong></span></span><span><span>, and then clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>Device Manager</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>‌</span></span><span><span>
</span><span><span>&nbsp;if you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Double-click the appropriate device category, and then look for an entry for the device you are having a problem with.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click the entry for your display device, and then click
<span><strong>Properties</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<span><strong>General</strong></span> tab, and then look in the <span>
<strong>Device status</strong></span> box to see if it mentions any problems with the device—specifically, a problem with the driver.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>If you suspect that a driver you received from the manufacturer is faulty, contact the manufacturer.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><span>The drivers might have gone corrupt so, Uninstall and reinstall the drivers.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</span></span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Device Manager by clicking the
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span> button</span></span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>, clicking

</span></span><span><span><strong>Device Manager</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>‌</span></span><span><span>
</span><span><span>&nbsp;if you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In Device Manager, locate the device display, and then double-click the device name.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<span><strong>Driver</strong></span> tab, and then click <span>
<strong>uninstall Driver</strong></span> and follow the instructions.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Check the link to manually re-install the drivers

</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:
</span></strong><span>Try enabling DWM (Desktop Window Manager) in the registry.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type in

<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Navigate to the registry key
<strong>*HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\UxSms*</strong><br />
and Change or modify <strong>*Start *DWORD value to *2*</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Restart the computer for changes to take effect.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important this section</span></strong><span>,
 method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before
 you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

    <title>Problems with explorer.exe and other applications crashing on boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kapawozniak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with explorer.exe and other applications crashing on boot</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a problem with my computer - laptop working on 64 bit Windows 7.<br />
I will explain what happened step by step:<br />
It worked normally, until at some point MS Word (2003) stopped responding. So I tried to open task manager several times through right click on task menu -&gt; Open Task Manager (or sth like that, I'm using another language version). It never opened, and all other
 applications worked properly. So i tried Shift+Ctrl+Esc, what finally opened task manager.<br />
What I've seen there was several instances of taskmgr.exe processes with 112-116 KB of RAM attached to them, proper taskmgr.exe with 3K RAM, and not responding MS Word. I tried to kill taskmgr.exe (this 112 KB) what caused the proper task manager to stop responding.<br />
When it again started responding, it prompted an error saying "Access denied" or something very similar. So, mindlessly, I decided to just shut down the computer through Start-&gt;Shut Down, what closed not responding MS Word, but logout took really long time
 and at some point crashed, causing me to force shutdown of the computer.<br />
After booting, I logged in and not all of my startup applications booted (those which didn't included antivirus and firewall), and after 2 or 3 minutes explorer.exe crashed and there was no way of starting it through "run" command via task manager, which worked
 well this time.<br />
I went to safe mode, run a security scan, safe mode was working normally.<br />
After that I rebooted the computer and everything seemed normal, it run for several hours, but after that it just crashed. No symptoms at all, just screen getting frozen and no response to anything. Then I tried to run the system again and again, all of the
 time after startup either explorer.exe crashed or computer froze. Sometimes all of startup programs booted, sometimes only random part of them, sometimes computer worked normally for a few minutes before a random program stopped responding (like for example
 Google Chrome or Adobe Reader), what then caused further problems with irresponsive task manager or explorer.exe. Once it booted normally so I tried to restore system to a date before the problem started, it restored normally but the problem persisted, actually
 went even worse because now I'm not able to do anything on my computer in "normal" boot, as explorer.exe crashes after a few startup applications have been loaded.&nbsp;<br />
Now I'm working in the safe mode which causes my computer to strangely overheat and work really slowly.<br />
<br />
Do you have any idea what might have happened?<br />
Do you think that recovering the system (formatting system partition and re-installing Windows) might help?<br />
<br />
I have not tried to do a clean boot, I may try it at some point, but is it possible to configure clean boot from safe mode?<br />
Also, my antivirus software is AVG 2014, firewall is Comodo Internet Security, I have conducted scans through AVG, which shown a few corrupted .exe files in Dell pre-installed software (which were "repaired" by AVG supposedly) &nbsp;- they might have been in startup,
 although the problem showed itself again some time after this scan. Now I scanned my computer by F-Secure Online Scanner and it did not show any threats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am happy to provide any additional information.</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
As you are able to boot to the safe mode, I would suggest you to perform clean boot to see if some third party program is causing the issue. Also I would suggest you to try all the steps from the following link and see if that helps.<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
thank you so much for your prompt reply and advice.<br />
So far, clean boot helped, although computer seems a bit slower than usual (but this, if I'm right, may be caused by most of program data and settings having to be reloaded and that many programs have to start their own services when opened, not with the start
 of the system).<br />
Loading thumbnails and right-click menus (in Windows Explorer) was really slow from what I've observed. Apart from that, computer does its tasks normally, although I'm now too afraid to start more demanding programs like video games, as I really need this computer
 for my work. Windows Aero interface works perfectly.<br />
I'll try enabling some startup services to try to spot the one causing problems - I've just realised how many of them were there, so some clashes may have happened.<br />
<br />
Just in case, I did not have a DVD with Windows 7 or 'Recovery disc', although I have a "Recovery' partition on my hard drive. Am I able to perform an In-Place Upgrade using this partition and how do I do that? (Can you post a link to a relevant article here,
 as I only found one with use of recovery disc?)<br />
Also, is In-Place Upgrade somehow an equivalent of re-installing OS?

            Before embarking on reinstalling etc., why not answer my post as it could reveal less traumatic solution. If one does not emerge you can still carry out the solution suggested by Vijay.

    <title>My wireless connection only have access to Google&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 3abboodi  say:</h3>
<h2>            My wireless connection only have access to Google&#33;</h2>
                    Hello there,<br />
<br />
I've been having this weird problem for 3 months now, and I never was able to fix it. I had windows vista on my Sony laptop, and I usually connect to my wireless internet at my apartment. One day I woke up in the morning and wanted to check my email. The surprise
 was that my laptop is connected to my router perfectly, but I have no internet access. I tried a couple websites and the only one that works is Google. In addition, I could sign in to Windows Live Messenger and chat with people. The problem is I can't access
 any other website beside Google. Now, I upgraded to Windows 7, hoping this problem will be solved, but unfortunately, it's still there.<br />
<br />
The only way I can connect to my internet is by using Ethernet cable. Now, the funny thing is, the wireless connection works perfectly at my school and Starbucks, making me thinking that I have problems with my router. However, I have a MacBook and an iPhone,
 and they work perfectly with this router.<br />
<br />
One solution I tried was resetting my router to the original factory settings. I also installed 4 different browsers, all of them didn't work<br />
<br />
Please, I need your help to fix this weird problem<br />
<br />
PS: I brought another laptop which runs Vista, and the same thing happened. Wireless only Google and messenger!

    <title>Gamertag Changed by XLCM after 10 YEARS&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daintyfawn8895  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamertag Changed by XLCM after 10 YEARS&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My gamertag was clever, memorable, and had sentimental value to me. [Mod Removed]. I came up with it a decade ago and over that 10 year span haven't received a single complaint from another gamer, not about my name, or my demeanor. I play COD, 2k, Black Ops, Fortnite, and other titles online. Not one complaint. So how is it that the XLCM team decides after 10 years that my name is offensive? Are these employees of microsoft? Or are they volunteers who also play games along side us? Do they have any kind of oversight? Who's to say I didn't play one and kill him/her 10 times in one match and they decided to railroad me because they were granted power over their peers? I play against people who's gamertags reference murder, shooting in the head, puns about racism, and my personal favorite doing drugs or drinking. Which is whatever because I support their ability to do so. However, to say that my gamertag was offensive over murder, racism and being high or drunk is beyond ludicrous.&nbsp;</

If I find your name offensive and can relate the letters in your name to something that hurts my feelings I can have you reported? That's ridiculous. and if they agree with my take on it then you're out 10 bucks and a name you might've built an online identity around.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You're not made aware of complaints filed against you. So yes, someone could have reported you. It doesn't matter if you report someone because you think their gamertag is offensive, it's up to the enforcement team to determine if it actually violates the code conduct. So you can have a million complaints filed against you and not have anything happen if you follow the code. The enforcement team would have told you it was a violation on the enforcement site as well as with your case review.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>So once again, someone could get their feelings hurt because I beat them in a video game, and then report me and undermine a decade worth of online presence? My reputation is bright green, which leads me to believe there is a lack of complaints against me. Also once again, Taint isn't sexual at all, and they changed my gamertag to a homophobic slur. Which I find offensive. I'm sure they just randomly generate the names, but the fact that Dainty is acceptable but Taint isn't should go to show the complete lack of continuity and abuse of one gamers power over another. The fact that once they rule decision upheld there is no way to speak to a human, and support people can't even contact them is disgusting. I'd love to see the numbers on how many appeals are overturned. I'd love to know who the people are making moral decisions and exercising complete power over others. What makes their judgment so sound? Xbox is supposed to be creating a community of people from different backgrounds coming togeth

    <title>Windows 10 microphone frying sound compatibility problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matteomarchionni  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 microphone frying sound compatibility problem</h2>
                    <p>For a few weeks I've had this buzzing noise over my voice when recording with my Blue Snowball microphone. I've had Windows 10 since it came out basically and the microphone for a couple of years. It's always been fine up until this started. It makes it
 impossible to use, the sound just comes up at random times and very often.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried everything to fix it, reinstalling drivers, changing usb ports and more (also editing it with Audacity but it doesn't help).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find the problem I then run some tests:</p>
<p>1) Tried another usb microphone on my laptop and it worked fine.</p>
<p>2) Tried the Snowball on another laptop with Windows 8 and it worked also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there is certainly nothing broken. Being out of ideas I called my local pc repair shop and they think it's probably some compatibility setting with Windows 10. Which makes sense because it worked on my other laptop.</p>
<p>There are constant updated being done, and I can't recall this problem to have started after an update but it may well be the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need to use my microphone so any help is much appreciated. At the moment my options are to wait for a new update and hope, or buy a new microphone which I really don't want to do since it's not broken.</p>
<p>Is there anything else I can do? Although trust me I've tried most things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the sound so you can understand exactly what I mean:</p>

<p>thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all the steps one by one but the noise is still present. Although, it appears to have had a minor improvement after the troubleshooting. It seems like the buzz is audible for smaller periods of time, but still not good enough to be able to use.</p>

            So is there no solution to this or anything else I can try to make it work? In the past few days I've kept searching for answers but I can't seem to find any. I've heard a couple of my friends also have been having the same issue and are in my same position.
 I'm aware of a new update for Windows 10 coming on the 2nd of August but this doesn't mean it will fix the problem. I really need this to be fixed because I can't use it and it's unacceptable. If there is no solution, I'm going back to Windows 8 which worked
 fine as I'm still in time.

<p>Hi Dinesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for letting us know that you were able to set up your TV on the Xbox!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe the articles&nbsp;are referring to the Entertainment hub/tab found on your main dashboard next to the Community hub/tab. From the Entertainment section there should be the Live TV option that will then take you to the TV &amp; OneGuide section of your settings
 to set up the Live TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way&nbsp;we're glad you were able to get it set up :) I will now be locking this thread since the issue was resolved but feel free to come back anytime you have any other questions and we would be more than happy to answer them!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and have a great day!</p>
        </p>

<p>Hey Frederico,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post, unfortunately on this forum there has been no word of adding CrossFire/SLI support to Forza, this doesn't meant that it won't be added by the developer later on. For more information on this I recommend checking out the
<a href="https://forums.forzamotorsport.net/turn10_forum18_Forza-Horizon-4.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> fearfulsky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ambassador chat not giving xp.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. The xcl website directed me here for help. Over the past 14 days i have helped around 35 people through the ambassador chat on skype. However, i have not received ANY xp. This is very frustrating as i spent several hours and even stayed up a couple
 nights helping people as my goal was to get to level 8 before my holiday ends. My xp and assisted chat numbers remain the same as they were 2 weeks ago on the xcl.xbox.com website.The chats should have counted as i completed all of them and most people thanked
 me for help, after which i said bye and the chat bot asks me when i want my next question. Hopefully this issue can be resolved quickly.</p>

<p>*sorry for any typos it is quite the challenge using this phone keyboard.</p>

    <title>Surface Dock won&#39;t recognize external monitor on Surface Book - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidgreusel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Dock won&#39;t recognize external monitor on Surface Book</h2>
                    <div>
<p>The Surface Dock connected to my Surface Book refuses (sometimes, now all the time) to recognize the Dell 4K monitor plugged into it. The monitor works when plugged directly into the Surface Book, so the problem is with the Dock. Display control panel says
 it doesn't "detect" a second monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cable is Mini DisplayPort to HDMI. As I said, works fine connected directly to laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>* Surface Book is all updated.</p>
<p>* Two-button restart has helped before; doesn't work now.</p>
<p>* Both monitor jacks on the Dock work (or don't work) the same.</p>
<p>* Powering the monitor off and back on sometimes worked, now doesn't work at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need this second monitor for my work, and I need the Surface Dock for all the other peripherals.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need help!</p>

    <title>Website blocking not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikedellfarm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Website blocking not working</h2>
                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
How do I prevent my child from seeing a certain site?

<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Family Safety are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Version 2011 (15.4.3502.922)</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
I have set up Windows Family Safety on my Windows 7 laptop to control what my children are doing on the system. &nbsp;I don't currently have any app restrictions, only website restrictions. &nbsp;The website settings "should" be blocking access to all websites apart
 from those in the allow list, but its just a joke. &nbsp;When they open Explorer (IE9), it goes straight to the MSN home page - this isn't in the allowed list and yet it is displayed, although some of the ads or content within it does get blocked. &nbsp;They can then
 happily go to google and run searches for text and images. &nbsp;Google is not in the allowed list, and neither are any of the sites which google then quite happily takes them to. &nbsp;So far as I can see, the website blocking isn't doing much at all here, although
 on the activity report FSS claims to have blocked access to some sites.<br />
<br />
I have rebooted the computer several times since setting all of this up. &nbsp;There are only 4 alllowed sites in the list = "moshimonsters.com, lego.com, hero.lego.com and accounts.lego.com". &nbsp;I've also explicitly listed google.co.uk and google.com in the blocked
 list, but even this doesn't seem to help.<br />
<br />
I presume I must be getting something wrong because it really can't be this poor at blocking, but its not obvious what is wrong since it does manage to block a few sites.</p>

<p>Hi <span>mikedellfarm,<br />
<br />
We would like to confirm if you have refreshed the settings on your Windows Live Family Safety client? If not, then we recommend that you follow the steps provided below:<br />
<br />
1. Open the Family Safety filter by right clicking the Family Safety icon in the system tray<br />
2. Click on <strong>Open the Family Safety Filter <br />
</strong>3. Click the refresh icon in the top right corner of the Family Safety filter<br />
<br />
When the filter makes an update on what websites are allowed or blocked, the websites will be updated. In the case where filter is not triggered to refresh, the settings will update every 12 hours to the website, which may be the reason why your Filter is not
 working as you would have hoped.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if the same issue would still persist.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

            Yes, I can confirm that I have done that. &nbsp;It does not make any difference. &nbsp;I can still open up explorer in one of the protected accounts, it goes straight to the MSN homepage, which is not in the allow list, and I can enter various other websites into
 the address bar and be taken to them - none of them in the allow list. &nbsp;To confirm - the account is set with web filtering enabled, and allow-list only, but it just doesn't seem to have any effect.

            Hi there. &nbsp;Unfortunately, when I click the link to download the family_safety_quick_trace.zip file, it just takes me to SkyDrive, which doesn't appear to have that zip file in it, so I can't do this. &nbsp;Please can you let me know how else I can access this
 zip file, or be clear on what Windows Live ID I need to be logged in with in order to locate this ZIP file?

            <p>Hello Gwem,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your concern on Microsoft Community Forum. It must have been alarming knowing that after setting up your Family Safety within Windows 8, your child can still browse filtered websites. I will be assisting you on your inquiry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like to confirm the settings that you have given on your child account. Please provide us screenshots for us to determine if there are settings that needed to be changed. I have provided a private message where you can find the instructions on what
 screenshots we need and where you can securely upload the logs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that you need to be signed in to view the private message. Afterwards, kindly reply back to this public post.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
