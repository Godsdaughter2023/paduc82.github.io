<h2>            OneNote storage location on Google drive Iphone</h2>
                    <p>I have my Onenote synced to Google drive.</p>
<p>However when i open my iphone i do not see any of my notebooks.</p>
<p>Is this because Microsoft will not support google drive and that we have to use OneDrive?</p>

<h2>            Echo on other end of a recorded Skype phone call</h2>
                    <p>When I phone landlines from my Skype account the recording of the conversation has a significant Echo. But the recording of my voice is very clear. The voice of the person I phoned is very distorted due to the echo. The person I am speaking to can also sometimes
 here an echo of their own voice. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Would this be a basic hardware issue - do I just need to buy better external headset/microphone, or is it a software issue I can adjust on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions for resolving this would be most appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since upgrading to Windows 7 and IE 10, I cannot save anything to "favourites".&nbsp; I just get a 'access denied' message.&nbsp; Any ideas please?</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the complete error message that you get related to access denied? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assigning permissions to the favorite folder&nbsp;may help in resolving the issue. The attrib command can also help in fixing the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Follow the steps to apply permissions for a user:</p>
<p><span><span><span><strong>a</strong>:&nbsp;</span></span></span>Navigate to the location “<strong>C:\users\</strong> and open your user account folder.</p>
<p><strong>b:</strong> Right-click on the <strong>“Favorites</strong>” folder and then click “<strong>Properties”.</strong></p>
<p><strong>c:</strong> Click the “<strong>Security</strong>” tab, and then click “<strong>Edit</strong>”.</p>
<p><strong>d:</strong> To set permissions for a user that is not listed under Group or user names, click “<strong>Add</strong>”, type the name of the user or group, click “<strong>OK</strong>”, select the permissions, and then click “<strong>OK</strong>”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Perform the steps mentioned below and see if it helps.
</p>
<p><strong>a:</strong> Type<strong> CMD</strong> in the start search box</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: When CMD appears right click on it and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong></p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: Now type the following commands after each line press enter</p>
<p><strong>CD \</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>CD users\</strong>**your user name**\&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>ATTRIB favorites -r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This should remove the read only attribute from the favorites folder, and allow you to save the item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply if you have any questions. &nbsp;</p>

                    Onetime Multi-user installation of <strong>Office 365 – through the Windows Store</strong> does not seem possible. With computers or tablets, that are used by families members or different individuals in a business environment, it is common to have multiple
 login accounts. In the past when I installed any version of <strong>Office</strong> and other non-Store applications; they were installed once and then available to all users logging on to that device! This is not the case with&nbsp;<span><strong>Office
 365 – through the Windows Store</strong>. That is a very frustrating realization (without warning) after one is instructed to remove ALL PRIOR VERSIONS before installing&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Office 365 – through the Windows Store</strong>. The code
 could not have changed that much to have not made that a given expectation to achieve! AND, that is the frustration I have with all Windows Store apps; having NO MULTI-USER AWARENESS! Could it have, at the very least, be given as an option?</span>

<p>
</p><p>Hey, so after doing a Windows update - my tablet once again insisted on stopping me studying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some time and effort I've managed to come up with a solution for this issue. Basically when certain languages are installed, cftmon crashes non-stop. I had English New Zealand installed, unfortunately - like the Australian dialect, it too causes the
 crashes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how to fix it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search and open Region and Language Settings.</li><li>Delete all of the Languages and add something stable such as United States or British English.</li><li>The error should hopefully go away.</li></ol>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>As far as I can see, when you iterate through each MailItem in a Folder, they are stepped through in order of age (I suspect it is .CreationTime&nbsp;rather than .SentOn or .ReceivedTime).&nbsp; So it doesn't matter how you have sorted the folder view in Outlook,
 the first item that is displayed is always the oldest.&nbsp; Is that what you see?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can access the newest item like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fldr.Items(Fldr.Items.Count)<br />
<br />
and if you want to loop through all items with the newest first, you can do this:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim i As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For i = Fldr.Items.Count To 1 <strong>Step -1</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set olMail = Fldr.Items(i)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debug.Print olMail.CreationTime<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next i<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</p>
<p>Cheers<br />
Rich</p>

</p><p>Thanks for the Reply. I got a thought about it, and i wrote it already. But even here it seems there is an Issue.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>But in the above code, i faced rather a strange issue, which is with the index of the Outlook. The output shows me clearly, that there are some outlook items not being indexed so they were not exposed for the IF condition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please suggest. Any help is appreciated .</p>
<p>
</p><p>P/S: I cannot rebuild the outlook index, as my mailbox has more than 16000 Mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Better i should lookout for other alternative.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The "Help" file for Items.Find is surprisingly helpful in this case: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff869662(v=office.15).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ff869662(v=office.15).aspx</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>When filtering text fields, you can use either a pair of single quotes (') or&nbsp; a pair of double quotes (") to delimit the values that are part of the filter. For example, all of the following lines function correctly when the
 field is of type </em><strong><em>String</em></strong><em>: </em></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<pre>sFilter = "[CompanyName] = 'Microsoft'"  
sFilter = "[CompanyName] = ""Microsoft"""  
sFilter = "[CompanyName] = " &amp; Chr(34) &amp; "Microsoft" &amp; Chr(34)
</pre>
<p>In VBA, strings are enclosed in quotation marks (").&nbsp; e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; strMyString = "Some text here"<br />
<br />
If you need the quotation mark character to appear <strong><em>in</em></strong> the string, you can double it up, e.g.:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; strMyString = "Bob said <strong>""</strong>Boo!<strong>""</strong> and I was surprised."<br />
will return:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bob said <strong>"</strong>Boo!<strong>"</strong> and I was surprised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the use of Chr(34) in the example you gave is another way of&nbsp;including a&nbsp;quotation mark in the string.<br />
<br />
So to search for "Test" in the Subject field, you need to build a string that looks like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Subject] = "Test"<br />
and that string must include those quotation marks.&nbsp; So you can do:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strFilter As String, strSubj As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strSubj = "Test"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strFilter = "[Subject] = <strong>""</strong>" &amp; strSubj &amp; "<strong>""</strong>"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Set </strong>olMail = Fldr.Items.Find(<strong>strFilter</strong>)</p>
<p><br />
Make sense?<br />
Cheers<br />

<p>Hi again.<br />
What is "s" in the If s=n Then Exit For part of your code?&nbsp; Did the For k..Next k loop exit early?<br />
<br />
In your code here, <strong>Cells(1, n + 1)</strong>, are you listing across the sheet (row=1, column=n+1)?<br />
You said you have ~16,000 items.&nbsp; In a .xlsx/.xlsm file there are only 16,384 columns.&nbsp;
<br />
Could you be running out of columns?<br />
<br />
First, take the IF statement out of the equation.&nbsp; Have your code list the .ReceivedTime and .SenderName in separate columns.&nbsp; Compare how many items are listed vs. the number of items in the folder in Outlook.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim n As Long, k As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim fldr As Outlook.Folder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim olMail As Outlook.MailItem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n = 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For k = fldr.Items.Count To 1 Step -1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set olMail = fldr.Items(k)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheets("Misc").Cells(n, "A").Value = olMail.ReceivedTime<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sheets("Misc").Cells(n, "B").Value = olMail.SenderName<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n = n + 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next k<br />
<br />
Can you identify any specific items that are not appearing in Excel?<br />
Cheers<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your explanation on find().</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the 2nd question, my answer is yes. i can see many items are skipped.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">n = 1</span><br />
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; olMail.Display</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; olMail.Close olSave</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sheets("Misc").Cells(n, "A").Value = olMail.ReceivedTime</span><br />
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So here i displayed, every mail item according to outlook index. After running through some mails, suddenly it started showing mails from 03/06/2014 but not of today's. This made me come to the conclusion
 that, there is some issue with indexing of outlook.</span></p>

            <p>So the total number of items listed in your excel file was less that the item count in Outlook?</p>
<p>Can you identify an item that is not listed?</p>
<p>Select a "missing" item and run code like the following to try to figure out what if anything might be different:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim olMail As Outlook.MailItem<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Set olMail = Application.ActiveInspector.CurrentItem</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debug.Print olMail.Sender<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debug.Print olMail.CreationTime<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Debug.Print olMail.Subject<br />

All the missing items are e-mail messages right??</p>

            <p>Hi Rich,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, I didn't answer ur question about "variable s"... s is the number of emails i want to retrieve from my mailbox. so its the loop control variable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for ur ActiveInspector, i am able to get the details correctly. All the missing items are only mail messages. Rather i say, not missing Items, items are there but found only after a very long search of Inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Items listed in the excel file are exactly the same number in my Inbox, but they are not by date. After some mails it has 03/06/2014 mails and again after some mails it has 01/05/2014 mails. So the mails are searched but, not by latest date(atleast for
 some mails). As a result, the macro is taking long time for searching and i have no use of this automation if it takes that much time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Finally, i am able to solve it with the Find() function. I passed a variable to it to find the subject of my mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mail subject looks like below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"**************************************** on 03/11/2014" - the content before date is always the same</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i concatenated the string with today's date "Short Date" format and it is giving me the exact results.</p>
<p>

<h2>            6300 SMS Problem - Added words not being saved....</h2>
                    I recently purchased a 6300 in the Middle East (where I now live).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately there is a serious lack of customer service over here hence am stuck with a really annoying problem.<br />
<br />
When texting, "new" words such as 'uncomfy' / 'geeza' / my girlfriends name or place names - it is understandable that one must save these in the 'Edit Word' facility.<br />
<br />
Why is it, that after saving such words, next time I go to use them they are still not available and the only way to enter them is to go through exactly the same process (or turn predictive texting off)?<br />
<br />
Surely once I've "SAVED" them, they are saved??!<br />
<br />
Please help. I've phoned everyone I can think of but the level of service this side of the planet is not quite up to standard!<br />
<br />
Many thanks, Simon.

I recently purchased a 6300 in the Middle East (where I now live).<br />

Unfortunately there is a serious lack of customer service over here hence am stuck with a really annoying problem.<br />
<br />
When texting, "new" words such as 'uncomfy' / 'geeza' / my girlfriends name or place names - it is understandable that one must save these in the 'Edit Word' facility.<br />
<br />
Why is it, that after saving such words, next time I go to use them they are still not available and the only way to enter them is to go through exactly the same process (or turn predictive texting off)?<br />
<br />
Surely once I've "SAVED" them, they are saved??!<br />
<br />
Please help. I've phoned everyone I can think of but the level of service this side of the planet is not quite up to standard!<br />
<br />
Many thanks, Simon.<br />

Did you try searching for the saved words by presesing ( * ) star, after writing the text with predictive text ON.<br />
<br />
What is your current Firmware.

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I had this problem too.&nbsp; There are other threads which offer a solution (it worked for me):<br />
</p>
<p>I'm adding this to as many threads as I can find in case someone else is looking for a solution...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to make sure your phone or memory card has a folder called "Dictionary".&nbsp; If not,&nbsp; add one yourself:</p>
<p>Gallery &gt; Options &gt; Add Folder&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [the folder will be in phone memory]<br />
</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>Gallery &gt; Memory Card &gt; Options &gt; Add Folder&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [the folder will be on your memory card]<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>then type "Dictionary" and press &lt;OK&gt; to create the folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it's up to you whether you want all your custom words to be stored in the phone memory (less space) or on your memory card (larger, but if you switch memory cards you'll have to recreate the dictionary).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Hope this helps someone!

            Usually this occurs if the document has all of the following conditions:<br />
<ol>
<li>Nested tables are in the header or footer and the nested tables are formatted to wrap text.</li><li>The document contains a {NUMPAGES} field in the header or the footer.</li><li>Change tracking is turned on and the document contains more than 10 pages.</li><li>Print Layout view is turned on.</li></ol>
To avoid this problem, use any of the following methods:<br />
<ol>
<li>View document in Normal View<br />
</li><li>Turn off text wrapping for the nested table.</li><li>Remove the nested tables in the header or footer.</li><li>Remove the {NUMPAGES} field in the header or the footer.</li><li>Turn change tracking off.</li></ol>

<h2>            HP Envy X2 does not boot properly after installation of some updates</h2>
                    <p>Original title: My HP Envy X2 is a brick! </p>
<p>I have an HP Envy X2 detachable tablet computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the Technical Preview and it worked well for some time.&nbsp; After one of the last updates on the installed version, it become inoperative and would not boot successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I had a recovery USB for the system but cannot find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now attempting to do a clean install of the 10064 release, unsuccessfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, the install would not recognize any input from the built in keyboard or touch pad.&nbsp; That is still the case.&nbsp; I managed to get past the language and acceptance screens by attaching an external USB keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system now installs to the point of reboot and then processes for a while and then displays a screen that says "Something went wrong.&nbsp; We can't sign you in at the moment. Check your network connection and try again, or select skip to sign in later.&nbsp;
 At this point, neither the internal or external keyboard will work and I cannot get past this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have acquired the original drivers that were provided but do not know where to put them on the install USB to get the install to recognize the drivers and allow it to operate and continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts or assistance would be most appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Larry, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of the Windows 10 Technical Preview. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please perform the Methods mentioned below in order to get the issue fixed. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 1:</strong></span>&nbsp;<span>Try to remove any external devices connected to the computer and check if you can boot to the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, then this issue may occur due to corrupt Windows startup files.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 2: </strong></span><strong>Try to run startup repair
</strong>and check if it helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow these steps:</p>
<p><strong>a. </strong>Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have installation media for Windows, start your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>", do so. If you
 don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, click "<strong>Repair your computer</strong>" to start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>b.</strong> In the<strong> Windows recovery environment</strong>, on the "<strong>Choose an option</strong>" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>c.</strong> Click "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" and then click "<strong>Automatic Repair</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may <strong>download Windows 10 ISO file and burn it on a DVD to create a bootable media.</strong><br />
Refer this ISO link: </p>

</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, it did not resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not have install media for the prior W10 release but do have an install USB for the current release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I would try the automatic repair, it would fail.&nbsp; The log file showed only one error which was that the installed version of Windows was the wrong version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have subsequently wiped the hard drive on the WNVY X2 and performed a clean install with the 10x4 release.&nbsp; The result is the same.&nbsp; The internal keyboard and touchpad on the computer are inoperative, as is the touch screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The install proceeds normally through all steps including the first reboot after setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At that point, it works for a few minutes and then comes up with the same white screen saying</p>
<p>"Something went wrong</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can't sign you in at the moment.&nbsp; Check your network connection and try again, or select skip to sign in later."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboard is inoperative at this point (both internal and USB) and I can make no further progress.</p>

            <p>Hi Larry, </p>
<p>
<strong>System Restore </strong><span>allows you to restore your computer to a previous state quickly and easily without losing any of your files or personal settings. Sometimes when you install programs or drivers, they may affect some of the system settings
 and prevent other programs from working correctly. You can use System Restore to revert these settings back to their previous state.</span>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Try to boot to Windows using the disc to perform a System restore.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Insert the installation DVD or USB and boot Windows 10 Technical Preview from it.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the ‘Windows setup’ page select the ‘language to install’, ‘Time and currency format’ and the ‘keyboard or input method’ and click on ‘next’.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click on ‘Repair your computer’ and select ‘Troubleshoot’.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click on ‘Advanced options’ and select ‘System Restore’&nbsp;and select the operating system to perform the restore.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>Application /programs that were installed after the last restore point will be lost. You may have to reinstall the application/programs. Once you are able to boot to normal mode, you may also check in Windows update history
 for any failed updates and the error codes.</span></p>

I have several small Excel workbooks that I primarily use on my phone.&nbsp; Yesterday I edited two of these workbooks on my pc as it is easier to do formatting changes.<br />
<br />
Today I notice I can open these two workbooks on my phone, but there is a message
<i><b>"can't edit workbook"</b></i><br />
I have checked and they are .xlsw files...<br />
<br />
If I open an excel workbook that I didn't edit on the computer yesterday, it opens fine and I can edit it (no error message)<br />
<br />
I tried creating a new workbook on my computer and copying the information over, however this new workbook has the same problem when I try to access it on my phone, i.e.,
<i><b>"can't edit workbook"</b></i><br />
<br />
Any suggestions?&nbsp; this is very frustrating<br />

            I have done some testing.... <br />
<br />
If I create a new&nbsp; .xlsx file on skydrive from my pc...&nbsp; (I put just one word in the new spreadshit then exit it... log out)<br />
<br />
When I access this on my phone I get the error message "cant edit workbook"<br />
<br />
Is it because the Office software on WP 7.5 can't open .xlsx documents due to some upgrade on Microsoft Excel Web app?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I can still open .xlsx skydrive files on my phone as long as I have not opened them on the Excel Web app since about Sunday Jan 27 2013...<br />

            <p>I have the same problem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All my workbooks that have been working fine on my WP7.5 for until a couple of days ago now give the error message "can't edit workbook" when I try to open them on my phone.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is after doing some&nbsp;minor&nbsp;changes in them using the excel web app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I create an empty workbook on my skydrive using the web app and&nbsp;just save it without writing anything at all&nbsp;in it, I can open it and edit it on my WP7.5.
</p>
<p>If I however write as much as a single number in the new workbook using&nbsp;&nbsp;the excel web app&nbsp;it becomes uneditable on my phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft, why break something that wasn't broken? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>By the way, I use Windows Phone 7, and had the same issue in 7.5 and now 7.8 versions of that OS. So it's not about the OS, but about the Excel app, it seems.</div>

<p>Hi WoodleysideLab,</p>
<p>Usually, the “Alternative email” fields resides in the Office 365 Settings &gt; Personal info page:</p>
<p><a href="https://portal.office.com/account/#personalinfo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://portal.office.com/account/#personalinfo</a></p>
<p>You can check whether the address ****@coribi.net is filled in as the alternative email address.</p>
<p>Also, can you let us know if the account ****@coribi.net is an active user managed under your organization? Is the account granted a password admin right or does the account has some sort of link to the
jo****@me.com?</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Jerry</p>

<p>I have gone to personal info page. There is one "alternate email" listed which is the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** address. There is no secondary email address listed, and no @coribi.net listed.</p>
<p>The account *** Email address is removed for privacy *** is not an active user managed under this organisation. It was the alternate email set up by a system admin when we created the Office365 E3 accounts. He has left the orgnisation, and his account in Office365 was deleted. The coribi.net
 address does not appear on any of the current Office365 accounts.</p>
<p>It appears that this has stuck from the original registration/office365 setup, and there appears to be no way to delete it.</p>

<p>hi woodleysidelab,</p>
<p>thanks for your updates.</p>
<p>to further investigate this issue, could you follow the steps below to check the outcome?<br />
1) on the <a href="https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/profile</a> page you should see one alternative email address that you set in o365 portal.<br />
2) then click “register for password rest”, you will see your second alternative email address in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=7164a9b6-6b9b-4728-8932-d785c0df74eb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

3)to keep one of them, you can modify the above two email addresses to the same.</p>
<p>if this issue persists, i’d like to collect some additional information for a check via backend. to protect your privacy, i have sent you a private message to collect the information. you can access the private message via the link below:<br />
https://community.office365.com/user/conversations.</p>
<p>please also notify us on the forum if you’ve replied to the private message so that we can know your updates at the same time. once the information is collected, we’ll further look into the issue from our side.</p>

                    <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having issues with getting an excel template to create a new file when opened. It always opens the document and doesn't create a new instance.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using One Drive and Excel on an iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The specification for this file is to by default on open to create a new document, then be forced to save as a copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to have it so users (read/write and read-only) are forced to save a copy of this file, and the standard reply of "you need to train a user to do this themselves" is not the answer that will be accepted!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I consider this otherwise a bug and it needs to be fixed, or you shouldn't be able to open these files on an iPad.</p>

<p>Hello Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To sort this out, I'd like to clarify if this is your first time to encounter this issue? If so, did you make changes to your device prior to this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I suggest that you make sure that your Excel application is up to date. Also, you may consider uninstalling and reinstalling the application and check if this will resolve your concern.</p>

<p>Hi Antoneth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No changes were made to the document prior to testing on the iPad. It works normally on a regular PC and testing on a desktop device was all successful. When I wanted to open the document so it creates a new document as it is an excel template, it opens
 the document for edit, not a new document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device that was used is a clean device that is not used regularly by a user. It has a clean set of applications that are up-to-date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The excel template file (.xltx) opens the file for edit, not a new document. So if you edit the document on onedrive, it will save the data in the template. Then if you open it on a PC, it will create a file with that data from the iPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you explain why this keeps happening and how to fix it please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows builder preview 16251</h2>
                    <p>Thank you Microsoft,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For making my desktop useless with this latest builder preview. Now I can't retrieve anything that is on my desktop. I can't even get it to reboot at all. I now get an error message that reads as such. (No boot disk has been
 detected or the disk has failed) thank you so very much for making Windows 10 worse than 8.1 ever was. I have been telling you what problems I have been having and every thing you all have told me to do has just made my PC useless to the point I am now stuck
 with&nbsp;having to use my old laptop&nbsp;with Windows XP on it. What I way to go. You&nbsp;have lied to us by not making 10 compatible with PC's up to 10 years old. Thank you Microsoft for me losing the one means of finding a job or starting a business away from me and
 any other user unfortunate&nbsp;enough to believe you lie's. I am one very unhappy Windows 10 user and I&nbsp;am now going to start looking at finding a PC with Linux on it instead of your **** fest of an operating system. You have just lost a Windows user for good.</p>

<p>Did you read the warning that was posted about using BETA software before installing Insiders/Preview on a system, it said using such software may have issues, such as deleting programs, crashes, may not boot, and the biggest one don't use it on your everyday
 system, and as posted on this forum and others make a back up of your system. so don't blame MS as this program is for testing to find such issues. I see your other posting where people have told you the same thing don't blame MS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is just some of the info that is published by MS about using BETA OS:</p>
<p>Remember, trying out an early build like this can be risky. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>That's why we recommend that you don't install the preview on your primary home or business PC. Unexpected PC crashes could damage or even delete your files, so you should back up everything.
</strong></span></p>
<li>If you want to stop using Windows 10 Insider Preview and return to your previous version of Windows, you'll need to reinstall your previous version from the recovery or installation media that came with your PC—typically a DVD. If you don't have recovery
 media, you might be able to create recovery media from a recovery partition on your PC using software provided by your PC manufacturer. You'll need to do this before you upgrade. Check the support section of your PC manufacturer's website for more info.
</li><li>After you install Windows 10 Insider Preview, you won’t be able to use the recovery partition on your PC to go back to your previous version of Windows.
<p>

            Besides what Joe has said and so you know, this forum is a peer to peer group of volunteers testing future unreleased builds of Windows 10. We report our findings good or bad in the Feedback Hub where Microsoft can see and evaluate our feedback to help
 them in future releases of Windows 10. We have no direct contact with Microsoft and most of use these beta builds on PC's or laptops used only for testing and do not install beta builds on our daily use computers as Microsoft recommended when we joined the
 program. In your other post, mel77084 told you we could help you if you give us info about your system.&nbsp;

<p>You should <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>never, ever</strong></em></span>&nbsp;use your desktop to save your documents to&nbsp;or
 have, especially when these are reinforced by Microsoft from day one with&nbsp;Windows 3.x with the idea of Windows and the Desktop.</p>

Macrium Reflect v6 Free Edition</a> is a good starting point, clicking the link will start the download of ReflectDL.exe (2.94Mb) as the site can be a bit confusing now with the push for purchase of product.</p>

<p>My laptop is over ten years old and it runs WIP's very nice indeed. How old is your computer that you are trying to run WIP's on? Personally most<strong>*</strong> computers 10 years or older should really be replaced especially in a business environment.
 The further you get behind in technology the bigger and more expensive it will be to replace, especially software wise.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>*</strong>Depends on everything hardware wise naturally.</p>

<p>Tip, you might be able to connect the hard drive to slave to a bootable OS and recover your files this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you do a clean install of Windows 10 Creators Update from the link provided below, you can create your own bootable USB or CD, from there you reboot and start afresh clean.</p>

<p>Your post reminds me of the person who bitterly criticized the maker of his bicycle because he had not yet learned to ride it ... he insisted that it was defective because it would fall over every time he tried to ride it. Since it was so defective, he offered
 to sell it for $2.00 to a young lad who had a paper route, but no bicycle. The lad gladly handed him the $2.00, jumped on the bicycle, and rode off to deliver his papers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your computer difficulties could be overcome if you would only accept the free help that is available to you on this forum, rather than berating Microsoft endlessly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might well be that you would need to upgrade some of your hardware in order to successfully run the newer builds; if so, you could choose to do so, or to stick with the outdated hardware, and run the operating system that it can run successfully.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although one might really like his outdated hardware, he should realize that when it was designed and manufactured, it was not possible to make it capable of handling all, yet unknown, future operating systems, and that fact doesn't mean that the makers
 of any/all future operating systems would be under any obligation to forever make those new operating systems backward compatible with one's outdated hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish you well in your linux endeavors, should you choose that option.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you choose “Reset This PC” under Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery – your PC will be in an unusable state. There is no workaround if your PC gets into this state and you will need to reinstall Windows. This issue will be fixed in the next build.
 You can still rollback to the previous build if for some reason this build doesn’t work out for you. This bug also existed in Build 14251 so please avoid resetting your PC on these builds.&nbsp;

            <p>I found another issue which I think is connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check my 2 SSD's on my Insider build, both show as failing according to SMART. I checked them with the Samsung Magician and HWINGO64. I pulled the 840PRO and put it in my HD Docking station attached to my main PC (W10 RTM) and it shows no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering the PC runs fine and the drive showed no errors when tested on another PC I'm chalking this up to sensor issues (?) I suspect the same thing that is causing the perfmon /report not to finish is causing the missing data in SMART. I did report
 this.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Wilma,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>There are a number of possible explanations as to why security codes don't always arrive. Read through this list of the most common causes, and see if any of them apply to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Your phone block calls or texts from unknown numbers. Kindly change your phone settings&nbsp;then choose<strong>&nbsp;I don’t have a code</strong><span>. We’ll send another security code.</span></p>
<p>2. Is your phone number entered correctly? To keep your information safe when you're signing in, we only show you the last two digits of your phone number or the first two characters of your email address. You can check to see if your security info is correct
 by going to the <strong><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Security basics</a></strong>
<span>page, signing in with your Microsoft account, and selecting </span><strong>Update info</strong><span>.&nbsp;You may need to enter a security code to get to this page. Choose a method that you know works, or choose
</span><strong>I don't have any of these</strong><span> to reset your security info.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, if you can see an option to send the code via email aside from the phone number, kindly try using that one. Check if you will be able to receive the code. If you have enabled the two-step verification on your account, let us try to disable that
 one. Please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Security basics</strong></a> page, and sign in with your Microsoft account.</li><li>
<p>Select <strong>more security options</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Under <strong>Two-step verification</strong>, choose <strong>Turn off two-step verification</strong> to turn it off.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Follow the instructions.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, please try sending a code again and observe if you will receive it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted for us to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Despite your comments the answer is a simple one...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>WHOEVER ACTIVATED RESET PROTECTION IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO CAN DEACTIVATE IT AS THEY WOULD BE THE PERSON&nbsp; WHO RECEIVES THE RECOVERY KEY&nbsp; VIA EMAIL!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have bought the phone from AT&amp;T the answer would be to take&nbsp; to back to them as they sold you a phone (wild guess here !!&nbsp;a return? where the previous owner activated RESET PROTECTION and did NOT deactivate it so has an email with the RPRK in their
 IN-BOX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phone are not sold with RESET PROTECTION "ON"&nbsp; or activated, activation occurs after&nbsp;i.e linked to the&nbsp;OUTLOOK id</p>
<p>first step and then that person turns RESET PROTECTION on</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the ONLY way to overcome that by obtaining the RPRK <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/10549/microsoft-account-protect-my-phone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>to reiterate&nbsp; ONLY the person who activated&nbsp; will receive the email, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
there is NO back door or ways to circumvent it!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Either show this comment or explain this to AT&amp;T as they no doubt will have the details of the original supplier, if not&nbsp; you would be entitled to a refund.</p>

    <title>hotmail account not syncing from my android phone - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            hotmail account not syncing from my android phone</h2>
                    Hello, a couple of days ago my email stopped working on my android phone. I have no problem logging into my hotmail account from my laptop or from my ipad. Is just on my android phone. I have another hotmail account that works perfectly on my phone, the
 problem is with my personal account only, which is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. I tried downloading the hotmail app for android to see if it worked, I got a message saying "internal error 100". I had no problem accesing a different hotmail account with that app,
 the problem is specific to my account only. Please let me know if there is a problem with the account. Thank you<br />

There does however seem to be an increase in the number of people reporting this. &nbsp;It is fairly obvious there is a problem with mobile devices logging on.<br />

&nbsp;if you are having an issue please report it on the status page, it is the fastest way to give them feedback</b></div>
