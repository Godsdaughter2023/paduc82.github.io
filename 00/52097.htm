<h2>            this service isn&#39;t available right now-please try again later in Windows 10</h2>
                    I just recently bought a new laptop, when asked to sign in, I forgot my Microsoft account password, so I used my Skype instead, but it has a really long password for it, so I decided to try and change my laptop's password, but when I tried, it gave the
 message "this service isn't available right now please try again later" So then I decided to try the facial recognition sign-in but it said I needed a PIN so I tried to create one and once again, it said "this service isn't available right now please try again
 later" instead! I can't change any of my laptop's account and I've tried a bunch of things listed for Windows 8, but none of them have worked!<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a lot of reasons why this issue might occur. One of which is poor Internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing we need to do is check our Internet connection. Make sure that we are connected to the Internet before making changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we are connected to the Internet, Microsoft server might be down. We just need to monitor and give ample time and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other concerns, don't hesitate to get back to us.</p>

            My original question may have been a bit misleading. I have actually tried dozens of times, each when my laptop has internet connection, and at different places using different internet connections as well. I have even tried it a few times while using
 the internet for other things, just to make sure I was connected. I have been trying it at least a few times each week since I bought my laptop about a month ago, and yet I have never been able to change any of my personal settings due to the service not being
 available. Is there a specific time when the Microsoft server is up such as before 5 pm or something? Or will I have to bring my computer into Best Buy or some other place so they can try to fix it?

                    <p>My account was recently Permanently banned from xbox. The account&nbsp;in&nbsp;question is deathshot657,&nbsp;I have submitted a case review and it was well reviewed,&nbsp;my account was permanently banned for refunding charges or "Charge-backs" as the enforcement team calls them, now the only reason that I refunded these charges was because someone kept getting a hold of my cards (and for a little background I don't have any children who could be stealing from me and none of my IRL&nbsp;friends play xbox).&nbsp;&nbsp;Now&nbsp;every-time there were fraudulent charges on a certain card I would get a new card and the weird thing is I would get charges on those cards as well, cards I had never even put on xbox, cards I had never even used IRL.</p><p><br /></p><p>Now I understood that getting a refund was wrong but whoever was stealing from me was taking hundred of dollars at single intervals and I needed that money&nbsp;to pay&nbsp;for food and bills so that's why I refunded those charges.

            <p>What you should have done was contact Xbox support to report the charges as fraudulent and asked then to refund it.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you went directly to your bank and made the chargeback then to the enforcement team it would look like you were trying to steal(not saying you were)&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>The enforcement team doesnt use the forums and the only way to contact them would be through the case review process.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>If you already did that and they upheld their decision then there is nothing else you can do at this point.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#34;creation of the video preview failed&#34; for both USB webcam and DV camera &#40;firewire&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Device Manager reports both devices "working properly" but all attempts to use them fail no matter what software package I use.&nbsp; The error varies with the software package.&nbsp; Attempting to preview video via "My Computer" results in the "creation of the video
 preview failed" error.</p>
<p>Both devices used to work many months ago but I can't remember exactly when they stopped working.&nbsp; A Service Pack update or some other Windows Update may have caused the problem (not sure).</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>[My System: Windows XP (Media Center Edition), Service Pack 3, Dell Dimension, Intel Core2, 1 GB RAM]</p>

<p>Nevermind, it's working now.&nbsp; For those with the same problem, here's what I did to fix it.</p>
<p>1 - Grab Roman Ryltsov's DirectShowSpy.dll from http://alax.info/blog/777 and at a command prompt type "regsvr32 DirectShowSpy.dll" to register it.&nbsp; (I actually used an earlier incarnation, also by Roman Ryltsov, called FilterGraphSpy.dll that I had previously
 downloaded).</p>
<p>2 - Try using your webcam or DV camera again.&nbsp; If it works, you may want to uninstall DirectShowSpy.dll by typing "regsvr32 /u DirectShowSpy.dll".&nbsp; My camera and webcam continued to function properly after I uninstalled FilterGraphSpy.dll.</p>
<p>That's it.&nbsp; Though I've done some DirectShow programming, I don't know the detailed reasons behind why this would clear this specific problem.&nbsp; Roman might.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

<p>Hi Praseetha,</p>
<p>I ran a Microsoft diagnostic test on my sound and playback. As my problem related to the earphone device, I chose to run a scan on my Speakers Realtek 5-USB PnP sound device. The results came back and suggested that I make the sound device my default. I
 am uncertain as to why? because my default had always been on the Speakers Realtek High Definition Audio. I went into the control panel and changed the default in my Sound; it immediately began to work.</p>
<p>Thank you for your followup.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            I AM NOT RUSSIAN, WHY IS IT RUSSIAN&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I have nothing against Russians, however turns out my e-mail for XBL was hacked and they changed everything around, my actual e-mail account is now fixed, new password, security question, etc, but now my xbox.com is in Russian, and I don't know how
 to change it, please help, I don't like trying to use a website in a language I don't understand, the only way I'm getting around right now is because I use Google Chrome as my web browser and so it auto-translates the website to English</p>

<h2>            Desktop shortcuts in Edge browser</h2>
                    <p>I have a rather minor issue compared to some of these download/install problems.&nbsp; But how do I create a plain old shortcut to the desktop from a web page in Edge?&nbsp; The lists of shortcuts do not include that item . . . .&nbsp; I have to be missing something obvious.</p>

            <p>Edge just isn't meant to be a one-to-one feature replacement of IE.&nbsp; That's why IE is still there.&nbsp; They're definitely still taking suggestions for what to build next in Edge (fire up your feedback app or use the uservoice voting website), but they started
 lite, with the ultimate goal of making edge as fast as they can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can definitely tell they started lite.&nbsp; To be fair more options show in edge if you select/highlight something first.</p>

<p>
</p><p>But for this request, you can still create a desktop shortcut with right-clicking to create it.&nbsp; There's also a powerful tip, you can create an edge-specific shortcut (similar to how mailto: opens in your default mail client).</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>May I ask, where did you get this info?...... and where would we find (Tomorrow) this ios file ?...... and will</p>
<p>it work for peoples who already have previously purchased windows 8 ( like me ) and just need the
</p>
<p>( free) upgrade to windows 8.1....who would rather have the install disc.</p>
<p>This morning I already upgraded to windows 8.1 thru my computer's Windows store....but no iso file.....</p>
<p>Microsoft directly installs Windows 8.1 upgrade on your hard drive</p>
<p>Thank You.....( I gave you a Me Too vote).&nbsp;</p>

So, as it stands right now, the app to download the 8.1 ISO is not accepting Windows 8 keys. This is going to change in the future? I would also like an 8.1 ISO disk so I don't have to re-download Windows 8.1 for every computer I have that is eligible for an
 upgrade... that's a waste of time and bandwidth.

<p>Been having issues removing this error message, and "Activate Windows" watermark - As seen there obv. is a product key, but for whatever reason it doesn't work - Im not really familiar with this problem, and would very much like, if someone could guide me
 in the right direction or give me a fix.</p>

            Hi Thomas
<br />
<br />From your screenshot, it is likely that the Windows 10 licence you are running is a volume licence version and is meant to run in a Company or organisation where the activation is re-armed on a regular basis or it is a cracked version of Windows. . . 
<br />
<br />Do you know the history of your PC or version of Windows? 
<br />
<br />Is your PC second hand or Windows was reinstalled by a PC Repair Shop?
<br />
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator' 
<br />
<br />Run or paste this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv 
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of the resulting dialog . . .

            Hi Thomas,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Do following -
<br />
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click on either Powershell (Admin) or Command Prompt (Admin) 
<br />Copy below and paste into Powershell / Cmd windows and Enter 
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />
<br />If you notice the word KMS (Key Management Server), GVLK (Generic Volume License Key ) - 
<br />
<br />It is a volume license key used by organizations and is managed through Key Management System hosted on a centralized server. Hence, you can not use it.
<br />
<br />The key is not a valid key to be used. It is a counterfeit license. You will have to buy a new license for Windows and use that.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.       
        </p>

            Hi Thomas
<br />
<br />Thank you for that screenshot, I think the only option for you to get back to genuine Windows 10 is to backup your data and clean install Windows 10 Home, which I believe is the original version your PC is licenced to . ..

            Yes, since GVLK and KMS are appearing, there is no other option but to buy a Windows 10 license. Best place to buy Windows 10 license is Microsoft Store. Click below to buy it from Microsoft
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/windows</a>
<br />
<br />You will find that there are many online sites selling very cheap licenses, don't fall for them as majority of the times, keys expire after some time.

    <title>Bitlocker drive preparation tool - fail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benneh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bitlocker drive preparation tool - fail</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
So I am trying to enable bitlocker drive encryption on my laptop, which is already running Vista Ultimate x86.&nbsp; I didn't originally intend to, and I knew if I wanted to later, I could allagedly use the Bitlocker drive preparation tool, so I built it with a
 single partition.<br />
<br />
I now want to enable bitlocker, so I downloaded the drive preparation tool, but I when I run it, I get the following error:
<br />
<br />
"The bitlocker Drive Preparation Tool could not find a target system drive.&nbsp; You may need to manually prepare your drive for BitLocker."<br />
<br />
So I dig around, and find this kb article&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/933246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/933246</a><br />
<br />
I tried to manually specify the system drive by running the command line: "<span>BdeHdCfg.exe -target c: shrink -newdriveletter x: -size 1500 -quiet -restart" but it just runs for a few seconds and then returns to the command prompt, so
 I check the event log and find an entry under event viewer, applications and services logs, Microsoft, Bitlocker-DrivePreparationTool, Admin and found event (error event id 1) similar to what I saw in the gui about not finding a system drive.&nbsp; Under the operational
 event folder I found event ID 4104,&nbsp;"<span>A volume failed to meet the requirements for a target volume. Volume: C: Reason: The target volume cannot shrink by the requested size. "<br />
<br />
So in the aforementioned kb article, my error message appears with some suggested resolutions: "Temporarily disable hibernation option and hard disk paging. Then, use the Windows Preinstallation Environment to delete the Hiberfil.sys file and the Pagefile.sys
 file. Restart the computer in Windows Vista. Then, run the BitLocker Drive Preparation Tool again." OR "Reinstall Windows Vista."<br />
<br />
So obviously I tried the first suggestion, disabling hibernate using "powercfg -h off" and deleted the hiberfil.sys file, disabled a paging file under system properties and deleted the "pagefile.sys", and rebooted.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Still the same error occurs :(</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Is the second course of action "Reinstall Windows Vista" serious?&nbsp; I want to enable drive encryption, it shouldn't be this hard.&nbsp; I don't think requiring people to reinstall just because an application can't function in a
 reasonable way be an excuse...</span></span></p>

            Hi benneh,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the KB article you posted there are two different&nbsp;scenarios listed that could cause the error message:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"The bitlocker Drive Preparation Tool could not find a target system drive.&nbsp; You may need to manually prepare your drive for BitLocker."<br />
<br />
In your post you referenced&nbsp;scenario 2 and the steps you took to resolve it, but you didn't reference&nbsp;scenario 1 which is as follows:<br />
<br />
Scenario 1: You do not have sufficient free disk space
"At least 10 percent of the active partition must remain free after the partition size is reduced by 1.5 gigabytes (GB). To resolve this error, move files to another partition or delete files."<br />
<br />
Just to&nbsp;be sure that this is not the reason for your issue; after subtracting the 1.5 GB size reduction from your total hard drive space will you still have the required 10 percent of free space left on the active partition?&nbsp; Please let us know.&nbsp; Thank you.<br />

<p>Signing in has no effect at all on your ability to send or receive mail. It simply determines which contacts list and calendar to load.</p>
<p>

<p>Yes, that is the current version. The KB3093594 update is/was not included in the program installer, and it is no longer available from Windows Update.</p>

<p>Installing KB3093594 using the patch downloaded&nbsp;before 17 December 2015 would bring the installation up to build 3563. The patch that was available 17 December 2015 - 1 February 2016 brought the installation up to build 3564. This solved the problem of program
 crash when updating the calendar on Windows 10, but not much else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'd like you to confirm that, when using Windows Live Mail 2012 v. 16.4.3528.0331, you're now able to synchronize mail, calendar and contacts with your Hotmail account that has been upgraded to Outlook Mail. This shouldn't be possible; the whole purpose
 of the bungled update was to <em>make</em> it possible.</p>

            <p>I can confirm this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On about 3/3/2016, I suddenly experienced WLM repeatedly crashing when trying to update a calendar change I had made. Every time I would restart it, it would crash in about fifteen seconds as it tried to communicate with he servers. &nbsp;This allowed me the
 time to log out of my Hotmail account on WLM (this is only for the calendar and contacts) and once logged out, WLM worked fine for email but not the calendar or contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had downloaded and installed the patch back in December. &nbsp;The only trouble I was having up until this point was the issue with all of my sent email showing the sender's name where the recipient should be that everyone else is having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wiped WLM from my system just now an re-installed it. I now am back to&nbsp;16.4.3528.0331 and everything works.... and I mean everything. Sent items now appear correctly in that folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a feeling that MS, once they realized their update was a huge failure.... went back to the original format for the Hotmail servers in the meantime while they try and fix it. IF they're trying to fix it.</p>

    <title>PES 2019 &#34;Test NAT Type&#34; Issue on XBOX One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diogoschmitt  say:</h3>
<h2>            PES 2019 &#34;Test NAT Type&#34; Issue on XBOX One</h2>
                    <p>Hello, Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with Pro Evolution Soccer 2019, specifically on online gameplay. Currently on XBOX One, during an online match, whenever a player uses the "Test NAT Type" option on settings, the connection gets voided and no win or loss is awarded to any
 player, as the game has trouble identifying who got disconnected. This results in many people using this option to cheat, whenever they are losing the match.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On other consoles, this is not possible, making the amount of cheaters on Xbox ONE in PES2019 WAAAY bigger than any other console. Konami, the company responsible for the game, does absolutely nothing about it. In many ocasions, I get cheated on back to
 back games, and winning a match depends not only on you, but on the honesty of your opponent. In about 80 online matches, I've been cheated 18 times, and absurd amount of times. Me and the entire community of PES2019 playes are well aware of this, as is Konami.
 It's been known among us that if you wish to play PES2019 online <em><strong>[Mod Removed - Xbox Forum Guidelines.]</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything that can be done by Microsoft Support on that case, since Konami does not care at all? I really want to keep playing on Xbox, as I like the console very much, but it's getting infuriating to try to play PES2019, my favorite game.</p>

<div>
</div>
<div>
<p>I am using Windows 8.1 Pro, 32bit.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<p>I have also Shadow Defender installed, with "Enter Shadow Mode on boot"</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Now, what folders do I need to exclude on Shadow Defender so I can update Windows Defender on Shadow Mode? I have excluded the C:\Program Files\Windows Defender but still when I update on Shadow Mode and exit on Shadow Mode, the update is lost (in Normal
 Mode).</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
<p>What registry/folders do I need to also exclude?</p>
<p>I want to update Windows Defender while on Shadow Mode and make those updates permanent.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

</div>
<div>
Please help. Thanks.</div>

<p>Adobe Elements 13 and Paint both use WIA for access and will only read documents not slides or film.

            Hi,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Communities.</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
Yes Windows Image Acquisition does works well with Canon 9000 F Scanner. Here’s a list of software’s that need to checked for the proper functionality of the scanner:</div>
<div><br />
<a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/scanners/canoscan_series/canoscan_9000f?selectedName=DriversAndSoftware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/scanners/canoscan_series/canoscan_9000f?selectedName=DriversAndSoftware</a>
<div><br />
Make sure these software are installed and then you will be able to scan slides to your computer with this scanner.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There’s a small video demonstration of how to do it on the same page as well. It will help you understand it better.
<div><br />
Do reply us back about the status of the issue. We’ll help you further.</div>

            <p>Thank you I have downloaded the suggested software and&nbsp; I can now acquire slides or film in Canon My Image Garden and my old Photoshop Elements 9. However I cannot acquire slides in Photoshop Elements 13 which I have just purchased or in Microsoft Paint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In addition CanonScan Toolbox and Canon MP Navigator will not&nbsp; access scanner. Produce message "Unable to select TWAIN source"</p>
<p>Canon are completely unhelpful.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Thank you very much for your kind response.</p>
<p>I will try your suggestions a little later.</p>
<p>Response to your questions.</p>
<p>I can open these documents in Word and their behavior seems normal, until I try to close and then it tells me that the file cannot be modified, as if they had been password protected. I
 never, never, ever password protect anything because after a while you end up losing the file.</p>
<p>All other attempts to act on the file (move, delete, rename) come back with a box telling me to close the file.</p>

            <p><span>I apologize for giving an assumption that sounded correct, but was not.</span></p>
<p><span>The “.doc” Word file problem is with all documents created after a given date, not clearly determined yet.</span></p>
<p><span>Every document created (saved) after a certain date has the same weird behavior.</span></p>
<p><span>The file can be opened, modified and closed like a normal Word document.</span></p>
<p><span>However, the file cannot be operated upon successfully from Windows Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>It is not possible to rename, move, delete, etc. neither the file nor the folder where it is located.</span></p>
<p><span>This situation is a cancer that grows as I do work on more and more new unmanageable files.</span></p>

            What error message do you receive after rebooting and then using the delete key? &nbsp;Make sure you don't open the files first, or the program that reads them may lock them and force you to have to reboot again.

            You're right it absolutely should. &nbsp;Are you positive the error message doesn't say 'access denied' instead of 'file open'?
<div><br />
<div>You might try either deleting from the command prompt, (the command is "del <i>
filename</i>" or possibly booting into Safe Mode and try from there (in safe mode, no program should be able to lock the file because only essential processes are running).</div>

<p><span>This is really dismal. I have worked my head off without results, and what is worse, I have no clue as to the cause or the way this problem
 arises.</span></p>
<p><span>Other than you, I have had beginner’s suggestions that had been tried before I posted the question(s) I have asked.</span></p>
<p><span>List of things I have done:</span></p>
<p><span>Restored the Windows Image to a previous back up.</span></p>
<p><span>Using “AVG” antivirus I scanned the whole system for viruses.</span></p>
<p><span>Uninstalled AVG, installed “Bit Defender”, scanned the entire system and found one Trojan virus.</span></p>
<p><span>Since I have all my data on an external removable disk, I took it to another computer and worked on the troublesome files.</span></p>
<p><span>On my “main” faster SONY computer I use Windows 7 enterprise 64 bit version and Office 2010.</span></p>
<p><span>On my “back up” SONY computer I use Windows 7 enterprise 32 bit version and Office 2003.</span></p>
<p><span>On the “small” computer I was able to manually repair all the damage caused in the tribes and retries done previously on the “big” computer.</span></p>
<p><span>To accomplish these tasks it was necessary to back up large sections of the disk.</span></p>
<p><span>After the corrections were made in the “small” computer, the files were brought to the “big” computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Sickening, to find out that the problem still comes up on the “big” computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Would it be possible that I am overlooking some obvious reason or solution?</span></p>
<p><span>At this point I have to thank you for the suggestions you have made and the hope that you can suggest an answer as to how to learn how this
 problem came about and most importantly, how this problem can be prevented.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As an aside comment (relevant or not) I have to say that it is not easy to control rage against Microsoft that forced (blackmailed) me into
 buying Office 2010 which I did not need just to be compatible with a totally unnecessary new word format so that I can process mails from customers.
</span></p>
<p><span>I still have difficulty doing things with the new Word that used to do in my sleep with word 2003.</span></p>
<p><span>To add insult to injury now Office 2010 seems to be creating unmanageable files. Files that can be successfully processed in Word 2003.</span></p>
<p><span>I have to ask (at least in my mind) who is going to pay for all the time I have spent learning a totally unnecessary Office 2010 and who
 is paying for all the time spent debugging Microsoft products?</span></p>
<p><span>I had to put aside most of my work to dedicate it to this issue.</span></p>

<p>getting skpe working is critical for my users. Has anyone seen this before? I tried to override RDP settings in the registry, by creating a key called&nbsp;AuthenticationLevelOverride to zero and that didn't help. I tried reinstalling skype for business plug
 in and web app. We do not use an OCS server here or any other telephony.&nbsp; We tried in IE 11 Firefox and chrome. The site shows the same behavor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? This was tried on at least 6 different domain computers.</p>

    <title>Xbox Live Account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Live Account</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>So I haven't been on Xbox Live in a few months, and when I attempted to sign into my account I was prompted for the email address and password for the Microsoft account associated with my Gamertag. My email address was accepted, but when I entered my password
 I got this error message: 8015D002. So far I have changed my password twice with no success.</p>
<p>Furthermore, signing in online with the same info results in me signing into an account with the same exact name as my old one, minus the last letter and all of the info on it. I was actually able to download this new account on my console via Xbox live
 using the same information that wouldn't work for my old account.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any idea of what's going on?</p>

<p>Hello there Ultra :),</p>
<p>That error code that you are providing means that the account does not exist. If you are certain that it did please try these suggestions:</p>
<p><strong>Solution 1: Did you recently sign up for two-step verification?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If you recently turned on two-step verification, you may not know how to sign in to apps or devices that don't accept security codes. Some apps (like the mail apps on some smartphones) and devices (like the Xbox 360) can't prompt you to enter a security
 proof when you try to sign in. If you get an incorrect-password error with an app or device, you'll need to create a unique app password to sign in. After you sign in with your app password, you're all set to use that app or device. You’ll use this new app
 password to sign in to your device instead of using your Microsoft account password.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://login.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Sign in</a>&nbsp;to your Microsoft account. </li><li>Under&nbsp;<strong>Password and security info</strong>, tap or click&nbsp;<strong>Edit security info</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
If you're prompted for a security proof, enter it and tap or click Submit. </li><li>Under&nbsp;<strong>App passwords</strong>, tap or click&nbsp;<strong>Create a new app password</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
A new app password is generated and appears on your screen.&nbsp; </li><li>When you’re prompted for your Microsoft account password on your Xbox console, enter the app password that you created online.
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Solution 2: Verify your Microsoft Account security information</strong></p>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit&nbsp;<a href="http://login.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft account</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;If you have forgotten your password or can’t sign in using your password,&nbsp;<a href="http://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset your password</a>.
</li><li>Click&nbsp;<b>Edit security info</b>. </li><li>Verify your security information. For example, verify the&nbsp;<b>Phone number</b>,&nbsp;<b>Alternative email address</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>Security question</b>&nbsp;information.
</li><li>Sign out of your Microsoft account and then sign in again. </li><li>Try to sign in to Xbox Live again. </li></ol>
<div>
<p><b>Solution 3: Delete and re-download your Xbox Live profile</b></p>
<p>For help, see&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download, move or delete your Xbox Live profile</a>.</p>
<div>
<p><b>Solution 4: Clear the system cache</b></p>
<p>To clear the system cache, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the&nbsp;<b>Guide</b>&nbsp;button on your controller, select&nbsp;<b>Settings</b>&nbsp;and then select&nbsp;<b>System Settings</b>.
</li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Storage</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>Memory</b>. </li></ol>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Highlight any storage device, and then press&nbsp;<b>Y</b>&nbsp;on your controller. (It doesn't matter which storage device you select; the cache will be cleared for all storage devices.)
</li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>Clear System Cache</b>. </li></ol>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5.When prompted to confirm storage device maintenance, select&nbsp;<b>Yes</b>.</div>
<p>Hope that one of these solutions will help you :)</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This information is a nice cut/paste deal. Which is a handy thing for problems that persist across many forums, but there are other steps you should make sure of if that doesn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Xbox.com / live.com etc have a minimum password length of 8 characters but they don't have a maximum number of characters.The Xbox unit also has a minimum of 8 characters for the XBL password but has a maximum of 12 characters. As such you should
 make sure that your password fits the length minimums/maximums to work on both. This is one of many answers to this error code that seems to be quite common.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Another would be to simply delete and redownload your profile to your xbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If 1 doesn't work it wouldn't hurt to try them all. If they all fail it may be an issue that isn't so simply fixed and you'll have to call customer service to have them look deeper into your account details and see if there is a problem somewhere
 that can't be fixed from your home.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hope what little information we all here can provide you gets you up and gaming again soon.</p>

<p>So thanks for the responses guys. Unfortunately, none of your suggestions worked. I haven't tried deleting and redownloading my account, but only because attempting to input my Microsoft account information resulted in the downloading of the alternate account
 I mentioned and I don't want to risk loosing my account entirely.</p>

<p>If that is the case then I would suggest contacting Official xbox support directly on the issue at
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a> and explain your issue to them and they will most likely be able to help you and if you feel it is necessary you can ask to be escalated to the Advocacy
 Team if they don't do so during their troubleshooting steps as they specialise in this kind of issue. Let them know you followed all the steps on the
<strong>Error code search</strong>&nbsp;so they don't repeat those steps to you. Good luck with your issue :)</p>
