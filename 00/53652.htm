    <title>Windows 8 fails to start &#91;Check Media Fail&#93; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8 fails to start &#91;Check Media Fail&#93;</h2>
                    Almost every time I restart my computer the OS (windows 8) fails to load. Instead I am greeted with this message "Check Media: Fail". I cannot boot into windows period when it does this. Through some fiddling I've come to realize that if I attempt to do
 a repair the error message that I get is "The hard drive is locked" or something to that effect. If I attempt to do a clean install, it will not detect any HDD, when I move to load the HDD driver from a USB the HDD then shows up. When I cancel this and click
 exit to Windows 8, the system loads as normal and everything seems fine. My drivers are up to date, I have formatted the drive and restored from a system image but the same error still arises if I shut down again.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Additional info: &nbsp;</div>
<div>The system uses a standard HDD being used in tandem with a SSD through Intel Rapid Storage Technology</div>
<div>BIOS Mode is set to UEFI</div>
<div>Secure Boot is enabled<br />
&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Summary:</div>
<div>Windows 8 fails to load as if there is no OS detected</div>
<div>If I load the HDD driver the system then functions as normal</div>
<div>It appears as though the HDD driver is somehow being overwritten with each reboot</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any Ideas beyond Nuking the system and starting from scratch?</div>
</div>
                </div>

            <p>I am also having this same error appear upon boot up.&nbsp; The screen says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"checking media" and after about 20 seconds it says "fail"&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It does this twice and then boots up to completion.&nbsp; I think it has something to do with Windows 8 because I had this problem previously and then did the Windows 8.1 upgrade and it fixed the problem.&nbsp; Suddenly the error is back again and I think there must
 have been a scheduled Windows update that had a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried a system restore but it didn't help.&nbsp; I think the only solution is to reinstall Windows.&nbsp; Very frustrating because it takes my laptop so much longer to boot up, not sure if there are any other
 problems with this issue (I haven't noticed any as of yet).&nbsp; My laptop came pre-loaded from Dell so it's not like I have the CDs to reinstall programs and the warranty is no longer!&nbsp; :-(</p>

            <p>always check with the manufacturer of the product you have an issue with. their tech people are usually very knowledgeable and you can usually find the help that you are seeking.
</p>
<p>as for the "checking media - failure" message --&nbsp;I too received that on my dell laptop. it has something to do with the boot menu/order in the bios settings. their is a new term called "eufi" and I noticed there was 2 eufi boot options in front of my hdd
 so I fiddled and moved my hdd in front of them and I fixed the "cm-f" message. with the newer hybrid drives and especially the ssd's there has also been changes in the boot commands, etc.</p>
<p>I am not an expert, that's why I defer to the tech specialists that work for the brands.</p>
<p>good luck and remember if you don't know, there probably is someone available to you that does.</p>

            No such options exist for batch removal. &nbsp;I have THOUSANDS of pictures. &nbsp;I'm not going through them one at a time. This and "how to tag people" are all I can find. &nbsp;I don't want to see this in my photo gallery at all. &nbsp;It's only tagging pictures of my
 ex-boyfriend and my now dead grandmother. &nbsp;Thanks for making me relive my pain, Microsoft.

Windows Failure Scenarios<br />
<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/downloads/FailureScenarios.aspx?displaylang=en<br />
<br />
What do I do if my system fails validation, but I am certain that I purchased/have a genuine copy of Windows?<br />
<br />
When a copy of Windows fails validation, the user is directed to a customized Web page with details about what caused the failure and recommendations for how to fix the problem. This page contains a section with troubleshooting steps. One of these steps will
 let you check to see whether you can use the online Product Key Update Tool. If your computer came with a genuine product key, but Windows was improperly installed using an invalid product key, the Product Key Update Tool helps convert your computer to a genuine
 status without having to purchase a new copy of Windows. If this solution does not work, refer to the instructions above for what to do when your system fails validation.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have heard a lot of people are unable to validate through WGA - what's going on? Is there a system glitch or an error in the validation service?<br />
<br />
The WGA validation process is extremely reliable, but there are times when system or network errors prevent validation from working properly. Validation failure is usually caused by the use of a non-genuine Windows license. In many cases, customers don't know
 they have received a counterfeit copy. Unintentional victims of counterfeit are often surprised by the result and may question the validity of the service. However, WGA has been operating since July 2005 and has validated more than 500 million systems. Microsoft
 investigates all user inquiries about possible errors. When errors occur, we work with our customers to resolve them. Customers who suspect problems with the validation process should follow any on-screen instructions<br />
<br />
Is there a 100% correlation between WGA validation failure and owning a non-genuine copy of Windows? Is it possible to pass WGA validation once and fail later?<br />
<br />
It is possible for users to pass WGA validation once, and then fail later as a result of non-genuine software. Microsoft frequently discovers new keys that are being counterfeited and adds them to the WGA service. After new keys are added to the WGA service,
 a validation result could change.</p>

<h2>            Application has been blocked from accessing Graphic Hardware</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Community,</p>
<p>I have recently purchased Alienware 15 r3 (8 gb ram, 6 gb gtx 1060, i7 7th gen), I haven't installed any games&nbsp; but&nbsp; whenever I start my computer and open Microsoft Edge browser I get following message in notification</p>
<p>"Application MicrosoftEdgeC has been blocked from accessing Graphic Hardware"</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">"Application video.ui&nbsp; has been blocked from accessing Graphic Hardware"</p>
<p>Also whenever I see video on Edge, video does not run it shows empty black / green screen with audio running. Same problem with windows default video player.Also All my drivers are updated.</p>
<p>My screen suddenly goes black and I see some distorted pixels for 1 second and then my laptop brightness increases automatically and then it works normal.</p>
<p>If any one has solution for it then please let me know asap.</p>

            First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />If you have Windows 10 1803 installed:
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Temporary files may consume a huge amount of space in your hard drive. Moving this folder to another location will help you to easily find and delete all your temporary files in order to maximize your system's free space. To rectify this, you can run the
<strong>Disk Cleanup</strong> utility to remove unwanted or incomplete files on your computer to save space. This is designed to free up disk space on a computer's hard drive. This has also been proven to resolve storage errors since it scans and analyzes the
 hard drive for files that are no longer in use. Refer to this article:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/8fef4121-711b-4be1-996f-99e02c7301c2/disk-cleanup-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Disk cleanup in Windows
 10</a></strong> for the simple steps on how to utilize it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, it is best that you scan your computer using the <strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong>. This aids in getting rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. Do not worry as it will work with your existing antivirus software. To download
 it, see this link: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/products/scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong></a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If any bad sectors are found when scanning your hard drive and trying to repair that sector, any data available on that might be lost.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to reply again should you have additional questions.</p>

<h3> questionboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless Network Problems</h2>
                    
<p>I have a new Acer laptop.&nbsp; It will initially&nbsp;connect to my wireless, but then if I hibernate... (and this is intermitent) it will not reconnect.</p>
<p>I've gotten messages that there are no wireless connection (which is not true as there are several)<br />
If I check the device manager everything is in order<br />
When I do a troubleshoot, diagnosis... it always seems to reinitialize the wireless adapter and things go back to normal.<br />
Also, if I do a reboot it will work again.</p>
<p>This is very frustrating and wasting time...&nbsp; My old laptop ran on XP and in 6 years I never had this problem.&nbsp; Does anyone have any ideas on how to put this issue to rest?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Maybe this can Help.</p>
<p>Assuming that the signal is strong, and that there is No electrical environmental noise (<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/wbars.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/wbars.html</a> ).</p>
<p>Uncheck the Network Card's Power Saving (I.e., do not let the card save power).</p>
<p>There might be some variations on where the Power saving setting is.</p>
<p>Here are few examples, YMMV, look around in your systems.</p>

<p>----------------------------</p>
<p>Still a problem?</p>
<p>Check the Router's support, and make sure that your using the latest firmware for the Router.</p>
<p>Check the Computer's manufacturer support site and make sure that you are using the latest Drivers.<br />
<br />
Download the drivers and unpack them to a folder of your choice.<br />
<br />
In the Device manger, right click on the adapter.<br />
<br />
Click on Update Drivers, and choose the Browse my computer for drivers, <br />
<br />
Choose let me pick from a list, Click on&nbsp; Have a Disk and point to the folder with the Drivers.</p>

<p>I check the event logs and below are the ones that may be pertinent to this issue (I think), if anyone can actually understand what they mean.</p>

<p>There is no way to do this in Vista.&nbsp; It's possible some 3rd party programs will work - but most only work with certain keys and the function keys often aren't included.&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent nearly an&nbsp; hour looking and came up with only the following (and&nbsp;one that
 involved extremely advanced registry editing that I did not feel comfortable recommending as even I would have trouble following it).</p>
<p>Here's one program that doesn't specifify any limitations (though that doesn't mean there aren't any):<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/map-any-key-to-any-key-on-windows-xp-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/map-any-key-to-any-key-on-windows-xp-vista/</a>.&nbsp;
 You might want to give it a try to see if it does the trick.</p>
<p>If not, search for "keyboard remapping in Vista" in Bing, Google, <a href="http://www.tucows.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.tucows.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.download.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.download.com</a> to see if you can find some program that will work (and works with Vista).</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

                    What in God's name was Microsoft thinking with Windows 8? And now they want to force this on all new pcs? This is pure junk! It's extremely annoying interface is losing many customers. I spoke to a few people already who bought pcs and want to know how
 to remove windows 8 and put back windows 7...or xp. Shame, shame, shame. Usability testing must have been flawed in the lab on this one.

            Thanks Ken, I have downloaded the classic shell software now and everything is pretty much back to normal . I must agree with the guy that asked the question though, I bought a new laptop today and was flabbergasted to find that the start button had disappeared.
 It's almost as if there was a deliberate attempt to hinder people in changing their settings to get rid of that awful start page, it was the first thing I looked for.<br />
It still rankles that I have had to download third party software (with the risks that entails) just to make my brand new laptop useable though.
<br />
Not your fault Ken, and thanks again for your help.<br />

            <p>Why should I have to buy a product or download a shareware product to make the interface usable for a non touch device?&nbsp;This should be built in.&nbsp;If you&nbsp;are trying to be like Apple, you are succeeding, but for the reasons that put pc's on the desks of most
 businesses. I understand that you must innovate, but you can't at the expense of your base. It seems like Microsoft is out of touch, from the calamitous release of Xbox One, to the complete rejection&nbsp;Windows 8 by the business community, to the lack of VPN
 support in Windows RT, to&nbsp;applications written in&nbsp;Visual Studios that need major updating just to run on IE&nbsp;10, and etc.&nbsp; It seems as though you have completely ignored or are actually trying to drive off your corporate user base.&nbsp; If that is Microsofts strategy,
 great&nbsp;we will move on. If not, you need to take into cosideration how upgrades, changes, loss of existing functionality, etc.&nbsp;are going to effect this segment of your users.</p>

            I completely agree with you. Am actually thinking of finally going over to Linux. W8 on a PC is a complete disaster, unless you turn it's great new features OFF. Who on earth thought it was a good idea to hide everything you need in order to DO anything.<br />
<br />
And why hasn't it occurred to them that after a few years using a particular interface design, it is incredible frustrating and innefficient to have to go back to zero to relearn the interaction from scratch? Seems like Microsoft tend to redesign things for
 the absolute beginner, and there really aren't many of those around.<br />

    <title>My Xbox Home Issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My Xbox Home Issue</h2>
                    
<p>So I have my Xbox Live account link to 3 different systems. Me &amp; my youngest brother under the same roof &amp; another away at college. Everytime my brother in college try to play a game I've downloaded on my account it tells him he can't play because it's not
 his game. My account currently isn't under my home but it's home on their xboxs. So is there a way my account can stay home on his system without him having to switch every other day &amp; not waste my limit usage?</p>

<p>No, you can't get arount it as its a safeguard to prevent unautorized account/game sharing.. in order for your brother to access your games and content without being logged into your account the console he plays on has to be set as your "home console/xbox"
 the three switches per year is to prevent unautorized use of the feature.. as I understand it the home console function is meant to allow sharing of games/content by people living under the same roof.. I would not recomend trying to work around this by giving
 your brother access to your live account as this would fall under the term "account sharing" which is against the tou &amp; coc and will result in an account and/or console ban.</p>

<p>Hi Debra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error usually means a network error occurred between servers on the internet or an issue with the actual server. It means that the server of the site that you are trying to access is taking so long to respond. It could also be an issue with the DNS server
 that you are currently using in the network. That said, we suggest trying to access the site again after a while and see if it is already working. If the issue persists, it would be best to contact the website administrator or your ISP so they could provide
 alternative DNS servers that you can input on your modem or router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're here if you have more queries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

<p>Hi David</p>
<p>After a while I was able to get my emails to open. I think it might just be AOL as they are fixing to end their software any day now. I paid for their service for years even after I got my dsl service from AT&amp;T. Finally cancelled after I got the U-Verse
 and have been using the free AOL. I always had problems with them. Still having some issues with the mail opening. Just seems at times it takes longer. I am able to open emails on my andriod with no problems. Good luck to you.</p>

                    I purchased the Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000 and it worked fine for about 2 months and now I cannot get it to connect to my laptop.&nbsp; I am running 32bit Windows 7 and when I try to add device the device I receive an error message "0x80070005".&nbsp; This makes
 me think it might be a problem with settings on my machine because another mouse I had that worked fine before gives me the same error when I try to connect it.&nbsp; Both mouses are bluetooth and give me the same error message.

Uninstall and reinstall everything and check! <br />
<br />
This is a nice thread to refer. With a similar issue. Without the error message. <br />
<br />
Here's the link - <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/bbfdeb41-c179-41a0-aac4-e94bf1433634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
<br />
I am sure you would have it under warranty still! Get it replaced if nothing works!
<br />
<br />
Also, just in case, try clean boot and check if any 3rd party app is the culprit.

<h2>            Why does wushowhide keep offering a drive update that never appears in Windows Update as available&#63;</h2>
                    Every time I run wushowhide app it lists&nbsp;an update to the driver&nbsp;Microsoft - Printer- 6/21/2006 12:00:00 AM - 10.0.15063.0&nbsp;as available for hiding or downloading. I understand that this driver applies to the "print to pdf" function which I do not use.
 Do not have the print to pdf "printer" installed. Trying to hide this update doesn't work, it just keeps appearing. In the alternative, not hiding it does not result in it being sent to my Windows Update. I would like to hide this update (preferred) or download
 and install it to keep it from constantly being listed in wushowhide.

<p>
</p><p><span>With Windows 10, your device is always kept up to date with the latest features and fixes. Windows Updates are installed automatically, with no need to select which updates are needed or not needed.

</span><span>prior to that change, </span><span>you can follow the instructions in this

<p>Thanks for the quick response. However, I didn't learn anything new as a result. The link you provided covered how to use wushowhide, an app I've been using daily for almost a year. Maybe my description of my issue was not adequate, so I'll try again with
 the whole story.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using wushowhide and metered connection to prevent Windows updates until they have been "cleared" by the Windows Secrets website's Patch Update. I check wushowhide daily to see what updates are offered. Click Advanced, Uncheck automatic, select
 Hide. Usually,&nbsp;there is only a Defender signature update which will download without turning off metered connection. In this case, after closing wushowhide, I go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security and click on Check for Updates, click Download and let it download
 and install. On occasions when&nbsp;wushowhide offers something besides the Defender signatures I hide those items which I don't wish to install at the time, turn off metered connection,then go to Updates to install anything not hidden..</p>
<p>
</p><p>The specific problem I'm having involves the previously-listed printer driver. I first did NOT try to hide it, but it never appeared in Windows Updates, even though metered connection was off. This continued to happen every time I ran wushowhide. Getting
 tired of this, I attempted to hide it. It went to the hidden list, but continued to be offered each time wushowhide was run, but still never appeared in Windows Update for installation. There are currently duplicate entries for this driver in my hidden updates
 list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I can't have it either way. Can't hide it and can't install it. So, what to do?</p>
<p>

<p>I keep seeing the same annoying "update", that never actually updates. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I also use the WUSH tool regularly, as well as have the metered connection scenario, especially ever since the Windows 10 version 1709 fiasco with my PC. You will just have to keep hiding it, just like I have been doing since November 30, 2017.</p>

</p><p>Its annoying, but until Microsoft actually cares enough to actually fix the issue, its the only thing we can do for now.</p>

<p>After searching for more information, I found a webpage that explains that this "update" is actually a "bogus update", that dates back to Windows Vista.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the URL to read more about it:&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/blog/Windows-Enterprise-Desktop/Bogus-Win10-Printer-Update-Alerts</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, it just reiterates what we have both been doing, namely, to keep hiding the unwanted, and unnecessary update. The author goes on to say, that it could actually do more harm than good, for Windows 10. I hope this helps.</p>

            Sorry you're having this problem too, but glad it's not just me and that there is actually someone else using wushowhide and metered connection. I am still holding on 1709 based on recommendation of the folks at Windows Secrets. I have the iso file ready
 to install once I get the go-ahead.

            I don't even bother hiding it anymore. Just let it keep showing as available to hide since it never actually goes to the update offerings.

<h2>            Xbox One on but won&#8217;t do anything</h2>
                    <p>My Xbox One will power on, with the white power light on, but it won’t do anything. The tv doesn’t detect an input source. I’ve checked the tv and the hdmi cable, and they both work. Also, the controller won’t connect to the Xbox. I can turn the Xbox on with the controller, but the controller won’t connect and flashes the middle button light. The Xbox will eject and take cds, and I can hear the cd rom spinning when I put a disc in, but the Xbox won’t do anything else, and the controller still won’t connect.&nbsp;I also can’t turn the Xbox off, unless I hold the power button for 5 seconds. When I press the the button, the sound plays for the Xbox’s turning off, but it stays on.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Closing all programs when exporting with AME or Premiere - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c.whitaker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Closing all programs when exporting with AME or Premiere Pro.</h2>
                    <p>First of all, I will say that none of this happened before the update that windows forced me to do. After the update, I got a bluescreen that said "DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL", but I don't think that's relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that after the update, whenever I'm exporting a video using AME or Premiere Pro, I leave a program called MouseJiggle open. What it does is move the mouse when I'm away to prevent the computer from going into sleep mode. Another strange thing
 that happened after the update is (and it has never done this before) that when I tried to open MouseJiggle, A little box told me that I would need additional software to use that program. I had to download .NET framework before it would run.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I got the framework, MouseJiggle worked perfectly. I started encoding a video with AME, and left the computer. When I came back to it about an hour later, the screen was dark and when I woke the computer up, both AME and MouseJiggle were closed. The
 export had not completed. After many more attempts at encoding the video, I came back to the computer either frozen or the programs closed. One time, the bluetooth mouse wasn't working. Only the keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried to export using Premiere, and it just froze at 5%. I have been told that windows has something that terminates programs if they're consuming too much memory, but that wouldn't explain MouseJiggle closing. Also, since I have Win10 Home Edition,
 I don't have gpedit, and therefore cannot disable it. Keep in mind, NONE of this happened before the forced update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My specs:&nbsp;http://imgur.com/a/ffmKK &nbsp; (I know I'm starving it with 8GB of RAM but it's worked fine before)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not new for Microsoft, I have a new problem with Windows every day. Please help. Thank you in advance.<br />

<h2>            WSRESET isnt working. Windows Store cant download apps</h2>
                    <p>I previously made a post about an error code that came up when trying to install apps. The issue was resolved and has now returned once again. I have tried using WSRESET as administrator, it just stays in that black window and does nothing. Am using your
 windows apps troubleshooter to clear windows store cache, that just says "resolving problems" but has been sitting like that for 20 minutes. So overall, Wsreset.exe doesnt work and my windows store cache may be damaged according to a troubleshooter. When running
 the windows apps troubleshooter, this comes up, but when I click reset and open windows store, it does nothing. Please help.&nbsp;</p>
