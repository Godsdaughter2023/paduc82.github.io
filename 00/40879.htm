<h2>            inactive DLC achievements for Rise of the Tomb Raider</h2>
                    
<p>there is a new DLC for this game "Endurance Mode" that was released on Dec 29th.&nbsp; there was also a Title Update enabling the DLC and adding 10 achievements for 250 GS.&nbsp; however the game's page on xbox.com has not been updated yet.&nbsp; this happened most recently,
 to my knowledge, with Minecraft Story Mode when Episode 3 came out.&nbsp; it took a week or two for them to be added.</p>

<p>please whoever can make this happen sooner, i am waiting to give you my money!&nbsp; here is the thread of people discussing why they have to wait:

http://www.trueachievements.com/forum/viewthread.aspx?tid=752085&amp;anchor=5977883#m5977883</a>&nbsp; here's a thread where we are asking the developers to push the achievements through:

<p>this is pretty unbelievable for what i consider to be the best 360 game of 2015.&nbsp; it's not like this is a dinky windows phone game, this is a top tier release.&nbsp; the xbox one versions always seem to get the new achievements right away.&nbsp; are you trying to
 get people to drop the 360?&nbsp; personally i have both and would like to earn all the achievements for this game on both systems.&nbsp; please whoever can take action on this, let whoever needs to know, that there is an update that is waiting.&nbsp; there should be no
 need to hear from the developers when you already have people actually earning these achievements already, but being unable to sync them to their xbox server saved gamertag...</p>

<p>I came here just for the same thing, this is ridiculous considering the mode is like 3 weeks old and this hasn't been fixed, it puts me off to play the mode at all, and i actually quite liked the short time i spent on it and the whole idea of it.</p>
<p>Plus I wasn't aware of this so I went ahead and unlock the 2 easiest ones, "Nope" and "Well Done", both unlocked but of course it wouldn't count towards my gamerscore or show properly, so i went ahead and deleted my profile, erased cache then recovered my
 profile, the endurance achievements are now locked again and the game actually displayed to have 60 achievements instead of 50, so thinking it was fine now i went to try these two again and they won't unlock at all now. THEN I find out they still aren't on
 xbox.com, and i'm not sure i ruined my chances of getting them for good when (IF) they do add them later.</p>
<p>On top of that I can't download the "Ancient Vanguard" costume that's supposedly included on the season pass without having to pay for it again, but that's another story. Hope this is all fixed by the time the Baba Yaga DLC is out, love the game so much
 but these problems are getting quite annoying</p>

<p>It may be possible that the issue will be fixed once the Baba Yaga DLC is out, but I don't want to get my hopes up. The thing is, the Endurance achievements are avoidable. You can play the mode without challenges enabled and you can avoid unlocking the achievements.
 But since Baba Yaga is story DLC that may not be the case if they forget the achievements for that as well. That Square thread QuickMythril linked is in a forum read by the game's community manager, who reports issues back to Crystal Dynamics. None of the
 reported issues have received attention since early this month, but our problem isn't one that needs a patch to be fixed. The devs are the ones who put the achievements on Xbox.com, so they need to realize they forgot and do it.</p>

<p>What I joke, who's handling this? </p>
<p>Yea the achievements were added, I went ahead to try once again, the two quickest ones, first thing i notice is the challengie "well done" wasn't registering any of the burned smalls animals i had :ara eat, I thought maybe it's because I had greek fire since
 i equipped the card that gives you the codex skills, second thing by accident I got a relic so I couldn't get the "nope" one, however the challenge for nope did register when I escaped I just didn't get the achievement for it, again.</p>
<p>Well I retried, selected "well done" challenge again, "nope" had to cool off, so I left the rest intact, i went with normal fire arrows and noticed the number went up this time, so i kept doing it and realized it wasn't the "well done" challenge the game
 was registering, it was "skillful raider" (Open 5 Codices or Sarcophagi without getting caught in a trap) which was also selected this time, after i finished my run I even got the achievement for it, and i didn't even visit a crypt in my run, let alone open
 a single of those things.</p>
<p>As i said, what a joke. Ruining a great mode with crappy handling.</p>

<p>yeah i am also having trouble. i couldn't get anything to work for WELL DONE. &nbsp;tried using the fire from the fire arrows, not the arrows themselves, and retried that a bunch of times before finally wasting my infinite fire arrow card.</p>
<p>i also noticed the things i was doing did not count towards the in-game challenge tracker, so no idea if the achievements will pop when i do complete them. &nbsp;maybe i was just lucky but NOPE worked for me.</p>
<p>sadly i wasted more time looking at the achievements for the xbox one game. &nbsp;since the achievements are all tied to challenges, and they both have all the challenges i figured it'd be the same. &nbsp;but of course we loyal 360 players still take a backseat the
 xboners who always get more.</p>

<p>"Well done" won't work cause they got it mixed up with "skillful raider", so perhaps doing the task for "skillful raider" will give you well done, I tried "nope" many times and it just don't work, even if I get the challenge confirmation that i did it the
 achievement just won't pop up.</p>
<p>Also yea, as in the main game, xbox360 version has less achievements, but considering how they don't even work right I don't think I care having less.</p>

<p>And I just failed the "happy camper" challenge which is surviving for 5 days by opening the supply box on the snowcat, seems pretty much everything got mixed up, so yea, thanks for that patch crystal/nixxes, well done.

<p>well baba yaga is up and the DLC achievements are all good except for Witch Trials, which requires you to get gold on score attacks for the new DLC levels, of which i believe there are only two. &nbsp;i got gold on both, but no achievement, and no one else on
 trueachievements seems to have it either yet. &nbsp;there are only 28 people tracked with that DLC so far, but it was pretty easy to get gold on both levels, so i imagine the other 5 people who have all other achievements probably tried and failed to unlock it
 as well.</p>

<p>i also got the gold medal on the 3rd Baba Yaga DLC level (first of 3 actually), that only shows up in chapter replay. &nbsp;i remember someone having this issue with the achievement for all bronze in the main game. &nbsp;it still didn't trigger the achievement after
 getting another gold beating my previous score on one of the other Score Attack levels again.</p>
<p>the Endurance Mode achievements are still all messed up:</p>
<p>Happy Camper (survive 5 days) will fail if you open the snowcat, but doesn't count up to 1 on the tracker after the first day.</p>
<p>Nature Retreat (survive 7 days) does keep count, but fails if you drop to freezing.</p>
<p>Who Needs A Map (locate 5 crypts) doesn't track at all.</p>
<p>Master Archaeologist (collect 10 artifacts) does not track and did not unlock when i reached 10.</p>
<p>Fast Reflexes (destroy 3 spike traps after being caught in them) does not track. &nbsp;i even tried destroying them after they finished triggering and i didn't get hit. &nbsp;obviously "being caught in them" must just mean to trigger them as being fully caught means
 you die. &nbsp;and the picture shows her shooting them as they come down.</p>
<p>Well Done (eat 5 small animals killed with fire) does not seem to track no matter what kind of fire you use to kill the animal.</p>
<p>Skillful Raider (open 5 final chests without being caught in a trap) does not seem to work either. &nbsp;assuming again that being caught means triggering them. &nbsp;i have not yet actually gotten one final chest without having triggered any traps, but it doesn't
 say Failed when i do trigger one, so i thought maybe it counts per crypt. &nbsp;i did manage to complete a crypt and get the final chest without triggering any traps in that crypt, but my count did not increase.</p>
<p>Vacation (escape after 7 days) &amp; Great Haul (escape after 10 days with 10 artifacts) both just said In Progress the whole time. &nbsp; however someone on trueachievements said they died purposefully on the 2nd day and got both of these and did not get Skillful
 Raider though they should have.</p>
<p>the same person said they got Skillful Raider by choosing that challenge as well as Well Done, completing the requirements for Well Done and then leaving the forest. &nbsp;so clearly there are some issues with the challenges that are also affecting the achievements.</p>
<p>the only one that seems to be ok is Nope (escape on day 1 with no artifacts). &nbsp;i had no problems with that one.</p>

            <p>A project file (.mswmm in the classic versions / .wlmp in the latest versions) is only part of what you need to edit a movie.&nbsp; You also need the original source files (videos, photos, music).&nbsp; I like to think of the project file like a recipe.&nbsp; But like
 a recipe, a project isn't much good without the actual ingredients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you open up the project file, do you at least see all the rectangles representing the source files?&nbsp; Do they show Red Xs or Yellow triangles?&nbsp; If so, just double-click on one and navigate to where the source file exists on your computer.&nbsp; That will
 reconnect the project with the source file so it shows again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't have the original source files, there isn't much you can do.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor can you use your final movie to&nbsp;get back to the original source files.&nbsp; That would be like&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;unbake a cake to get back to the original flour, eggs, water, etc.</p>

            You are right, but that is not my problem. &nbsp;There were no red xs. &nbsp;And my video is all there. &nbsp;It just doesn't display in the storyboard tiles as I would expect.
<div><br />
<div>I have found a work around that I don't even know if I can explain. &nbsp;The answer came through the version of Movie Maker available on my 2013 Windows software and not through 6.0.
<div><br />
<div>I am learning to deal with the way the storyboard shows up - 1 tile for each second the image will show. &nbsp;Inserting video and editing music is much harder in the newer version. &nbsp;What I could alter with the slider bar and insert now requires more work,
 but I am making my way through.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>In Windows Movie Maker 6.0, can you explain (or show with an image) what is not displaying the way you expect?&nbsp; It's possible you are in a storyboard mode rather than a timeline view, or vice versa.&nbsp; Just click the choice by the storyboard/timeline (or press
 Ctrl+T) to toggle to the other state.&nbsp; Also, you can expand that area with the zoom icons (+/- magnifying icons) or by dragging the divider to give more room to the storyboard/timeline area.&nbsp; You can also expand the video track by clicking the + icon on the
 left end of the track.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, if you are okay with continuing to work with the newer Movie Maker 2012, then I guess making it work in WMM 6.0 is moot.</p>

            <p>In the latest versions, Microsoft has replaced the traditional timeline (from WMM 6.0 and earlier) with the hybrid wrapped storyboard/timeline that you now see.&nbsp; There is a zoom slider in the lower right that can vary your view from a storyboard (slider
 to the far left) where each clips is shown as one thumbnail, to a timeline (slider to the far right) where each clip is shown as a rectangle representing the duration of the clip.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I find I have to sometimes slide the zoom slider back and forth depending on the editing function I'm performing and the level of detail I want.&nbsp;One feature I truly miss in the new design is the ability to drag two clips over each other to transition between
 them. This would also allow one to easily change the duration of a transition.&nbsp;You can still do this by adding a transition then going to the ribbon and setting the new duration, but I miss the "organic" way of doing it before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In any case, please feel free to post back with your experiences on the newer version and any other questions you may have.&nbsp; And if you have feedback suggestions, submit them to

<h2>            Stuck at 89&#37; while updating to 1903</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>My problem is that when Windows tries to update, the updates get stuck at 89%, lock up, and then undo themselves. I have tried the troubleshooter, and unplugging any external hard drives. Then I spoke to a Windows Advisor who told me
 to run a scan with the System File Checker. That returned no errors. He transferred me to a Windows Advocate who went in through Logmein and she deleted a bunch of temporary files and then downloaded the Windows Update Assistant All of these don’t fix the
 problem. I’ve spent the majority of the day trying to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edition: Windows 10 Home</p>

            Hi Justin. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I would manually upgrade to the latest version 1903 by opening the Media Creation Tool from this link:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>, choose Download Tool Now, then open the tool and choose Upgrade This PC Now.   This saves your files, apps and most settings in place, is the most stable method to change versions, brings your Updates current, resolves most problems.
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If the Version has problems I will work with you to try to resolve them. If the problems are intractable, you have ten days to roll it back in Recovery settings.  
<br />
<br />Most problems are resolved by doing this gold standard Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> . So read it over and see if its something you want to learn to do. 
<br />  
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />No exact error could be traced in the log except for a time error.
<br />
<br /> Error converting install time 9/2/2018 to structure[gle=0x00000057]
<br />
<br />Wild guess, is the system date, time and formats correct?

            There's something more you should know. At 57%, the computer attempts to restart, but hangs on a black screen. I slept through an attempted update only for a black screen to greet me this morning. To get the update to continue, I had to shut it down completely

            The documentation states the following:
<br />
<br />
<br />A rollback occurred due to a driver configuration issue.
<br />Installation failed during the second boot phase while attempting the MIGRATE_DATA operation.
<br />
<br />This can occur due to incompatible drivers. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Typically, there is a dump file for the crash to analyze. If you are not equipped to debug the dump, then attempt the following basic troubleshooting procedures:
<br />
<br />Make sure you have enough disk space.
<br />If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates.
<br />Try changing video adapters.
<br />Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates.
<br />Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing.
<br />
<br />I suspect it is a video driver issue as you say you see a black screen. Please check for updates for the same and if not, I would suggest you to stick to 1809 in the meantime.

            Hi,
<br />
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>

<br />
<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.
<br />

                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am using&nbsp;Window Vista on my laptop. Its quite&nbsp;some time I haven't use my DVD/CD drive. Today I try to use but cannot read any CD or DVD. I had try to solve the problem by update the drive but still cannot fix. Then I use Microsoft FIX IT support from microsoft
 but the probelm still there.<br />
<br />
Its say: Window cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damage (Code 19).<br />
<br />
Click "check for soluton" to send data about this device to Microsoft and to see if there is a solution available.
<br />
I did but outcome is COULD NOT LOAD DRIVER SOFTWARE.<br />
<br />
Please inform what should I do?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
It is very rare for the methods in the 1st reply above not to solve a Code 19 issue.<br />
<br />
You could have drive issue as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD burn and CD and
<br />
DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others do so properly.
<br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some registry entries<br />
that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause. <br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the correct<br />
Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course as there will
<br />
other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD drive from<br />
someone with the same model.<br />
<br />

<p>Ciao Michele, </p>
<p>
</p><p>you&nbsp;are writing in the&nbsp;Italian section ot the&nbsp;community, If you need to communicate in english you have to post your question
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us?auth=1">
here</a>, we should&nbsp;write in Italian here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Detto questo, Windows non supporta nativamente la funzione di cambio colore delle cartelle e se hai difficoltà ad utilizzare un software probabilmente troverai più informazioni contattando direttamente il produttore di tale app, personalmente ti sconsiglio
 di utilizzare software esterni per la personalizzazione del sistema in quanto spesso sono software in avvio automatico e influiscono negativamente sulle prestazioni oltre che esporti a potenziali rischi per la sicurezza.</p>

    <title>PC upgrade invalidating Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> navagon  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC upgrade invalidating Win 10</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 from a boxed retail copy of Windows 7. Using Win7 I could install it on any computer I liked just so long as it was only on that one computer. So naturally I expected the Win10 upgrade that was foisted on me to reflect this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when I upgraded my PC and moved my drive containing the Win10 install over to the new computer it decided that it wasn't genuine anymore insisted on payment. Then after a restart simply locked me out of my machine with a password that wasn't there
 before. I have since formatted and reinstalled Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there's the question not only of whether or not I can get Windows 10 back, but more importantly one of if it's even worth getting back. If all copies of Win10 are like this and there is nothing that offers the same rights as a retail copy then I'd almost
 rather not bother and use Win 7 until it's obsolete and consider my options again then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can offer some insight into the situation it would be much appreciated.<br />
</p>

            <p>Windows 10 is not like previous versions of Windows, it is tied to the architecture of one PC and a unique identifier for that PC is stored on the Microsoft Servers, it then has a digital entitlement to be installed on that PC. So it can be activated many
 times on that PC, but no other PC, unless you buy a volume licence.</p>

            So there are only OEM copies and MS is foisting this on people even though it represents a significant reduction in consumer rights? I smell a class action lawsuit in the making. No matter how many times they lose, MS don't learn do they?

            <p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case, since you upgraded from a retail copy, you have a one time transfer right, which permits reactivation using the Windows 7 product key.</p>

<p>Hello Megs,</p>

</p><p>Here is a guide to getting a callback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you go to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://support.xbox.com/contact-us">
Contact Us</a> :<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1 ----select Xbox One</li><li>Step 2 ----select no thanks</li><li>Step 3-----select games</li><li>Step 4 ----select request a call from support</li></ul>
<p>Once they call explain thee issue and they will be able to help you. Being it not an Xbox issue they will most likely transfer you to Microsoft, but it definitely a way to get someone.<br />

<h2>            Cannot download Gears 1 and 3 codes</h2>
                    <p>So a friend gave me a Gears 3 download from his Gears of War 4 pre order. He is located in the U.S and I am in Germany. My xbox and my website region language and location is that of the United States.</p><p>Today, I received two codes from Xbox Live for my Gears 4 purchase. The codes were for Gears 1 and 2. However, I&nbsp;was only able to download Gears 2 but got the same message for 1 as I did for 3. Anyone else have this problem?</p><p>Ref #:&nbsp; <span>1360427317</span></p>

            <p>Region locking is the issue actually. Not all of the Gears games are region locked which is why some will work, but not all. Gears 1 is not available for download in Germany so it won't work. Gears 3 should work if you set your account region to Germany. Your account region has to match your physical location in order to download region locked games.</p>

    <title>How do I stop Windows Update Assistant from existing&#63; And how do I - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael gecko  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I stop Windows Update Assistant from existing&#63; And how do I keep my compter from installing updates&#47;restarting&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so I've been having issues with my computer recently. I have another open question on the forums here regarding that. Basically, it gets stuck in a boot loop that I (mostly) can't find a way out of. However, twice now, my computer has managed to restart
 normally-ish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time that my computer restarted normally-ish, I uninstalled the Windows Update Assistant. It always fails to update anything, and always bogs down my computer before it ultimately restarts it. I don't know what's wrong with the program, but it
 never does anything good. It's cancer for my computer. But guess what? Just like cancer sometimes does, it came back. And killed my computer. However it works that it goes ahead and reinstalls itself is just stupid.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, back in the boot loop, and with no helps from my other question posted here, I messed around long enough to eventually get it to restart a second time normally-ish. Now that's where I'm at. I don't want my computer to do anything to itself. I don't want
 to turn it off or have itself turn itself off, I don't want updates, I don't want cancerous Update Assistants installs themselves, etc. etc. Ideally, this would be a temporary situation until I can figure out how to fix everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to do this without having to possibly restart or ...something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, help.. I don't know what to do at this point!</p>

            This is a known issue in which the previously hidden recovery partition become visible. The solution is as follows<br /><br />Although you can safely ignore these partitions, if you prefer do away with the low disk space warnings and hide the partitions so they no longer appear in File Explorer, you can do so by manually removing the partition’s assigned drive letter. To do this: <br /><br />1. In Cortana, type cmd and press Enter. Then right-click Command Prompt in the search results and select Run as administrator. <br /><br />2. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type diskpart and press Enter. <br /><br />3. Type list volume and press Enter. <br /><br />4. Make note of the volume number for the drive letter you want to remove. For example, if the drive letter you want to remove is Drive “E”, note the volume number for Drive E. <br /><br />5. Type the following command, and press Enter. <br /><br />select volume &lt;volume number&gt; <br /><br />When typing this command, in place

            This is a known issue with 1803. It has been happening with new update that new drive is getting uncovered and you start getting low space notifications. You can do following to hide it and there will be no harm anywhere.
<br />
<br />Type diskpart in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) &gt; Right click on Diskpart and Run as Administrator
<br />Give following command and Enter: 
<br />select volume f
<br />Give following command and Enter:

            Hi Annette, this is a known issue in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />In the second Command Window, run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />select volume F
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />remove letter=F
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt 
<br />
<br />That's It!       
        </p>

<h3> jetta48  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will Photoshop CS4 work in Windows7 64-Bit&#63;</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I want to know if Photoshop CS4 will work in Win 7 64-Bit.<br />
<br />
I have tried the MS compatibility site, but it's not listed one way or the other - which seems a major omission for such an important program.<br />
<br />
I can't find any info on the Adobe website.<br />
<br />
I don't want to spend loads money on Photoshop if it won't work.<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            Hi Sai.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Are you running under an Adminstrative account?  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-account-type-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-...</a>
<br />
<br />You  may need to right click the Setup or .exe  file to Run as Administrator to get elevated privileges required by the software.  
<br />
<br />If you've lose Admin privileges on other things too, see here:  <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrative-rights-in-windows-10#comment-334148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrati...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Sai... this is called the user account control.
<br />If you are not logged in with an administrator account then when you make changes to Windows like installing apps and changing firewall etc it requires you to put in your admin credentials.
<br />If you are trying to run commands in say command prompt or powershell it requires to be elevated.  Which means when you go to command prompt or powershell you need to right click the app to open it and select run as administrator.
<br />See link.

                    <p>Hi guys, so here's my story:</p><p><br /></p><p>since I upgraded my Xbox to the gears of war 4: Xbox One S console, ive been getting a problem where my connection will disconnect every once in a while. It will literally disconnect me for 3-5 seconds then come right back. Now heres the thing, it didn't happen before when I had my Halo 5 xbox one edition and it only happens when <u>I'm wired</u>. Ive called support, ive tried everything and I'm absolutely stumped. My ps4 is also wired on the same modem/router and it never disconnects. In fact, I havent noticed anything else disconnect other than my xbox one s while wired. When I'm wireless, I have no problems. Its driving me crazy.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Here is what I tried. </p><p>- complete reset of console (not fixed)</p><p>- swapped Ethernet wire with ps4 one (not fixed)</p><p>- bought new Ethernet wires (not fixed)</p><p>- used different port of router (not fixed)</p><p>- called support, been sent a new console (not fixed)</p><p>-

It seems to only work with the original fat xbox one. Doesn't happen with my ps4 that's also wired. It seems to be an xbox compatibility issue with the new xbox one models (S and X) with the Bell modem called: Home Hub 2000. http://support.bell.ca/Internet/Products/Home-Hub-2000-modem </p><p><br /></p><p>MS please fix this.

<h2>            Microsoft Minesweeper Diamond Badge Achieved&#59; Challenges Reset.</h2>
                    
<p>I achieved the Diamond Badge, on Windows 8.1 Minesweeper, this morning. I backed out to the main menu, to look for my "wins at your back" achievement, and it had not unlocked. I closed out the app, and proceeded to work on Taptiles, and Sudoku. They have
 similar achievements. The achievement did not unlock in Taptiles. The achievement DID unlock in Sudoku.<br />
<br />
So on to the major issue here:<br />
<br />
When I reopened Minesweeper, my daily challenges were reset back to the 16th. From the 1st through the 16th, all challenges are complete. The following days have not been attempted except for 1 challenge today, when I was hoping it would "fix itself."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
 16th is the point that I achieved my Gold medal so I believe this is tied to the Diamond Badge Update, and have been unable to find any other posts detailing this issue.</p>

<p>Yes, you can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use either Heidoc or http://windowsiso.net</p>
