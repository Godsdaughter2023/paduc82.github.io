<h2>            Is there a limit to the number of songs I can have in my music collection&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I use Groove Music on my Windows 10 machines to only stream music from my Music Pass Subscription.&nbsp; However once I reach approximately 50,000 songs my collection begins to drop music from my collection.&nbsp; When my collection is sorted alphabetically by artist,
 which is my preferred choice, the songs are dropped from the beginning of the collection.&nbsp; I have re-added the same album tracks over and over again with the same results.&nbsp; Not all album tracks are dropped, most of the time 2 or 3 tracks remain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried adding back the album tracks for a particular artist many times with the same result.&nbsp; I have even tried adding back the tracks for a single album, then waited for the message indicated the tracks were being added and would be accessible across
 multiple machines to end, then gone into settings and resynched my entire collection. With the same result the next time&nbsp;I shut down the Groove Music player and restart say a day or so later the added tracks are gone.&nbsp; Needless to say this is very frustrating
 as a user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machines that have this problem are running both X64 Windows 10 Home and X64 Windows 10 Professional&nbsp; at Version 1703 using OS Build 15063.138.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I continue to add music to my collection once I get over approximately 52, 000 songs Groove Music crashes.&nbsp; Looking in the event log is see the following error log:</p>
<p>Faulting application name: Music.UI.exe, version: 10.17022.1030.0, time stamp: 0x58d2198c<br />

</p><p>I've tried all the steps listed in the Groove Music troubleshooting guide and the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me solve this problem. Even if it's to provide guidance&nbsp;that in&nbsp;fact there are limits to the size of the streaming Music Pass&nbsp;collection.</p>

<p>Hi AllanIverson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a 50,000 track limit today. Along with some of our other limits (100 playlists, 1000 songs in a playlist) we're looking at changing this as we upgrade some of the infrastructure and backend technology that powers Groove.</p>
<p>

<h2>            How to hide control boxes that are not filled in when printing on Word 365</h2>
                    <p>I have made a form using the developer tool and control boxes - some are plain text and some are drop down. Not all boxes will be filled in all the time and the form needs to be printed every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried hiding the text but if i fill in the box and then delete the content the boxes become unhidden and show up when i go to print!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be brilliant</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hi Sukie, thank you for your response, apologies for the delayed response. I have now managed to overcome this problem - I inserted the control box, selected the "Enter text here" words and changed the text to hidden. I then grouped the control box and on
 properties, I ticked the box that meant the control box could not be deleted and then protected the form so only the boxes could be changed. This seemed to work and as the form was only for internal use, i made sure all the computers were showing hidden text
 and this has been sufficient for what we need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe your way would have also worked!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help!</p>

<h2>            That code didn&#39;t work. Check the code and try again hotmail</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think my email is hacked .. i tried to log in it says wrong password so i started to try resetting it ... the secret question has been changed and it shows it in spanish language so i tried the mobile number code option and it worked everything good but
 ! when i do reset by mobile number it says code is correct but u need to do also the 2 step verification, so i have the google authenticator app in my smartphone and its generating the codes but when i put the code it says the code didn't work ! i don't know
 why ... </p>
<p>
</p><p>How i can't get my email back and i have the code from my mobile + the code from google authenticator?? this is unbelievable
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way my last hope was d the recovery option which is answering Hotmail questions and information about the email .. i put everything about my hacked email and i am sure of the information 200% because i know them good and i have screenshots of them
 then after sending the information .. less than 1hour i got respond automatic reply says the information is wrong ! omg i cant believe this .. there must a problem from Hotmail itself
</p>
<p>
</p><p>????</p>
<p>
</p><p>please help me this is the second time same person hacked my email and i don't know why he is hacking it ... the weird thing is he don't change the mobile number ?? i don't think he is stupid but he never change it and i still get reset code but Hotmail
 wont me until i do the 2-step-verificaion even with doing that they don't accept the code
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hotmail is getting me crazy ... come on we are in 2016 and i can't get my email back while i answer every question and i put the code from my mobile number !! isn't that enough ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hotmail in 2006-2009 was better and u get ur email back without this stupid system which is obviously not working and its not secure&amp;safe for the email

<p>If the file really is a .txt file (plain text, no formatting), then you can use the File &gt; Open command to open it in either WordPad or Word, and go to File &gt; Save As. Then:</p>
<ul>
<li>In WordPad, choose "Office Open XML Document", which will save a copy of the document as a .docx file. (The Windows 10 version of WordPad doesn't offer the older .doc format. You can later open a .docx file in Word and save it as a .doc file if you really
 need that.)</li><li>In Word, click the dropdown that initially says "Plain Text (*.txt)" and choose either "Word Document (*.docx)" or "Word 97-2003 Document (*.doc)".</li></ul>

            <p>Hello George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which Windows 10 build is presently installed on your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details and screenshot of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also appreciate this fact that you are trying to install the latest Windows 10 build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur either due to software conflicts or if antivirus software is blocking the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>use steps provided in this article and then try to upgrade to latest Windows 10 build.</strong><br />
Refer:<br />

<p>
</p><p>Important notes:<br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as
 you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>

<p>Hi Jon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There can be several reasons as to why your email attachment went missing. It can be due to the attachment size being too big or your antivirus program may have blocked the attachment. Also, your ISP or email provider may have removed the attachment which
 caused this issue. However, we would like to clarify some points in your concern for us to provide you the most appropriate solution. Kindly provide us the answers needed below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using Outlook.com or the Outlook program which is installed in your device?</li><li>Which device are you using to access the email attachment?</li><li>Which OS version is installed in your device?</li><li>Were there any changes on your device prior to this issue as you have mentioned that you were able to access the attachment before?</li><li>Does the email with the attachment went missing as well or just the attachment itself?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll wait for your response.</p>

    <title>Early Office 365 renewal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christian j hill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Early Office 365 renewal</h2>
                    <p>This evening I input a new product key to extend my renewal. I was tired of being nagged by the subscription expiration notifications. Upon activation I see that my renewal date has now changed to today's date (16th) from its original expiration of the 22nd.
 I immediately made support contact via chat but did not receive a straight answer to my question. Instead, I was directed here.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I ask again: where in the terms of service is it published that activating an "extension" product key before your current subscription expires terminates the existing subscription and creates a new renewal date?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is indeed published somewhere, then lesson learned. If not, the renewal system logic is flawed and I (and I'm sure others) would like to have my previously licensed subscription days added back to my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, why aren't you notified prior to renewal that you will forfeit any existing days if you renew early? Seems somewhat underhanded.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I'm glad I didn't renew as soon as the nag bar appeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Service request number: 1258828530</p>

    <title>Cannot Unhide Rows in Large Excel File - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amc_68  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Unhide Rows in Large Excel File</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to unhide all rows in my spreadsheet. It was originally a Read-Only Macro-Enabled Workbook, but I saved it as a copy in an Excel Workbook file (not Macro-Enabled). I have researched different ways to unhide rows in the workbook, but nothing has
 worked so far except for manually clicking the hidden row on the row number column.</p>
<p>I have also tried:</p>
<p>1. right-clicking on the hidden row to "Unhide" a single row</p>
<p>2. selected all cells using arrow in top-left corner, then right clicking on row numbers to "unhide"</p>
<p>3. selected all cells using arrow in top-left corner, then clicked "Format" &gt; "Unhide Rows"</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Methods 1-3 did not work. Mouse buffered for a minute and then nothing changed, or the file stopped responding for a few moments. I only need to unhide cells so I can use the "Find &amp; Select" tool. How can I properly unhide rows without manually clicking
 hundreds of times, or is there a "Find &amp; Select" work-around I can use that will also display the hidden cells?</p>

<p>I also tried adjusting the height of all the rows, but that did not work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By clicking on a hidden row, I mean double-clicking on the small space between nonconsecutive rows. It's a shortcut to right-clicking on that space and selecting "Unhide".</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I just tried selecting all the cells, then used "Format" &gt; "Hide Rows". Once all the rows are hidden, I click "Format" &gt; "Unhide Rows". This is working, but is a time consuming process. This shouldn't be how Excel functions...</p>

            <p>Well, I don't think that's possible now. But there's a workaround. Along with "Movies and TV", there's the good old "Windows Media Player". So, you can play one video file using Movies and TV and another video file using Windows Media Player.</p>

            Why is it a rip off when you've bought an Indian model that's aimed for the Indian market that only has a warranty that's valid in India?<br />
<br />
When you import (or export) phones from other countries it's down to you to be fully aware of the limitations.<br />
<br />
Like most other stores/manufacturers/products the free gift vouchers are limited to the region the product is intended to be sold in.

<p>It's down to the Nokia distributor to be honest about their product! I asked about the warranty, if it could be used in USA, all the questions one would ask. &nbsp;This one flat out lied to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been told on numerous occasions since then that customer service in India is not like it is in USA. &nbsp;Then again, if American Nokia reps are saying I'm screwed because I gave my money to their company on the wrong land, I wouldn't call that wonderful
 customer service either.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Portal - Web template changes is not reflecting on the portal</h2>
                    I created a new web page and used one of the created page templates which includes an already create "Web template", I change the content of the web template to include only "&lt;h1&gt;test&lt;/h1&gt;" and it worked, after that whenever I change it it doesn't reflect
 anything even if I changed it to "&lt;h1&gt;test 2&lt;/h1&gt;", I cleared the cache, used different browsers and still the same.

            <p>As far as the issue with dates in Outlook, go to View -&gt; Columns in the menu bar at the top of your screen and make sure you have "Date Sent" checked. This should display the same date/time as the Gmail server, which is the same date/time in the email message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to uncheck "Date Received" if that is currently checked, or keep both of them checked.<br />

    <title>Fields don&#39;t show shading for end users of document. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carrie-nika  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fields don&#39;t show shading for end users of document.</h2>
                    <p>I created a document in Word 2010 that would be used as a proposal template. In it, I added macro fields (e.g., MACROBUTTON&nbsp; TextFormField "Insert Project Name") for people to click on to adjust their information specific to that proposal. Whenever I open
 it, I see the form fields shaded in grey (great!), but if I email and send it to anybody else, the form fields don't show up with the grey shading. I need users to be able to easily see which fields require editing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas why the shading doesn't show up for other people? I have tested it sending it to users on both Word 2010 and Word 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I think that what's happening is that the end users/recipients don't have their Word program set up to "Always" show field shading. When that is clicked, the fields do show up, but I don't want to have to give that instruction to every single person,
 if I can help it. </p>

            <p>Unfortunately, you can't easily do anything about the field shading option, which is a per-user setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only alternative while continuing to use fields is to include the following macro in your document, which you would have to save as a macro-enabled (*.docm) document; and the recipients would have to store the document in a trusted location or otherwise
 enable the macro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sub AutoOpen()<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; ActiveWindow.View.FieldShading = wdFieldShadingAlways<br />
End Sub<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, that would leave the option set to "Always" for any other documents they open until they go to the Options dialog and change it. Fixing that would involve more code. You don't want to go there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all recipients have at least Office 2007, then use <a href="http://gregmaxey.mvps.org/word_tip_pages/content_controls.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Thanks - that's what I was afraid of. I started out doing it with Content Controls, but I have the same problem there. Even if I set the shading property, it still requires the end user to have "shading always" selected (unless I'm missing something there).
 Thank you for your response!

    <title>Windows Phone SMS and Contacts issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeremepalma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Phone SMS and Contacts issues</h2>
                    <p>I believe my phone recently updated and since then my contacts were gone, sms was not working and the phone needed to be rebooted frequently in order to use apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've somewhat fixed these issues but problems still persist.</p>
<p>I resynced my contacts which seems to have restored them all again. However in SMS my conversations are fragmented. Some contacts have entirely new threads created and when I respond to an old thread with the same contact it is one sided. All of their responses
 go into a new thread. I have 5 years of text messages saved and I would like to keep them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've made sure that these contacts in question have all available accounts linked. I've uninstalled skype because I believe half of the issues originated from that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot fully verify but I think people aren't getting some of my messages. That may be fixed now that skype is uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, every time I receive a text message my screen says that I have anywhere from&nbsp;20 to 99+ text messages. However when I open the messaging app I have between 0 and 2 messages..&nbsp;That isn't a huge deal but may help with troubleshooting?</p>

</p><p>Hi Jereme,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to confirm, when you mentioned that you already tried to reboot your phone, are you pertaining to a soft reset, or a hard reset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't tried any of these procedures, we suggest to do them, since you mentioned that this issue happened right after the latest update. To do a reset, you may follow the steps provided
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">here</a></strong>. Start with a soft reset and if
 the issue persists, back up your files and proceed with a hard reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have already tried both forms of resets, please let us know.</p>

            I just did the reset that involves holding down the power and volume down. However I still have 2 people with 2 threads going in messaging. I'm not sure how to combine these threads. And I'm nervous of deleting 1 or the other because like I said before
 I have 5 years worth of conversations.

            The latest update that was applied to my phone seems to have "fixed" the issue. I say "fixed" because I still have 2 threads for 1 person but the new thread has all the old messages in it. So it is fixed and back to normal for the most part.

    <title>Problems getting Outlook 2010 to connect with Yahoo Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicktjr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems getting Outlook 2010 to connect with Yahoo Mail</h2>
                    <p>After purchasing and installing a 3 license version of Office 2010 pro&nbsp;on 3 machines, I have a specific issue with one laptop running Vista home premium 64-bit.&nbsp; One XP desktop and one laptop Win 7 ult 64 bit installation went flawlessly even with multi
 email address from three different email&nbsp;carriers.&nbsp;For over a week now I have been searching forums, trying fixes, and work arounds with attempting to get the Vista laptop outlook&nbsp;to sync with Yahoo mail, my problem is specific to this machine and yahoo mail,
 the other installations were just fine even the yahoo emails are working great.</p>
<p>With Outlook loaded on the vista laptop it continually crashes as soon as it tries to get mail from the yahoo server, Hotmail, windows live email, and my local isp email accounts&nbsp;load fine, as soon as it attempts to go to yahoo mail outlook crashes and won't
 restart, even in&nbsp;outlook safe mode, and it won't restart&nbsp;until I remove the yahoo connection settings and take the .pst and .ost&nbsp; out of the user directory ande put&nbsp;different ones in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one error I can copy is:</p>
<p><em>Unable to send or receive messages for the Yahoo (xxxxxx) account. An incorrect password was entered. The next time you send or receive messages, you'll be asked to enter your user name and password for this account.</em></p>
<p><em>Server Error: 0x800CCC90<br />
Server Response: -ERR [AUTH] </em></p>
<p><em>Server:&nbsp; pop.mail.yahoo.com'<br />
Outlook Mail Error ID: 0x800CCC92<br />
Protocol: POP3<br />
Port: 110<br />
&nbsp; </em></p>
<p>The errors I can't get to and copy are:</p>
<p><em>Cannot start Microsoft Outlook, Cannot open Outlook window, the set folders cannot be opened, the server is not available.</em></p>
<p><em>Outlook cannot log on. Verify you are connected&nbsp;to the network and using the correct server address and log on information.
</em></p>
<p><em>The connection is unavailable, outlook must be online or connected to complete this action.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The password is correct, the addresses I checked and re-checked, I have those exact addresses working with two other machines and two other yahoo accounts. I even tried copying the setup files from a working setup to the vista laptop and I get the same exact
 error. I have now loaded Outlook 4 times on this machine, I even tried&nbsp; a "clean boot" installation but nothing changes. I have contacted Yahoo with this but all I get from them&nbsp;are the confirmation emails, for days now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions&nbsp; will be greatly appreciated,</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Nick</p>

            <p>Thanks to everyone who offered suggestions on this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had to uninstall all of office on that vista machine due to "rundll" issues. I was getting a&nbsp;&nbsp;"rundll32 has stopped working" error when I would exit ie9 or any office product. Upon uninstallation and defrag,&nbsp;and then a &nbsp;re-start the issue has stopped.
 I can only assume that it was due to the numerous times I installed/uninstalled office 2010 and/or outlook 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have retained notes and logs in regard to the outlook issue and the rundll problem, the 3 license office 2010 suite I purchased comes with 1 year tech support and I'm going to use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Nick</p>

    <title>Is there a way to apply a growth rate&#47;&#37; change function in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamharless  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a way to apply a growth rate&#47;&#37; change function in Excel, for a successive list of figures, without having to calculate each one individually&#63;</h2>
                    Say for example, I have a list of end period values, such as GDP figures, for example, listed successively in a particular column (say, column a) for each year, and that I want to calculate the rate of growth from one year to the other (ex. year 2 from
 year 1 - i.e. growth rate from a2 to a3, year 2 to 3 (a4 from a3), year 3 to 4 (a5 from a4), and so on, with each successive answer being displayed directly to the right of each ending period figure, in say, column b; is there a way to do this, and how?&nbsp; Thank
 you, and I would very much appreciate an answer to this, as it would be much help to me.&nbsp; Thanks again.<br />

            <p>One formula you have to give manually, then you have to drag or copy it down, then it will automatically give you corresponding results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Say you have data in column A &amp; B like this screen shot, &nbsp;then you have to give this formula
</p>
<p>
</p><p>=B3-B2</p>
<p>
</p><p>at C3 and then take you mouse to right/down corner of the cell, it will show a sign of '+', just then you have to press mouse and drag it down. The formula at C3 will be copied down to C4,C5,....... &nbsp;and you will get corresponding result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you want percentage growth then in the same way you have to give this formula at D3</p>
<p>=B3/B2-1 ( change cell to percentage format) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and then drag it down.</p>
