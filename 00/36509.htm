            Did you disable the onboard graphics? I assume this board has one?
<div>(Set Primary Graphics to PEG, and disable the integrated GPU in BIOS)<br />
&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>may be going to the onboard as the primary display device, hence no output on the GTX460.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I believe the Bios and boot screens will show on both, but soon as you get to a login, it will only display on the primary, until you set up extended/clone in the Graphics options.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just a thought..</div>

            <p>I had this problem when the HDMI cable I was using was too long (greater than 5 feet in my case).</p>
<p>I have the GTX 460 as well.</p>
<p>What was happening, is after the boot, it would switch to the DVI output, which is why the HDMI monitor went black.</p>
<p>I discovered this when I connected a second monitor to the DVI output.</p>
<p>My only resolution was to keep the HDMI cable short or just use&nbsp;a DVI cable.</p>

<h2>            Skype 8.25 and Windows XP</h2>
                    <p>On an older PC (ASUS EeePC) I use Windows XP Pro, SP3, fully updated, no problems.&nbsp; I have Skype 7.36.0.150 installed,&nbsp; works perfectly.</p>
<p>I want to upgrade Skype to version 8.25.</p>
<p>1.)&nbsp; I uninstalled Skype 7,&nbsp; downloaded version 8.25.&nbsp; I can not install 8.25 because I get the prompt saying that it is incompatible with my current operating system</p>
<p>2.)&nbsp; Next I installed Skype version 7 again and tried "Help" -&gt; "Check for Updates" , I get the message that I have already the latest version of Skype installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I have been reading I understand that&nbsp; Skype version 8.25 can run on Windows XP Pro SP3.</p>
<p>Is my understanding correct???</p>
<p>Is there a way to solve my problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response</p>

            The New Skype won't work on XP. XP is not supported anymore since it is an ANCIENT OS. Better update your operating system or buy a new computer if you want to continue using Skype

            Skype 8.x uses Chromium. Chromium dropped XP/Vista support in 2016. That combined with performance issues, limitations and the lack of support for both OSes, you will not see a new version of Skype that is compatible. Many similar IM/VoIP providers do
 not support those systems for similar reasons. Skype 8.x requires Windows 7 or above.

    <title>All Windows 10 Apps Will Not Launch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nathanielcarter  say:</h3>
<h2>            All Windows 10 Apps Will Not Launch</h2>
                    <p>I am using: Windows 10 Home, Version 1511, OS Build: 10586.218</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every one of my windows 10 apps lack a picture, instead they have a string of text that looks similar to a URL:</p>
<p>
</p><p>@{Microsoft.(appname) &nbsp; &nbsp;For example, @{Microsoft.WindowsStore_2016.27.20_x64_8wekyb3d8</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to launch the apps with any method I could try, it would seem like it would start but then close itself in about 1-2 seconds, completely ending the process. No error messages are given.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked around the community and have tried several solutions that were recommended. Here is what I have tried based on what I found in this community:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows App Troubleshooter</p>
<p>SFC Scan</p>
<p>Cleanboot</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of which has detected no problems or corrupted files. When all services and startups were disabled, the problem was still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss and I would love to avoid a phone conversation with Support if I can. If anyone can help, I would love an answer, thanks.</p>

<span>ms-settings:</span>, and then press <span>OK</span>. This opens Settings.</div>
</li><li>
<p>In Settings, go to <span>Update &amp; security</span> &gt; <span>Windows Update</span>, and then select
<span>Check for updates</span>. Install any available updates and restart your PC if required.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Some problems can be fixed by signing out of your account and then signing back in. Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete and select
<span>Sign out</span>. Once you’ve signed out, sign back in to your account.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Try to reset the system, if the issue persists. For how to reset, refer the link below.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:&nbsp; </strong>Resetting removes apps and drivers you installed, removes changes you made to settings and removes any apps your PC manufacturer installed. (If your PC came with
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span>, apps from your PC manufacturer will be reinstalled.) If you reset your PC within a month of your upgrade to
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span>, the option in Settings that lets you go back to your previous version of Windows will no longer be available.</p>
<p>

            The first troubleshooting option you can try is Microsoft's own Windows 10 Troubleshooter for Windows Update. In the Windows 10 Creators Update, you can find it in Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot, click Windows Update then click Run the troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />You can run the troubleshooter a couple times to see if it helps. 
<br />
<br />You can also try installing the update manually:

            Hello, 
<br />First of all, try installing the update manually. You can find the latest ones here:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/12/december-updates-microsoft-releases.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/12/decembe...</a>
<br />If that doesn't help,
<br />Try resetting Windows 10 updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.

<h2>            Windows 10 Enterprise - 1709 RSAT</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running a fresh install of Windows 10 Enterprise x64 1709 OS build 16299.125 and trying to get the RSAT tools working. I've installed the 1709x64 version of RSAT but when I go into Windows Features the Remote administration options are missing. This
 is happening on multiple machines in my work environment, I can't seem to find much info online about it except a few suggestions to install the 2016 server RSAT tools which didn't work. I already have the US Language pack which was another suggested fix.
 Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            Windows update taking forever</h2>
                    <p>As of 11/12/16 I have not been able to update my Windows 8.1 x64 OS. When I try to run updates it just runs for a long time. I also tested running updates on my Windows 7 x64 laptop with the same result. Is there something going on with the update server?
 I found out Windows Updates was not working when i tried to install Visual C++ 2015 and it got stuck at the wusa.exe process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ran the Windows Update Diagnostic Tool on my 8.1 system and it found 2 errors that it fixed. I run the tool again after a restart and get the same 2 issues to fix.&nbsp;</li><li>Ran&nbsp;<span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth and&nbsp;</span><span>sfc
 /scannow successfully and it fixed all issues.&nbsp;</span></li></ul>

            <p><em>Assuming Win8.1 64-bit...</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll need to do some "digging" here. Please answer <em>each of the following </em>
[admittedly tedious]<em> diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting this post: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Did the computer come with Win8 (or Win8.1) preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win8 (or Win8.1), or did you upgrade a (e.g., Win7) computer to Win8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Lenovo; Acer)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1d. Have you ever done a Refresh? ...a Reset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1e. Are you a <em>registered </em><strong><a href="http://insider.windows.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Insider</a></strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your currently-installed <em>third-party</em> anti-virus application or security suite (i.e.,
<em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>), if any, and <em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription
</em>(if any)<em>&nbsp;expire?</em> </p>
<p>
</p><p>3. What third-party anti-malware applications (i.e., <em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>) are installed, if any?&nbsp; What third-party firewall, if any?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer<em> since you bought it?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Is&nbsp;KB3197874&nbsp;and/or KB3185331&nbsp;listed in <strong>Installed Updates </strong>
<em>(not <strong>Update History</strong></em>)? [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>7a. What Update Version &amp; KB number are displayed in the <em>second line of text</em> in IE11's Help | About [<strong>Alt+H+A</strong>] tab; e.g.,
<strong>Update Version: 11.0.54 (KB1231231)</strong> ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7b. Is Firefox <em>version 49.0.2</em> (or higher) and/or Google Chrome <em>version&nbsp;</em><em>54.0.2840.99</em> (or higher) or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Is <strong>Adobe Flash Player v23.0.0.207</strong> installed? TEST HERE USING&nbsp;INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>9. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic;
<em>System Mechanic</em>; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Total System Care; Glary Utilities; Registry Booster;
<em>McAfee QuickClean</em>; <em>AVG Quick Clean</em>;&nbsp;<em>AVG PC TuneUp</em>; Norton Registry Cleaner;

            <p>1. As a troubleshooting effort to see if the HP preinstalled OS (on the HP computer we are dealing with) was the issue I removed the original hard drive and connected a clean hard drive to the HP computer we are dealing with and installed a fresh Windows
 8.1 64bit OEM OS and tried to install updates with the same result. To see if there was some type of issue with my OS or an issue with Windows Update Server.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;Thursday, ‎January ‎22, ‎2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I never saw it under updates only in the Notifications area that it was available which I ignored since I was fine with 8.1.</p>

<p>Assuming the factory-preinstalled Win8.1 is/was installed on "original hard drive"...</p>

<p>1. The "clean" HDD was for a test only. The original HDD is back in place and only the "Original hard drive" is being used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2a. I obtained it using the Window Media Creation tool to an .iso file that I burned to a DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2b. Being that it was an OEM install it must of used the HP bios string for the activation. I did not manual activate or enter a key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3a. Yes it was present during the time frame&nbsp;for the upgrade, but I ignored it. It is no longer present.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>3b. Not it's not under installed updates and it is under update history as failed on 11/13/16. That's when I tried to run Windows updated and saw it under Optional.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">KB3185331 was installed via Windows Update.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>5. No. This is active subscription I continue to renew online. Last renewal was 4/17/16 active for a year did not require a new . Auto updates for McAfee is on so whatever updates are pushed and
 installed automatically. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a side note I tried disabling McAfee Virus protection and Firewall to see if that was causing the Windows Update issue and that did not work either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Updates wouldn't be offered (installed?) on the "clean HDD" if the install had not been Activated (i.e., the results of your test wouldn't apply to the "original HDD" anyway).<br />
<br />
</li><li>I find it interesting (in a geeky way)&nbsp;that the Get WIn10 app is no longer present without KB3184143 having been installed (the update's supposed to remove everything related to the Win10 upgrade offer).<br />
<br />
</li><li>Also interesting is the fact that KB3184143 (released 26 Sept-16) failed to install on 13 Nov-16 yet KB3185331 (released 11 Oct-16) successfully installed on 14 Oct-16.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Moving on...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chances are the HP computer came with a Norton free-trial preinstalled so those "leftovers" may be one of your troublemakers. You've "automatically" upgraded McAfee Total Security at least once - possibly twice - since you installed it so those "leftovers"
 may be at work here, too.&nbsp;Let's see if ridding the system of all leftovers resolve your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Roll up your sleeves, cross your fingers &amp; try the following multi-step fix I've cooked-up just for your computer...</p>
<p>
</p><p>ACTIONS</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[You will want to print these instructions for offline reference. IMPORTANT =&gt; DON'T SKIP ANY STEP &amp; perform all steps in one, uninterrupted session! If a step says to reboot</strong><strong>,
<em>reboot!</em>] </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. Right-click on the following link, select SAVE TARGET AS... &amp; download the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:
<a href="http://us.mcafee.com/apps/supporttools/mcpr/mcpr.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Right-click on the following link, select SAVE TARGET AS... &amp; download the Norton Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:
<p>
</p><p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Uninstall <strong>McAfee&nbsp;Total Protection</strong>&nbsp;via <strong>Start | Control Panel | Programs |</strong><strong> Programs and Features</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. <strong>IMPORTANT! =&gt; Make sure the Windows Firewall &amp; Windows Defender&nbsp;is enabled
<em>immediately</em> after rebooting!</strong> [Should happen automatically but I want you to double-check.]</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NB: You're "working without a net" now: Don't to ANYTHING <em>else</em> online (e.g., browsing; reading email; chatting) until you've completed Step #7 below!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>5a. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1a above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the McAfee&nbsp;utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5b. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1b above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the Norton&nbsp;utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Do a clean install of <strong>McAfee&nbsp;Total Protection</strong>&nbsp;(using your Product ID, if need be) &amp; reboot. If you purchased your software directly from McAfee, go to
<a href="https://home.mcafee.com/Secure/Protected/Login.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>7. Manually and repeatedly update the McAfee application until you get a "no more updates" or similar prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Re-assert Internet Explorer as the default <strong>Browser</strong> in the CUSTOM (<strong>&lt;=important!</strong>) section of

<p>
</p><p>9b. Double-click on the file you saved in #9a above &amp; accept the prompt to MERGE the data with the Registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>10. Reset Internet Explorer per the instructions on this page: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>TIP: For optimum results, check/enable the <strong>Delete personal settings </strong>
option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>11.&nbsp;Run the automated Windows Update troubleshooter [AKA Windows Update Diagnostic Tool] again&nbsp;from start to finish. [3] See
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2714434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 of McAfee LiveSafe, instead of McAfee Total Protection, in Step #6 above. YMMV</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that it is not possible to connect to the internet through Wifi in Safe Mode with Networking. This is so because in Safe Mode, the computer uses minimal drivers that are needed for the system to run. Try to connect&nbsp;directly through
 the Ethernet cable and check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your reply for resolving my concern but I am sorry to say..I do not agree that its not possible to connect internet through Wifi in Safe Mode with Networking.<br />
<br />
I believe you agree that in case of Windows 8.1, we can connect internet through Wifi in Safe Mode with Networking but unfortunately I am not getting the way to connect internet through Wifi in Safe Mode with Networking. However, I don't agree that connecting
 internet through Wifi in Safe Mode with Networking is not possible.<br />
<br />
With Regards<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your response. We apologize for the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my above stated post, I wanted to convey that in Safe Mode with Networking, limited drivers are loaded which will not allow you to utilize your wifi functionality. However you may sort this issue by enabling drivers and services. To do so follow the steps
 below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Drivers.</strong></p>
<p>While in Safe Mode with Networking, open Device Manager. Then double click to expand Network Adapter, right click on the driver and select Enable.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Services</strong></p>
<p>While in this mode, open the Services page through Run Command (Windows button+R). Once opened, type services.msc in the dialog box. This will open the services page. Once here locate WLan Auto Config and set the Status to Start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Unable to Download Games Xbox Game Pass for PC</h2>
                    <p>Afternoon&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded the Xbox Game Pass for PC App</p>
<p>
</p><p>The App is signed into my account I use for my Xbox One X which I have Xbox Game Pass ultimate&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to download a game on the App. It does not seem to recognise I have the Xbox Game Pass ultimate subscription and asks me to sign in.</p>
<p>However it does not allow me to sign into my account email I have linked to my Xbox and to which I have signed into the app already. Instead it only wants to log into my alternate email address which I have no active subscriptions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to look at my profile to see if I can resolve but with no joy</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be much appreciated </p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. Unfortunately, at this time there are known issues with this Xbox Game Pass Ultimate / Subscription downloading games&nbsp; for some reason. Many have had issues downloading. We recommend to just wait it out until the
 kinks are ironed out. It should be resolved sooner than later. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Editing Windows Fax and Scan Profiles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Editing Windows Fax and Scan Profiles</h2>
                    <p>Although this topic exists it did not get answered correctly. It was asked for Windows 7 and was answered for Vista, which does not show "profiles" as a button in Control panel&gt;printers and scanners. Windows Fax and Scan does not show up there either - just
 the actual imaging hardware devices. Window Fax and Scan is a utility made to use WITH your hardware scanner, not a piece of hardware itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is "How do I change the profile for Windows Fax and Scan so that I may establish a new "Default" set of parameters for scanning?"&nbsp;I have hundreds of docs to scan. Don't want to reset the dialog each time.&nbsp; Default is Color. I want grayscale.
 Default for grayscale is 100dpi and I want 300dpi.&nbsp; and have those set as "Default."

            <p>OK. I've figured this out and its a lot easier than I thought.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with Acqanal's answer which does not work in W7 for reasons described in the original post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what does work:</p>
<p>Hit the Windows key. Enter Windows Fax and Scan in the search box and select it in the results. When open select Tools&gt;Scan settings. Within that dialog there are selections for setting parameters and a box to check for making the selections the default
 settings. That's all there is to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My previous confusion came from the "version" of Windows F&amp;S that was opening through another program. The header said Windows Fax and Scan, but it was actually just a applet designed by the app developer to use a lite version of W F&amp;S without the ability
 to reset defaults. The real version of the program that comes with W7 easily does.</p>

    <title>Why does my laptop keyboard mode keep changing&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> canuckguru  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does my laptop keyboard mode keep changing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Every time I restart or do a power-on startup, Windows 8 resets my keyboard to CMS (Canada Multilingual Standard). Often I don't notice until I try to enter my password and it is not accepted (I included some punctuation, which differs&nbsp;among keyboards).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I always reset my keyboard to my choice (US English), but the next time&nbsp;I restart or do a cold boot, it has reverted to CMS again!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Updates not updating or when they do they eat my whole - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julie900  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Updates not updating or when they do they eat my whole months, server tariff in a couple of days.</h2>
                    <p>I have asked a similar question and after several attempts and people telling me to delete Windows 10 and reinstall it I finally manged to complete some Windows updates.&nbsp; It took nearly three days and just when I thought it was safe it started to do another
 update and it got to 60% and hung there for two or three hours. In the end I stopped it as I came out of my computer.&nbsp; What I didn't realise is that on 11th July I had used the whole of my usage for the month from my server solely doing Windows updates. I
 am not a happy bunny as you can imagine and today having upgraded my tariff so I can use my internet until next months tariff starts, which is the 3rd August, I find that a Window update is still stuck at 60%.&nbsp; It is endeavoring to download Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp;
 All I can say is I hope it is worth the wait.&nbsp; Can someone tell me why these updates are taking soooooooo long.&nbsp; I am frightened to turn my desk top on at the moment just in case I use the whole of my usage again in just a couple of days.&nbsp; Why o Why is Windows
 10 such a problem and why are the downloads taking so long?&nbsp; My server provider has assured me that the speed isn't slow.&nbsp; However, either way it has cost me money this month and I don't know why the updates&nbsp; haven't been updating automatically. &nbsp; If someone
 tells me to unistall it and install it again I will go mad.&nbsp; The time I have spent on Windows 10 is unbelievable and I still haven't had some of my issues resolved by Microsoft. For instance my window is still off the screen and one of your engineers has told
 me to roll back my nvidia driver, which I have been waiting patiently to download to hopefully resolve this problem.&nbsp; So why would I roll it back?&nbsp;&nbsp; I delete my printer because it is no longer supported by Windows 10 to find that Microsoft have now developed
 drivers in conjunction with Kyocera.&nbsp; I am literally tearing my hair out with Windows 10, thankfully I was sensible enough not to upgrade my laptop as I think I would have gone round the bend by now.&nbsp; So folks is there anyone out there that can please, please,
 please, help with with these ridiculous updates that seem to have taken over my life and my server? It would just be nice to turn on my desk top and use it without any problems............unfortunately those days appear to have long gone, along with&nbsp; my sanity!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I really need to resolve these issue once and for all as it is costing me money and I have no faith in Windows 10 whatsoever due to the many problems that I have incurred. Thank you, and I am sorry for the rant.</p>

            <p>Hi Gerry </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; I conducted an eventviewer log for my laptop on OneDrive last week because I had experienced problems with Windows explorer and I was getting errors and warnings in eventviewer.&nbsp; I haven't heard back from that query from you.&nbsp;
 If I delete the files in One Drive then that log will disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you come back to me with regard to my lap top I will do a log for eventviewer on my desktop and wipe those files.&nbsp; Could it be a slow and old processor on my desktop that is causing the problem.&nbsp; My husband who sadly died a couple of years ago updated
 the desktop as he was a computer geek but the processor remains the same as it left the factory.&nbsp; I have just been informed that my AMD Phenom processor doesn't support full virtulization for Safe Money in Kaspersky.&nbsp; The processor is 2008.&nbsp; Could this be
 the problem with my updates not downloading quickly enough?&nbsp; Just a thought but I will do eventviewer when I hear back from you. Thank You Julie
</p>

<p>
</p><p>The question below has not been answered.&nbsp; I was asked for some information which I provided and posted the wrong report.&nbsp; I updated the right report and put the link in the message and still I have had no response back.&nbsp; Since then I have again used my
 upgraded tariff due to Windows updates just sitting there not moving and then suddenly after several hours they will move a couple of percent.&nbsp; It has cost me time and money this month and I am not impressed.&nbsp; When I initially thought should I update to windows
 10 it stated that Microsoft would check to see if your computer was compatible, but I thought hey I will check myself before I download.&nbsp; I went into see what and when a download would be scheduled and it downloaded it straight away.&nbsp; I was not amused.&nbsp; This
 has happened to several of my friends.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can some one please help me.&nbsp; I have now put the links to One Drive so you can see the reports I was asked to submit.&nbsp; It has now been over a week and I have lost my server tariff again due to Windows 10 updates.&nbsp; I
 am tearing my hair out.&nbsp; The original message is below.&nbsp; Can someone please help me because I do not want the same problem with my server next month and I cannot upgrade this month as I am at the top end of the tariff.&nbsp; I have now got to wait until 3rd August.
 I am desperate as I am just wasting time.&nbsp; The irony is I have bought a new laptop and I cannot do any downloads....deep joy! The delights of Microsoft.&nbsp; The problem is on my desk top.&nbsp; I had no problem with Windows 8 Pro. It worked like a dream.&nbsp; Windows
 10 has been quite honestly a nightmare and a couple of my neighbour's have gone back to Windows 8.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; Before I even attempt to put my desk top on can you please tell me whether your reply is in conjunction with the reports I posted on one drive.&nbsp; I am terrified of putting my desktop on as I cannot afford to lose server usage because
 of windows 10.&nbsp; I was without internet access for over a week due to Microsoft and these blasted and annoying constant updates that have taken, it seems, over everyone's lives and it also seems that we are unable to turn them off. So can you please tell me
 that the solutions above are after reading the reports that are one my one drive account. As you can image I am very skeptical that these solutions will resolve my problems but I would just like someone to confirm that you have read these reports and these
 latest solutions are a result of reading them!</p>

            Another reply to this ongoing saga where I have trouble with Window 10 updates using all my server usage in two days.&nbsp; I have followed various solutions to no avail and the latest one was to delete all the files out of software distribution download folder,which
 I did.&nbsp; Unfortunately the one that was downloading the day I did it I was unable to delete&nbsp; as you are unable to stop updates no matter how hard you try, and I also went into command prompt and typed wuault.exe/updatenow in cmd as suggested and then clicked
 on updates, and it is still stuck on 10% where no doubt it will stay if I leave it for hours and hours.&nbsp; It does appear however, to have stopped downloading as nothing is whirring away in the background on my desktop.&nbsp; SO what now folks as nothing seems to
 be happening&nbsp; whatsoever and I am now back at square one? I have been trying for months to resolve this problem and I am frightened to turn my desk top on because the updates eat my server usage.&nbsp; I really need to resolve this problem because at the moment
 I am unable to use my desktop.&nbsp; I have run troubleshooter and nothing comes up so again another failed attempt to resolve a Windows 10 problem. So I have a computer that is rendered useless due to Windows 10 updates.&nbsp; PLEASE HELP BEFORE I PUT MY HEAD IN A
 GAS OVEN!!!!!! And while I responded to Gerry Cornell having put various report files on One Drive, I have had no response.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows indexer status shows &#34;indexing complete&#34; instead of &#34;indexer paused&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>original title: Windows indexer status​</p>
<p>When I boot up the PC and immediately go to indexer option, it shows "indexing complete" instead of "indexer paused." However, when I clear my cache, the status changed to paused. I can replicate it on both of my Windows 7 PC.</p>

<p>I have already run the fixit to reset the Windows search <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_search/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_search/en-us</a>, but as soon as I add a favorite, delete it, and then reboot, the problem comes back</p>
<p>Steps to replicate the glitch:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the account is the only one on your PC.&nbsp; After it shows "indexing complete" and the Windows flag loads up, reboot.</li><li>As soon as your PC reboot, check the indexer status.</li><li>Now clear your cache. It will toggle from complete to paused.&nbsp; When I think is happening is the status "refreshed" as soon as I toggled.</li></ol>

            <p>It seems that when I create a new user account, the origional account indexer status is working properly.&nbsp; Also, its just that the "status" is not showing correctly until I clear cache..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: Looks like the problem exists on the new account (if I log into it directly instead of logging into primary account and logging out and then logging into test account).&nbsp; Indexer is working fine but the status is a little glitched.&nbsp; It shows "indexing
 complete" until I clear cache.&nbsp; Then it changes to indexing paused.&nbsp; After some while it changes back to indexing complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first pic shows when I check indexer immediately after I restart the PC or boot it up.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second shows the status after I clear my cache.&nbsp; Apparently there is a "refresh" of the status when I clear cache.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried rebuilding index multiple times.&nbsp; As mentioned in the topic, I even "reset" Windows search.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steps to replicate the glitch:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the account is the only one on your PC.

<p><span>The Windows Search service is set to a delayed startup so that would be the reason it is paused after a restart. You need to

            <p>What I mean is the status is shown as "complete" as soon as startup. But after I clear "cache" the status "refreshes" and show as paused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically this is what happens.&nbsp; Indexing is complete btw and no problem with search.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I restart the PC, the indexer status shows as "indexing is complete" when it should says "indexing is paused."&nbsp;&nbsp; But when I clear my cache, the status "refreshes" and it now says indexer is paused. Is this "refresh" a bug? Shouldn't it just say "indexing
 is paused" since the beginning until it unpauses?</p>

    <title>file transfer over wifi from one PC to another PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sagar_patel  say:</h3>
<h2>            file transfer over wifi from one PC to another PC</h2>
                    <p>I have two windows 7 based PC and one windows xp based. its often when i have to transfer big amount of files, almost of 80 gb to one-another. So, all I want to know is that, how it is possible through wifi? Does it need any kind of wire?
 Does it need internet access or it can be done through hot-spot created by android (version 2.3.6) mobile? Is there any kind of free software or free application available to do this in easiest way? What is home-group and how it is used? How can I include
 all of my PCs in common home-group with same wifi network? If possible, I would like to get my solution through flash file/screen-shots/ video files or if nothing above is possible, then it will be ok with steps in simple texts!!!</p>
<p>I would also like to know that, will the transfer rate over wifi for this way, be better than pocket usb hard-drive? I meant, what is better for my purpose, wifi sharing or to use pocket usb hard-drive?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for giving your valuable time.</p>

            <p>Probably the best way is to use File and Printer sharing which is built into all versions of Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it is WiFi or hard-wired does not make so much a difference as the type of connection that you have.&nbsp; The higher bit-rate, the faster the file will transfer.&nbsp; There are three speeds of USB, at least three common speeds of&nbsp;wireless WiFi (b,g,n), and&nbsp;three
 speeds of&nbsp;wired Ethernet (10-Base-T, 100-Base-T, and Gigabit).&nbsp; The approximate maximum bit-rates of different connectons are listed as follows.&nbsp; I use a 1/10 factor to convert to Bytes/sec.&nbsp; Numbers are approximate maximums (ie you will never see these rates
 but good for comparison) and many conditions can reduce these speeds (particularly with wireless):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>USB 3.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 4000 Mbit/sec (wired)</p>
<p>Gigabit Ethernet = 1000 Mbit/sec&nbsp; (wired)</p>
<p>USB 2.0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;280 Mbit/sec&nbsp; (wired)</p>
<p>Wireless "N"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 150 Mbit/sec (wireless)</p>
<p>100-Base-T&nbsp;Ethernet = 100 Mbit/sec (wired)</p>
<p>Wireless "G"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp; 54 Mbit/sec (wireless)</p>
<p>USB 1.x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp; 12 Mbit/sec (wired)</p>
<p>Wireless "B"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 11&nbsp; Mbit/sec (wireless)</p>
<p>10-Base-T Ethernet = 10&nbsp; Mbit/sec&nbsp; (wired)</p>

<h3> ladizi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 1809 Realtek Audio Issue</h2>
                    <p>The driver was working fine until yesterday, the volume thing has an x over it, and its no longer in Device Manager. If I use older versions (2017) it says error code 10 but it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried installing the latest drivers from both ASUS and Realtek.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ASUS' does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Realtek's however sends me to a BSOD with the error <strong>SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED</strong> and the cause being
<strong>rtkvhd64.sys</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Realtek's seems to kind of work in safe mode, which led me to use <strong>verifier,
</strong>and from the thread post for it said I needed to send my <strong>DMP </strong>
files because when I used it; regular windows gave a <strong>BSOD</strong> confirming that verifier was working.</p>

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If clearing the browser's cache and cookies, and performing a DNS flush didn't help, then this could be an issue with the router or modem settings. Also, you mentioned that this error only occur when you connect your computer through Ethernet cord. Now,
 to isolate the case, have you tried using another Ethernet cord? Did you check the network settings of the router or modem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Have tried different ethernet cables and ports. Same intermittent problem. &nbsp;Also occurs with wireless connections but seems to be less often. &nbsp;Other computers using this modem/router are not affected so must be something with this computer and windows 10.

</p><p>HP tech support can only now suggest factory reset, then letting Windows reinstall all its updates. However, I have already done this with a problem I was having with the USB ports, and network error still occurred so not sure why I should have to do this
 again. &nbsp;HP support tells me that if problem persists after factory reset, then they do not have a solution other than referring me to their pay for service software support even though I have their 3 yr extended warranty. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for your response. Have you tried a different browser yet? How about clearing the browsing data in your current browser?<br />
<br />
You can fix the ERR_NETWORK_CHANGE by resetting IP/TCP. This is a rather simple procedure and you can do it by following these steps:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Command Prompt as administrator.<br />
</li><li>When Command Prompt opens enter the following lines:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>netsh int ip set dns<br />
</li><li>netsh winsock reset</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp; 3. Close Command Prompt and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>

<h2>            How can I block a user from uploading files on the web&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using Microsoft Family Safety from few months, I dig many times in t find any way I can block user from uploading files? Like the way we have option for "Block file downloads from the web" under&nbsp;Web filtering.</p>
<p>If not using&nbsp;Microsoft Family Safety, is there any other way I can block users from uploading files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW I am using Windows 7 64x.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that you would like to block user from uploading files using Family Safety. However, please be informed that this is not possible since it is by design. Family Safety allows you to Block File Downloads from the web but not uploading files:</p>

    <title>WINDOWS 7 CRASHES WHILE RUNNING HARDWARE ASSESSMENT AT &#34;10 BATCH - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            WINDOWS 7 CRASHES WHILE RUNNING HARDWARE ASSESSMENT AT &#34;10 BATCH ASSESSMENT&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>I had to put a new motherboard in my system after I plugged a second graphics card in it for Crossfie functionality.<br />
<br />
The new motherboard FOXCONN A79A-S (AMD chipset) seems to work fine with the two graphics cards running in Crossfire.&nbsp; My only issue is:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;WHENEVER I RUN THE HARDWARE ASSESSMENT PROGRAM IN WINDOWS 7, IT CRASHES IMMEDIATELY WHEN IT GETS TO "10 BATCH ASSESSMENT"<br />
<br />
&nbsp;NO BSOD, NO BLACK SCREEN.... THE WHOLE COMPUTER SHUTS COMPLETELY OFF INSTANTLY, INCLUDING THE POWER SUPPLY!<br />
<br />
&nbsp; I GET THE SAME EFFECT WHEN I TRY TO PLAY CRYSIS.&nbsp; I HAD NO PROBLEM PLAYING CRYSIS BEFORE THE MOTHERBOARD CHANGE, BUT NOW IT TOO CRASHES INSTANTLY AFTER THE OPENING VIDEO ENDS.<br />
<br />
THERE ARE NO ERROR CODES AT ALL!</p>
