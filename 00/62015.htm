<h2>            Canon MX330 won&#39;t scan after update to Windows10 Home edition version 1709 OS Bld 16299.248</h2>
                    <p>I was able to scan until the most recent Windows 10 upgrade I did late last year. I'm now on 1709.</p>
<p>When I tell the printer to scan and save to PC it goes through the motions on the display but doesn't actually initiate the scan itself.</p>
<p>I tried the MF Toolbox 4.9 but it says a supported scanner is not installed. I ran the trouble shooting option which suggested a Windows 8 setting but that was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Is there a fix for this problem? What software &amp; drivers should I have installed?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Cynthia</p>

<p>My PC had already updated to 16299.309 by the time I went to manually do it. Online there are no Canon drivers for Windows 10 so I called the Canon help line. I spoke with a guy who had me download the 64 bit drivers for Windows 8.1 (md64-win-mx330-1_02-ej.exe)
 and&nbsp; the Canon MP Navigator EX ver 2.13 software (mpnx_2_1-win-2_13-ea23_2.exe). I'm now able to print and scan successfully.</p>
<p>Thanks for your prompt reply to my post.</p>

            There is a version of MP Navigator on Canon's website for the MX330 which worked for me. It is for an older version of Windows, but still works.

                    <p>How do I send files on this new version of Skype? On chat there is only picture option. I can send files by accessing themselves and sharing by Skype, but where do I do this on Skype itself?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>Hi Barb Bowman, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I think it is the same problem, and I'm having it too. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow, the only working solution for me is making the Task Manager visible all the time. Besides having 88 pages of users having the same issue, the only usefulness in that thread is about sharing the same frustration.

<p>Hi Jasmine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding my SP4 I7 256GB (16) [model TH2-00001], purchased 18 Jan 2016:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had no problems with it and have not dropped or otherwise abused it.&nbsp; On 12 Nov 2017, it started the screen video jitter problem.&nbsp; I have done all the updates; tried lowering resolution, updating the graphics card driver, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The jitter only stops when the mouse or touchpad are used to move the pointer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help as the wax on, wax off is tedious.</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as inexplicably as it started, the screen jitter has stopped after booting AM on 17 Nov.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On 16 Nov. in the middle of the morning I had a blue screen that stopped my work and read something like "Windows critical stop or restart."&nbsp; It was completely non-optional and unstoppable; it rebooted.&nbsp; I assumed it was MS with an attempt to fix the screen
 jitter.&nbsp; SP4 came back up and still had the jitter.&nbsp; The next morning after booting, the jitter was gone and is still gone as of today 19 Nov 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope/pray that the fix sticks and hope that everyone with this problem finds a solution that is better than the keeping task manager on your screen or Mouse Miyagi.</p>

    <title>Delete 3rd party Updates from Windows Update Service&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sydney loke  say:</h3>
<h2>            Delete 3rd party Updates from Windows Update Service&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have researched this problem, executed the suggested solutions.&nbsp; None of which fixes this problem.&nbsp; My PC Windows 10 Pro Version 1511 OS Build 10586.164, 64bit, No pen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A discrepancy exists between stored data settings;&nbsp; Settings/Update &amp; Security/Advanced Options/View Your Update History and Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Programs and Features &gt; Installed Updates
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Using the first method, starts with Settings/ shows more information (including the un wanted 3rd party update). While Control Panel &gt; method shows less.&nbsp; Instructions provided to date
 are not comprehensive do not describe what to do if the content of the instructions are missing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">In this case the 3rd party driver update is installing more than a driver rather a complete default install of other related software products. Which I have deduced to be the cause
 of system crashes.&nbsp; Not the driver itself.&nbsp; Since Windows update Service is designed to provide the latest updates to the device in question.&nbsp; Then Windows Updates Service needs to verify if additional 3rd party products are using this method to get their
 line of products included in the update.&nbsp; Or provided a method to choose not to install.<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">I have not found a solution to this problem from either this forum or scouring the hybrid of methods offered by the OS. This will have to be an patch or update to the OS.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Thank you for your continued support. Sincerely a valued customer.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the computer. I understand the inconvenience when things don't work the way it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10, Windows will automatically check for the available updates. Windows will also check for updates in the background and automatically download and install them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unlike on previous versions of Windows, there’s no way to select individual updates you want to download. All updates from security updates and Windows Defender definition updates to optional updates and driver updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only option you can control is to select the “Advanced options” link and uncheck “Give me updates for other Microsoft products when I update Windows.” This will allow you to disable&nbsp;updates for Microsoft Office and other Microsoft programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows won’t download updates on connections you mark as " Metered.” This ensures Windows won’t waste valuable tethering data or other mobile data on updates that can wait until it reaches a solid, unrestricted&nbsp;Wi-Fi network. To prevent Windows from downloading
 updates on a specific connection, first connect to that WI-Fi network. Next, open the WI-Fi settings panel and select “Network settings,” or open the Settings app and select “Network &amp; Internet.” Scroll down in the list of Wi-Fi networks and select “Advanced
 options.” Activate the “Set as metered connection” option here. Note that this only affects the current WI-FI network you’re connected to, but Windows will remember the setting for this specific&nbsp;network in the future</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>@ Ruth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the refresher, which is always welcome. In my opinion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you have said, is a limitation and a security issue with the Windows Update Service, (WUS).&nbsp; The implementation of the WUS has created a back door, for unsolicited software that effects the OS by causing crashes, frustrated users and unnecessary time
 spent on troubleshooting, support services.&nbsp; The limitation is the lack of an option for the device end user or the implementation of Intelligent software (within the code) which could offer the choice to post pone one update in a list of updates.&nbsp; Currently
 its accept all or nothing.&nbsp; In some of the solutions posted, it was mentioned that using a right click on an update entry would provide a popup menu where you could select not to update.&nbsp; I have not successfully opened this popup.&nbsp; I believe the code has not
 been implemented or its there but not working.&nbsp; Probably an event-handler or pointer pointing to the right place but that part of the code does something else.&nbsp; In retrospect this would be an elegant method and solution to this kind of problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The security problem has to do with the updates installation process elevates the package to trusted installer, and please correct me if I'm wrong, which also happens to 3rd party updates authorized by the WUS as part of the service for developers.&nbsp; This
 is where malware, spyware or trojan-ware could gain access to everyone's device.&nbsp; I hope this would be a concern for Micro Software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned not accepting or disabling updates for Microsoft Office and other Microsoft programs.&nbsp; I would caution anyone who reads this to be aware that you will also not get automatic security updates for Microsoft Office and other Microsoft programs.
 (It has not been stated that this would have any effect on 3rd party Driver updates) It will then be upon you to administrate these built-in functions. Lots of daily work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The network metered connections which only "Do What, exactly?".&nbsp; Provides the Device end user with a choice to save some cost to automatic services. Good to know, but relevant?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if this is a worthy issue and will be passed up the chain of command, into the hands of product development?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In appreciation, </p>
<p>
</p><p />

    <title>Accurate positioning of second screen relative to the first. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boydtolton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Accurate positioning of second screen relative to the first.</h2>
                    I need to position a second monitor accurately relative to the first.&nbsp; Specifically I need to arrange the first display in landscape more, the second display in portrait mode, and the with both displays having the first (ie. bottom) row of pixels (ie.
 row 1) being the same row. When I position the displays using the&nbsp; graphical "Select and Arrange Displays" in Win10 Settings, I find that the bottom row of pixels for the two display can range between + and -30 pixels.&nbsp; Is there a command line method of arranging
 and positioning the displays accurately?

            Good day ! I am an independent adviser here to help you!
<br />
<br />As far as pixel-by-pixel basis, this is probably not possible. I haven't seen or heard of anywhere having a command to arrange displays pixel for pixel. 
<br />
<br />You most likely will have to use an external program or your graphics cards driver software to fix the screens better than windows can.

            WIndows can arrange the display graphically but does a poor job of aligning the screen relative to each other.&nbsp; Surely if Windows has a graphical method, they must have a command line method.

            They have commands for the display but I don't believe there are commands that will let you go pixel for pixel aligning them. 
<br />
<br />Windows perfectly aligns the screens relative to what they assume your screens look like. That is that is uses the same resolution. If you had 2 of the exact same screens, then windows 10 would perfectly align them pixel for pixel. 
<br />
<br />Make sure you have the exact same resolution and the exact same screens and it will be perfect. 
<br />
<br />Also, like I said, you should be able to use a GPU software program like nvidias control center or AMD's to align them better.

Not with the animated picture you have. But, there is an alternative plus a few dollars......</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been thinking about the PowerPC thing... PowerPC was some kind of chip used quite some time ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your processor is an Intel Core i7... not even remotely close to a PowerPC...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any add in cards or external devices hooked up to your machine ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>**** Just answered my own question with a search****</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take a look at this link.. just for info purposes...</p>

<p>
</p><p>So what you actually need is the driver for your Network Adapter, which apparently uses a PowerPC Processor !!!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 is unstable&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lrm555  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 is unstable&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My new Toshiba laptop came loaded with Windows 10.&nbsp; I loaded MS Office Suite 2013 and MS Outlook 2013 on it.&nbsp; All worked fine for about a week.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when I turned it back on, the Start button suddenly did not work, Cortana search didn't work, the notifications function also didn't work.&nbsp; And I could no longer open Word documents.&nbsp; So I did a restore on the system and all worked okay for a few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, when I turned it on, I'm having the same problems - no start button function, no Cortana or notifications, and I can't open Word docs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Toshiba and they said that the MS Office 2013 and Outlook may be incompatible with Windows 10 and causing this instability.&nbsp; Please let me what I should do?&nbsp;

            <p>Unfortunately, this Windows 10 continues to be unstable.&nbsp;&nbsp; While it works just fine on my desktop computer, it's been nothing but headaches on my new laptop which came loaded with Windows 10!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Cortana, start button and notification issues are now working.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>But I just noticed that most of the Windows 10 apps don't work (calculator, calendar, weather, camera, music)!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>When I click on them in the app list on the start button, I just get a message saying This App Can't Open.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've contacted your tech support and have been hours on the phone with them as they've re rebuilt Window 10 back on the laptop and these apps are still not working!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading other posts, it seems like others are experiencing this app problem on laptops with Windows 10.&nbsp; So it sounds like there's a need to create some kind of fix soon.&nbsp; Please let me know what you're doing to address this problem!&nbsp;

            <p>There are definitely issues with Windows 10 and Office 13.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the scans suggested above, and my system comes up clean.</p>
<p>I have also run the repairs to correct the corruption issues with Outlook 13 (where problems WERE found), but I still experience some issues with Outlook 2013. Selecting an Outlook subfolder, the cursor changes to the 'Processing' indicator and it is difficult
 to select anything. The only way to resolve this is to shut down Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Access 2013 has also become unstable, with crashes far more frequently than ever before while running apps that were stable under Win 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated - Thank you.</p>

            <p>To date I've tried explained Methods 1 and 2 listed herein on the response - neither worked!&nbsp; Method 1 requies Admin prev and Windows Key + R does not allow that option.&nbsp; My Cortana remains my instability issue. .&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft would of been better off leaving
 that out or an option to its customers as it works only about 33% of the time if I am lucky.&nbsp; It doesn't matter day or night - from right after I turn on my laptop or whether I have it up and running for few hours . .&nbsp; Cortana is NOT there for me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe a nice build of 10500 and the ousting of Cortana would be duly fitting here - let's make this happen!</p>

            Yes, I have much the same problems on my Lenovo laptop. I have found that doing a Restart does seem to temporarily cure problems but it is really annoying to have to do it so often! with Windows 7 it was normal just to close the lid when finished and when
 I came back to do more work and carry on but oftet with Windows 10 I have to do a restart before I can continue. It amazes me that the old Insider builds before the release version did not have these problems !!! when are Microsoft going to fix these problems?

            RN, Microsoft is asking a lot here - Method 1, 2 and 3 will not fix Windows 10 which has some significant problems. I am very tired of watching the message "Outlook is not responding" every few minutes when working on my emails. Rather than have thousands
 of users spin their wheels, Microsoft should fix this compatibility issue ASAP. I hope you have elevated this problem.&nbsp;

            Yes I agree windows 10 is the most unstable OS ever by MSFT.&nbsp; Almost every application, whether it's Word, MSN Explorer, IE, Skype, and a host of others ALWAYS stop working and needs to be opened again.&nbsp; Wish I could roll back to my original windows 7.

            I must disagree, since this thread started and many upgrades since, Windows 10 is now the most stable system version I have used( first PC I had was a 286 running DOS 4.1). I have two laptops running Windows 10, a Lenovo Thinkpad E520, an HP Pavilion 15
 and a quad core SSD equipped Windows 7 Desktop and I now find that I hardly ever use the Desktop as I prefer Windows 10.<br />

<h2>            chkdsk&#47;autochk&#47;autocheck problems.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am being driven crazy by a problem at Restart on my Windows XP Professional SP3&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I always boot into Normal Mode, the Dirty Bit is always set on my C: disk. Consequently, the next time I Restart, the system always wants to run CHKDSK/AUTOCHK *.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The value in my BootExecute entry in the registry is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>autocheck autochk *<br />
C:\PROGRA~1\AVG\AVG2013\avgrsx.exe /sync /restart<br />
</p>
<p>because I have AVG Free Antivirus 2013 installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once AUTOCHK finishes, the system goes into a reboot sequence, which will bring up Windows without further AUTOCHK-ing (suggesting that the disk is clean at that point). If that reboot is allowed to go into Normal Mode, the C: disk will be dirty, as indicated
 by FSUTIL DIRTY QUERY C:. If, instead, F8 is used during the boot sequence after AUTOCHK and Safe Mode is selected, the disk is shown to be clean (by FSUTIL). From there, Restarting again into Safe Mode shows the disk still to be clean. Restarting after a
 Safe Mode session into Normal Mode, shows the disk to be dirty again, according to FSUTI (always run from the Command Prompt).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this suggests to me that something in the Normal Mode start-up is causing the disk to become dirty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AUTOCHK does not report any fix-up measures on the screen, but in Event Viewer/Application/Winlogon I typically see messages like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...</p>
<font>
<p>Windows will now check the disk. </p>
<p>Cleaning up minor inconsistencies on the drive.</p>
<p>Cleaning up 35 unused index entries from index $SII of file 0x9.</p>
<p>Cleaning up 35 unused index entries from index $SDH of file 0x9.</p>
<p>Cleaning up 35 unused security descriptors.</p>
<p>CHKDSK is verifying Usn Journal...</p>
<p>Usn Journal verification completed.</p>
</font>
<p>...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>although the number of unused entries (35 in this case)&nbsp;will vary from one run to another but it will always apply to file 0x9. I'm not sure whether these "minor inconsistencies" are the cause of the disk being regarded as dirty or whether they are unrelated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried using MSCONFIG to reduce the number of programs/services run at start-up but is is only when booting explicitly into Safe Mode that the clean disk&nbsp;behaviour (according to FSUTIL, after AUTOCHK during boot) seems to occur.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that you can disable AUTOCHK ever being run at boot time (CHKNTFS /X, etc.)&nbsp;but I am unwilling to do this since there will be no warning if any more serious inconsistencies ever occur on the disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also like to understand the syntax of the BootExecute entry better. When there is more than one line (as in mine), does the second line get run unconditionally, following the completion of the first line? Is AUTOCH<u>EC</u>K responsible for checking
 the dirty bit and scheduling the running of AUTOCHK, if the bit is set? If so, does the second line only get run, if AUTOCH<u>EC</u>K has&nbsp;found that the bit is set?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the second (AVGRSX)&nbsp;line in my BootExecute entry causes the system to be Restarted, I don't think that&nbsp;I have seen that to happen, when the disk isn't dirty. Not sure why.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any&nbsp;suggestions on the cause of this problem&nbsp;from anyone with more knowledge of Windows start-up procedures would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please don't hesitate to come back with any questions for clarification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I couldn't see that either of those links helped to explain why the disk appears clean when Windows is started&nbsp;in Safe Mode (after an AUTOCHK run)&nbsp;but not when started&nbsp;in Normal Mode (or in any reduced version of Normal Mode that I have tried, with fewer
 Start-Ups and Services being run).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already knew how to disable AUTOCHK at boot time but I guess that will dsiable it for all potential future error situations on that disk, not just the one that I may be experiencing at the moment. Doesn't sound very desirable!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think that AUTCHK itself or the AVG command in the BootExecute registry entry can be causing the problem, since FSUTIL run from the desktop when the system has been booted into Safe mode shows the disk to be clean. The only other possible explanation
 would be that FSUTIL itself doesn't work properly in Safe Mode, always reporting a disk as clean. (I don't think that this explanation works because AUTOCHK does not get scheduled for the next Normal Mode boot, following a "clean" Safe Mode session. This behaviour
 suggests that the disk really is clean, at this time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the correspondents on one of those links had the impression that this problem started occurring (for him)&nbsp;when a particular set of Windows Updates were installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still baffled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found out why my C: disk was being flagged as dirty each time I booted into Windows in Normal Mode but not for Safe Mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the files (with a name like chjw_deleted16572270-892e-455e-b775-e241fdbcad2e in the AllUsers AVG ApplicationData area)&nbsp;relating to the AVG 2013 AntiVirus&nbsp;Free&nbsp;appeared to have&nbsp;lost some of its NTFS security attributes, rendering that file unreadable
 and undeletable, I believe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When AVG saw this file, during start-up, it seems to have flagged the disk as dirty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is diffcult to be sure about the exact nature of the corrruption of the file structure relating to this file, except to say that it seems to have become inaccessible to Windows. However, CHKDSK/AUTOCHK appear unable (with any switches)&nbsp;to detect any problem.
 Presumably these programs are happy, providing that there are no pointers (index entries)&nbsp;in the file-system to indicate that that file should have security attributes which are not there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, the file-system can appear to be consistent as an NTFS structure, without having the necessary (consistent) information for Windows to be able to access the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, I suppose that it is possible that the security attributes are present but somehow point to an invalid user account or permission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The provisional remedy was to move the offending file out of the AllUsers AVG ApplicationData area into a non AVG area and re-install AVG.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still left with a corrupt file, which I would quite like to clean up, but at least the irritating AUTOCHK runs at boot time have gone. If anyone can suggest a utility which can clean up this sort of file, I would be very interested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>

    <title>XP upgrade from SP2 to SP3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gorn&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            XP upgrade from SP2 to SP3</h2>
                    Support for WinXP will end in April 2014 but existing support is for only XP SP3.<br />
<br />
I have just had to reload windows and my installation disk contains only Win XP SP2. There is a link to SP 3 at
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24</a> but it says that for the update of single computer use the Auto Updates. This creates a problem -t when you only have SP2 you cannot
 use Auto Update to get SP3 because SP2 is no longer supported!&nbsp; When I use Auto Update it does not download anything at the set time.&nbsp; If I try to log in to manually update it says the page that SP2 is trying to log into cannot be found.<br />
<br />
How can I get the single computer version of SP3 so I can update from SP2?

            <p>Ignore the warnings, download and install it. If your system has a non-intel processor, for example AMD, you need to download and install&nbsp;the Microsoft upgrade package for non-intel processors&nbsp;from the link below. prior to the installation of Windows XP
 SP3.</p>

            You may definitely reinstall <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10</a></strong> by following the steps provided on this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install-insiderplat_pc/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">link</a></strong>. At the bottom
 of the page, you will see the steps on how to reactivate Windows 10. If you prefer to reinstall Windows with all the preinstalled apps from Dell. I suggest getting in touch with their support team to get a Windows 10 OEM disc. Just a friendly advice, It would
 be best to back up all your important files before performing these steps to avoid data loss.<br />

            If Windows XP came pre-installed on your computer, contact your computer maker for a replacement CD. If you bought a retail version of Windows XP, contact Microsoft.

<h2>            Windows 10 downgrade</h2>
                    I wanted to go back to windows 7 from settings and recovery, but it was saying i have to delete first the accounts i created(administrator). It is true that i created the admin account from cmd, but when i saw that i can do even less from that i went to
 cmd and i "removed" it. I thought then it was sayin that because of my main, so i activated again that admin account and i deleted my main...biggest stupidity i've ever done. After that i had to create another account ,i searched a little how to do that from
 the admin build,and now here i am , unable to downgrade . now it says i have to remove 2 accounts i created(administrator, and the new one). Hope someone will understand my mistakes , and if there are no solutions for this yet, how can i save windows.old from
 auto delete?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your effort towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Please be aware the Windows.old folder located at the root of the local disk where Windows 10 is installed will be deleted after 30 days automatically.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The Windows.old folder is used to facilitate the rollback. <strong>So please perform any rollback within 30 days</strong> or this option will no longer be available.</p>
<p>　</p>
</span><span>
<p>Try the following methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a month after you upgrade to Windows 10, you’ll be able to go back to your previous version of Windows from
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update &amp; security</strong> &gt; <strong>Recovery</strong>. This will keep your personal files, but it'll remove apps and drivers installed after the upgrade, as well as any changes you made to settings.
</p>
</span><span>
<p>　</p>
</span><span>
<p>Also, we would like to know since how many days you are using Windows 10? If it's been more than 30 days, refer the following article and check if it helps.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 initial observations - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> djp42  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 initial observations</h2>
                    <p>My first impression after installing Windows 10 on my PC was favourable, but during the first few days working with it, I have observed a few things I don't like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;My browser of choice is Opera, and I run Firefox as well, since I do a LOT of work on the internet. &nbsp;I often have several tabs open in each browser. &nbsp;Today, for the second or third time time, Opera closed the html file I use the most. &nbsp;It's a big webpage,
 residing on my hard drive and not yet uploaded to the internet, but Opera NEVER closed it without an explicit command from me when I was running Windows 8.1 and before that, XPPro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;Firefox remains open, but all the text has disappeared from every webpage that is open, even the titles that appear in the tabs themselves. &nbsp;Where these webpages included a picture, or the tab includes an icon particular to the webpage, the picture or
 icon has survived, but everything else is gone. &nbsp;I'm fairly sure this will cure itself when I close and reopen the program or do a reboot, but these are time wasting distractions interfering with my productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;The title bars of all the programs I use are either white or a pale grey. &nbsp;When I have several programs open, I would prefer to have them coloured so I can quickly find the title bars on the screen and click on them. &nbsp;Except for the awful High Contrast
 choices, the Colour Scheme settings do not address this problem. &nbsp;The High Contrast choices are simply ugly. &nbsp;EDIT 2015-08-13 There are a lot of complaints about this. &nbsp;There's a workaround at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-change-title-bar-color-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="How to add colour to your menu bars">http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-change-title-bar-color-in-windows-10/</a>&nbsp;and
 it seems to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. &nbsp;When first using Windows 10 I had a menu of choices about sharing information with Microsoft. &nbsp;The defaults are to share everything. &nbsp;These can be turned off, but it's a tedious process which must be done one feature at a time. &nbsp;This creates a risk that
 many users will just choose the overall default and be subject to a significant invasion of privacy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. &nbsp;Just like Windows 8.1, when I open a program by clicking an icon pinned to the taskbar, a new icon opens way over to the right. &nbsp;That's goofy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. &nbsp;I work with thousands of graphics files that reside on my hard drive. &nbsp;Windows 10 automatically assigned the default program to be one that I downloaded some months ago and whose 30 day test period has long expired. &nbsp;I was not offered a choice. &nbsp;Hence,
 every time I tried to look at one of these images, I got an error message saying the program was expired, and asking if I wanted to uninstall it. &nbsp;When I chose uninstall, though, I'd get another error message saying it couldn't be uninstalled because the uninstall
 application couldn't be copied to some (now forgotten) folder. &nbsp;This happened 10 or 15 times before I finally gave up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. One of the few Windows 8.1 features I liked was being able to click the arrow on the right of an Windows Explorer (File Explorer) address bar to get a dropdown menu of recent locations. &nbsp;The arrow still opens a dropdown box, but it's blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. &nbsp;The vertical scroll bars on almost all my open programs has become much narrower, making them harder to grab, and they are in a non-contrasting grey, so the sliding part almost blends in with the background colour of the open window. &nbsp;It's more difficult
 now to access these vertical scroll bars than it used to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. &nbsp;Despite saying Microsoft reinstated the Start menu in Windows 10, it certainly does not resemble the Start menu in older Windows versions, nor is it anywhere near as complete. &nbsp;While it is resizable, making it taller doesn't move more menu items into
 view in the left column, and while there's a vertical scroll bar, it's black on black so you cannot find it except by trial and error. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>10. &nbsp;I have several apps running. &nbsp;I "snapped" one to the right of my screen, intending to move to another and snap it to the left, since I will be copying from one to the other. &nbsp;The not yet left-snapped app is not visible, instead I see a background consisting
 of part of my desktop, and icons for several other active programs, but not the one I intended to snap left. &nbsp;It turns out that Windows+Arrow shrinks the windows and moves it left or right regardless of which arrow key is used. &nbsp;It seems to cycle horizontally
 and vertically as well. &nbsp;This is going to take some getting used to; it seems bizarre that Windows doesn't obey the arrow direction used and the arrows don't behave in a consistent manner. &nbsp;Entering one full-sized window, nothing happened when I pressed Windows-UpArrow.
 &nbsp;When I pressed Windows-DownArrow, the window shrank and moved to the left, displaying itself as the top level of a group of cascading open program windows. Pressing Windows-DownArrow a second time minimized the program and made the next one active. &nbsp;Pressing
 it a third time minimized that program's window and made yet another active. The minimized programs can be accessed again from the Task Bar or with Alt-Tab. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
I will add to this list as time goes by. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>11. &nbsp;Slowness - at times everything slows to a crawl. &nbsp;I suspect something is happening in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>12. &nbsp;This morning</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;Coming out of sleep mode, I was faced with a black screen, except for the toolbar. &nbsp;Turns out my browser, Opera, was open but the display was blank. &nbsp;I suspect this is a conflict between Windows 10 and my graphics card.</p>
<p>b. After closing Opera, my Thunderbird email client was next to display. &nbsp;As I moved the mouse, line after line after line of text within the message window went blank. &nbsp;Again, an indicator of conflict with the graphics card?</p>
<p>13. &nbsp;Now <strong>for crying out loud, </strong>Firefox has blanked out when I clicked on its menu bar - there's still a huge place holder for it on my screen, but all there is in it is white space where the title and address bars would be, and grey where
 the webpage content would normally display, with a few black rectangles that appear (and stay) as I move my mouse over the grey area. &nbsp;I imagine I can recover from this by rebooting, but WHY SHOULD IT BE NECESSARY! &nbsp; UPDATE &nbsp;Firefox Release 40 came out on
 Aug 13 2015, perhaps that will fix this problem. &nbsp;UPDATE Aug. 15 2015. &nbsp;Nope. &nbsp;Now I cannot move between the various tabs in Firefox, scroll within any of those webpages, nor close tabs individually. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>14. &nbsp;Every time I try to sort the contents of a folder by date after I've saved some files to it, both Win 10 and 8.1 index the folder again, so I have to wait and wait until the sort is finished before I can click the most recently added ones. &nbsp;This is
 very frustrating. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2015 08 16</p>
<p>15. &nbsp;My Opera browser crashed. &nbsp;A few minutes later, after opening Opera again, my entire sytem crashed, and then Windows 10 did some sort of reboot. &nbsp;When I got back to my sign in screen and signed in, pretty much everything I had had open was open again.
 &nbsp;That's a good thing, but why the crash? &nbsp;I got a message saying there was a Windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2015 08 17</p>
<p>16. &nbsp;Having the computer on Sleep all night, I did the usual pressing a key to awaken it. &nbsp;Everything opened but I could not connect to the internet with either Opera or Firefox. &nbsp;My wifi connection was showing it was connecting, so what gives? &nbsp;I spent
 5 or 10 minutes trying to get online, then put the machine to Sleep while I went out. &nbsp;Returning now and awakening it, everything seems to be working. &nbsp; That's good, but why was I unable to get online? &nbsp;This doesn't speak well for any files stored in the Cloud.
 &nbsp;Users will be crippled when they can't access them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>17, &nbsp;I put my computer into Sleep mode last night with several programs open which I intended to resume working with again this morning. &nbsp;Unfortunately, Windows did some sort of update overnight and rebooted. &nbsp;Unlike Aug. 17, none of the programs were open
 this morning, so I have to waste time trying to remember which programs I need to reopen, rather than just have them ready to use. &nbsp;NOT GOOD, MICROSOFT!!!</p>

            <p>If you have a Windows installation DVD then you can go through the first few installation steps. You will get an opportunity to format your disk. If you have no such disk then you can do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;1. Set your BIOS to use the DVD drive as the primary boot device.<br />
&nbsp;2. Boot with a System Repair CD. If you do not have one, ask a friend to burn one for you via the Control Panel / Backup and Restore. It takes less than five minutes.<br />
&nbsp;3. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …" appears.<br />
&nbsp;4. Select a language, a time and currency, and a keyboard or input method, and then click Next. You are now in Repair Mode.<br />
&nbsp;5. Select an Operating System, then click Next.<br />
&nbsp;6. Select the Command Prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;7. Type these commands and press Enter after each:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; diskpart</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; select&nbsp; disk 0</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clean</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exit</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above process will erase everything on your disk. Note, however, that a person with sufficient skills, time and the right tools can reverse the erasure. If you really want to make the disk unreadable then applying a hacksaw to it is highly effective
 and costs next to nothing.</p>

<p>original title: BSOD: Driver_Power_State_Failure 0x0000009F</p>
<p>Good Day,<br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone could help me solve a problem on my computer. I had recently gotten a BSOD saying DRIVER_POWER_STATE_Failure and 0x0000009F. This particular BSOD has been occurring frequently over the past two days, and as a result of it, my computer
 would get really sluggish and less responsive, especially when I'm shutting down my computer, shortly leading to the BSOD. I tried looking into this using Blue Screen Viewer and it said the problem occurred with ntoskrnl.exe. After that, I'm at a complete
 loss as to where to go from here. My computer has the following configuration: Windows 7 Ultimate 64-Bit Edition, Intel i7 975 Extreme Edition, 2 x EVGA GeForce 295 Superclocked, 12 GB Cosair Dominator GT, Cosair 1000 HX Power Supply, Creative Labs Elite Pro
 Sound Card, Blackmagic Intensity Pro Capture Card, EVGA x58 3-way Classified Motherboard, RAID 1 with 2 x 2 TB Western Digital Black Hard drives, RAID 10 with 4 x 1 TB Western Digital Green Hard Drives. The last drivers I installed were the latest Intel Matrix
 Storage Drivers, and the latest audio drivers that pertained to my motherboard's on-board audio module.</p>
<p>I attached the three most recent mini dump files that, if I can recall, show this BSOD error. Hopefully all of this helps you guys narrow down the problem. I would really appreciate it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the Mini Crash Dump Files: <a href="http://cid-17153ecede3918b4.office.live.com/embedicon.aspx/.Public/Mini%20Crash%20Dump%20Files.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Click Here</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I ran the Driver Verifier program from within Windows 7, and it also produced a crash dump, but the BSOD error was different than the previous ones. I attached that crash dump file as well, and labeled it accordingly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the Mini Crash Dump File from Driver Verifier: <a href="http://cid-17153ecede3918b4.office.live.com/embedicon.aspx/.Public/Driver%20Verifier%20Crash%20Dump%20File.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please, if you can, would you lend me a hand?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>Results verified with WinDBG, DumpCHK, and BlueScreenView.<br />
</strong><br />
The 3 Bug_Checks 9F were CAUSE by Pci.sys and the Bug_Check C9 (Driver Verifier) showed<br />
hidclass.sys was CAUSE. Both of those are Windows components which means something<br />
unknown drove those to fault.<br />
<br />
Be sure to update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and other major device drivers.<br />
<br />
=============================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 9F&nbsp; 0x0000009F<br />
<br />
</strong>Are you using any Roxio or Nero programs? These have been known to cause this problem even<br />
if they were working well for a long period of time. If so check with their support.<br />
<br />
----------------<br />
<br />
Check these :</p>
<p>Error message when you try to resume a Windows 7-based or a Windows Server 2008 R2-based<br />
computer from hibernation: "Stop 0x0000009F"<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/977186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/977186</span></a></p>
<p>Stop error when you put a computer that is running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 to<br />
sleep or into hibernation, or when you restart the computer: "0x9F" <br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/975599" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/975599</span></a></p>
<p>"0x0000009F" Stop error message when a computer enters and resumes from hibernation in<br />
Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/981848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/981848</span></a></p>
<p>This one is possible if BlueScreenView OR MyEventViewer (or EventViewer) shows the appropriate code.</p>
<p>Windows Kernel event ID 41 error in Windows 7 or in Windows Server 2008 R2: “The system has<br />
rebooted without cleanly shutting down first”<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2028504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2028504</span></a></p>
<p>And :</p>
<p>"Stop 0x9F" or "Stop 0xFE" error on a Windows 7-based or Windows Vista-based computer that<br />
uses certain AMD USB EHCI host controllers<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/982091" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/982091</span></a><br />
<br />
================================<br />
================================<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.</p>
<p>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispware/security programs can also cause these issues.<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to see<br />
if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be caused by a loose card or cable<br />
and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel - Device<br />
Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display Adapter - NIC<br />
and WIFI - Sound and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow computer to turn off power.<br />
Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Start - type in Search box - MSCONFIG&nbsp; find at top - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else). See next message for my<br />
generic driver update methods.</strong></p>
<p><strong>BCCode: 9F&nbsp; 0x0000009F&nbsp; &lt;-- read this link<br />

Hope this helps and Happy Holidays!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<p>Good bet the issue is caused by or aggravated by Norton which is known for causing strange issues.<br />
</p>
<p>Norton/Symantec is known for causing strange issues and aggravating others. Best to uninstall it<br />
to test as merely disabling it will still&nbsp;allow pieces of it to install. Uninstall it and run the Norton<br />
Removal Tool to prevent trouble causing remnants from being left behind. Below are recommendations<br />
to use while testing, even better permanently.<br />

<br />
------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend : (These are all Free versions and very effective.)</p>
<p>Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and<br />
Network running.</p>
<p>Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free</p>
<p>Windows Firewall</p>
<p>Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)</p>
<p>IE - Protected Mode</p>
<p>IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)</p>
<p>I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Two versions of Avast are available 5.x and 4.8x<br />
<br />
Avast 5.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</span></a><br />
<br />
Avast 4.8x&nbsp;- Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web,<br />
and Network running. (Double Click&nbsp;Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields -<br />
Terminate&nbsp;those you do not use.)<br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4</span></a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />

<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for the response. I apologize for the late response, just got back home. Before this all started happening, I was downloading and installing a few games off of Steam, and Games for Windows Live. Then, my computer started hanging, so I
 had to power down manually. And ever since then, this kept occurring. I just uninstalled Norton Internet Security and Nero 10, and still the problem persists. Earlier, I was running CHKDSK to make sure nothing was corrupted, but it keeps hanging at 1 second
 before scanning, and my keyboard becomes unresponsive throughout the entire countdown, so I'm not even able to scan my hard drives. The only way around this was through the F8 menu and loading the Last Known Good Configuration, but even then it would hang
 at 1 second, and the keyboard would still be unresponsive, but it would then boot into Windows 7. After that, the keyboard works... Really weird =/ . Before I read your response SpiritX, I removed my Blackmagic Intensity Pro card, and the Blue Screens stopped.
 But, when windows starts up normally, it still hangs at the CHKDSK, and the keyboard is still unresponsive during the CHKDSK prompt, but it loads into Windows...Yay! But, for some reason, Windows Live Messenger keeps crashing now... What is going on? I had
 the latest drivers installed for the Intensity Pro for a few months now, and had no problems. Could something be conflicting with the Intensity.sys? Sorry if this seems all jumbled together, I'm just ripping my hair out... I'm going to try the hot fix from
 SpiritX, the one with restarting the computer... Do you think there is a problem with the card, itself, or is this just software issues?</p>
<p>Thank You Again!</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
That checkdisk will not run is not good. Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and<br />
cables (on both ends when possible) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug.<br />
<br />
Then use these methods to check the drive (the issue could be hard drive controller, cabling,<br />
or other hardware). <br />
<br />
Disk issues can get serious very quickly so I would thoroughly check the drive now and be sure<br />
to keep redundant backups of your important data (use several methods).<br />
<br />
Inside Windows - Regular or Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 as you boot).<br />
<br />
Run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way out then restart.<br />

----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
For even better and more efficient checking :<br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt of the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista/Windows<br />
7&nbsp;disk - if you do not have a&nbsp;Vista/Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friend's (it needs to be same<br />
32 or 64 bit and they are not copy protected) or make one. Also your System maker will sell the<br />
physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
Space after k and before /&nbsp; and after f and before /<br />

<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Go into Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot so watch screen as you startup. Set the<br />
boot order to CD/DVD to use Windows&nbsp;disks (Vista or Windows 7 whichever you have installed.)<br />
Remember to set back when done.<br />

<p>Thanks for the response. I just got CHKDSK to work, and it fixed a few errors and completed successfully (I hope). When I got into windows, I went to MSCONFIG and configured it so that Windows boots in a clean mode, with just Microsoft services. I enabled
 1 service though, the Intel Rapid Storage Technology RAID service, so I could just verify and repair my RAID. Everything was working fine, until the RAID service got to around 58% complete, then the system blue screened again, giving the same Driver_Power_State_Failure
 0x0000009F. I was under the impression the the Blackmagic Intensity Pro Capture Card was causing this error, now I have no idea. I attached the crash dumps of two crashes the day before. What do you think is going on? I hadn't had a chance to check to see
 if the hard drives are bad yet, I'm in the process of backing everything up, but do you think it could be a faulty hard drive causing these problems?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Both Bug_Checks were 9F 0x0000009F&nbsp;CAUSE shown as pci.sys and sbp2port.sys both of which are<br />
Windows Components so something else drove them into fault.<br />
<br />
1. Update the BIOS and low level chipset drivers.<br />
<br />
2. Uninstall Norton/Symantec and replace at least while testing.<br />
<br />
3. Suspect the RAID setup is involved in the issue but will be hard to do much if the drivers are up to<br />
date - check with the System Maker/Motherboard if the RAID is on the motherboard and/or the RAID<br />
device maker's Support<br />
<br />
Hope this helps and Happy Holidays!<br />
