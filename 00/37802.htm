    <title>Run as Administrator in Win 10 doesn&#39;t &#34;stick&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikesyr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Run as Administrator in Win 10 doesn&#39;t &#34;stick&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have followed the steps found around the web but they don't work - at least for what I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a game app (that also has a desktop shortcut) that, when launched, always asks for permission to make changes.</p>
<p>Should " running as an administrator" prevent my being asked this every time I run the app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turning off "SmartScreen" under Security in Control Panel didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the shortcut to "run as admin" didn't work</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the .exe to "run as admin" didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right clicking the app to "run as admin" doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess all these gyrations are pointless? Thanks.</p>

</p><p>Is it a Microsoft account or Local account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see this kind of behavior, when User Profile doesn't have required Administrator privileges. Suggest you to check with the below steps and see if they helps you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">* Press
<strong><span>Windows Key + R</span></strong>, type
<strong><span>netplwiz</span></strong></span></p>

            <p>Please understand.... I can get the app to run but ONLY after accepting the warning. I don't want to have to deal with the warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;Is it a Microsoft account or Local account?<br />
<strong>I don't understand the question...Is what a Microsoft account or local account?</strong><br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;You can see this kind of behavior, when User Profile doesn't have required Administrator privileges.&nbsp;<br />
<strong>My account already does have admin privileges.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;* Press Windows Key + R, type netplwiz<br />
&gt;&gt;* Click and highlight the User profile, which you want to make administrator<br />
<br />
<strong>At this point my account is already identified as being an administrator (Group column says "HomeUsers, Administrators").</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;* Click on Properties, then select the Group Membership tab<br />
&gt;&gt;* Select the Administrator, Click apply/ok.<br />
<br />
<strong>Did that, and my "Group" listing dropped the "HomeUsers" and now says only "Administrators".</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Rebooted but it didn't help.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I wrote earlier: &nbsp;</p>
<p>Right clicking the app to "run as admin" doesn't work.</p>
<p>What does this mean? That I can never get it load without the UAC warning me?</p>

<h2>            Your Computer is trying to use a DNS server that is incorrect or doesn&#39;t exist</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago I moved into a new house for uni and this was impossible for me to use a ethernet cable &nbsp;and had to use my wifi adapter to connect however when trying to connect I am unable to get onto the Internet originally it was telling my one or more
 protocols from my computer are missing related to the windows sockets protocols and after a day or so of trying to beat that issue deleting &nbsp;the winsock keys and using winsock repair to repair the registry managed to stop the issue but I now have the issue
 stating that your computer is trying to use an incorrect dns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I know so far or have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I can connect to the Internet on my phone and tablet and my housemates can also connect</p>
<p>
</p><p>Manually entering the dns address and public ones such as Google yields the same outcome</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the command prompt suggestions such as the netsh ones, ipconfig, &nbsp;sec /scanned shows nothing to be wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restoring my pc resetting my pc have provided no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used two different wifi adapters which have both shown the same results and reinstalling their drivers has not helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be appreciated I really need a fix for this soon</p>

<h2>            Cannot boot into Windows</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I was recently curious about Linux and tried to create a dual-boot with Ubuntu and Windows 10. Not satisfied by it, I soon decided to remove it and to do that, I followed some instructions that made me delete the linux partitions with diskmgmt.</p>
<p>Then I rebooted the laptop. And now the only thing that appears is a black screen with a "Minimalist BASH-like line editer" with the following title: GNU GRuB version 2.02^beta2-36ubuntu3.12".</p>
<p>Pressing ESC, F8, F10, F12 does not change the way it boots, it always ends up at that black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question is, how can I reset my laptop entirely so it runs Windows 10 again? I have a backup, but no windows repair disk nor anything like it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated as I am lost at this point, and if you need more info please say so.</p>

<p>hi david, as suggested bellow but if that fails too it could be a hardware problem? if you can boot into safe mode and see if the issue is there failing the usual chkdsk, sfc/scannow , and as you have a backup then using another pc download the media creation
 tool and and use it to create a recovery drive ,usb flash drive /disk media and re-install windows doing a clean custom install.</p>

    <title>Xbox One and TV with built-in tuner - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> satsumo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One and TV with built-in tuner</h2>
                    
<p>I'm fortunate enough to have just bought a Samsung 4K 65 inch TV.</p>
<p>It has a built-in Freesat tuner in it.</p>

<p>The problem is that the Xbox One appears to only handle a set-top box rather than a TV with the functionality built in.&nbsp; Does anyone else have a similar configuration - i.e. the X1 connected to a TV which also happens to be the tuner?&nbsp; Until I get this resolved
 I cannot really make use of all the features my TV offers.</p>

<p>BTW: X1 gaming on a 4K TV - WOW!!! (Yes, I know it's just upscaling).</p>

<p>The way the One works is you put it between the upstream end and downstream end and it works with the set-top box. &nbsp;If the "set-top box" is downstream I doubt it works.</p>

<p>The X1 controls devices upstream too (it controls my Soundbar which is upstream - i.e. on HDMI-out) hence technically the X1 "could" do what I needed, just wasn't sure if it did!!</p>
<p>Guess I'll have to wait for an update to resolve that...most TVs sold today (in the UK) have built-in Freesat/Freeview - hence pretty sure I'm not the only person who needs the X1 to control the TV's channels. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll look at the Feedback forums and see if it's there and vote it up.</p>

<p>I also have a Samsung tv with a built in tuner, however the Xbox One TV tuner is what you need to get OTA tv through the Xbox via oneguide without the need for a set top box, which is what I have running with no problems. If you are looking to get cable
 channels without a box, that's a totally different animal though.</p>

<p>I not sure I understand, the link is the effectively a freesat box, you put your arial cable in one end and the other end you put in your xbox, and due to the tuner it can sort out your freesat and one guide, you may need a splitter to split the arial cable
 so it goes directly into your tv as well</p>

<p>In reply to above I think you plug the cable that comes through the wall into one end and then into the x1 and the HDMI plugs in as normal x1 to your TV .
</p>
<p>Some thing to note as far as I know from what I have searched it is only valid to work with free view and not free sat &nbsp;,so due to this I will not be getting one. I do have a nice TV Samsung ue55f8000st so it has free sat built in and I have two cables coming
 through the wall so I was thinking of getting a very cheap free sat box so the one guide on x1 can work by putting one of the wall cables in the TV and then one in the cheap free sat box and link that to the x1 it may work........

<h2>            Classical fps our Heritage&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; Unreal Tournament 99 needs to be preserved on XB1 PLEASE&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello there fellow gamers and microsoft xbox employees. I would like to tell you a little about myself before making my case. I am big fan of halo. Ive played since halo ce 2001. I spent alot of time playing halo 2 on the original xbox live. Im much older
 now. I purchased an xbox one last year so me and my girl friend could relive those old halo2 memories. So much time had passed and so much has changed. My girlfriend and her family has got me back to gaming and im glad because i truly missed it. But looking
 back on halo reminds me why i begged my mom for an xbox and broadband so many birthdays ago. One of the original xbox live launch titles back in the day was unreal championship. That game and xbox live is the reason i play halo today. Unreal Championship was
 a slight let down to its predecessor Unreal Tournament 99.&nbsp;But halo came along and picked up the multiplayer&nbsp;fps arena&nbsp;where Unreal Tournament 99 left off.&nbsp;I was very young when i was introduced to ut99. It was a lan party. Everybody had there own pc.&nbsp;My young
 mind&nbsp;was blown away by it all. Unreal Tournament 99 is the reason im hooked on multiplayer FPS today. It is the reason I game.&nbsp;I bought a ps2 recently to play it but the ps2 was not powerful enough for UT99. Low frame rate. Multiplayer is splitscreen or ilink
 (a form of ps2 lan) and all the maps are downscaled. Split screen gets 2 game modes and maybe 8 maps. Half the game is missing. The ps2 version just couldnt stand up to the pc. (But XB1&nbsp;can!)&nbsp;I bought&nbsp;Unreal Tournament GOTY (Game of the Year 99)&nbsp;off steam.
 In order to play the game on modern PCs the open gl must be updated (old direct X is well...too old)&nbsp;and one&nbsp;will have to add the line "FrameRateLimit=60" (doesnt have to be 60) under the OpenGLDrv.OpenGLRenderDevive in the UnrealTournament.ini file. This
 is&nbsp;almost to complicated for me but not for the guys at xbox. Im sure a pc port to xb1 online&nbsp;game store could take less than a few&nbsp;weeks. Maybe a few days even.&nbsp;I would gladly spend my hard earned&nbsp;money on it. ( Ive seen the new unreal not really impressed.
 I know im fine with old graphics and the community for unreal just wants ut 99 back. This would sell xb1's to all the pc junkies that still crave online carnage only&nbsp;UT99 can provide. FPS is loosing originality.&nbsp;Halo's multiplayer arena style and&nbsp;CODs&nbsp;came
 from unreal tournament. You know the announcer for multi kills and sprees? UT99 did that. Halo's original fan base was&nbsp;Unreal players. We owe what we have today to Unreal Tournament&nbsp;'99 the original fps gladiator bloodsport. Not the countless unreal seqeuls
 that kept letting us down before it eventually killed unreal by extinguishing UT99's former glory. Sounds like another franchise lol. But i dont want to get into that.&nbsp;All im saying i whether you play cod or halo some&nbsp;those multiplayer mechanics you&nbsp;love come
 from Unreal Tournament '99. This is an opportunity xbox should jump on. If anyone else would like to revisit history speak up. It would be&nbsp;awsome to see Unreal Tournament GOTY in the&nbsp;XB1 stores but, until then&nbsp;I'll be booting up the ol' ps2 to play with bots
 or shelling out the dough trying to build a&nbsp;pc to run the classic art.&nbsp;Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>

<p>I think the best you can hope for is UT3 being added to Back compat as so far,UT4 is only confirmed for PC.i doubt that Epic will rework a game that old for re-release.but head over to the epic/unreal forums and make your voice heard if enough fans speak
 up maybe,just maybe they will bring the new one out on XB1/PS4</p>

<p>We can pay homage to the classics but I don't think remakes or faithful ports would do well today. I'm not sure how the old boys Quake and Unreal stack up these days. Huge FPS franchises like CoD, Battlefield, Titanfall, Destiny, and others, soon Battleborn...
 it's a competitive genre now.</p>
<p>Epic's focus on PC is a result of the failure of UT3. The development of that was focused on consoles, and it didn't do well against the new boys on those platforms, and since the PC version was basically constrained by the console focus, a port, it didn't
 do well with the crowd that should have dived all over it.</p>
<p>They could do a faithful remake tacked on, maybe. As with Doom 3 BFG with the old DOOMs in the collection. But they were already available on last-gen anyway, as Arcade games on 360 and such. Maybe with Xbox One and Windows 10 crossplay, perhaps UT4 could
 do something nobody is really doing yet and unite PC and consoles, and find a way back into the mainstream. Especially if the Xbox One has mouse and keyboard peripheral support.</p>
<p>Otherwise UT4 will probably thrive on PC without console versions and only huge success on PC will make console versions a thing a publisher would be interested in considering. So with that in mind, a faithful remake of the origial, or the old version made
 available... it's hard to see it happening.</p>
<p>I hope it does just for you though OP, it sounds like you're a huge fan. =)</p>

<h2>            No Wifi - Windows Connection Manager won&#39;t start&#58; Error 126</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help me with this. A Windows 10 notebook I'm working on does not have Wifi working.</p>
<p>After network adapter diagnosis, it says that WLAN service is not running. Tried to fix it as an administrator but that didn't work either.</p>
<p>WLAN service dependencies led me to Windows Connection Manager, that's also stopped. Tried to start it but gave me error 126.<br />
</p>
<p>As this PC had Windows 8 previously and Wifi worked before, I think this problem is related to corrupted files on upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I tried DISM.exe (dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth) but it didn't fixed the problem.</p>
<p>Also tried&nbsp;sfc /scannow and it said that "it has found damaged files but could not fix them"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other repair tools I can use to avoid formatting the hell out of this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>

<h2>            Activate windows 10 with new motherboard</h2>
                    Replaced mother board after installing windows 10 and now windows is not activated. When i try to activate it says that my product key has been blocked. Upgraded to windows 10 from Retail version of Windows 8.1. It was my understanding that it being a
 retail version, not OEM, windows would not be tied to hardware. Thinking about re installing but do not want to go through all that just to run into the same issue.

            <p>Had the same issue. &nbsp;After talking with Microsoft the only option is to roll back to 8.1, then reinstall Windows 10 or buy a key for $119.<br />
<br />
This is ridiculous. &nbsp;My Windows version a a legitimate, licensed version. &nbsp;You would think they could just provide a key.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately you have to go back to 8.1, have the key reactivated, then upgrade to windows 10.&nbsp; Because it is a retail key you have the option to move your Windows from one computer to another computer. BUT even this is not automatic.&nbsp; The key itself is
 still only good on one computer at a time.&nbsp; Unfortunately changing a mobo is seen as a new computer. But with just a mobo swap, its not necessarily treated as a new computer.&nbsp; So if you actually have an OEM version you would still be able to have the key reactivated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Step 1 is to go back window 8.1. Make sure you use the key you already have when you reinstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2, contact Microsoft support, explain the&nbsp;situation as simply as possible ("I have a retail version of Win, and&nbsp;I had to do a mobo swap.&nbsp; Please release the key&nbsp;so I can reactivate&nbsp;my computer...")&nbsp;to have them release the key.&nbsp; Provided you have a
 legitimate key, they will do this with out a problem.&nbsp; And then they will assist you in making sure that your version of windows is activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 3 - Update your version of windows.&nbsp; Not sure why but I could not upgrade to Windows 10 until Win7 was fully updated.&nbsp; it took all night for this to complete.&nbsp; Hopefully with 8.1 you will not have as many updates.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 4 - Upgrade to Windows 10 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that this is a PITA but unfortunately the free version of Win 10 does not have a key.&nbsp; Because of this, tech support, at this time,&nbsp;does not have a tool to release your old profile information to allow the new.&nbsp; But they can release the old key
 under 8.1.&nbsp; I know, its "stupid" but its also free so we cannot complain too much.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a similar problem where on the day up upgraded my computer to 10 my mobo failed.&nbsp; I to had to swap out the mobo and my win 10 would not activate.&nbsp; In the past 2 days I have gone through the process of reinstalling win 7, contacting tech support, updating
 then upgrading to Win&nbsp;3 which only completed about 2 hours ago.&nbsp; My Win10 is now fully activated and working fine. The main difference between your situation and mine is I had an OEM version of windows.&nbsp; That's a good thing for you because retail should have
 an easier time getting the key released.</p>

            After being on hold with Microsoft for around an hour I was told by the representative to reinstall 8.1 and do the upgrade to 10 again. My version of 8.1 was purchased thru the Microsoft store with a student discount. From my understanding it's a full
 retail version not OEM. PITA is right! Especially since I had gone over my data limit for my satellite Internet so my speeds were throttled. (Live in the boonies so that's my best choice for internet.) Even after doing the upgrade again I still had to call
 the windows activation number as it was still showing that my windows 10 was not activated. So after a couple hours of reinstalling and getting updates, calling the automated number to activate windows and a little bit of prayer I was good to go! Definitely
 not the best experience. All this because my MOBO came in late from amazon and I was eager to try windows 10 out.

            This is very time consuming and I have lost all data and programs as a result, I got the free upgrade again after reinstalling Windows 7. My BIG concern is what happen after the free upgrade is no longer available and I need to change my moterboard again?

            The short answer is that, unless there is a change in Microsoft's free Upgrade offer, then you would have to buy a Windows 10 Licence. New Motherboard = New Device = New Windows 10 License required, unless you have a full Windows 10 retail License, which
 you can transfer.

            Heres a thought, buy as many motherboards as possable stick on 7, upgrade to 10 and resell motherboards Windows 10 activated , someone could make a nice&nbsp;bit of money&nbsp;selling Windows 10&nbsp;preactived boards on Ebay to people that need to replace the motherboards.

            <p>no they couldn't because Microsoft is giving the biggest screw you to people who want to build their own computers of all time. It's not just the motherboard. If the cpu is changed it's the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So check this, If I get a new motherboard, which I did, I have to do all this horrible ****. But when I get a new cpu, I will have to do it again! and so will everyboday else. if you change EITHER, you lose activation. They fight piracy by screwing over
 anyone with legitimate licenses that likes to build their own computers.</p>

            I'm guessing that running "winver" on that system would show you're running Windows 10 RTM (10240).&nbsp; My loose understanding is that they're slowly rolling out the 10586 update to the world: checking in Windows Update might find it, but I'm generally unclear
 on the exact rollout plans.

<h2>            Wifi Adapter keeps shutting off</h2>
                    Using my phone to do this, I have been dealing with my wifi adapter doing this, it will last 10 mimutes at most before it shuts off and will not turn back on, troubleshooter keeps saying Windows 10 cant bind the IP protocal stack to the network adapter.
 It is a belkin Wifi Adapter, works fine, the only way I can get it to work again is if I restart my computer, which sometimes does a bluescreen when doing so, My pc is put out by Cybertron (dont ask why it uses a transformers name) up until october of 2018
 I had no problems with it, Windows did forced updates (the kind that you need to do just to shutdown your computer) alot, each update scrrwed up something with my settings including at one point making my usb ports shutoff after 5 minutes of runtime (thats
 fixed now). All I know of what may of caused it was a update, since track record shows it has been the case alot, I am beyond frustrated at this point, I need answers on how to fix this and I want to know why these updates do this st

            Hi Elden.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything else possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works: 
<br />
<br />Enable IPv6 in the network adapter settings: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enable-disable-ipv6-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the fixit from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852</a> (Re-enable IPv6 on all nontunnel interfaces) and reboot.
<br />
<br />Which network icon is showing in System Tray:  the Wireless waves or Ethernet TV with plug?  Left click to see if any Networks show up to sign into.  
<br />
<br />If not right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-to-default-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WIfi &gt; Manage Known Networks, highlight and remove the network having problems, restart PC to see if it shows up again.  
<br />
<br />Try plugging in by ethernet cable to the router to compare, then plug the ethernet cable into the modem (if separate) to see if this might be an issue with the router.    
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected and optimized.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br /> 
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 Update, if it's too late to roll it back  I can help you shrink C by about 50gb in Disk mgmt to do a test Install to the shrink space, which will configure a Dual Boot you can sign into to set up to see if the problem goes away.  If so I'll then help you move into the new install and eventually delete the old one and recover its space.  Steps here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            Heres what I have gathered, motom works fine, when the computer stops acknowledging it a wire with a tv symbol appears where the wifi signal should be, if I plug the adapter into another computer it works fine, I dont know where the information needed
 to look up drivers by model number as there are 2 strings of numbers, and a 3rd shorter one, cant do a system restore as the window that does it freezes up, ethernet is not a option as the modem is in the other room, I cannot find the area where I view update
 info, it just does not show after updates and security, as for the second poster, I have not done network reset, left it to try last alongside system restore, which I have done, all I know is my USB adapter is put out by belkin and the instructions on how
 to find model/product number does not match up with it.

            Did you complete all steps?
<br />
<br />Have you gone to the Belkin Downloads site to search for drivers for that adapter?  
<br />
<br />Here's how to trace a driver to search for it by it's precise model:  
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />  But if you have that you can report it back and search now.

            I figured it out, for me it was none of these that worked, it was something you never once mentioned, I remembered there was that AMD thing that I had on my computer since I got it, in itself was the answer, I turned off a setting and no more problems
 with internet since, the Wifi Radio setting is what I messed with that gave me my solution, I appreciate the help, now I can go back to teaching people who are new to games, forums, etc.

<h2>            Frequent Wifi &#34;limited&#34; connectivity after 8.1 Update</h2>
                    <p>I have read loads of posts on this site and others and still do not have a remedy. Every 5-15 min, my wifi connection goes to "limited" on my 8.1 laptop.&nbsp; I disconnect, reconnect and voila.&nbsp; For a few minutes.&nbsp; It's affecting my backups as well as my regular
 use and is very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no connectivity issues with my wifi and the printer, the Mac, the iphones, or any other devices.&nbsp; I have verified that my router is working properly and this issue did not begin until I did an update to 8.1.&nbsp; It occurs no matter what internet provider
 I'm using. I've been at hotels, friends' homes, my parents'...all across the US in the last two weeks and it's the same problem.&nbsp; It is NOT the internet provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two solutions I see most often were already checked:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; My network drivers are updated.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Power saving is turned off/unchecked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I've missed it in all of my google searches, but is there a real fix for this?&nbsp; Other than hard coding a path for the internet?&nbsp; That really defeats the whole purpose of wifi to me.&nbsp;

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are facing difficulty in connecting your computer to the network. I really appreciate your effort to resolve the issue. Both the methods which you have tried could really
 help to resolve the issue. Since the issue still persists, I suggest you to try the following steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This error means the PC has successfully connected to the router, but the PC wasn't assigned a valid IP address, so you can't actually get to the Internet. It can also indicate
 that a valid IP address was assigned but that the PC doesn't have Internet connectivity.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">However Internet connection problems are most commonly caused by disconnected cables or by routers and modems that aren't working correctly.

            <p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Method One while things were working well and of course, no issues found.&nbsp; I waited until the connection failed again and ran the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got two messages in the end but some "modifications" were made during that process as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; "The connection between your access port, router, or cable modem and the internet is broken."&nbsp; This came with a yellow warning sign saying "detected" but no action was available.</p>
<p>2) "The default gateway is not available" This came with a green check mark saying "Fixed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did this same thing before, right after I updated and started having the issue a few weeks ago and thought I had things fixed (forgot to mention in first post).&nbsp; Things worked for a bit but then failed again.&nbsp; As of right now, I'm over an hour in with
 no connectivity issues.&nbsp; So that's good. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to reboot shortly and leave for a bit and see what happens.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks for your time.&nbsp; I didn't think to try the troubleshooter again because it had been done.&nbsp; What fundamentally bothers me is that I want to know WHAT the real problem is.&nbsp; Something seems to be a mismatch within the OS.&nbsp; I would like to understand
 what the underlying issue is.&nbsp; I've worked in technology for many years and am hating 8 and 8.1 because it's like MS is trying to be a Mac OS in not letting us "see" the nitty gritty but it also doesn't work as well.&nbsp; It is very frustrating.</p>

            <p>Sad to report that while the modification yesterday seemed to keep the connectivity going for quite awhile, the "limited" thing is back today.&nbsp; Twice now in the last hour.</p>
<p>
I prefer to test one variable at a time so I'm going to let this go for the rest of the day before trying the second method.&nbsp; I just ran diags on my router to double check for issues there but nothing that looks out of place.</p>

<p>Thanks.&nbsp; As I mentioned in my original post, the power management is unchecked for the network adapter, the drivers are current, the network diags have been run, but the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">The steps you need to follow are as simple as they could be: just open Device Manager, select your main network adapter, click on “Properties,” go to “Power Management” and uncheck the option reading
 “Allow this computer to turn off the device to save power.”</span><br />

<p>Thanks.&nbsp; I didn't see your response when I last posted.&nbsp; I'm having an issue trying to do anything in dos.&nbsp; It says I have to be an admin and I verified that my login/user IS an admin.&nbsp; But no dice.&nbsp; This machine was purchased/set up through a vendor, there
 is no other user on the machine and when I check user settings, my login is most definitely an Admin.&nbsp; So how do I work around this?&nbsp; I tried going at cmd from windows/x and also from just cmd in the search.&nbsp; Either way, same problem.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 apps corrupted</h2>
                    <p>After using the information in&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_store/troubleshooting-windows-10-pc-metro-apps-not/29fb735f-1511-442a-a1c7-eb081e7524d9?page=1">this page</a>&nbsp;to
 try and fix my windows store, the problem became worse as all the apps became corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90b37519-94b5-42a8-9eec-25b06096abc5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/90b37519-94b5-42a8-9eec-25b06096abc5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any solutions to fixing this? Trying to do a repair install does not work as it forces me to delete everything due to "unsupported directory" or something.</p>
<p>

            <p>I have tried everything but none have fixed my initial windows store problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The part titled "<strong><span>Attempt Reinstall apps for the user via powershell"</span></strong><span> has made the problem worse and resulted in all the apps disappearing and stuff showing up in the start menu like in the picture I've uploaded.</span></p>
<p>Apparently, the commands not only did not fix the apps but deleted them in a recent build, resulting in problems similar to mine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The troubleshooter did not detect any issues and restarting the computer multiple times did not resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Created a new account and the default apps were not even there. There wasn't even a trace of the apps unlike the picture I've shown.</p>

                    I have a few issues with my MSI GL63 8RC laptop and I'm wanting to factory reset it to try and fix these problems, but it won't let me. It shows it open but then closes it after a few seconds.

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode with network network function to repair Windows..
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            Hi LoG.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Use whichever methods works  here to access Repair Mode to do the Reset:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary you can  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC by installing the Media Creation Tool and following the steps given on it's download page here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If using another PC to create the media uncheck the box for Recommended Settings and choose carefully your licensed version and bit rate (normally 64 bit).  
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then  Troubleshoot Options to Reset. 
<br />
<br />If those all fail then use the same media to Clean Install  following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi LoG
<br />
<br />Backup your Files
<br />
<br />MSI systems have a great Factory Restore System. On your Start Menu go to MSI - Dragon Center - Tools and Help - Burn Recovery
<br />
<br />Insert a USB Flash Drive and create the MSI Recovery on that
<br />
<br />This is the best method to use on an MSI, there is a lot of propriety software and drivers on an MSI and that method will re-install that as well as installing a clean Windows 10

                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of my Windows 10 installs does not reboot.</p>
<p>The system is running perfectly fine, but if I try to reboot, the system shuts down and does not start up.</p>
<p>I get stuck on a blank black screen with a command line style cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to manuelly shut down the computer by holding the power button.</p>
<p>The system still boots up normally when powered on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already did a complete reset to factory defaults, and after this, I was able to reboot.</p>
<p>But now, a few days later, a reboot is impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that somebody can help me with this issue.</p>
