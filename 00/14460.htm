<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please provide more information before we proceed.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Does this issue occurs in other Office applications?</span></li><li><span>Where are you saving the Word document that you are trying to open form Word?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>This issue may usually occurs when the file was altered by a third-party software during the transmission process, and hence the file cannot be opened. I suggest you to refer to the following methods and check if it helps in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Please refer to the below mentioned steps.</span></p>

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click "<span>Unblock</span>", when done, click "<span>OK</span>". (<span>Note</span>: a properly-working Word file does not have an "<span>Unblock</span>" button displayed).</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>If issue persist, you may </span>click and add trusted location to
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>File</strong>&gt; <strong>Options</strong>&gt; <strong>Trust</strong>
<strong>Center</strong>&gt; <strong>Trust</strong> <strong>center</strong> <strong>settings</strong>...&gt;

    <title>Inserting media files into PowerPoint 2010 &#8211; gets stuck - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Inserting media files into PowerPoint 2010 &#8211; gets stuck</h2>
                    <p>I am using PowerPoint 2010 on Windows 7.</p>

<p>Trying to insert media files (audio / video) of different formats makes PowerPoint stuck: The “PowerPoint is inserting media.” indication on the status bar starts, but it
 is stuck at the beginning. The application totally stops responding (even though task manager shows ‘running’), and I have to kill it via the task manager.</p>

<p>Please advise how to resolve.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Try to play the video file using Windows Media Player. If it plays fine, try to insert Media Player in PowerPoint and check if you’re able to play the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable control. Because the default state in PowerPoint 2010, control function is hidden, we need to enable it firstly as follows:<br />
1. Click File&gt;Options&gt;Customize ribbon&gt;Under customize ribbon on the right side, check the Developer tab and click “ OK”.<br />
2. Return to the PowerPoint edition interface, there will be a new Tab-"Developer".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insert videos.<br />
1. Click" Developer" tab <br />
2. Under control section, hover the mouse cursor over “more controls” and click.<br />
3. In the dialogue box, scroll down and select" Windows Media Player", click" OK" to close the dialogue box. Then the mouse will become"+".<br />
4. Drag the mouse, the player interface of Windows Media Player will appear in the PPT. You can increase or decrease the size.<br />
5. Select the player interface, right click, select" properties", a dialogue box will pop up.<br />
6. Double-click on Custom tab and click on browse to browse to the location where you have saved the file and Click OK.<br />
7. Close" properties", and you have inserted the videos successfully.</p>

<h2>            How to use additional search criteria selected by &#34;&#43; More&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I had a problem with additional search criteria fields that could not be deleted or removed again (marked yellow).</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a06cb7fc-1b24-4037-b0e9-31615d015f91" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the commandline option /resetsearchcriteria fixed (removed the fields) it,
<strong>however.....</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use Outlook 2013 search just in the search box, search works fine. Though, I have to remember the search syntax for more complex searches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can add more criteria with the "+ More" button and get a view as in the screenshot above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, those additional search fields are non-functional. I cannot search anything with those since I cannot type in there. I can also not remove them with the "x" at the side. I have to revert back to&nbsp;/resetsearchcriteria...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this behaviour normal? I would say no. The "+ More" functionality is not working here. How can I fix this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really like to use the "+ More" search functions...</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Dan</p>

<p>Hello Robert,</p>
<p>Thanks for the hints.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Search Service is running. I am able to find anything in the filesystem and within Outlook (unfortunately not anymore in a combined fashion from the Win-F search anymore, since MS has decided to remove that feature.. anyway)..</li><li>I can use search terms (in outlook) like <br />
from:daniel to:peter<br />
and have results immediately. </li><li>Outlook is not running as administrator and I have tried with different UAC settings.
</li><li>I have deleted and recreated the index before and it did not change the behaviour either.
</li><li>I stopped Lync2013 which runs along Outlook, restarted Outlook to check if there is a change. Nope.</li><li>Just out of curiosity, I ran Outlook as administrator, but there was no difference either. &nbsp;</li><li>The Eventlog does not show anything interesting (as far as I can see)</li><li>Started Outlook /safe, still the same issue</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I *can* add more search criteria, but I cannot use the added fields (they are greyed out) and I cannot remove them (except when starting Outlook /resetsearchcriteria.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What else could I try?</p>

<h2>            x3-02&#58; Copying contacts with no display</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I dropped my phone a few days back, which caused the display to go black. I think the phone is functional besides that, as I can hear the welcoming Nokia tune when pressing my pin code, and feel it respond to me touching around the menus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I have a pretty large phone book, I'd like to get my contacts out of there. Doesn't seem like I can acces them through the PC using the USB cable, so it looks as if I have to copy them through Menu-Contacts-Copy Contacts. My problem is, that without the
 display, I don't know where the copy contacts option is when in the contancts menu. Could comebody post some pics of the menu, or try and describe which button to press, like 5th from the top, 2nd from the bottom, then I think I might be able to manage it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advanace.</p>

                    <p>Hi there everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is is my first time posting on a community board. So please excuse me if I'm asking a stupid question, or if it's already here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have just recently received an email titled "Microsoft account unusual activity"</p>
<p>

</p><p>
</p><p>This is what the email has said. There is then a link to view recent activity. ^</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have not clicked on the link as in am not sure if this is actually Microsoft emailing me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is then this is not good because I don't live in the United States and I've supposedly logged on there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I I have just changed my password to this email and I have a phone code set up when changing passwords.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>You’ll probably recognise most of the account activities listed on your <strong>
Recent activity</strong> page.</p>
<p>Even if an activity sounds suspicious at first, you can expand it to see more details and decide whether you remember it.
</p>
<p>For example, if you accidentally made a typo in your password, you’ll see <strong>
Incorrect password entered</strong> in the list.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Or, if you signed in to your account from a mobile phone, you might find that your service provider routed the signal through a cell tower in another city.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>But if an activity looks unfamiliar, or if you see an unusual pattern (like multiple sign-in attempts or changes that you’re sure you didn’t make), let us know.
</p>
<p>We’ll help you make your account more secure to minimise any threats. </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>If you click “This was me”:</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you tell us you were responsible for an activity, we’ll keep track of that info going forward.
</p>
<p>For example, if you sign in from a new location that happens to be the hotel you’re staying at on a business trip, we’ll add that location to the list of places we expect you might sign in from in the future.
</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>If you click “This wasn't me”:</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you tell us that you don’t recognise an activity, it’s possible that a hacker or a malicious user has gotten access to your account. To help protect your account, we’ll walk you through several steps, including changing your password and reviewing and
 updating your security info. </p>

            <p>Part of your present issues that you have described are probably caused by the presence of AVG and McAfee concurrently on the computer...and I don't usually criticize an AV product but McAfee has a history of bogging down computers - I've removed it on occasions
 and it was like a totally new computer once McAfee was gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would uninstall McAfee, run the McAfee Removal Tool and reboot the computer.
</p>
<p><strong>McAfee</strong> Removal Tool: <a href="http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS101331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS101331</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to use AVG that's&nbsp;your decision&nbsp;- you might uninstall/reinstall AVG after removing McAfee.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your financial concerns totally.&nbsp; I don't recommend upgrading an old XP computer to Win 8 - they just don't work out too well since most don't have a fast processor or enough RAM to properly run Win 8.&nbsp; You may find the following to be helpful:</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You may want to get you a Windows 8.1 or there are still Win 7 computers available if you would rather have the W7 operating system.&nbsp; I'm not a fan of the "Big Box" stores but Best Buy and Office Depot have a good selection at their stores and&nbsp;online - don't
 let them sell you security suites, tech support&nbsp;and other items that aren't needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck...</p>

<h2>            Project Web App Online Slowness with mutliple projects</h2>
                    We have multiple users licensed for <span><span>"Project Online Premium without Project Client for faculty" and there have been issues in the past few months as the project list grew it would take 15 to 30 seconds to load different projects for viewing\editing.
 This slowness was most noticeable when the list had over 50 projects. Recently our project manager cleaned out all the old projects and only a few projects remain but response time for accessing projects has returned to normal with only taking 5 to 8 seconds
 to load. Is there a limit for the amount of projects in the system that would cause slow performance?</span></span>

            <p>Hi Travis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Project Online is a cloud-based service which as a part of Microsoft Office 365. Two main factors which are contribute to the performance are the Network environment and the resources we requested from the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the situation you mentioned above, here are some articles for your reference. For example, we recommend that when you configure views, offer users simple specialized views for faster navigation rather than a complex all-in-one view that would load
 unnecessary data most of the time.</p>

</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>If the issue persists, <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

    <title>Is MS Office Becoming Too Overpriced For Home Use&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is MS Office Becoming Too Overpriced For Home Use&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have used MS Office for a very long time, always amazed by its versatility and power!&nbsp; However, I am concerned about how the effects of a staggering economy may for current and future Office users to either hold on to older versions for as long as possible,
 or make a transition to a competitive platform such as Open Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People are concerned about the $130 or more price for Office Upgrades when the competition, although in some respects not as good as Office, gets the job done for lower-income families.&nbsp; Basically, if you can combine for instance Open Office and Google Docs,
 and I know a lot of people that do that who have limited budgets, their needs are met.&nbsp;In my view, Office 2010 and the new Office 2013 show their versatility, but there is a price to pay.&nbsp; The new Office 365 is a very interesting and revolutionary concept
 for many business platforms.&nbsp; especially being able to always have the latest version and updates each year!&nbsp; However, will customers be willing to pay&nbsp;and able to afford the licenses?&nbsp; And there is also the issues of backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we look at the introduction of Office 2013 and the download only model, with only ONE license per computer, how much will the loss of the conventional CD/DVD Rom Office products hurt the customer.&nbsp; I think that from a business model, if the customer is
 well embedded within a company that uses the Office Products, there are great deals available.&nbsp; However, for the low-income user who just wants to write the occasional paper for school or the personal letter to Grandma, are the updates for Office cost-effective?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the model is not cost effective I would like to see MS develop a solution like they did for Microsoft Security Essentials.&nbsp; OK MSE is free.&nbsp; I don't&nbsp;know if MS would go with that model for older versions of Office.&nbsp; Remember when MS Works was a part of
 some package deals and I am not sure, but I think you could get something like Word 2002 and MS Works, and a couple of other products at a reduced price?&nbsp; Would or will there be an Office Starter 2013 for free on OEM systems for Windows 7 and Windows 8?&nbsp; There
 should be, because I think that MS should work a little more at ways to make MS Office more affordable for home users.&nbsp; The free alternatives continue to be free, to grow and expand.&nbsp; How will MS address this challenge for MS Office now, and in the future?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Microsoft is a business, not a charity. If its business model does not work, it will adapt. My guess is that its business model has been well thought out.<br />
<br />
As for the type of user you describe, then there is absolutely no need to keep following all the changes. There are many users happily working with Word 2003 and earlier versions, which are just as capable of producing the odd paper or letter as they ever were.
 And there are various open source products that people can use if they wish.<br />
<br />
As for backward compatibility. Word document formats are all compatible with current versions.<br />

            <p>Ummm, actually Office 365 for Home Use is downloadable to 5 PC's, see...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/136343/whats-the-difference-between-office-365-and-office-2013/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=090213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/136343/whats-the-difference-between-office-365-and-office-2013/?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=090213</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, in essence, it has been made more afforable for the average Home User.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Office 2013 has&nbsp; desktop model which is for 1 PC but it is not a download only model, it is a desktop version.&nbsp; And if all that doesn't seem like a lot you can also access, albeit a stripped version, Office via the new Outlook.com (your old Windows Live
 account) for free.</p>

    <title>Why is Outlook Junk Mail STUPID &#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimdirt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Outlook Junk Mail STUPID &#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I constantly have to retrieve WANTED emails from Junk&nbsp;&nbsp; , I constantly have to create Rule upon Rule for the same email over and over , and STILL&nbsp; , emails I WANT&nbsp;, keep going to the Junk Box&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Add Rule&nbsp; , any Subject , From , Containing these words&nbsp; , and EVERY option for allowing it into my Inbox in Windows Live Mail App&nbsp; , and I constantly , have to go online to Outlook.Com&nbsp; to FIX what I already thought I fixed , the last time I did it .........
 Its bad enough Windows 10 no longer supports Windows Live Mail (version 2009 before Microsoft dumbed it down and ruined it) , but to force us to use a useless Mail App (I am on a PC not a phone&nbsp; , so I don't want , nor need a App , I want a functional&nbsp;EMAIL
 PROGRAM) that give us no ability to filter email&nbsp; , but then on top of it we are forced to go to Outlook.com to fix what should not be broken ...... because we "thought" we had already fix it and told it to send it to the&nbsp;Inbox ......</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Here is a idea I bet no one at Microsoft even thought of ......... How about sending ALL mail to my Inbox&nbsp; , and letting me say , This is Junk&nbsp; , and if I do not LIST IT AS JUNK , then DO NOT PUT IT IN THE JUNK FOLDER !!!!&nbsp;, EVER !!!!!!!!!! &nbsp; , just keep
 sending ANY email that contains the same address or Title (Bi-Mart Newsletter&nbsp; , sounds pretty straight forward as a Rule to ALLOW this NAME , right ?? &nbsp;, but for some reason after choosing every rule to ALLOW it as Inbox safe over and over&nbsp; , it still goes
 in my Junk Folder&nbsp; , but 10 of them go to my Inbox , and 2 Junk&nbsp; &nbsp;..........&nbsp; same goes for Guitar Center , Autoanything , Home Depot , Lenscrafters , and any other email I already listed as SAFE !!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;a bazillion times&nbsp; , is that too hard for Microsoft to
 figure out ????&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Bottom Line is&nbsp; , If you are going to FORCE us to use this junk&nbsp; , at least TRY to make it smarter than a rock&nbsp;&nbsp; , Helen Keller could have filtered my email better than Outlook does ...... How about this ??&nbsp;&nbsp; .... Bring back Windows Live Mail or Outlook
 Express&nbsp; , as they actually were functional&nbsp;(at least version 2009 was)&nbsp;, which is most likely why Microsoft got rid of them&nbsp;&nbsp; , kind of like XP&nbsp; , the only OS that did not use huge resources and rarely if ever crashed or better yet Win 98SE off the disk ,
 with NO updates ever , worked flawlessly and NEVER got a virus &nbsp; , where Windows 10 Blue Screens monthly for realistically&nbsp; , no reason whatsoever&nbsp; , it is the most unstable OS sine Win 8&nbsp; , but the only way Microsoft will support&nbsp;10 , is if you install the
 Un-Creators Update that makes my PC , pretty much useless&nbsp; , since I want a Control Panel and I want to control my Screen Saver , and I want to CHOOSE NOT to install updates I DO NOT WANT ... or CHOOSE WHEN to Download a useless patch instead of it using up
 all my limited bandwidth downloading a junk supposed "upgrade" which is actually a downgrade&nbsp; , then forcing me to reformat my PC , to get rid of it ............&nbsp; I actually had to do a Remote Host with Microsoft Support to finally force stop ALL Windows Updates
 aside from Windows Defender&nbsp; , now I no longer have to worry about the Creators Update screwing everything I actually liked about Win 10 up by forcing itself on MY PC&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is more of a complaint to Microsoft&nbsp; , because I am sick of having to weekly create the same rule over and over for the same emails over and over , so they actually go where they should have gone in the first place ...... and I can't figure out how
 to make it stop sending stuff I already listed by Address , Name , Subject , Containing&nbsp;xxx words&nbsp; , etc.&nbsp; to the Junk folder when it is clearly listed numerous times as SAFE and WANTED in my INBOX</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the rant to those not employed by Microsoft&nbsp; , for those who are .......... TELL THEM to FIX this junk so its useful to users&nbsp; , not a pain to use !!

<p>Sorry, didn't read your rant after the first paragraph.</p>
<p>Pretty simple, delete all your Rules, Blocks, and Safe Senders.</p>
<p>Then for a few weeks or even a couple months train your mailbox don't create any new ones. I have none of those defined on my mailbox and it is rare I have to correct an emails location from where Microsoft put it (Inbox vs. Junk).
</p>
<p>Move things that go into the Inbox into the Junk folder that are spam. Move the good stuff out of Junk into your Inbox. It takes training for the backend system to know what is good and what is bad to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, if Microsoft determines something is spam in their initial analysis on an in-bound email, it will go to the Junk folder no matter what Rules/Blocks you setup.</p>

<p>
</p><p>No need to read my rant , as it is just that ... A Rant&nbsp; , not directed at anyone ..... well maybe Bill Gates .....but anyway....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue&nbsp; &nbsp;, or what I think is the cause&nbsp; , or at least a leading factor , which is what annoys me , since Rules or not , it should not redirect a email unless it contains a virus or something of that sort&nbsp; , otherwise&nbsp; , it should be my choice not Microsoft's
 (or Outlook's) ..... But the pattern I notice is sometimes&nbsp; , I just Delete some emails , if I don't feel like reading them even if they are from a sender I approve of&nbsp; , but the point is that sometimes&nbsp; , say for example BTO Sports&nbsp; , or Rocky Mountain ATV/MC
 , where I frequently buy parts , etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;,&nbsp; is that the "sale" or whatever , is not something I am interested in at that time&nbsp; , so I just Delete it without reading&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But more to what I feel is possibly causing this (I could be completely wrong) is that when you have to "Read" a email in Windows 10 Mail App , it takes a bit&nbsp; , then the (blue) bar on the left side of the email header (that indicates you have read it or
 not) goes away&nbsp; &nbsp;, but if I delete it before the bar has had the chance to disappear&nbsp; (in other words&nbsp; , I have to click on the email , so it is "open" then after a few seconds the bar goes away) , then those seem to be the ones that randomly end up in the
 Junk folder when I do NOT actually "open" the email , even though they have been received in my Inbox for a long time and/or I have made a Rule OR marked them as Not Junk (any email from that sender , etc), which otherwise , I would maybe get 1 actual "Junk"
 email per month&nbsp; , but the majority of the emails I get in it (99%) are emails I actually want in my Inbox&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am understanding what you are explaining&nbsp; , but I do not think this is a "learned trait"&nbsp; , because if it did "learn" then it would not be sending them to Junk since I have been constantly telling it I want them in my Inbox&nbsp; &nbsp;, I think it is a issue
 with Windows 10 Mail app , or Outlook itself&nbsp; , that decides for you , that if you do not physically read a email&nbsp; , it must be Junk because you deleted it&nbsp; &nbsp;........... Follow ???&nbsp; ...... That is what I "think" is going on&nbsp; &nbsp;.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though as I mentioned&nbsp; , I could be totally wrong , since I for the life of me , can't figure out why Microsoft does the stupid things it does to its customers&nbsp; , by taking away everything they want&nbsp; , and give them a ton of literal **** they do not want
 , and literally TOLD them they do not want over and over ........&nbsp; &nbsp;, if they would just leave things alone , or actually LISTEN to the Customers&nbsp; , not some idiot research group&nbsp; , or a 16 year old that wants his PC to work like his X-Box or Smart Phone&nbsp;
 &nbsp;...... Older people like myself , do not like changes , especially when they screw everything up that was fine before the update or patch&nbsp; &nbsp; , but all the patches and updates , do nothing , except cause system errors , compatibility issues that were not present
 prior&nbsp; , or random crashes without updating or changing anything in the system that was working fine , then suddenly , BANG&nbsp; , your computer has encountered a error and needs to shut down</p>
<p>
</p><p>You know why Windows is subject to so many Viruses and Malware ????&nbsp; , I can tell you why&nbsp; &nbsp;, because they keep patching the system and it opens up another area for a attacker to get in ..... As I mentioned before&nbsp; , Win 98SE if installed from the disk ,
 without doing ANY Windows Updates (driver updates are fine&nbsp; , just not Windows Updates) NEVER got a virus or Malware attack&nbsp; , but when I did the Updates&nbsp; , I was constantly needing some kind of Virus removal tool ...... So that Proves , that the updates are
 the direct cause of attacks&nbsp; , because a Patch is given , and then almost instantly there is another patch to fix the vulnerabilities the last patch just did because a attacker already compromised the system&nbsp; &nbsp;, it actually says so in the notes of the patch
 .....&nbsp; &nbsp;, The attackers do not bother with the original versions because they know everyone will be forced to update , and that is their way in .....</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I think the issue is&nbsp; , which is Microsoft messes with the files so much that they change one thing , and it screws up everything else&nbsp; , and its a never ending battle of fix what they just fixed that caused a issue because they did not test
 to see what the "fix" would do to other areas of the system&nbsp; , again&nbsp; , I wish I could use Windows Live Mail (2009 version only) with Windows 10&nbsp; , back before they changed the protocall&nbsp; &nbsp;, as since they changed that&nbsp; , it is clunky and hardly functions .....
 kind of like Windows 10 Mail App............&nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry .....ranting again ...&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway&nbsp; , thanks for the reply&nbsp; , but I am not sure if its actually going to fix the issue&nbsp; , as the pattern I was noticing , that I thought about after I posted&nbsp; , was that it only seems to happen to emails , that I have just Deleted without reading&nbsp; ,
 (Autoanything , Home Depot&nbsp; , Harbor Freight Tools , etc.) , as none of my other emails&nbsp; , or any from people are ever in the Junk folder , whether they are in my Contacts list or not&nbsp;</p>

 remember this&nbsp; ?????&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;, I put a Rule on a email from a sender I WANT , saying if their name , or this word is used in the subject or header to send to Inbox ...... and the same day , I will find a email from that same sender in the Junk folder .........

<p>I know the interface of outlook is nice and it has some good stuff, but this problem so far has been unsolvable. I am contacting uncountable people on support everywhere to let me emails go through my customers (which the email contains the good in it...)
 but the replies have been always generic and always assuming the problem is from my part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently it has to do with something called "smartscreen" which will take better decision than yourself. (they make sure to write smart screen with a register mark like it was something people might want to steal... that's funny)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it has been so frustrating I am following now those steps:<br />
<br />
- Prevent all email hotmail/outlook email addresses to purchase any goods. I force my customers to use any other email address.<br />
- Mark all emails from microsoft as junk, so they have to spend and loose time arguing that their emails are legitimate. That's the least they deserve (also think that the people that are provoking those problems are engineers with an extremely high salary)</p>
<p>- Of course never use outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that if everybody followed those steps this problem would not happen anymore. Help me spread this solution!</p>

            Microsoft's corporate e-mail filtering works. It is purposeful that Microsoft allows regular Outlook, even paid Outlook users to have spam issues. You are also denied the most basic tools to combat the spam yourself. Simple functionality like being able
 to block entire domain suffixes like .icu should be a given. It seems there is only one solution, Gee Mail.

    <title>Unable to Connect Outlook 2016 to Outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to Connect Outlook 2016 to Outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>I've had Outlook 2016 set up with Outlook.com for about a year and it's been working fine until now.&nbsp; Suddenly a prompt kept popping up asking for my credentials.&nbsp; It would repeatedly pop up even after entering the correct password.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the same time, I received an email on my other device saying "We detected something unusual about a recent sign-in to the Microsoft account @outlook.com. To help keep you safe, we required an extra security challenge"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I closed outlook and deleted my profile from the control panel.&nbsp; I then made sure Outlook 2016 was up to date by using the update now option under Office Account.&nbsp; After that, I opened Outlook 2016 and proceeded to set up the account again.&nbsp; However,
 when going through the Automatic Set up, I can't get past the box that pops up asking for credentials even though I'm typing the password correctly.&nbsp; I do not have 2-step verification enabled. Judging by the interface, it looks like Outlook.com has been upgraded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this online which may be the problem, if so when will it be fixed?</p>

    <title>Can I selectively pre&#47;append static text to numbered headings&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eclarkso  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I selectively pre&#47;append static text to numbered headings&#63;</h2>
                    Let me clarify the title: I have a standard set of heading styles numbered using a multi-level list style, and what I would like to be able to do is SELECTIVELY mark some section headings as containing sensitive internal use only information--but have
 all the headings numbered as part of the same list: <br />
<br />
1 A Heading Title<br />
...<br />
1.1 A Subsection<br />
...<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">(IUO) 1.2 Another Subsection</span><br />
...<br />
2 A Second Section<br />
...<br />
<br />
My first thought was to create a bunch of companion styles to the built-in header styles called "Header<span style="font-style: italic">
</span>1 (IUO)", "Header<span style="font-style: italic"> </span>2 (IUO)"&nbsp; and use a multi-level list style that prepends the (IUO) text to the list.&nbsp; However, I do not see how distinct multi-level lists can share numbering (continue numbering only works on
 lists of the same style).<br />
<br />
Is there any way to do what I want with styles?&nbsp; I have read Shauna Kelly's material on multi-level lists and headings FWIW, but I'm not having any trouble with TOC or numbering or any of that.&nbsp; I am of course working with substantial (100 page) documents that
 have a lot of headings, so manual insertion is a significant initial and ongoing maintenance headache.<br />
<br />
I looked for a way other than a custom list item to prepend or append static text to a paragraph, but came up empty.<br />
<br />
My fallback is to use IUO headings styles that are linked to the corresponding regular headings (which numbers correctly), and try a macro that inserts the IUO text (no idea how feasible that is either).&nbsp; Any other ideas?<br />

            <p>Hi GS,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please be informed that your inbox capacity will automatically increase as you need more space. If your inbox grows too fast, you might not be able to send or receive any more messages. You can visit this
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/email-storage-limits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> to know more about the storage limits in Outlook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, if you wish to increase your storage space and your sending limit as well, I suggest that you upgrade your account to Hotmail Plus. Click
<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/hotmail/ad-free-hotmail-and-outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> if you are interested to upgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>We need to ask for the affected email account in order for us to check its status on our end. Please provide it in the Private Message tab that I have initiated. You need to sign in to this website and click

            What leads you to believe that the failure to receive messages is connected to how much space you have in your mailbox?&nbsp; There are plenty of other reasons why mail delivery might fail.

            Best recommendation is to sit this build out and try the next available build. You shoud provide your specifications and also detail your attempts to update using the Feedback in your current build.

<p>
</p><p>I'm having the same issues with OneNote, regardless of the client used.</p>
<p>I tried onenote.com as well as OneNote for Win10, so it seems to me to be a general issue that is not restricted to onenote.com or 2016.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To better understand the situation on your end, may I know what the wrong with the error? Is it also preventing the notebooks from syncing up as<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/error-0xe40200b4-0xe401065d-0xe000145c-or-0xe4010640-when-syncing-notes-in-onenote-2016-92aff2e1-9696-42e5-a9bd-15c2ec10870a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the

<h2>            ACCOUNT VERIFICATION</h2>
                    <p>Bit of an annoyance. I <del>have</del> had access to my hotmail account but haven't used it in forever. When I logged in to it to verify my old Playstation Network account it won't let me in until I verify myself as the owner. The problem is, this is an
 old email, my second ever. I can't fill out the questionnaire because I sent no e-mails, had no contacts,I was underage when I made it so I don't know if I falsified birth date to pass the 18 check. I also can't send the e-mail to my linked e-mail address
 because it's linked to my first ever e-mail address which I can't remember the password to and isn't linked to another account. To top it all off whenever I use type in the verification codes it's telling me the characters don't match the pictures when they
 absolutely do. I'm 100% certain I'm inputting them correctly, even done case sensitive and audio, it just keeps telling me they're wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">TL;DR</span></strong></p>
<p>Is there any live support? I did chat with some operator who linked me to a microsoft help page where I open a ticket but they just took 24 hours to send me an e-mail with the reset password link.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the very least is there a way to stop the human verification images from saying that they're incorrect? I'm fairly certain I can regain access to my accounts with sufficient trial and error attempts at choosing my 16 year-old-selves answers.</p>
