<h2>            s603rd to become obsolete and replaced by 5th instead&#63;</h2>
                    do you think that it is going to happen down the road, that s603rd will be extinct and 5th will rule the world of s60in lets say 6-12 months?share you ideas please, i am curious to know where this stands. thanks for your input and sorry if this is not
 the right place to post this thread, I am sure moderators will bring in order if this is the case. thank you all for participation.

Have a look at the differences between the interfaces.<br />
There are major design and usability differences, they are made for different types of phones and user. Possibly a 4th edition will be the generational successor to 3rd?

            There's not going to be an S60 4th Edition (Nokia is avoiding the use of number 4 in phone names and S60 version numbering):<br />

<br />
Over time S60 5th Edition based phones will replace S60 3rd Edition based phones just like S60 3rd Ed. phones replaced S60 2nd Ed. phones, etc.

            i was confuse about the n95 8gb and n82 OS. Are n95 8gb and n82 S60 3rd Edition feature pack 1? cause n95 8gb and n82 are Symbian 9.2 - Series 60 user interface, 3.1 Edition right? Then in the<br />

<br />
it said feature pack 1 got Firmware upgrade Over The Air (FOTA), why n82 n n95 8gb doesnt have it?<br />
<br />
sorry if i mistaken about the n95 8gb n n82 OS.<br />

            The phones are, indeed, based on S60 3rd Ed. FP1 and Symbian 9.2.<br />
<br />
And there's even the N80 based on S60 3rd Ed (no FPs) and Symbian 9.1 which had FOTA support (but no other S60 3rd Ed./Symbian 9.1 device has).<br />
<br />
So, whether a phone based on those versions is supported by FOTA is a device-specific decision that Nokia has made for reasons only they know.

    <title>VBA and the Global Address List - Excel purging all macros - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> montyonthebonty  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA and the Global Address List - Excel purging all macros</h2>
                    <p>I've got a file in Excel with some VBA code, which I want to lookup an address in the Global Address List. I found some code to do this (<a href="https://scottlyerly.wordpress.com/2015/07/17/excel-geeking-extracting-outlook-address-book-information-to-excel-using-vba/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>)
 and I've managed to edit it slightly to work with my code. But as soon as I try to copy that code over to an existing workbook, it stops saving, then when I open the workbook again it has wiped all VBA content - forms, macros, the works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas why?</p>
<p>

<p>Yes. The file has a lot of macros which have been working fine for years, but it seems to be something to do with the code for accessing the Global Address List that is causing the issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It seems likely that the file was saved as .XLS (legacy format, which allowed macros) and you are now saving it .XLSX which does not save macros. You must save it (saveas) in .XLSM format to retain the macros.</p>

            That's probably it. I had to have my IT department change the settings on their virus scans so that my folders were not scanned - any code that modifies existing code looks like a self-replicating virus; any code that generates emails looks like a spam-bot,
 and all my files were getting deleted during the scan. It never affected my saving the file, but your network may have a pre-save scan requirement.

            <p>
</p><p>There are some setting that are intended to reduce spam (or just annoy users) like the number of draft emails that can be opened simultaneously, or the number of people who can be on the 'to' list of an email, but I'm not familiar with technology that could
 determine where the offending code is located and delete it. Especially if you aren't actually sending email yet, just pulling info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at your link- I had used a different code source last year to try to grab some data from our AD, but like your code, it pulls one record at a time- which (if you are in a large company) is VERY inefficient. I decided that it was better to just ask
 IT to create a query for me and dump the data I needed, and didn't save the code because I didn't plan to take that approach again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what happens when the code runs? You get to the "extract done" message, then the file won't save? The file crashes before you get to the "extract done" message?</p>

            <p>Good afternoon</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I found that code, the first thing I did was dump it into a blank workbook and test it. That works fine. I then created a variant where you type a name into a cell and press a button - it then looks for the address and gives you a list of matches. That
 works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I was all set to import that code to the file I was working on and that's where the trouble starts. It seems to be (no idea why) that importing that module is what causes the issue. Writing this I'm wondering if literally copying and pasting the code,
 or even typing it out from scratch might get round it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree that it's an inefficient way of doing it, but this is mostly to set up distribution lists (which is a once in a few weeks/months job) so the plan is to run the code (takes about two minutes) with a progress bar. Not ideal, but worth it to eliminate
 errors when they inadvertently type in an email address that isn't valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Given Bernie's experience (yikes!)... is there a difference in where you save the test file vs. the 'real' file (for example, test file is local, real file is on a server where a virus checker might scan it)? Do you experience the same problem when the test
 file is saved to the same location as the 'real' file? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is a virus scanner, then any method of re-typing it won't help. At that point, I'd got back to IT and ask how they want to support you- maybe they need to take responsibility for doing the DGs for you, or whitelist your file or folder, or something...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without knowing what type of scanning might be going on... I wonder if it can only scan "open" code- if it would still be triggered by password-protected VBA modules.</p>

<p>Looks like it may be worth a try to uninstall the printer <br />
and restart your system.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe the printer will be<br />
recognized and the drivers will be automatically installed<br />
correctly.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

    <title>Why do I need OneNote App and OneNote 2016 on Win 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do I need OneNote App and OneNote 2016 on Win 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Are there any advantages to having both OneNote App and OneNote 2016 on a Windows 10 machine? I can't see any other than self-imposed reduced features in 2016 like Recognise a Shape (which for some unexplainable reason has been added to the App but not 2016).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My logic thought process sees the App as a free "dip your toes in the water and try" tool that can introduce users to the power of OneNote. Seems sensible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I realise "I love it!" and decide to <strong>buy</strong> the more powerful 'super' OneNote 2016 my troubles start. Firstly, as mentioned above, it's starved of valuable ink features which seem anathema to the Microsoft Surface touch strategy. And
 the new Edge browser, with its built in clipper (necessary because Edge doen't support Add Ins like Cliper 2.0), directs clipped content to the App, which is still installed on my Windows 10 machine after I've 'upgraded' to 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For people who I tell "try OneNote, it's amazing" these little things cause so much confusion (like the confusing between onedrive and onedrive) that they end up going to Evernote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, maybe I am missing something?</p>

<h3> krobertsonoesi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Convert emails to PDF</h2>
                    <p>I recentaly upgraded my Microsoft Office 2007 to 2013.&nbsp; In Outlook 07 i was able to install Adobe Acrobat and use it to convert my email folder to a PDF file.&nbsp; When I downloaded Acrobat it placed a AdobePDF drop down menu on the main toolbar (File, Edit,
 View, Go, Tools,........ AdobePDF).&nbsp; I was able to click on that menu button and get the options to convert my email folders to a PDF.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, when it converted the emails it&nbsp;automatically created an index of the emails to quickly&nbsp;scan and find the one needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that&nbsp;I have 2013&nbsp;I cannot figure out how to do this.&nbsp; Does Adobe Acrobat still link to Outlook as it did in 07?&nbsp; If so how do I get this work?</p>

<p>Office 2007 went out of support in Oct17, there have been numerous reports of problems since then, after a win10 update.</p>
<p>Your issue is because 2007 was released before hi-def displays were in use and as such you need to reset the display to a lower state in order that the install options can be read</p>
<p>And the last thing you should do is install 2003 on a win version that doesn't support it (Unless you are a knowledgeable user and this is obviously not the case) &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 showing multiple shared mailboxes</h2>
                    <p>
Hello,</p>
<p>
This is a hard thing to explain. I have included a pic of what I am seeing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsocial.technet.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fgetfile%2f1059725" /><br />
</p>
<p>
So I am delegated into the Resource Trainingcal inbox by our server admin. When he added me, and I clicked on the folder to expand it, it said that the folders could not be displayed. So I went under the alternative method, which was going to File, Account
 Settings, Account Settings, Change, More Settings, and then Add. Once I go under the Advanced Tab, this is what I am seeing.....</p>
<p>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsocial.technet.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fgetfile%2f1059726" /></p>
<p>
So for some reason it is repeating multiple times. I have only added this mailbox once. Here is the funny part, when I close out of Outlook and reopen it, those folders on the folder pane and under the Advanced tab will change to another mailbox and will repeat
 multiple times.</p>
<p>
Does anyone know what is causing this and what can be done to fix this? Your help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to prevent client to block a freelancer in Skype when it&#39;s time for payment&#63;</h2>
                    I am a freelancer (My website is:&nbsp;https://caguioaleonora.wixsite.com/freelanceservices) and have seen some scammers issue here in the Skype community, and some clients who blocked freelancers after the job is done and is already waiting for payment. My
 question is, how will I recognize if it's a scammer? What is the immediate response/any settings from Skype that I can immediately click so as the client not to block me after the call? This will help me take actions for my future communications through Skype.
 Thank you.

            Hi Leonora
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />This is outside of the scope of what Skype can do. 
<br />
<br />I would expect in the case of freelance work, you should request a down payment or some proof name and address when communicating with a customer over Skype. There really isn't much else that could be done, since a Scammer could easily create a new account.

            Thank you Andre. I was just bothered with some posts here that they are being blocked through Skype. I understand it now. Really appreciate it.

            <p>You'll note that when you select More Colors under Shading, the Borders button becomes selected, and the black color Word is showing you is the border color. So don't try to do it this way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, select the <strong>Home</strong> tab, click the arrow beside the <strong>
Borders</strong> button, and select <strong>Borders and Shading</strong>. On the <strong>
Shading</strong> tab of the dialog, make sure that the selection for "Apply to" is "Cell" rather than "Text" or "Paragraph," and then you can go to&nbsp;click the arrow&nbsp;by the box under "Fill,"&nbsp;select "More Colors," and see the RGB numbers on the
<strong>Custom</strong> tab of the&nbsp;<strong>Colors</strong> dialog.</p>

</p><p>In the outlook app in my inbox. I am able to hit the delete key on my keyboard and the top email delete and select the next email with no issues. Once I skip an email and hit delete the mail get delete and the next email doesn't get selected. I have to manual
 click a email in the inbox to be able to delete again and I always have to select the next email to delete as long as it is not the first email.</p>

<p>Hi cphipps5000,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to replicate your issue on my end. I selected the first mail in the inbox and hit delete on the keyboard, the next mail was automatically selected. I scroll down may mails in the inbox and selected an email, delete the email and it automatically
 selected the next mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend that you install the latest update if there's an available in the App Store, if an update is not available. Uninstall Outlook, then reinstall it again. See if the issue still occur.</p>

    <title>Word to PDF conversion problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jsdrum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word to PDF conversion problem</h2>
                    <p>I convert a LOT of Word documents to PDF for my job (Document Control). The Word versions are maintained by my group and sent to other people/departments for revision.&nbsp; Once approved, we convert the Word document to pdf using the "Save as" function and have
 never had an issue with this.&nbsp; I have recently found several converted documents which have been changed in a very specific way:&nbsp; There are inserted chromatograms (charts) which are&nbsp;exported to Word&nbsp;from some lab equipment. The Word versions look fine, but
 the pdf is missing most of the lines/peaks within the chart and the time markers inside the graph are shifted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything else in these documents&nbsp;look fine.</p>
<p>I have checked other Word documents which contain inserted information from&nbsp;various sources (e.g. jpegs, Visio charts...even some that have chromatograms) and they are fine as well.</p>
<p>The problem documents were created by different people on different machines at different times.&nbsp; The versions of Office are 2007 and 2010.</p>
<p>In one of the documents, the charts print incorrectly as described, but if you "restore down" the window, the lines/peaks become visible, though the text is still offset. When you maximize the screen, it appears just like the print out (with unacceptable
 charts).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running additional checks.&nbsp; I had some minimal success with converting these documents via the print function.&nbsp; I am exploring this further, but&nbsp; wonder why this would make a difference?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts would be appreciated!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            IE does not allow to open tif &#40;tiff as well&#41; file directly.</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>Recently I've been having an issue with several PCs. The main issue is that, when user tries to open tiff file directly from the internet with IE6 it only allows to save it and then open from the PC locally. But on other PCs (same configuration) it opens
 fine. The system is windows XP SP3 and some SP2 with IE6. Does anyone know a setting that I should change? Maybe something in file associations?</p>

<p>On one machine, try the TIF/TIFF file association fix at<br />

<p>Why are you still running XP SP2 which is no longer supported? Why IE6?</p>

    <title>Will I lose older emails if I stop my Live Hotmail Plus - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tcat36  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will I lose older emails if I stop my Live Hotmail Plus subscription&#63;</h2>
                    I've tried to research this answer but it's still not clear to me. I have an old Hotmail/Hotmail Plus account that I've upgraded to Outlook.com. I'm still paying the annual subscription right now, but it's up for renewal soon.<br />
<br />
If I stop paying the "Plus" subscription and go back to a regular Outlook.com account, will I lose my older emails if my storage exceeds a certain limit? If yes, what is that limit? and is there a way to find out how much space my account currently takes up?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

Thank you for posting here.<br />
<br />
I understand that you are asking if your old email messages will be deleted if you cancel your Ad-free Outlook.com account, and you want to know the storage space for your account.<br />
<br />
Please be informed that your email messages and your contacts will be retained if you will convert your Ad-free Outlook.com account to a Free Outlook.com account, but the storage limit and the sending limit will be decreased. Once your storage limit has been
 maximized, you might not be able to send and receive an email. For more information on your storage limit, please refer
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/email-storage-limits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.<br />
<br />
If you have other questions, please post back.<br />

<h2>            I am seeing the unsent draft at the bottom of an email in my inbox.</h2>
                    This one has me freaking out.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On Wednesday at 1:30 PM, I sent an email with an attachment from my hotmail (Outlook) to my boss. Later, I copied and pasted three pages from Word to a new hotmail (Outlook) message, saved it as a draft at 1:46, but did not send it. In fact, I never designated
 a recipient. The message was for my own personal use.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On Friday, at 9:18, my boss sent me a new email unrelated to the one I had sent her on Wednesday. At the bottom of this email was my previously composed but unsent message. I checked my sent items, but that message was not there. I checked the draft itself
 and it was still listed as Saved Wednesday at 1:46. I did not send my boss or anyone any emails after pasting the three pages to a new draft and saving it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All evidence points to the fact that my draft was never sent to anyone. My boss would definitely have mentioned the contents of the draft had she received it. Yet how is it possible that the contents of it were located at the bottom of a new email sent
 by someone who should never have received it.</div>

            Thank you for your speedy reply.
<div><br />
<div>I'm not sure if I made it clear exactly what happened. Somehow, an unsent draft found its way into a new email from my boss. Here are the exact steps that happened:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. I sent my boss an email with an attachment at 1:31 PM Wednesday. This was the last email I sent to ANYONE.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. I copied and pasted three pages from Microsoft Word into a New message and clicked Saved Draft immediately at 1:46 PM. This was all after sending my boss the email at 1:31. I never designated a recipient to this draft.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. On Friday at 9:15 AM, I received a New email from my boss, NOT a reply to my previous one from Wednesday. At the bottom of this email was my draft from Wednesday. It was in the format of Conversational Threading, ie. in a different pane.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. I checked my Sent Items and it shows the last email sent was the 1:31 message on Wednesday, which did not contain the contents of the draft.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can't take a screenshot because I had already deleted the message, and I have not been able to duplicate the results. It seems like a very strange glitch to me. What I am worried about is that possibly my boss somehow received my draft. I would like
 to know if this is a possibility.</div>

            <p>Hi <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/03838b65-9cde-48fe-b3db-4d4e0d3ea3c6">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me assist you with your concern regarding your unsent draft email if it was send to the recipient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like what the last moderator mentioned it is possible that your Conversational threading is enabled on your account. Even though you did not send the email and saved it as draft it will still show on the thread.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rest assured that the email was not sent to the recipient.<font color="#000000">
</font><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>On the top of draft email you will see Continue writing.
</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this answered your question, please do not hesitate to contact us again if you have any other concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Kay</p>

            OK, now THAT ios enough information :-) &nbsp;Sadly, what it tells me is "I do not know what is wrong, I have never heard of this issue before."
<div><br />
<div>Usually, large slabs of grey shading indicate a cross-reference that has gone wrong, sucking in a large section of text including its target (sometimes, several chapters!).</div>
<div><br />
<div>To see if it is that, when it next happens, right-click the shaded area and see if you are offered the option to "toggle field codes". &nbsp;If you are not, it's not a broken cross-reference. &nbsp;If it is, the shaded text will vanish! &nbsp;Don't panic. &nbsp;It hasn't
 actually gone anywhere...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Scroll back up the document until you find the cross-reference, which will now read { REF "BookmarkName" }. &nbsp;That's the code that actually generates the cross reference.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Right-click that code, and choose Toggle Field Codes again. &nbsp;The text will reappear.</div>
<div><br />
<div>NOW you have a problem :-) &nbsp;The text that reappears does not exist at that location. &nbsp;It's being copied in from a different location in the document. &nbsp;You must now decide which is the correct place for it, and move it to where you want it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would use Cut to remove it, and Edit&gt;Paste Special&gt;Unformatted Text to paste it. &nbsp;That way you will remove any broken field codes that are in the text. &nbsp;You will need to re-format the pasted text.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Everyone gets broken cross-references when editing documents that contain cross-references, unless they are very careful. &nbsp;To ve careful, you need to go to Word&gt;Preferences&gt;View and turn "Field Shading" to "Always" so you can see where they are, and thus
 make sure you do not edit closer than one character to a cross-reference.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There are other things that might cause this indication, although I have never seen them, so these are just wild guesses:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) &nbsp;Running out of memory. &nbsp;Log out of your computer at the end of work each day, and log back in the next day. &nbsp;This cleans up the memory. &nbsp;Shut the computer down and re-start it once a week. &nbsp;This cleans up the OS. &nbsp;If it's memory problems, this will
 clear it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2) &nbsp;Strange settings in the display of Tracked Changes. &nbsp;Make a copy of the document and Accept all changes". &nbsp;If that clears it, the document has too many tracked changes in it, and is in danger of failing completely. &nbsp;I recommend Compare Documents instead
 of Track Changes when working on long and complex documents. &nbsp;It achieves the same thing, but is most unlikely to cause document problems.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps</div>

            Additional to the other replies, you're an update behind on OS X - 10.6.<span style="font-weight: bold">8</span> is the current build. I don't know that it will make a difference with this issue but ya just never know :-)<br />

<h2>            Word 2013 and Greek keyboard</h2>
                    I have a document that I need to add Greek letters to. Like the Greek letter for alpha.&nbsp; Does this font come preinstalled in Word 2013? If so, how do I switch to it.&nbsp; If not can you tell me what I need to do&nbsp;to get the Greek alphabet in Word.&nbsp; I am a basic
 Word user, nothing real fancy.

            <p>There are at least two ways to insert just a few Greek letters using only what you already have.</p>
<ul>
<li>In your regular font, type the English (Roman) letters that correspond to the desired Greek letters, and then change the font to Symbol. The Symbol font is standard in all Windows versions. Here are two lines that were typed identically, but the lower line
 has Symbol font applied to it:</li></ul>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e4d8b10-5590-4ac5-871e-ddc7ce0e5c80" /></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>On the Insert tab, click Symbol and then click More Symbols. In the dialog, make sure the "from" box is set to "Unicode", which makes the Subset box visible; then set the Subset box to "Greek and Coptic". Click on the letter you want and then click the
 Insert button. This works for most fonts, although some don't have a "Greek and Coptic" subset.</li></ul>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a765b3ac-2199-4945-b6ac-e19872e0a9da" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; After you use a letter this way, it will show up in the list of recently used characters in the Symbol button's dropdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have to type whole sentences or paragraphs of Greek text, then you would need to
