            <p>I suspect that if you have a right handed mouse 'click' means a left mouse button click (whilst holding down Ctrl and Shift keys together).</p>

    <title>Windows 10 update reverted display language to Portuguese and now no - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 update reverted display language to Portuguese and now no option to set English</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>I live in Brazil so local original default language on my PC was Portuguese. I had set everything (input and display) to US English.</p>
<p>Last night a major update came in and at the end of this everything reverted to Portuguese.</p>
<p>The display language US English is visible in settings but the option to make it standard is grayed out.</p>
<p>I've spent a couple of hours looking at Control Panel and Regional Settings but I can't get it back to English. It keeps telling me to go online to the Internet, but I'm already online.</p>
<p>This is a huge pain as it affected everything including Excel and its formulas.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>After a lot of searching here on the forum and testing a lot of solutions that were proposed for similar problems with Win 8 and 8.1 I finally found one that appears to have resolved the issue.</p>
<p>So here it is to help other users:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Go to Control Panel - Language - Advanced settings - Reset (or&nbsp;</span><span><span>Restore Defaults&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">at
 the bottom of the page).</span><br />
<p>
</p><p>After restoring defaults and rebooting, the language settings in Control Panel then consider that Internet is available and the latest English Language Pack for Windows 10 Version 1607 downloaded and installed OK.</p>
<p>

            if you are in the US, go to a physical retail Microsoft Store and they will test to see if it is the charger or the Surface itself. it sounds like the charger to me. you can try ordering a replacement charger. Read the ratings of third party chargers on
 Amazon and pick one that others say works well. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Delectronics&amp;field-keywords=surface+rt+power+adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Want To Join An All Halo Clan&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spartan i043  say:</h3>
<h2>            Want To Join An All Halo Clan&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>We are the founders of the Halo rings. We destroyed the flood and restored humanity. We lived and thrived before anyone. We are the earliest Halo players. We are Team Forerunner.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey! Spartan I043 here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning sound cool? Keep reading! I am&nbsp;currently in the process of recruiting for my clan Team Forerunner in Halo.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, I will be gone for a week, so contact one of the co-leaders if you wish to join. The names are listed below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We play&nbsp;every Halo that was ever&nbsp;made:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Halo: Combat Evolved (PC)</p>
<p>2. Halo 2 (PC)</p>
<p>3. Halo 3</p>
<p>4. Halo 3: ODST</p>
<p>5. Halo Reach</p>
<p>6. Halo Wars</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will also&nbsp;expand to the upcoming Halo:&nbsp;CE Remake and Halo 4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ABOUT TEAM FORERUNNER:<br />
Team Forerunner is a clan where winning and losing don't count, where skill doesn't matter, where cussing hardly exists, and where fun is always in the game. If you cuss up storms, only care about winning, and are unsporting don't bother reading on or sending
 us friend requests. We DON'T want players that cuss up storms and we DON'T want players that are unsporting and only want to win. We want players that want to have fun, we want players that are good sports and we'd prefer players that don't cuss (we don't
 mind if a you can't help throw a cuss word in every now and then). We currently have about 70 awesome, official players in Team Forerunner! Team Forerunner only cares about having fun and if we win great. . . if we lose, oh well we have our chins held high
 ready to move on either way. We are very strict on players who only want to win, who are unsporting, and who cuss up storms (We banned two members because they were both cussing up a storm and one of them only wanted to win and was unsporting). Most of Team
 Forerunner's members rarely ever cuss (which is really nice) and we try to help each other rank up, complete challenges and become better players. Both guys and gals are welcome to join our clan. KillJoyseries89 made&nbsp;our websit &nbsp;where you can view more of
 Team Forerunner's information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER RULES:<br />
1. Player must respect the leaders/co-leaders: Spartan I043, Iron Hawk II, Jakeylakes, Reydaitso, fishiesDONTswim,&nbsp;crazed so, and&nbsp;junglecatz81&nbsp;(So far only two members have disrespected us and I don't want it to happen again)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Player must be a good sport whether it's win or loss. (In other words, have fun whether you win or lose)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Player must have a mic and must communicate to the team. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Player must be willing to participate in ALL Halo Reach game modes. (Slayer, Capture the Flag, Headhunter, Invasion etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Player must change their emblems to Team Forerunner's official emblem (No armor or gamertag changes are required, however if you join our clan, I ask that you put "Team Forerunner" into either your motto or bio so that way when our new members look at
 my friend's list, they will know who is in our clan and who isn't)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I allow ALL ranks to join so I will allow you to join whether you are a Recruit, Inheritor or anything in between. Currently our highest ranked officer is a Field Marshall and our current lowest ranked officer is a Warrant Officer (again these are official
 Team Forerunner members). And we have many ranks in between, so you should be able to fit right in!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER INFO:<br />
Players can also list a specific preference in which class they will be assigned. (All-Around, Heavy, Long Range, Close-Quarter, Vehicle Operator, etc.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Octagon backround with the Champion Star in the middle is the Team Forerunner emblem. The Colors are Steel (Backround Color), Silver (Primary Emblem Color), and White (Secondary Emblem Color). I no longer require the service tag to be changed, because
 it is hard to recognize teammates with the same service tags.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As said above I am trying to make Team Forerunner as fun as I possible can, and if there are any recommendations let me know. We also try to have clan battles every weekend, so if your clan wants to battle ours, feel free to contact our Clan Battle Organizer
 Jakeylakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER CONTACTS:<br />
You are more than welcome to contact any of the leaders/co-leaders listed above, but for the most part you will want to send me messages. You can contact me multiple ways:<br />
1. Xbox Live Gamertag: Spartan I043 <br />
2. Right here in the forum<br />
3. Send me a private message</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TEAM FORERUNNER MEMBER NEWS:<br />
We now have our very own clan meeting room! We hold meetings&nbsp;every other&nbsp;Saturday. You can come to these meetings and find out more about us if you wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, When you join Team Forerunner, don't only send me a friend request, but also send Iron Hawk II (Team Forerunner Leader), Jakeylakes (Team Forerunner Co-Leader and Clan Battle Organizer), Reydaitso (Team Forerunner Co-Leader and Secretary of Treasure),
 fishiesDONTswim (Team Forerunner Co-Leader)&nbsp;crazed so&nbsp;(Team Forerunner Co-Leader), and junglecatz81 (Team Forerunner Co-Leader)&nbsp;one. This way they will know you are wanting to join or have already joined. You can try to contact one of them if I'm not online.</p>

<p>Iron Hawk II writes:<br />
"Hey guys, I am proud to be a Team Forerunner leader. I hope you have the best experience possible playing Reach in our clan.
<br />
This clan was built by Spartain I043 and myself and we want other Reach players to play to win, but also be good sports about losing because we will most likely not win every match. This has been a great experience for me. I hope to see you on the battlefield
 soldier. Iron Hawk II, signing out.<br />
PS: I appreciate my fellow clan members to be my friends and also if it isn't too much to ask, I would like a good rep. Oh! And one more thing I would appreciate as little language (cussing/swearing) as possible."</p>

<p>Jakeylakes also writes:<br />
"Hey guys i'm Jakeylakes one of the members of Team Forerunner. I would just like to give you a heads up display of how great this clan is and I highly recomend that you join. Team Forerunner plays for fun, Team Forerunner accepts anyone who's willing to join.
 These past few weeks have been awsome, I have played so much now and my ranks are soaring through the roof because I can actually play Reach and enjoy. Team Forerunner has lots of members and there all fun to talk to. If you consider becomeing an honarable
 member of Team Forerunner all you need is a mic, contact Spartan I043( our team leader- also give Iron Hawk II respect aswell) or alteranativly you can contact me and i'll talk with Spartan I043. Many Thanks Jakeylakes Team Forerunner"

"I'm a new member myself, this is a great clan to join. Team Forerunner may put fun first, but don't let that fool you into believing we are not a serious clan. I have been in 4 clans spanning the past 7 years on XBOX Live and I am impressed with the level
 of professionalism on Team Forerunner. "</p>

<p>Other quotes by my members:<br />
1. "Team Forerunner is a VERY fun clan!" -Capt Dewy/ispartan365 <br />
2. "Team Forerunner puts the Team in Teamwork!" -Crazed So<br />
3. "I never plan to leave Team Forerunner!" -Untaimed Spirit<br />
4. "Finally a clan where winning doesn't matter!" -burningclod<br />
5. "Team Forerunner's guys are GOOD!" -SILENTxkiller</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CONCLUSION:<br />
Believe it or not this is our (Iron Hawk II and me) first time running a clan as well as being in a clan. We must be doing a good job or our clan members wouldn't be saying these things. Personally we love to have fun, but we can get very serious (especially
 when it comes to recruiting and cussing players with unsporting attitudes). If you want proof that these guys have fun in Team Forerunner just send them a message and ask. They will tell you how much fun they have. We guarentee you'd have fun as well. If you
 want to join, but may be nervous if you were to want to quit and not disappoint me, don't worry about it. We don't force anyone to stay, nor do I force anyone to leave. It is completely up to you. We ask that you really think about joining. We have so much
 fun as a group and we want to share our fun with YOU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Team Forerunner is a clan where you want to find friends, play with mature yet fun guys that rarely cuss, have VERY GOOD sportsmanship, and have the teamwork spirit, then Team Forerunner is the clan for you, because Team Forerunner wants you to have a
 Halo Reach experience that you will NEVER forget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Questions and comments needed answered quickly about Team Forerunner should be sent to Spartan I043, Jakeylakes, Reydaitso, fishiesDONTswim,&nbsp;crazed so and/or junglecatz81. Iron Hawk II is online when possible (not frequently) so only send him messages if
 necessary. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On behalf of Team Forerunner we hope that you join (quickly).</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade version 1511 - not enough space.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm trying to install the new Windows 10 upgrade, version 1511, 10586 on my Windows 10 tablet.</p>
<p>Before the update began&nbsp;I was informed that there isn't enough free space on my C: drive. I performed a cleanup and&nbsp;choose&nbsp;another drive (sd card) for downloading the update.</p>
<p>When trying to install the upgrade after downloading&nbsp;I was&nbsp;informed again that there isn't enough free space, and that ~ 5 gigs are required on my C: drive...</p>
<p>I removed all the store apps, but I have achieved&nbsp;only 3.1 gigs of&nbsp;free space. I do not want to remove my firewall and antivirus software, nor Office which came bundled with my Asus tablet.</p>
<p>What else can I do? This free space issue has become ridiculous and annoying&nbsp;(have been&nbsp;struggled &nbsp;with it&nbsp;again and again on my tablet and windows phone....).</p>
<p>Appreciate your assistance.</p>

            <p>Hello Matias,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Small storage devices, like devices with 32GB hard drives or older devices with full hard drives, may need additional storage to complete the upgrade. You may need to either remove unneeded files from your device, or insert a USB flash drive to complete
 the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest you to use some external USB flash drive to avoid this low disk space error. Once the upgrade gets completed, disconnect the USB drive. But ensure, not to make any change to that USB drive.&nbsp;It contains the files that helps to rollback to the previous
 version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you require further assistance.&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for your advice. </p>
<p>As you can see from the screen clippings I added in my previous posts, I have and SD card with almost 26 gigs of free space in my tablet.
</p>
<p>I choose to use it, and indeed the download occurred. The issue starts when the upgrade process continues. For some reason I'm told I need an additional 5.07 GB on drive c:.
</p>
<p>I'd appreciate you further assistance. </p>
<p>Best.</p>

<h3> sjburns12  say:</h3>
<h2>            DAYZ A STANDALONE GAME ON PC AND PS4 BUT NOT XBOX&#33;&#33;&#33; WHY NOT&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>A little bit about Dayz- its a free world survival horror game set in Russia. The entire game is based around just surviving the end of the world where the zombies themselves might not be as dangerous as the humans that play the game. The Game has won many
 awards and has 2 million people playing it.</p>
<p>ok, so basically there is this really awesome game called Dayz and originally it was a mod, but now the developers are making it its own game. BUT, what it looks like is that ONLY PS4 AND PC will be getting this awesome upcoming title, NOT XBOX ONE. This
 is really concerning being a big fan of the original game. The reason for Xbox not getting it is this- Xbox doesn't allow self publishing indie games and updates for the game can cost a ton of money and the Dayz developers want to avoid that while PC AND PS4
 are both self publishing indie and do not charge for updates. XBOX PLEASE LET YOUR USER PLAY THIS GAME I AM SURE THAT YOU WOULD MAKE A HEFTY PROFIT FROM YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS AND BOTH OF US WILL BE HAPPY!!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Sincerely a Xbox fan</p>

<div>My friend is able to download daily challenges in his PC in Microsoft Minesweeper which he installed the game an year ago. He installed Microsoft Solitaire collection few days back and he cannot download daily challenges.</div>

            Thanks for your reply. I'm sure it must be down to Microsoft as I was doing the daily challenge on Mahjong all of 2013 without any problems. Just started the error code at new years. Really miss it. Hope Microsoft take note and get it fixed pronto.&nbsp;

            I'm not even getting an error code. Today's mahjong daily challenges were fine, but for the previous two days every time I click onto the first and third challeng I get the spinning tile for a few seconds and then it just automatically jumps back to desktop.
 This has happened before, and it is so frustrating. What is frustrating is the total lack of any real support offered.<br />

            <p>I also faced this problem when I was traveling and connecting through another network.</p>
<p>I believe this due to the firewall settings in that location, that would log in ok, but not let download the daily challenge, possibly because that was considered streaming content - and that was blocked.</p>
<p>[while I could go to youtube and browse listings, could not actually open/stream any of the links].</p>

                    <p>Dear team,</p>
<p>Recently I have purchased Dell Inspiron 5th Generation 5000 series laptop having windows 10 Home edition.
</p>
<p>I am facing problem on the laptop as the function key i.e. "Fn" is not working.
</p>
<p>For few softwares, while installation&nbsp;I am suppose to press "Alt+F2" but it does not work and only decreases the volume, Which is quite frustrating.
</p>
<p>Any help is much appreciated. </p>

<h2>            worried this will be assumed as cheating</h2>
                    
<p>The Lords of Shadow "Reverie" DLC came out last week. Unknowingly, the achievements were not yet up on Xbox.com so when I completed it, the achievements unlock but did not add to gamerscore or even show on xbox.com.
</p>
<p>Today, it turns out they were finally uploaded today to xbox.com. So, I recovered my gamertag to lose the achievements so they would properly add up and show the game as completed. After completing one level of the DLC, all the achievements unlocked simultaneously(I
 assume since my save was still there and the requirements were previously filled) but in the incorrect order. Now I am worried, is microsoft going to see these 5 achievements in the wrong order and reset me for cheating? so call me paranoid</p>

            I have a problem trying to update Renesas USB 3.0 driver V2.0.32.0<br />
<br />
I am trying to install displaylink software but it tells me that V2.0.32.0 is not working on it and to update to V2.1.36.0.<br />
<br />
However the driver that the new Renesas update is trying to replace is version 2.01.032 and after running the update the driver stays as V2.0.32.0.<br />
<br />
I cannot find V2.01.032 to update to that first, then update to V2.1.36.0.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

<p>The certificate is not trusted because the issuer certificate is unknown.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Hidden Network&#34;. Suddenly can&#39;t get wireless access through a DLink -615 router on Win7 laptop and Ipod touch</h2>
                    I have a new win7 laptop and an Ipod Touch 4g. I just arrived at a location where I have a DLink-615 router which was configured by a WinXp laptop last year.<br />
I powered up my new laptop and Ipod and entered my router password. Everything has worked perfectly until yesterday when I powered off my router.<br />
Now I can't connect with either the PC or Ipod. I get a "hidden Network' message.<br />
I've search the net for answers and have tried a few of the recommendations.<br />
I've tried to reinstall DLink from my original product disk and am told install was successful.<br />
How could everything work and then stop just because I powered off/on the router?<br />
Can someone give me specific instructions on what to try next? Many thanks in advance for your help.. I REALLY need wireless access<br />

<p>Hi Mr. Cheese,</p>
<p>What is the "hidden network" message verbatim?</p>
<p>That usually means that the device is not broadcasting the SSID, which could be causing an issue.</p>
<p>This really sounds like a settings issue, especially of other devices are still able to connect to the router .</p>
<p>I suggest resetting the router by pushing in the little button on back, and just setting the WEP password and nothing else.</p>
<p>Next you can create a new network profile on the laptop with the default settings (SSID and channel) and the WEP security pass phrase/password.</p>
<p>Are you able to connect?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Wired xbox 360 controller switched from Player 1 to Player 2 durring gameplay.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using Windows 7 64bit. I have deleted and reinstalled my contoller drivers and deleted and reinstalled 360 Accessories 1.2 with no avail. I have also switched USB ports. Durring gameplay my controller will randomly switch from quadrant 1 being lit up
 to quadrand 2 being lit up. This causes the conroller to stop working until I log out of the game and log back in. After I log back in i will play for a few min and then the controller will switch back to player 1. Also, sometimes it will switch to having
 quadrant 1 and 4 lit up green and the camera with just spin around my player. I cannot find anyone else that has had this problem. Please help!</p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
Where did you download the drivers for your controller?<br />
<br />
The issue seems to be with the drivers.<br />
<br />
Uninstall your controllers and any related drivers first and then perform these steps-<br />
<br />
•Download the file from this link- <br />
http://dl.qj.net/dl.php?fid=25580 <br />
<br />
•Unpack the file.<br />
<br />
•Connect your PS3 controller to the computer using the USB cable. The lights on the controller should begin blinking.<br />
<br />
•Go to the Control Panel from the Windows Start menu and click on Systems.<br />
<br />
•Click on the tab Hardware in the window that pops up, and then click on Device Manager.<br />
<br />
•Click Human Interface Devices in the device manager screen. Underneath will appear the option USB Human Interface Device. Right click on this and select Update Driver.<br />
<br />
•Click on Install from a list or specific location in the pop-up window. Select the Don't search I will choose... option on the next screen. Click Next.<br />
<br />
•Click Have disk on the next screen and then choose browse and select Desktop. From there, click ds3 drivers and choose ds3drv1.02. Click through until you get to the file beginning Dual shock... Open this and install the file.<br />
<br />
•Go back to the control panel and click on Game Controllers. Select Playstation 3 Controller and go to Properties. Press the Home button in the middle of the playstation controller. You should then see the cursor in the box to the left of the window respond
 to your joystick when you move it.<br />
<br />
<br />

            I have a similar problem. &nbsp;Mine has been player 2 for as long as I can remember. &nbsp;I never had any problems using it in games that allow the controller - like Beat Hazard. &nbsp;But I wanted to use it in&nbsp;Splinter Cell: Conviction&nbsp;(since the PC controls are horrid)&nbsp;I
<i>think</i>&nbsp;it sees the controller as the second player so when I turn it from K/M controls to the controller it sits there and doesn't recognize any button presses at all. &nbsp;I'm thinking that this
<i>might</i>&nbsp;be my problem.

            A stupid stupid problem to be having.&nbsp; Inexcusable for microsoft to be promoting this controller as some universal&nbsp;controller for pcs&nbsp;that will be plug and play wtih Live games and it has no configuration screen!!&nbsp;Just the&nbsp;windows calibration screen and
 that's it?&nbsp;&nbsp;No&nbsp;instructions.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; It automatically installs the drivers and performs mysteriously, changing the "player" setting at random.&nbsp; No ability to swap axiis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Idiotic.

            I use a hub but still suffer from the switching. Sometimes, its action specific...wen u press a particular button in a game...n at other times, its random...maybe a driver issue. I disconnects and just reconnects as P2. Updated the driver as well but to
 no effect. Any new solutions?

            <p>Something that helped me for awhile was I went into the Device Manager, and I found two devices associated with my controller - one was a "Gameplay Controller", and the other was an "HID enabled device" or something like that. Anyways, I disabled the "HID
 device" one and it worked fine for awhile. However, after a little bit, I'm still having the same problem again.</p>

            <p>Update: unplugging other devices and restarting worked for me. &nbsp;If you are having issues with it switching mid-game I'd say either you have something else plugged in that gets bumped and activated, or your having issues with the hub/ port you are using intermittently
 loosing a connection and assuming you've plugged in another controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Original:</p>
<p>I'm thinking a restart should fix the issue. I never had this issue before today. &nbsp; I actually had a usb classic style SNES controller plugged in when I tried to play a game with my XBOX360 controller. It didn't work and I noticed it (360) was set as player
 two. I have several XBOX360 controllers and i thought maybe one of my other ones was plugged in so I looked around and they weren't but the SNES controller was. I unplugged it (SNES) and the light stayed on player 2. I tried to play my game thinking "it's
 the only controller plugged in so it should work"- NOPE. &nbsp;So I figured I'll unplug the 360 controller so it will reset to player 1 - NOPE. &nbsp;It changed to player 3. Clearly the computer thinks there are multiple controllers plugged in. Unplug other HID devices
 and restart.&nbsp;</p>

            Did anyone find a way to fix it? I have the same problem and didn t find any solution. I read in the Internet that the problems often refer to NIVADA drivers. is that possible? If anyone finds a solution, pls answer me. ( My problem is EXACTLY THE PROBLEM

    <title>Factory Image Restore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anne4golf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Factory Image Restore</h2>
                    I have been unable to install Vista (Home Premium) SP1 which is a prerequisite for upgrading to Windows 7. I tried to do a restore to Factory Image so I could then install SP1. When I tried to do this I got the following error message: "The factory image
 could not be found reinstall using OS media (DVD)." <br />
Any suggestions? or, other ideas on how to solve the SP1 problem (I've tried all suggested methods).<br />
Thank you, <br />
Anne

<p><span>You do not say whether you have a Vista DVD, or not to take it back to Factory Settings..<br />
<br />
If you do, go into Bios/setup at startup/Power on by hitting F2 or Delete, depending on your type of computer, or you may have F12 to go into the Boot Menu, and change it there, and set the DVD to be 1st in the Boot Order, reboot with DVD in that Drive, load
 files, delete existing Vista partition, create new partition, format, install, etc.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows Vista Installation Super Guide</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
If a Manufacturer's Recovery DVD came with the computer, follow directions upon reboot via same Boot Order method above.</span></p>
<p><span>If you do not have one, contact them.<br />
They will send you a Vista recovery Disk/s for a small $ cost.</span><span><br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
&nbsp;If the computer manufacturer did not include Vista disk/s, there should be a Recovery Partition on your Hard drive.<br />
<br />
That is the way they do it now, most of the time. We are supposed to make the Recovery Disks ourselves, with instructions included in the installed Manufacturer's&nbsp;Software in Start &gt; All Programs.<br />
<br />
At the bottom of the splash Screen at startup/power on, there usually is a Key number, F10, or F11,&nbsp;to hit to start Recovery Process, to take it back to factory standards (out of the box).<br />
<br />
Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options&nbsp;, and start a factory standards recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair computer option.<br />
<br />
See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.<br />
<br />
Each manufacturer has their own way of doing a Recovery to factory standards.<br />
<br />
And save all your Data before you do it, as a reinstall wipes everything from your Hard Drive..<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers.</span></p>

<p>I called to cancel this order.</p>
<p>but because the bad guys just used my card, i don't have any information about the order.i just have my card number,the amount of the purchase,the purchasing time</p>
<p>the representatives said they can not cancel the order</p>
<p>now my bank put the charge on my account, and i had nothing to do but to wait for the bank to pull out the detail information of the charge.</p>
<p>i think microsoft store should change the progress of such situation. the order is not made by myself, why cann't it be canceled?</p>
