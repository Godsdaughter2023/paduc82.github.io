<h2>            My MS Office documents are &#34;floating&#34;</h2>
                    <p>My MS Office documents are "floating" if I move them on the monitor (~ 10 yr old Dell). It doesn't happen with any other app. What could be wrong?</p>

            Hi Hubert 
<br />
<br />Please explain this, what do you mean the documents are floating - is that the Word window that is moving around, or is the document inside the window moving around.
<br />
<br />If that is the document in the window that is moving, is it moving with your mouse or on its own?
<br />
<br />Also when you say they are floating, do you mean there is some sort of inertia in the movement?
        </p>

<p>I would say it is the document window, with the title of the document on top.</p>
<p>"some sort of inertia in the movement" is probably a better description than "floating".</p>
<p>For example, if&nbsp; I make a tight circle with the mouse pointer there is a delay before the window moves, it will continue moving after the mouse button is released and there is no way of telling where the document window will end up on the screen.</p>

            Hi Hubert 
<br />
<br />That type of behavior generally indicates a problem with your graphics card device driver . . .
<br />
<br />Go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running
<br />
<br />if that does not resolve this, in Word, go to File - Options, then on the left, click Advanced, and on the right, in the Display section, tick the box beside 'Turn off hardware graphics acceleration' and click OK, then restart Word . . .

<h2>            New Outlook &#47; Hotmail &#34;Login&#34; Query</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hotmail/outlook login screen has changed... (April 2016)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Previously, when logging in, if you type the first letter of your email address in the first field, it would list any previously entered log-in email addresses beginning with that letter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could then select the email address (or one of the listed email addresses) from the list, rather than having to type the entire thing out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the new login screen, that functionality seems to have disappeared, and the email address needs to be typed in every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst it may not seem like a bit deal, it was quite a time saver (as I log into, and out of the email account quite a bit).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible this functionality will be re-introduced? Was it removed for a reason?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And thanks for a great (and free) service!</p>

<p>After updating to 10074, I have no sound. &nbsp;my PC is connected to a samsung surround sound, with the display being a Samasung smart TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Sound/Control Panel shows "digital optical" as the primary device...which I do not have hooked up. &nbsp;HDMI option says "a cable is unplugged". &nbsp;I've been trying to get the sound working for 2 days now.....and managed to get it working ONCE....after the PC
 was shutdown overnight.....but the next time I woke the PC from sleep, no sounds...... &nbsp; any thoughts?</p>

<p>Hi Ed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not 100% sure I understand your configuration. Is your audio working off the display, or is it off some kind of amp with a pass-through to the display? This is an odd detail, but is there any difference depending on whether you boot your machine with
 the HDMI device (the amp or display, depending on the config) turned off or on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>I get my sound through a DisplayPort cable to a Dell monitor which has no speakers, but the monitor has an audio output jack where I plugin my soundbar.&nbsp; This pulls the sound from my video card (NVIDIA) which includes high def audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have sound capability from the motherboard (Realtek)&nbsp;and on an installed Creative SoundBlaster audio card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually after an upgrade my computer defaults to one of the audio sources that I am not using.&nbsp; I then have to go in via the Sound control panel, right-click my Dell monitor and make it the Default Device and the Default Communication Device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your actual device show up not greyed out so you can make it the default?&nbsp; If you right-click any of the devices in the list, try displaying both Disabled and Disconnected devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your TV is the default and the cable says unplugged (yet you are getting video?) does physically unplugging and replugging the cable at both ends change anything?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been finding that audio cuts out for me at times and I have to do this with my DisplayPort cable.&nbsp; On Build 10074 sometimes unplugging my video cable crashes explorer and I have to relaunch it via Task manager to get my Start Button and task bar back.</p>

            <p>Hi John! &nbsp;Thanks for taking the time to reply to my problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I'll try to explain how things are routed. &nbsp;I have an HDMI cable plugged into the graphics card on the PC (AMD R7 240). &nbsp;That HDMI cable runs to an HDMI In port on a Samsung "smart" TV. &nbsp;I also have an HDMI cable running from an HDMI out port on the TV,
 to a Samsung surround sound system. &nbsp;According to the manual for both the TV and the Surround sound system, thats how it must be wired when a PC is connected. (the only connection the surround sound has for input is an HDMI in port, other wise I could likely
 fix that issue with a sound or optical cable)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Thats the "hook ups". &nbsp; I've tried booting the computer in both manners....with the surround sound already turned on, and with the surround sound turned off, then turn it on after the PC boot has completed. &nbsp;In all cases the playback device shows up as
 either "Realtek Digital output", or "Reatek Digital Output (optical)". &nbsp;Neither of those are hooked up. &nbsp;And the HDMI that is hooked up shows up as "Not Plugged in". &nbsp;If I disable either of the Realtek Digital outputs, I get the red "X" on the speaker in the
 tray, but the HDMI just won't come online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Nothing is configured differently then in the previous preview version of Windows from a hardware standpoint, so it makes me suspect something has changed in the system files that is causing the issue.....but I'm not having any luck discovering what that
 might be. &nbsp; I've been checking for updates each day, hoping something will come through that avenue....but its not happened yet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Many Thanks for helping with this issue!</p>

<p>Well, Ed, this is lousy for you but actually good for me. :-) I've been looking for&nbsp;an example of this &nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you do me a favor?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Open a Command Prompt and run dispdiag, this will create a .dat file in the current folder</p>
<p>- Run DxDiag and save all information to a file</p>
<p>- Send both files to me at "mediaq at Microsoft dot com" and mention "AMD HDMI audio" in there so I know what it's about</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really appreciate your help. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi John!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Did the email every show up? &nbsp;The files were not that large...so I didn't compress them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I solved the issue last night! &nbsp;I was getting desperate, and scoured the net. &nbsp;I found an old post on the MS community talking about the same issue, only with a ASUS laptop and hdmi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Anyway, previously I had attempted to install graphics drivers via AMD auto detect....and it told me my driver were up to date. &nbsp;This time I went through the manual download, uninstalled the existing graphics drivers, then manually installed the graphics
 drivers..... as soon as I rebooted, the sound worked, and now in the tray the sound device is "Samsung". &nbsp;What a "DUH" moment..... I had just assumed that the drivers downloaded through MS Updated were the same as the ones on AMD's site.....guess not. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; If that email hasn't shown up, shoot me an email to EdCaffreyMS at Live dot com....... and I'll attach the files to a reply, and see if that will go through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Many Thanks for your help! &nbsp;</p>

<br />
<div>Simply put, Office 2007 only came in 32 it.&nbsp; The newer Office 2010 comes in either 32 or 64 bit flavors.&nbsp; You can install a 32 bit version of Office on either a 32 or 64 bit operating system (Vista or Win 7) but you can't install a 64
 bit version of Office 2010 on a 32 bit version of an operating system (XP, Vista or Win 7.)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Office 2010 32 bit is stable and should be the preferred install of Office 2010 unless you use extremely large data files in Word, Excel or the like.&nbsp; From what I have been able to find out so far, there is not a lot of difference between
 Outlook 32 and 64 bit versions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>One other thing to note is that if you run any other 32 bit Office programs (you decide to not overwrite Word 2007 lets say) you must install Office 2010 32 bit as 64 bit is not compatible with previous Office versions.</div>

<h2>            Problems with checkboxes when designing a form in Word 2010</h2>
                    I am designing a form in Word 2010 and I have been using checkboxes.&nbsp; They had been aligning themselves beside the text but then, further down the document, they started to appear slightly above the text&nbsp; which doesnt look too good.&nbsp; Could someone tell
 me why this would be happening and how I could fix it?&nbsp; Many thanks.

<h2>            Missing Keyboard Shortcut in Excel 2013 - Move among non-adjacent selections and unhiding column</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Excel 2013, I found that the following keyboard shortcuts are not available (which I used frequently in Excel 2010)</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span>Ctrl</span>+<span>Alt</span>+<span>Arrow Right</span>/<span>Ctrl</span>+<span>Alt</span>+<span>Arrow Left</span></td>
<td>Move to the right / to the left between non-adjacent selections (with multiple ranges selected)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Ctrl + Shift + 0</td>
<td>Unhide column</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>May I know are they no longer exit or they need to be activated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I can use these 2 keyboard shortcuts again as I found they are very useful, thanks so much!</p>

            <p>It appears to me that you have gone to the [File] tab, chosen "Options" then selected {Trust Center} and finally clicked on the [Trust Center Settings] button.&nbsp; Right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You would expect to see the items you've listed above - but you are missing 3 entries between</p>
<p>Trusted App Catalogs and</p>
<p>Protected View</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those 3 missing items would be:</p>
<p>Add-ins</p>
<p>ActiveX Settings</p>
<p>Macro Settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in my copy of Excel 2013, those 3 are there, as expected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as Guruprsad Ra <em>almost</em> said - if you will enable display of the [Developer] tab in the ribbon, there is an icon/choice near the left edge that says "Macro Security".&nbsp; You should be able to click that and open up the Trust Center right at the
 Macro Settings dialog where you have the various Disable/Enable settings radio buttons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, there's a deeper problem - and perhaps a repair install of Excel/Office would help it along, maybe not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[EDIT] On another line of thought, perhaps you didn't install VBA capabilities when you installed Excel?&nbsp; See
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/282847/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/282847/en-us</a></p>
<p>In that case you'd probably need to go to the Control Panel, Programs and Features, highlight Office 2013 (or Excel 2013 if you installed it as a stand-alone application) and then click the
<strong>[Change]</strong> button above the list of installed applications.&nbsp; That will bring up the install dialog and one of the options should be to use the
<strong>Add or Remove Features</strong> option to check and see if VBA support was installed previously, if not, elect to install it.</p>

            The preinstalled tracks on any phone are there under strict once-only licence terms, which is why Nokia cannot restore them if they are lost. The music companies would be unlikely to allow music to be given away 'free' with new phones if that were not
 the case. The only solution is to seek the tracks elsewhere.

<h2>            Lumia 540 upgrade issues</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi.</p>
<p>I need assistance with my phone upgrade to Win10 mobile. Lumia 540 is listed among the phones that can be upgraded to Win10 mobile.</p>
<p>I hope it wasn't a mistake to wait so long to upgrade and that I probably have missed the chance of an upgrade?&nbsp;&nbsp;It's just that being able to use my laptop for my main requirements I didn't feel the need to bother about my phone's antics but now that I have
 to travel and don't want to carry my laptop with me I realise I will need my phone's apps to work like they used to!</p>
<p>Please can I still upgrade? My phone is on Denim Firmware and that was why I didn't upgrade earlier because it wouldn't upgrade easily and I just couldn't stress myself over it since I had my laptop to hand.</p>
<p>If I can still upgrade, how do I go about it?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Unfortunately, the digital signing applies to the file, or workbook. It’s not possible to apply to individual worksheets.

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For
<br />
each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description,
<br />
version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your
<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site
<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software
<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />

<p>How to Install a Device Driver in Vista Device Manager<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

    <title>Buggy in general on build 15063.297 for Alcatel Idol 4s...here&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Buggy in general on build 15063.297 for Alcatel Idol 4s...here&#39;s issues I see</h2>
                    <p>I don't know if it's an issue with the phone itself, or something with the most recent build. Both my wife and I use the same device and experience the same issues. I've provided individual feedback on these issues in the feedback hub, but to no avail, never
 seem to get any response or upvotes. I'll list them here so maybe I can get some answers or make my case more well-known.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a few of the issues I am having:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Skype video calls are very choppy and laggy.</p>
<p>-When opening a video in the photos app, the screen blinks and goes black sometimes for a few seconds. This is especially noticeable when rotating the screen as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-The Alarm app isn't very reliable, as twice now it went off without making a sound. Yet, the screen did show the dismiss and snooze button. Resetting the phone and running a test with the alarm seemed to fix it, at least for the time being.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-For reasons unknown, the phone itself will reset on it's own. It seems to happen after attempting to load an app that takes too long? When pressing the back button, sometimes it locks up and resets the phone automatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-The Pandora app will sometimes not complete the full track, and I have to manually press the forward button to keep it going. A phone reset fixes this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll add more to this list as I encounter more errors. It's quite frustrating! I'll point out that these issues were not prominent on my old Lumia 735 running the anniversary update.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regarding this concern, we suggest that you perform a soft reset. <span>This method will not remove anything at all from your phone and is completely safe to attempt in any problem situation.</span><br />
<br />
You may also use the "Windows Feedback" app found in Windows 10 powered devices to send your feedback and suggestions.<br />
<br />
We appreciate your time reaching out to us.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
        </p>

            Thank you for your response. However, I did perform a soft and a hard reset. I also tried to reset the app that was giving me problems. Unfortunately, none of these methods have worked. &nbsp;As stated above, I also provided this information in the feedback
 hub where appropriate.

            Since the issue is still not resolved after performing the soft reset, the next workaround is to check if there's a pending phone software update. To check it, just go to
<strong>Settings&gt; Update and security&gt; Phone update&gt; Check for updates.</strong><br />
<br />
Before starting the update, connect to a charger or make sure your phone has enough battery power (at least 50%). Please use a Wi-Fi network connection to download the update to avoid mobile data transmission costs.

<p>Could be anything, even a firmware issue (might be never fixed), even a hardware issue (your particular unit). I would reset that phone via the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?Linkid=522381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Recovery Tool</a> and not adding my Microsoft account (and therefore not the backup). Then, I would update to Windows 10 Mobile Version 1703 via All apps » Settings » Update » Phone update. When that is done (currently OS build .297), I would update the apps:
 All apps » Store » Options » Downloads and double-check via Search » Skype there is no remaining update. Then, go for Skype and add your account just for that app. Still choppy video? Drop Alcatel (TCT Mobile) a note directly and return that phone to your
 point of sale (retailer).</p>

<p>Good idea with using the recovery tool. I will try your method in the next day or two and report back. I am wondering how NOT logging in with my Microsoft account would change anything though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly enough, I downloaded the recently updated version of Line, and video calls are smooth with it. This leads me to believe it's probably something with the app, or how it functions with the Alcatel.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That makes sure neither your backup is re-applied nor any 3rd-party apps are downloaded. It could be a background app/process which takes control of the phone. If you use a vanilla phone without any account, something like wild gone app gets unlikely. It
 simply rules out any personal configuration.</p>

            Alas, the recovery tool made no difference with skype video calls. I still think it's something in the app and how it behaves with the Alcatel. As I said, Line video calls are fine. A firmware update from Alcatel would be nice. Not sure if the problem
 lies there, but I have yet to see a firmware update from them yet.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Even if the thread is old, I will reply with what i know after tinkering with my newly bought Alcatel Idol 4 Pro (new old stock)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone does reset suddenly, I saw that it does it when an app hangs, there is no apparent reason for the app hanging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding video calls, this phone is a mistery ( I had multiple windows phones: 520, 530, 640, 650, 1520) but none of them did this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Whatsapp and Skype video-call the other person cannot see me, only a black screen.</p>
<p>I did manage, just one time, to call on another Win10Mobile phone on whatsapp, it worked, but then on a second call, the video didn't work anymore. Prior to this I tried calling on whatsapp to an android 8.1 phone, always black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>then I installed Viber, video works without problems, very fast no lag, but the phone gets too hot like the processor is working non-stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe somebody else who sees this, has some ideas...</p>
        </p>

 using a computer since 1985 with the very first windows. I must be getting too old, though, and that is why I'm having problems.&nbsp; Please begin from the very beginning....I know that I have to first deactivate office 365 from the old computer. The problem is
 . and I can't believe this, I can't locate the "install page" where I am suppose to choose "deactivate install".&nbsp; The two computers are Hewlett Packard. &nbsp; I am also having a problem finding the "account page" that I'm told to choose ""share office 365". &nbsp;
 The account page that I have just lists what I have purchased.&nbsp; I have never had this much trouble. I realize that I may have written a book instead of just a question. I apologize . &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Ramona,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Upon reviewing your description above, you would want to transfer your Office 365 to a new PC. If you follow the transfer terms in the Software License Terms, you can move Office to a different computer. If you are using Office 365 Personal, you may need
 to deactivate your Office from your old PC so you can reinstall it to the new one. If you are using Office 365 Home, you can just install the Office 365 right away to the new PC.</p>

            This was all changed on July 29th, so the only way now is by way of upgrading an active version of Win7/8, or buy a copy and install, if you now have a Digital Entitlement version of Win10 you can join the Insiders Program,

            <p>Thanks. This means of course that I cannot test Windows 10 on a variety of computers, because they came with Windows XP and Vista. It is just not feasible to buy licenses for those old PCs and laptops, just to test Windows 10 on them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks for the answer.</p>

            The change &nbsp;came after MS discovered that people were putting the first builds of Preview and not really testing as the program required and just sitting on them hoping to be able to get Win10 for "free" when it was released &nbsp;July29, if you want to see
 if W10 will run on older system just make the ISO and install it and see if it works doesn't need to be active to see if it will run, I do this all of the time and after I finish I just restore the old OS.&nbsp;

            <p>Yes, for a quick test of Windows, not activating is a way to go.</p>
<p>I have to confess that time is an issue for me. I rarely have so much spare time to finish doing what I am doing, so I get back to stuff days, weeks, months after I have started. That’s what happened to three of my older laptops for which I was lucky to
 get them activated.</p>
<p>I discovered some flaws way after July 29, 2015.</p>
<p>I get it that MS wants to prevent the 1990ies' practice of people who just copied the neighbors Windows and used it on their PCs. Serial numbers (Product Keys) alone also did not work. Activation is one way to do it, but quite francly, the testing world
 for private people doesn't work that way.</p>
<p>Anyway, I guess I'm also kind of marked by MS's actication policy. I legally use an OEM version of Windows, move it from one PC to the other, use it there for i-don't-know-how-long-a-period only to find out this year that MS is not accepting the migration
 of an OEM license to another computer. Even though that is not legal in Europe, they made the responsibility of the OEM activation go to the OEM partner. So, I used this Windows license for … a couple of years, more than 5, and did move the license to and
 from PCs quite a lot.&nbsp;<em>Asking the OEM about re-activation when warrenty, order number, oder date and everything is long gone, seems a bit odd!!!</em></p>
<p>Since I don't know beforehand how long I will keep an installation running, I used the procedure to activate an installation right away. Now, that turned out to be wrong.</p>
<p>OEM license are deactivated once they have been activated 39 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I got a legal license that I cannot use anymore. In addition to that, my primary PC just failed and I am getting a new one. So, I cannot even install this legal Windows on my new computer, even though I don't use it right now on any of my older testing
 systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Activation is just wrong.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The same is true for testing Windows 10.</p>
<p>Eventually this will make me move to alternative platforms. I am currently also using Linux and Mac OS X. I don't know for how long I will be willing to continue to participate with a) using Windows, b) helping others who use Windows and c) recommending
 Windows to others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will most probably end up recommending Linux to people who ask me about operating system stuff. I will most likely even consider recommending OS X over Windows, because you don't have the license and activation problem on Mac hardware at all. Additionally,
 OS X upgrades are free. Also, moving one OS X to another Mac is no hazzle at all. With Windows apparently it is, since the license is tied to the very PC, not to the number of PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>If I wanted to work for activation and license trouble, I could also consider building myself a Hackintosh.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I loved Windows 7 as long as I had a legal copy that actually activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate having to peg Microsoft to activate my legally obtained product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love Mac OS X 10.6, but I don't like so much what the newer versions feel like. The same with Windows: I don't like Windows 8/8.1 and Windows 10 is … okay, but not great at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love various Linux distributions, and hate others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, power users (private people) who are installing and testing and playing with operating systems for the sake of playing with them (not actually using them for their "work" or their software and workflows) – such users hate it that, except for
 Linux, most closed-source systems don't allow for power users tweaks and testing and hacking and trying things out. Activation is a show-stopper to that too, to the extend that prolonged testing (like doing it then when spare time permits) is no longer possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that makes my question and intention clearer.</p>
<p>I also hope I won't get flamed for thinking outside the Windows world and for having mentioned the A***e and the L***x words in a MSFT forum. My intentions are honest and true, therefore I don't feel it could be wrong to speak my mind freely.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">And, even though I don't like repeating myself, I think this is important so I will say it again:</span></p>
<p><strong>Microsoft, please answer to specific reports in this forum with equally specific answers. A generic answer makes testers feel mucked.</strong></p>
<p><em>(FYI this posting is NOT a specific report in this forum! It is a gerneral discussion. I am referring to specific bug reports that included all the information necessary, and got answer like: "did you try installing the correct driver yet" when I clearly
 stated that it was NOT a driver problem to begin with!)</em></p>
