    <title>Moving AppData files to a different location - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Moving AppData files to a different location</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently attempted to move my roaming appdata folder to a different drive since I'm running short on space on my SSD. When I right-clicked the roaming folder, I was able to go to the "location" tab and move it from there. After rebooting I saw that the
 files had moved but there seem to be some hiccups -- programs that won't start (sticky notes), apps that aren't properly reading the data (Skype) and some other minor funny-business.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>Anyway, I'd like to know how I can revert this process since the roaming folder still exists on my C drive with some left-behind files but right clicking on it doesn't show me the "location" tab anymore. Likewise, copying the folders back into the old
 roaming folder does nothing since the system directory is pointing towards my F drive as the new "roaming" folder.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Unfortunately I somehow also lost my system restore so doing that is not an option.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be appreciated!</div>
                </div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
This issue might occur due to the fact that the default location for the AppData folder has been changed.
<br />
<br />
In this scenario, we can try changing the location for the folder to default target. This might fix the issue. Follow the steps:<br />
Right Click on the Roaming folder inside AppData folder and select Properties.<br />
Go to location tab and select restore default for the target location.<br />
See if it makes any changes for the default location.<br />
<br />
If it doesn't, I would suggest you to create a new user account and then check if the issue still persist. Refer to the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link </a>to create a new user account. <br />
<br />
Do let us know if the issue still persists. <br />

<h2>            Cambridge Adcanced Learner&#39;s Dictionary a problem with display</h2>
                    <p>Hello...</p>
<p>I installed CALD 4th edition, and the installation was just perfect. However, after installation when I start the Cambridge Dictionary program, the entries in the window are invisible. I can't search for the meaning of any words. All I get is a blank window.
 Is there a plugin missing or what? The platform used is Windows 8.1 pro. In the picture you can see what I get when I start the program.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are your other devices trying to connect to the hotspot?&nbsp;The hotspot&nbsp;will stay in the list of available networks in case you want to use it again.&nbsp; It holds your network's security settings so you don't have to re-enter the information every time you want
 to use the hotspot.&nbsp; If you remove your laptop from the range of the other devices,&nbsp;the hotspot&nbsp;will not show in the lists of your other devices.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you see how to ask your computer to "forget" known networks?&nbsp;Look at the image below.&nbsp;You can ask your other devices to forget the hotspot, too.&nbsp;If you want to later use that connection, you will have to re-enter your security key.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forgetting the network really doesn't do me any good when the connection is unprotected. It doesn't ask for any sort of password when I connect to it. Although, the connection is a bit spotty. Some applications won't work on my mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But so long as it's showing up on any device that comes near my house, it allows them to connect to the network. And I don't want that. Isn't there anything I can do to hide it completely?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should mention, that it didn't always do this. I don't know what I did to change it, but it's only been within the last couple of weeks that the connection has popped up on my cell phone and iPad. But I did first notice it when a few months ago, it popped
 up on my brothers cell phone.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>It doesn't, unless you have&nbsp;NO security on your home network at all</strong>.&nbsp; If you have purchased a&nbsp;wifi router in the last, well, say 5 years or so, the router comes with the security already built in.&nbsp; I don't know the year when routers came
 with the security already built in, but routers didn't use to be that way.&nbsp; You would purchase a router and have to install your own security to protect your home network from being logged into by a stranger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what you are telling me, you have no security on your home network. Do you still have the manual that came with your router?&nbsp; Get it out to read how to get into your router's settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know what brand and model number for your router.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I'll give you some links to research and some basic instructions&nbsp;to see if you can manage getting the security back onto your network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Internet Explorer.&nbsp; If you don't see an icon for it, Click on Start, then All Apps, then Windows Accessories, then Internet Explorer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most routers use a common IP address such as <strong>http://192.168.1.1</strong>,
<strong>http://192.168.0.1</strong>, or <strong><a href="http://192.168.2.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://192.168.2.1</a></strong>.&nbsp; These numbers are what you type into the address bar on IE.&nbsp; Linksys, you’d type
<strong><a href="http://192.168.1.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://192.168.1.1</a></strong>.&nbsp;D-Link router, you’ll type
<strong><a href="http://192.168.0.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://192.168.0.1</a></strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You will get asked to <strong>Log In</strong>.&nbsp; Usually, the user name is <strong>
admin</strong> and the password is <strong>password</strong>.&nbsp; The website linked to below has the most comprehensive list of routers and the default username and passwords.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://portforward.com/default_username_password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://portforward.com/default_username_password/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I advise to put an administrative password on the router since the default password is very easy to figure out.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look for Wifi or security links on the main router settings page, usually on the left hand side of the page.&nbsp;You might have to go into the
<strong>Advanced</strong> settings.&nbsp;After you put an administrative password on the router, create yourself a sticker to place directly on the router.&nbsp; A sticker on the router is also a good place for your network key, or password, when you have it set.&nbsp;
<strong>Write it down somewhere. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to user guides or manuals for many popular routers.&nbsp; Select your brand of router, for example, Netgear, Belkin or Linksys.&nbsp; When you click on your brand, the next page will have model numbers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://setuprouter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://setuprouter.com/</a></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Just a note......if someone outside of your home is logging into your&nbsp;connection to use the Internet, and if they are doing something illegal, it could fall back on you.&nbsp; Your Internet service provider could also disconnect your service if someone outside
 your home is using your connection to get free internet.&nbsp; It is up to you to secure it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply back with the model number or brand of your router and I can assist you further if you cannot figure it out.&nbsp;

            <p>Thank you Charianne for responding to my question. </p>
<p>In response to your questions, let me answer them one by one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>* No, I am not getting any error because Windows is always stuck at the logo screen and does not go anywhere beyond that. If I try to force shut down by holding the power button, it goes into automatic repair loading screen and after some time some it gives
 me a black screen with only the mouse pointer visible. And if I use the Windows Recovery USB drive to access repair, it gives me a blue screen with the &nbsp;pointer again right after clicking Repair My Computer. Therefore, there isn't any possibility for me to
 even access Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Well, I've tried using the Repair My Computer option as I had mentioned above via Windows Recovery USB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Before all this happened, my explorer.exe hanged and crashed and everything got stuck with only the pointer being able to move. I went ahead and forced shut down using power button, which I greatly regretted now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* I faced this right after the forced shut down mentioned above.</p>

<h2>            on-screen keyboard won&#39;t launch on windows 7</h2>
                    The on-screen keyboard won't launch on windows 7, but if &nbsp;activate the alt+ctrl+del screen, the on-screen keyboard appears, then disappears when you quit the alt+ctrl+del activated screen (same thing on start up &amp; password screen). &nbsp;It only works&nbsp;when

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>- Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to follow below methods which may help you to reslove your issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:: System File Checker (SFC)<br />
</strong>SFC tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.</div>
<div>To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:<br />
a) Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then type <strong>cmd </strong>in the Start Search box.<br />
b) Right-click <strong>cmd </strong>in the Programs list, and then click <strong>
Run as administrator.<br />
</strong>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue<br />
c) At the command prompt, the following line, and then press <strong>ENTER:<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7?<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</strong></a><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: </strong>You can also try to disable and enable the onscreen keyboard and check if it works fine or not. To do so follow steps:<br />
1.Press the <strong>Win + U</strong> keys together to launch the <strong>Ease of Access Center.
<br />
</strong>2.Then click on "<strong>Use the Computer without a mouse or keyboard" </strong>
(most probably the 3rd option in the list).<br />
3.Then on next page <strong>uncheck </strong>the box which says <strong>"Use On-Screen Keyboard".<br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>Method 3:Create new User account</strong> <br />
If that does not work, create a new user account and check. If it works in a new user account, then probably your user account may have been corrupted and would need a fix.<br />
<strong>Create a user profile<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account</strong></a><br />
<br />
If issue doesn’t persist from the new user account, visit the below link to fix the user profile:<br />

<p><span><span>Bluescrren errors typically mean hardware or driver issues (though it could also be software).&nbsp; Read the posts and follow
 the procedures set forth by Spirit MVP in the following thread regarding the Blue Screen of Death.&nbsp; They should help you resolve your problem.</span></span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/8cd8362e-7d06-46fb-afd7-84d54b6a8ea7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/8cd8362e-7d06-46fb-afd7-84d54b6a8ea7</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A
 lot of that is duplicated below but it also offers some other oprtions and explanatons of bluescreen errors.&nbsp; What we really need now is the EXACT and ENTIRE text of the bluescreen message - just copy it down and post it in a reply.&nbsp; If the system shuts down
 too fast to copy the message, to to Start / Control Panel / System / Advanced System Settings / Advanced / Startup and Recover / and uncheck the box to Automatically Restart.<span>&nbsp;</span>Also check the box to Write an Event to the System Log and
 select Complete Memory Dump and check Overwrite any existing file.<span>&nbsp;</span>This will freeze the program on the bluescreen so you have time to copy the information.<span>&nbsp;</span>Can you boot normally except when these events occur?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also want to try the Driver Verifier Manager to see if you can identify the driver or device responsible:</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also use Skydrive</span></span><a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/SkyDrive-Microsoft-s-Windows-Live-Storage-Service-in-the-Cloud-61977.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://news.softpedia.com/news/SkyDrive-Microsoft-s-Windows-Live-Storage-Service-in-the-Cloud-61977.shtml</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;to
 upload dump and text files related to the error which may help us identify the problem.&nbsp; Just post back the link to where they are.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one
 you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;shutdown (Start / Control
 Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt starting from C:\Windows\System32).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To
 fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for
 the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers.&nbsp; Go to Device Manager by going tostart / search box and type device
 manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details
 and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should get any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you
 should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a></span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span><span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE and only if you can stll boot normally).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span>

<p>I'm using Windows 7 and recently I can't seem to save work on Word or any other programs as the button fails to work. I can press it but nothing seems to&nbsp;happens.
</p>
<p>This is also a similar problem with the Internet. If I want to upload a file the upload or search or browse button fails to work. Does anyone know what I could do as I am quite useless with computers!</p>

    <title>Skype is not loading my contacts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikesabatien  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype is not loading my contacts</h2>
                    <p>New ASUS Laptop, 4 days old. My old laptop still works fine and Skype works in it fine, although I really hate being forced off msn messenger and hate Skype, it appears to be my only hope at the moment to keep in contact with friends. So I use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in the new laptop I cannot get it to load my "messenger" contacts, yes I clicked the button, first with "All" later I tried "messenger" but neither works. All I can get is facebook contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, no one is ever online, so I called a few friends, they said that I am not online. Skype says its online but apparently its not actually working.
</p>
<p>Who knows, perhaps I installed the wrong one, on my old laptop I just took the forced update from messenger to Skype and there where ALL my friends and I was and still am online. However, when I tried to download Skype messenger to this new laptop, I get
 a contact list for facebook only, I can not access my messenger contact list nor can I actually get online, although Skype thinks itself to be online, weird.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could someone suggest which Skype program I should download as I am not familiar with this program, I only used the "OK" box in the update and never really looked at which Skype program it was. Somehow I probably installed the wrong one or something so I
 deleted it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I need to know how to install Skype from scratch so it not only actually works but will give me both facebook and messenger contact lists of mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<h2>            After KB3093266 update Wi-Fi downloading speed decreased 50&#37;</h2>
                    After installing Microsoft latest cumulative update KB3093266&nbsp;Wi-Fi performance of my windows 10 laptop decreases over 50% . The uploading speed is fine but downloading speed varies too much . I try to solve the problem by reinstalling Wi-Fi driver but
 it does not solve it. Two of my friends too have my same problem after installing this update. They have roll back to windows 8.1 do to windows 10 Wi-Fi issue. I solve the problem by uninstalling it but since we can't stop windows update in windows 10 the
 update install again . It is not convenient to use Ethernet cable every time I use my laptop , so can you tell me a solution to this problem. I really don't want to go back to windows 8.1 as my friends does since I love windows 10 new features and performance.

            <p>My speed didn't decrease, but I couldn't use my wifi at all, as the wifi adapter does not show in the network adapters page. The installation of this update and the start of the wifi adapter issues are correlated, as they started in the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Microsoft have a solution for that?</p>

            I'm having similar probelms. Update KB3093266 caused my WiFi to stop working after about ten minutes of use. I managed to fix it the first time by doing a system restore; however, as there is no way to turn off automatic updates, my computer resinstalled
 the update without creating a new restore point. I managed to update my driver and all was fine for a few hours, though my wifi speed was also reduced greatly. Then the wifi stopped working again. I launched safe mode to uninstall the update and it works again
 though now my whole computer still runs at about a fifth the speed it did before, but this entire process is a ridiculous waste of time. There needs to be a way to at least stop the automatic installation of updates. I'm using an HP Pavilion 11-e015nr and
 now have all the latest drivers.

            has anyone found a solution yet ? my wifi adapter is also a realtek rtl8732bs and I'm also experiencing a severe degradation of wifi performance. The maximum I can get on a 30 Mbps network is only 8 Mbps or lower.

<p>Did some searching, and it's apparently from the Loiter Squad Season 2 picture pack. &nbsp;</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>When you go looking for it through the dashboard (for anyone else looking for it, but unsure where go find it through the Xbox dashboard)- Games&gt;Browse Games&gt;Extras&gt;Gamer Pics - sort the gamer pics by release date, it should be easier to find as it came
 out within the last couple weeks.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

            If your device syncs automatically with Windows Media Player and you want to exclude a particular file from syncing to the device, you can choose to skip the file. You have several options for skipping files: deleting the file from the device, removing
 the file from a playlist that automatically syncs to the device, and removing a file that has an error condition.<br />
<br />
Delete the file from the device<br />
<br />
If you delete a file from your device and the file is part of a playlist that syncs to your device, Windows Media Player will skip the file the next time you sync your device.<br />
<br />
If you decide later that you want the file to automatically sync with the device again, drag the file from the details pane to the Sync list in the list pane, and then click Start sync.<br />
<br />
Remove the file from a playlist that automatically syncs to your device<br />
<br />
To view the contents of playlists set to sync automatically with your device, do the following:<br />
<br />
Click the Start button , click All Programs, and then click Windows Media Player.<br />
<br />
If the Player is currently open and you’re in Now Playing mode, click the Switch to Library button&nbsp; in the upper-right corner of the Player.<br />
<br />
In the Player Library, click the Sync tab, click the Sync options button , and then click Set up sync.<br />
<br />
In the Device Setup dialog box, click the playlist you want to view in the Playlists to sync list.<br />
<br />
Remove a file that has an error condition<br />
<br />
If an error prevents a file from syncing, you can try to resolve the problem so that the file can sync successfully. Or, you can prevent the Player from trying to sync the file again by clicking the Error button&nbsp; (which appears next to the file in the Sync
 status list in the details pane), and then by clicking Skip This File Every Sync. You can also skip all other files with the same error condition by clicking Skip All Files with This Error Every Sync.<br />
<br />
To view the Sync status list in the details pane, click the status bar in the Sync tab of the list pane.<br />

    <title>My external hard drive suddenly became unllocated&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My external hard drive suddenly became unllocated&#58;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have restored an image created by Macrium from my external hard disk which became now unllocated for reasone I didn't now. After the restoration successfuly completed, I closed the macrium environement. Then, after my computer restarted I found that there
 is a window telling me this:<br />
<b>Windows Manager Boot:</b><br />
<b>Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause. To fix the problem:</b><br />
<b>1- insert your windows installation dis and restart your computer.</b><br />
<b>2-choose your language settings and then click 'next'</b><br />
<b>3- click repair your computer.</b><br />
<b>if you don't have this disc, conatact your system adminstrator.</b><br />
<b>---------</b><br />
<br />
I booted from Macrium Secure CD version 4.0, which has an option to fix the boot error. Then, I choose fix boot error.<br />
There were four optitions, Which I think were:<br />
Master Boot Recored<br />
Unique Hard Code<br />
Boot Database configuration<br />
<br />
<b>NOTE: I have run boot fixing while my external hard drive is connecting to my computer, is this the reasone causing my external hard drive became unlocated.</b><br />
<br />
After fixing Boot, my system booted correctely.<br />
However, I was shocked that my external hard dirve which mostly has all my very important data has been unllocated. So my system didn't recognised my hard drive.<br />
I am quite sure that I didn't do anything wrong because I am quite keen. <br />
I didn't do anything so far(such as format or created), so could you please let me know if I could do anything to let my drive keep all the data stored on it.
<br />
Could you please help me becuase this hard Drive has everything(Images, programs, and data) I did two years ago?</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.sevenforums.com%2fimages%2fsmilies%2fmad.png" /> It is exactly my archeive.<br />
</p>
<p>Even when I resore my system from recovery disk, the same thing is <br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first connect my hard drive after a clean installation of windows from my recovery disks, I saw this window, although that the hard drive was one partition with NTFS.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you please at least give me any program to help me to recover all my data stored on my hard drive which became unllocated. I didn't proceed anything until now because I am afraid that if I had recreated it all the data inside it would be permentely
 deleted and would not be able to recovered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I quite exhuasted myself in collecting data stored on this hard drive become unlllcated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be quite sick if it didn't come back as it was<br />
It would be highly appreciated if you could help me.</p>

            <p>Thank you so much indeed for your reply</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way I was having MiniTool<font>®</font> Partition Wizard both installation and secure CD; however, the data recovery and lost partition recovery are not activated in the free edition. Only the copy and spilte drive are avialable<br />
<br />
Note: I didn't proceed anything since my drive has been unllocated because I have been shacking from what heppened. I was quite sure that I didn't do anything made this happened.<br />
<br />
I was using Mini data recovery Wizard before I faced this problem. There were about five options:<br />
<br />
1- Recovery deleted item,<br />
2- Recovery lost partition<br />
3- Recovery formated, and deleted partition<br />
4- Recovery media<br />
5- Recovery optical drivers<br />
However, when I tried running 'Recovery lost partition' and 'Recovery formated, and deleted partition'<br />
<br />
I didn't see any benefit from these at all.<br />
All the datas recovered were corrupted, although the program took about 3 hours on the entire disk whose space is (700GB), and took about 2 hours on a partition whose space is 600 GB.<br />
I want my external hard drive to be fixed and returned as it was (all folders, and subfolders and files inside them with the same names and organization)<br />
<br />
This is a very, very imporatant drive for me, so I don't want to do anything which can result in lost all the data stored on my hard dirve. So could you please help me with a remote help?<br />
Do you think that my hard drive can be returned back as it was?<br />
<br />
I am ready to do anything to let my drive return back as it was, could you possibly help me with this issue?<br />
<br />
I would quite highly appreciate your help. </p>

<p>This is the picture of Mini partition wizard, after clicking on partition recovery wizard,</p>
<p>Then this wizard showed me</p>
<p>If I successed recovering my unllocated drive, where should I recover the result?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How much time do you think it will be taking to recover all the datas stored on the drive?</p>
<p>Do you think that my hard drive can be returned back as it was?</p>

            <p>If the wizard is sucessfull then the "Unallocated" space will change to one or more partitions (depending on how many partitions were on the drive to begin with). The recovered partition(s) should then be assigned drive letters and Windows Explorer should
 display the contents (Files and Folders).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time to recover is unknown, bigger the drive the longer it will take. If you are using a USB cable to connect to the drive it will be by far slower.</p>

            <p>BTY: One of the things the wizard will try to find is a valid Master Boot Record (MBR). If thats still in tack then you may just be in luck.</p>

            Yes, it will take time for you get used to Windows 10 default Skype client. But yes, all in all, this client is a mini version of old Skype. This new Skype will not launch automatically at startup unless you make it part of Startup of Windows.
<br />
<br />If you want old Skype which is called Classic Skype, you can download and install from below. Both new client and this client will co-exist together.

<h2>            No Audio on Installing Windows 10 on my MacBook pro&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greeting to all of you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently installed Windows 10 on my Macbook pro (Mid 2012 version) and everything works fine except the Audio. Basically as far as my limited knowledge goes in this, when you install a Windows 10 on your Mac using BootCamp (BC), it installs all the drivers
 on your Windows on the first boot and it did. But I am unable to hear any audio. Attaching some of the Screenshot for more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried installing Realtek Audio drivers (tried with various versions) but after installing it, I get the Yellow Triangle error on the device manager on the Realtek driver. Does anyone has any workaround for this? its really so frustrating and I have
 literally watched hours os YouTube tutorials and dozens of articles and tried many combinations to resolve the issue but none seems to be working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would woulf be really appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Hi Suraj, 
<br />
<br />Depending on the MacBook you have, it only supports up to a certain version of Windows... the 2012 version may be a bit older to be support Win 10... but I’m not positive. 
<br />
<br />I know bootcamp can also be updated, <a href="https://support.apple.com/downloads/boot-camp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.apple.com/downloads/boot-camp</a>
<br />
<br />Note: This is a non-Microsoft website. The page appears to be providing accurate, safe information. Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br />And this updates the driver sets for windows. Please not, if you install an updated bootcamp DMG, you may lose your win install, so if you don’t have the media to install again, I’d punt on that for now. 
<br />
<br />Within windows, we can try a few things: 
<br />
<br />Let's click start, and type troubleshoot, and then launch the troubleshooter. Select "playing audio" and see if windows can fix the problem. 
<br />
<br />Right click on the volume icon on the taskbar, and look at your options. You should have volume mixer, and about 3/4 others. Go into these, and make sure none are disabled or muted. 
<br />
<br />Click start - settings - windows &amp; updates - Windows Updates - Let’s see if there are any pending updates that can be installed. If so, install those and we’ll check the audio again. 
<br />
<br />Give these a shot, and let me know!
<br />- C
