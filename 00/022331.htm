<h2>            Duplicate emails &#43; Microsoft the Ryanair of the IT industry</h2>
                    <p>All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a mix of question to the community and complain...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pay for Office 365 and Outlook is part of the package. When I decided for the Microsoft ecosystem I wanted decided also to use only one platform to manage all my email accounts (hotmail, gmail, yahoo, etc). I configured all the IMAP accounts and all was
 working properly. However, a couple of months ago I started receiving all my yahoo emails duplicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked for a solution on-line but I was not able to find anything. A couple of days ago I contacted Microsoft tech support via chat. One technician took control of my computer and played with the configuration. After more than one hour she told me that
 the problem was solved. However, it was not &nbsp;(case nr, 1332329668). I contacted today the tech suport again and a technician took control of my computer and run a some tests. After some time he told me (case nr.
<span>1332292425)</span>:</p>
<span>1332292425)</span>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>I have checked your account here and it seems to be that the problem that you are getting right now in your account is due to a connection problem between the yahoo server and our Microsoft server" ... "</span><span>It might be that this issue is
 due to some settings and configurations that we have in your yahoo account or really an account issue in your Hotmail account. In our case right now, the best thing that we can do is to run Advance Troubleshooting here in your yahoo and Hotmail account for
 us to know what is really happening and the best option that we have right now for this one is our<strong> Premium Software Support</strong>".... "</span><span>To give you the idea, Our Premium Support Service is only 65GBP (one time payment - pay per incident
 base) and that will grant me the power to run ADVANCE SCAN your yahoo and hotmail account to have a better view on the issue and it is a GUARANTEED FIX"... "</span><span>Based on the scan that we have ran in your accounts earlier, the problem that we have
 right now is the connection between your yahoo account and Hotmail account. This is actually not the first time that we have encountered this problem"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Bottom line... Microsoft knows about the problem... knows how to solve it... but will not do it unless I pay GBP65</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is there anybody in the forum that can help (without asking me money for it?</span></p>
<p>

            <p>Ok. Thxs for your answer</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I am using Outlook 2016 but I don not believe it is linked with the software installed in my computer as the same is happening with the online version Outlook.com</li><li>The previous support sent me to this discussion http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/livemail-email/duplicated-yahoo-e-mails-in-hotmailcom/cbf8ed01-ba5b-405d-878e-65be41c62459?auth=1</li><li>The issue is only for inbox folder and only for yahoo emails</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In the mean time, I did two things that seams to have solved the problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>I went to Yahoo help (https://help.yahoo.com/kb/mail-for-desktop) =&gt; contact us =&gt; sending and receiving messages =&gt; My issue does not appear in the list =&gt; Yahoo Mail Quick Fix</li><li>Went to Yahoo mail config =&gt; accounts =&gt; click on my yahoo account =&gt; Access to your Yahoo mail from anywhere =&gt; Here I changed to POP and saved and then changed again to "forward", verified my Hotmail email and saved</li></ol>
<p>For the time being looks like it is&nbsp;solved...</p>

<p>
</p><p>I checked through the Outlook.com setup of my Hotmail account and when a "send/receive" external email is added it&nbsp;can be done only via POP. I was not able to find the way to config IMAP.</p>

            <p>Ok</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe now I got it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally I had added my yahoo account to my Outlook.com account (Hotmail) and, at the same time, I was forwarding the emails from my yahoo account to my Hotmail account. Result = duplicate emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I stop forwarding emails from Yahoo to Hotmail and have only the Yahoo account added to my Hotmail account. Hope this solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have a some questions. </p>
<ol>
<li>Adding the account to outlook.com has the advantage that I can send emails from outlook using my Yahoo account. However, it seams that in Outlook.com only POP account can be configured. As&nbsp;a result, POP is not as efficient and IMAP. Among other sync problems
 there is&nbsp;quite a big delay&nbsp;to receive the messages.&nbsp;Is&nbsp;it possible to add an IMAP account to Outlook.com? When I do "add account" I only see the field to fill the POP info and no IMAP.</li><li>The alternative config would be to delete the Yahoo account from the Outlook.com config and to forward the emails from Yahoo to my Hotmail account. This way the emails arrive immediately but I would not be able to send Yahoo emails using Outlook.com platform.</li></ol>
<p>Any ideas? Any suggestion for a better configuration?</p>

<h2>            Outlook IMAP Folder View - Keep Settings</h2>
                    <p>How do I save the Outlook 2016 folder view settings for IMAP boxes so that they "stick"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The view that I want is the same as the other ones: List on the left, preview on the right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was this way by default until one day when it decided to switch this to "one line view" and remove the Preview pane by itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed the settings to put the view back the way it was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However this change only holds for a day or so, and then the view switches again by itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what triggers it; this does seem to coincide with the arrival of a new email in that mailbox. When you click on "Inbox" to read it, Outlook takes it upon itself to change the view settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried changing the settings, exiting and then restarting Outlook but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem only affects an IMAP box which is the topmost one in the tree on the left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Please help, Microsoft Print to PDF is creating an unreadable file</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using <strong>Windows 10 </strong>on a <strong>PC</strong>. In <strong>Microsoft Word</strong>, I will use
<strong>Microsoft Print to PDF </strong>to make a PDF file from a word document. The
<strong>PDF </strong>file is created by it is <strong>unreadable</strong>. It does not open in
<strong>Adobe Reader </strong>or <strong>Sumatra Reader</strong>. Has anyone encountered a solution, maybe by installing a driver? I purchased the
<strong>Windows 10 </strong>operating system USB for $170.00 CAD, so I was wondering if there is anything I can do to make PDF printing work. I checked on
<strong>MSDN </strong>and I could not file a download, and I ran all the windows troubleshooters and it did not detect a registry error. Can anyone help me so I can print PDF's using the built in Windows 10 feature?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

<p>I have had similar problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you try using "Microsoft Print to PDF" driver, then you get print dialog box with both Instance and Occurence unchecked, and it will not print all your pages.<br />
</p>
<p>I would try another PDF print driver:&nbsp; works with "Primo PDF", "Foxit Reader PDF Printer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>or the&nbsp; "Microsoft XPS Document Writer", but this is Microsofts answer to pdf, but is NOT pdf.</p>

            <p>Hi Andria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for offering your help. Here are the answers to your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>I&nbsp;access Outlook.com&nbsp;through a Web Browser.&nbsp; I use both Firefox and Microsoft Edge.</span></li><li>Yes, this happens when on any computer and on both browsers.</li><li><span>Have been experiencing this problem for at least 1 month now.</span></li><li><span>And I have cleared&nbsp;both&nbsp;</span>browser’s cache and temporary internet files many times.</li></ol>
<p>To clarify the problem, the 'Empty Folder' function&nbsp;works when using it to empty all&nbsp;other folders, just not when&nbsp;emptying&nbsp;the 'Deleted Items' folder.&nbsp; When in the 'Deleted Items' folder and I hit the 'Empty Folder' button, all the emails disappear temporarily,
 but when I return to another folder and then return back to the Deleted Items folder, all the same emails are&nbsp;still&nbsp;there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if&nbsp;I use the 'Select All Items In View' button to select the&nbsp;6 or so emails in view, then hit the 'Delete' button, that works to remove them permanently.&nbsp;But that way only removes 6 or so emails at a time. I wish the 'Select All Items In View' button
 would be returned to the 'Select All' button as it once was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also,&nbsp;if there was a 'Select All' button in the 'Recover Deleted Items' section that would be great too! As it is now there is no way to select all the emails for purge.&nbsp;We have to check the box beside&nbsp;each&nbsp;email. This is way too painful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope you can help me out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Kris</p>

    <title>Powerpoint programming possibilities - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abenterprises  say:</h3>
<h2>            Powerpoint programming possibilities</h2>
                    <p>With PowerPoint 2003 I saved for the Web and it created HTML pages.&nbsp; I noticed that there was a JavaScript file linked with many subroutines for programmatically processing coding.&nbsp; So I bought a book which said that&nbsp;2003 was the only PPT version that did
 that and now only VBA allows programming, but that only PowerPoint itself can run the code which means that PowerPointViewer won't run the script either.&nbsp; So if you want people on the Internet to run the VBA script from your site it is unrealistic to expect
 them to have PowerPoint installed to run the VBA.&nbsp; Version 2003 had a good idea, but I don't want to be buying books just to find out what can and can't be done.&nbsp; It would be nice to use the JavaScript that PPT2003 started using, but I guess the only solution
 is to use the MPEG or WMV files created for the Internet without ever being able to use programming meaningfully because you can't expect people over the Internet to have PowerPoint installed to utilize the VBA in it (Is VBA equivalent to VBScript?).&nbsp; Thanks
 for the help.</p>

            <p>PowerPoint, through version 2007, used JavaScript in the HTML it created so that it could preserve or duplicate as much of the native PPT functionality as possible (HTML alone doesn't take you very far in that direction).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are third-party add-ins and programs that convert PowerPoint to HTML in various ways, even from later versions of PPT that don't any longer allow saving as HTML directly. &nbsp;Perhaps one of those might give you the flexibility to create HTML then edit
 the resulting HTML to add your own Javascript programming to the mix. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one, <a href="http://www.pptools.com/ppt2html/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PPTools PPT2HTML</a>&nbsp;that's pretty flexible in this regard; &nbsp;the free demo doesn't expire and is fully functional. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>VBA is not exactly like VBScript is not exactly like VB is not exactly like VB.NET but there are quite a few similarities. &nbsp;Knowing any one of the first three would give you a start on the other two. &nbsp;VB.NET's a different animal. &nbsp;And for that matter you
 can include VBScript in HTML as well (though it's not going to be as widely supported by browsers as Javascript is.)</p>

<p>Hi Ewencameron1,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Outlook 2011 for Mac doesn't support TLS 1.2 and we have ended support for Office 2011 for Mac as of Oct, 2017. It's recommended to upgrade to Office 2016 for Mac to work with mailboxes which require
 TLS 1.2, get full support and latest security updates. Please check this following article for how to upgrade to Office 2016 for Mac:

    <title>When adding a network location, the HTTP&#58;&#47;&#47; address is not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michellelange  say:</h3>
<h2>            When adding a network location, the HTTP&#58;&#47;&#47; address is not accepted. </h2>
                    I have a website I created using Publisher 2003 on a Windows XP platform. I got a new computer with Publisher 2007 and Windows 7. I cannot publish to the web. The problem seems to be that I need to create a network location. I can get to the add a network
 location area, but when I enter a http address, it says "the folder you entered does not appear to be valid". I have searched and searched for answers and found others with the same question, but no answer. My ISP couldn't help me. Any help is greatly appreciated.

    <title>Transfering &#47; Synchronizing Calendar Entries from Device Storage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfering &#47; Synchronizing Calendar Entries from Device Storage to Memory Card Storage</h2>
                    I have the original Moto Q (WM5) with the latest and greatest firmware.<br />
<br />
After using the device for 1.5 years, I now have 400+ contacts and 4,000+ calendar entries.<br />
I do NOT use the Q for email and do not synchronize email.<br />
I synch my contacts and calendar with Outlook 2003 at home with ActiveSync 4.5.<br />
I synch my calendar with Lotus Notes 6.5 with Intellisync 5.5 + ActiveSync 4.5 at work.<br />
I have no synchronization issues.<br />
I have not exhausted the memory on the device.<br />
Device storage is 24.88MB used, 27.64MB free.<br />
Ram storage is 51.62MB used, 14.50MB free.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">The problem:</span><br />
Accessing the calendar or performing any operation on my Q now takes 40-60 seconds.
<br />
Navigating to a different day, switching from week view to month view, adding&nbsp; anew entry takes the same amount of time.<br />
This is unacceptably slow for the work I do day to day.<br />
<br />
After doing a master reset and resynching my calendar entries and contacts (no additional apps either) and getting the same results, verizon said that the amount of calendar entries I have is impacting performance. (even though officially they say you can have
 as many contacts+calendar entries as the storage in the device will allow). that just plain sucks. Purchasing the new q9m may improve things, but I'm a year away from being eligible for upgrade.<br />
<br />
I purchased a 2GB minisd card yesterday with the intent of moving the calendar and contacts OFF the internal memory and onto the card, to free up space on the device so that the performance would be better.<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">The question is: HOW do I tranfer &amp; sync to the storage card?????</span><br />
The microsoft knowledgebase provides no answers. Motorola call center was clueless.<br />
It seems all you can do is put media files (music/video/pics) to the card!!!<br />
<br />
This was a function I could easily perform on my old Apple Newton &amp; Palm Pilot.<br />
Why is it so difficult in Windows Mobile 5?<br />
Has it changed in Windows Mobile 6?<br />
<br />
I just want my contacts and calendar synched to the card in the device, NOT the internal memory.<br />
Is this a windows mobile thing? or an activesync configuration?<br />
Where do I go under "explore my smartphone" to find the database of calendar and contacts?
<br />
Can I just move them?<br />
<br />
PLEASE HELP!!!<br />

            it is not possible to move outlook data to the storage card. this is by design. your device seems to have a fairly satisfactory amount of free memory. i might be tempted to say that i agree with your mobile operator. this happening to the calendar only?
 You might want to do some cleanup in your calendar. Try a tool like SK Tools lite to remove uneeded files on your device. SK Tools is free.

            Yes, the performance issues are only noticeable in calendar launching/navigation/entry.<br />
<br />
SK Tools comes in several flavors: SK Tools, SK Tools Standard, and SK Tools Lite.<br />
For others who are interested, the company home page is http://s-k-tools.com/<br />
<br />
By "cleanup" do you mean delete entries?<br />
My goal is to keep my calendar entries as long as I have space for them. (BTW: what happens when you exhaust the device memory? Will activesync just not synch the old calendar entries?)<br />
<br />
In any event, I downloaded SK Tools Lite, because this flavor was the only free one.<br />
There is a utility called "Clean!" under SKTools, and "Auto Clean!".<br />
Checked the company site for documentation, but there was little.<br />
<br />
I ran "FreeUP RAM" (which restarted my device) and "Auto Clean!".<br />
Calendar performance has not improved at all.<br />
<br />
"Clean!" states: "Find and delete temporary and obsolete files, bad registry keys and more"<br />
Running it provides a list of things that it says I should delete.<br />
<br />
I deleted them too (but I was very nervous that some of my messages or calendar entries were getting deleted &gt; this was a big leap of trust to you, Mr. Linley).<br />
<br />
My calendar performance is still poor.<br />
<br />
I am curious if performance would be better in the Q9m with WM6, but the only way to test is to temporarily use the phone and put my 4,000+ cal entries on it. Perhaps someone out there with this scenario can let us know.<br />
Let's hope microsoft changes this "design" in future versions to allow the customer to store personal data on memory cards and not the phone itself.<br />
<br />
If you have further suggestions, let me know.<br />

            I don't have any more suggestions. One thing you can try is to move some Calendar items to a subfolder on your PC and sync. Since Activesync does not support subfolders, those items that you moved will be removed on the device. All you need is to keep
 a record of your items. Does it necessarily have to be on the device.?

<p>I have a new Motorola q 9m and synchronization performance is terrible. I synch only my contacts (1800) and Calendar with my home and my office machine. Each time I switch machines the synch time is over an hour.
 If I resynch to the machine I last synched with it only takes a few minutes (longer than it used to take with Palm Pilot but not terrible). However when I go to the other machine, ActiveSync thinks it is a brand new machine and does a 1 hour synch.
<br />
<br />
Watching the Task manager, I see that the first 5,000 I/Os go very fast. Then everything comes to a grinding slowdown, and it does a few I/Os per minute.

<p>drr, do you have a lot of calendar entries that are re-occuring?&nbsp; If so, do they have end dates?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the case, you need to change them so they DO have an endate.&nbsp; If fact those that might have NO end date will write entries for 400 years.&nbsp; That is a lot of appointments to remember and the fact is, we will all be dead and buried long
 before they end ... lol</p>

            No, you cant limit it by category - you need to set the private flag on events you dont want to share or move them to a new calendar. 
<br />
<br />Are you using outlook installed on your desktop? If yes, you can set the private flag in bulk. If you are only using outlook on the web, you need to set it one by one.

<p>

<p>
</p><p>#1 - Were the examples shown in the screenshots from the "same computer"?</p>
<p>#2 - Does the "strange data" actually exist in the CSV file when looked at via a text editor?</p>
<p>#3 - Ignoring the strange &lt;Next&gt; display - does the data import correctly or are the newly created contacts equally messed up.</p>

</p><p>Regional settings didn't yield anythng. Would love to email you one of my CSV's for you to get a closer look. Each file was generated by taking a single excel workbook sheet and "Save As" a .csv file. The strange data appears to be part of the contact's
 email address (characters prior to the @) and followed by unknown letters/numbers that I do not see anywhere else in the CSV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The CSV files used are the same exact files used in the past on this laptop without issue. Again, issue was discovered after this laptop hard drive was replaced under warranty. &nbsp;I noticed the problem when generating a new CSV file off my large excel contacts
 list....then after discovering the issue I tried to import many of my old CSV files that worked flawlessly in the past, and these all consistently showed the same issue. &nbsp;I've also repaired/reinstalled office 365 twice to no avail.... Issue persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of the screen shots I showed, all were on my laptop in O2013 on my laptop, except for the last two which were O2010 and on a different laptop. That was also the same file and showed the proper data after hitting "Next&gt;".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I import everything looks normal in the contact ID's.......but when I used the macros for first name, last name, etc in my "Send Personally" add-in, the strange data mentioned gets placed into the generated email. This problem occurs with macros for first
 name, middle name, last name,....and the data placed into the emails for each different macro are all the same (email name characters prior to the @, followed by random looking characters).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything worked fine with these same CSV files, Office 365/O'2013, and same laptop prior to the hard drive replacement. I've also uninstalled/reinstalled the "Send Personally" add-in, made by Mapilabs. I also have Mapilabs techs working to recreate the
 issue in their lab from my files.</p>

<p>
</p><p>So just to recap all of this - the data imports correctly (as in correctly = everything shows properly in the contact detail screen or more specifically "First Name"&nbsp;/ "Last Name" / Email Address etc &nbsp;= the correct value etc etc) but something is getting
 messed up with the MapiLabs macro - does that sum it up correctly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does&nbsp; - then the issue is with the MapiLabs addin and the ball is probably in their court. However, would be curious to see if&nbsp;this file will replicate the same issue as displayed in your screenshots (send it to &lt;karl @ claxton . com&gt; - identify that
 your msg is in response to this thread including the thread URL just for sake of easier future reference).

            <p>emailed. here's the body for other viewers sake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>......I've attached two CSV files, Event Test and Event Test 2. Both are renamed copies of CSV files that I have used earlier this year on my system (before the hard drive died and was replaced). Both of these CSV's worked
 perfect when mapped.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again the contacts appear to be normal when I look at their individual ID's in my outlook contacts folder (post import)....but the macro's used by the program are displaying the strange info that i showed in the screen
 shots. What gets me is prior to even getting to the add-in, the problem is visible at the custom mapping when you hit "Next". At that point in the process, the add-in isn't being used. The problem even persisted when I uninstalled the add-in and attempted
 to import while it was uninstalled.</p>

            <p>In the same spirit that Jay included his message to me in the last post - here are the quick summary results I returned to him
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-------------------------------------------</p>
<p>From a real quick first glance doing some basic tests – the results are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;Issue replicated on O’2013 but with anomalies – results not entirely the same if I remove the blank field column headers and re-save the file
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;Not an O/S related issue – strange things appear on both Win7/8/8.1 (click2run &amp; .msi installs)<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;Not a question of it being related to the addin since don’t have any installed on the test systems being used (OutlookSpy excepted)<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;Same results as you with O’2010 – the &lt;Next&gt; screen displays correctly during the Mapping segment<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;Not a problem with the CSV file from initial review checking the file at the byte hex level AND can replicate the same issue with any other text file so it’s not “data related” in the conventional sense<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;All the data imports fine as far as contact items (at least from appearances and Outlook treats the data normally) so this could simply be something related to a buffer over-run in O’2013 when cycling through the data file in the mapping phase – to be
 honest, not something I generally do in the normal course of things unless something strange like this comes up nor would most people so not likely to be an issue that would really be noticed. The more puzzling question is why the same &lt;garbage&gt; data isn’t
 displayed all the time and why it seems to start with data after the “@” sign in an email address. Whatever is tripping it up at that point seems to be affecting everything else going forward.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;Used one of the ContactGenie programs to export the imported data with no issues so retrieving the Outlook data didn’t present any problems but unlike MapiLabs – CG programs aren’t Outlook addins which may have some bearing on things (but do access Outlook
<p>
</p><p>On the surface, it appears that the common item between the MapiLabs addin and the Outlook mapping process – specifically as it relates to how data appears in the left hand window when moved via the &lt;Previous&gt;&lt;Next&gt; buttons – is how the data is being accessed.
 Otherwise everything else appears to function normally with no impact on the underlying Outlook data. If the only issue is how the data is being displayed by Outlook via the &lt;Previous&gt;/&lt;Next&gt; process – doubt that anyone is going to look at this as any kind
 of serious problem. If it’s impacting MapiLabs programs – they are the ones that are going to have to open up a support case with MS to track things down and get a resolution (or create a work-around for their code).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side issue, would also suggest that you either add column names or eliminate those columns that don’t have a column header. Both of the files sent had columns with no column names – the first had one missing column header near the end and the second
 file with several blank columns at the end.</p>

<p>First step is to isolate the various elements - based on the follow-up info provided after my last response, , there are far too many &lt;inconsistencies&gt; (for lack of a better word) on a bunch of different levels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, recapping my previous reply - two things&nbsp;that can definitely be confirmed based on tests&nbsp;on&nbsp;5 different systems (2 physical - 3 VMs)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 - The &lt;Previous&gt; &lt;Next&gt; issue is easily replicated which &lt;might&gt; be something from a recent update to O'2013 (the systems used were already all fully updated prior to the test). However, that may or may not be a simple display issue
</p>
<p>WHICH </p>
<p>#2 -&nbsp;Doesn't impact the import itself&nbsp;- that&nbsp;works just fine as long as the import is done when the header fields are displayed in the &lt;From&gt; list in the field mapping process (at least it did every time I did it)</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said, once the data has been correctly imported then the question of&nbsp;why the MapiLabs addin is not picking up the correct info is a completely separate issue - something is missing in this picture so hard to say what the core problem is at this
 point. A little puzzled why no one else involved indicated they were unable to replicate anything from the info you provided.

<p>A quick update - the display issue related when using the&nbsp;&lt;Previous&gt;&lt;Next&gt; buttons has also been confirmed to exist at least as far back to O'2013 SP1 beta (dating it back to sometime very late 2013) so unless your version of Office wasn't updated at all
 during all of 2014 before your HD failed - there are other things at play as related to&nbsp;your real core problem - that the Mapilab addin isn't functioning as expected. As mentioned already - that needs to be addressed by the MapiLab folks regardless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the Outlook issue itself&nbsp;is concerned - will get reported accordingly but in all honesty - at this point &lt;appears&gt; to be more of a visual problem&nbsp;than a functional one in terms of the actual importing of data.</p>

            If the messages aren't being delivered at all (not in Inbox, Junk Email, or other folder), that's a problem the lottery sender will need to resolve by contacting Microsoft. There's nothing you can do about it.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was very busy and couldn't reply - Sorry about that.</p>
<p>As for the problem the only solution that worked was using the Host File</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">A short summery : </span></p>
<p>After trying everything , we pinged in CMD the autodiscover.outlook.com address and entered the IP which</p>
<p>was received into the host file and marked with # the IP which was there already.<br />
It worked and we were able to perform the Autodiscover to 365.</p>
<p>We have a second migration coming up to the main Domain and we hope that by that all these problems will end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must note that this method should be used only as the last resort after checking updates, DNS etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps others as well who are having the same problem.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<h2>            Duplicate Contacts.. which ones to delete&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've owned a windows phones since w7.. and I have recently got a 950 with w10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a same issue when I went from w7 phone to a w8 phone with duplicate contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would start up my windows phone and select my previous restore file, then in the 'people' page on my hotmail account it will show duplicate 'outlook' on all contacts as they were linked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i would go through each contact and unlink and delete one..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then some of my text message threads would start a new thread instead of using the old back up thread(making text msg backup absoulety pointless, might as well start a fresh).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone tell me why there is two? How I can tell which is for my phone so I delete the correct one? or should I just leave them linked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm starting to think outlook/hotmail has its own contact and Windows phone has its own contact and instead of being merged they're duplicated and linked??&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I better off restoring all my contacts relinking them and live with 2 oulook accounts per contacts is this how its been designed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any info would be appreaciated!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I only use 1 main hotmail account for contactss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under 'email, calendar and contacts' on my lumia 950 I have my 1. main hotmail.com account where all my contacts are from and 2. work email address which I sync my calendar too but not contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under 'accounts used by other apps' I have 3 accounts 1. main hotmail.com 2.work email 3. Facebook but it uses same as my main hotmail.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into 'People' and went to ... &gt; settings and even in there its only showing 1 account (main hotmail.com)</p>
<br />
<p>cheers for the link, I'm aware/have used the cleanup contacts feature before.</p>
<p>
I'm wondering would it duplicate contacts if 2 phones were on at same time using the same account? i.e. my new phone and my old phone? I'm defintely only using 1 account.<br />

            <p>Two phones using the same account receive the same contacts. Either can edit but that would not cause duplicates.</p>

            <p>Yes I can see the duplicates, I have already gone through each one and deleted the extra contact (for the second time! I've upgraded phones).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem occurs after the clear out. When someone txt's me, 50% of the time it creates a new thread instead of using the same thread from the backup. It seems like there is a link between the phones text messages and people in contacts (..not just the
 name). </p>
<p>
</p><p>As both contacts look identical as both show as 'outlook' its 50/50 as to which the txt thread may be using.. This is why i was wondering if there was a way to figuring out which was which. The text message history must look out for the same contact name
 or something to marry up the contact after they have been restored..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify there should only be 1 'outlook' contact, which shares the same data between phone and email etc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if there is bug in my contacts.. I've been using wp since their first release and alot has changed since then so I'm wondering if its some sort of legacy bug in my account. I have a friend who's had practically same phones as me and also has
 950 and never had this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was a good job I exported my contacts before I started the upgrade, I think I'm going to clear contacts and re-import them.. then factory restore phone (start again basically) which is massive waste of my time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping I wouldnt have to go through this again as I did it on my last wp upgrade.

</p><p>What other option is there?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have many duplicate contacts as a reminder of when WP8.0 used to create duplicates of just about everything (songs, photos, contacts...) and eventually I had typically 3 or 6 linked identical copies of many contacts.&nbsp; If I add a detail to one of those
 contacts, only one of the copies will be updated.&nbsp; From time to time I do some weeding out, laboriously manually unlink and discard some, but then I found, after updating to W10M, that some of those I'd recently reduced to a single contact just disappeared.&nbsp;
 (To my relief it turned out to be possible to get them back by going to people.live.com and recovering recently deleted contacts.)</p>

            <p>Thanks but that isn't quite what I meant.<br />
</p>
<p>In <em>Clean Up Contacts</em> I can link duplicated pairs of contacts together.&nbsp; (The few I have are mostly where one copy has a truncated name - as best I remember that was names imported on a SIM from an old phone which truncated them).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The duplication I meant is that each contact in my phone is <em>already</em> several identical copies linked together.&nbsp; Mostly marked
<em>Hotmail</em> but some also have one marked <em>Skype</em>.&nbsp; Since I've never used Skype that leaves me a little more confused.&nbsp; Each time I've updated any details for a person, then one of their profile copies will have that new info, but I can't tell which
 one unless I unlink them all and browse each one separately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I want to remove an outdated phone number or company email for a contact I have to edit or delete all of their copies with that info in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process of examining what information's actually in each of these profile copies is extremely tedious.&nbsp; There must surely be a simple way of displaying all of the information, but I just havent found it.</p>

<p>
Clean up duplicate contacts at&nbsp;<a href="https://people.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://people.live.com</a>
</p><p>You can combine duplicate contacts into a single one with all the contact info.</p>
<div>
<div>
Use “Clean up contacts”
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In People, click <span>Manage</span>, then click <span>
Clean up contacts</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Within each contact set, clear the check box for any contact you don’t want in the set.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Repeat step 2 for all contact sets, and then click <span>
Clean up</span>.</p>
</li></ol>
<div>
<div>
Search and combine manually
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the People search field, type the name of the contact you’re looking for.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the search result, select the contacts you want to combine, and then click
<span>Link</span>.</p>
</li></ol>
<div>
<div>
Undo a combined contact
<p>When a new combined contact is created, the original duplicate contacts are then deleted. If you accidentally combine two or more contacts that are actually different people, here’s how to restore them.</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In People, click <span>Manage</span>, and then <span>
Restore deleted contacts</span>.</p>

            <p>Thanks again.&nbsp; I had already followed the link you gave but got stuck due to my misunderstanding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On people.live.com I can pick a contact and that shows me their name, contact details and the number of linked profiles.&nbsp; Clicking on the Links tab opens a pane showing me (typically) 3 Outlook profiles for the same person, with an X beside each which
<em>I presumed</em> deletes them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>That's where I got stuck because there's no indication on screen of what information each profile contains, so there was no way to choose which ones to delete.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My mistake.&nbsp; The X in fact turns out just to unlink them (I experimented with a contact I didn't mind losing).&nbsp; It would certainly have helped if hovering over the X had given an indication of what it really did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I can work through the manual weeding out process on my computer which is at least a bit less tedious than doing it on my phone.</p>

<h2>            Formula Array Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi There, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a array formula that I am trying to put into VBA so that 100+ users aren't individually putting it in themselves and therefore saving time.&nbsp; However, I am getting the Error 1004: Unable to set FormulaArray property of the range class.&nbsp; Assume this
 is down to being over the 255 character limit.&nbsp; Any idea how I can get this perhaps simplified so array would work in VBA?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Range("R4").Select<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Selection.FormulaArray = _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "=IF(RC[-3]=""Year"",DATE(YEAR(RC[-4])+1,MONTH(RC[-4]),DAY(RC[-4])-1),IF(RC[-3]=""Semi Annual"",DATE(YEAR(RC[-4]),MONTH(RC[-4])+6,DAY(RC[-4])-1),IF(RC[-3]=""Modern English Quarter"",MIN(IF(RC[-4]&lt;=Sheet1!R1C2:R8C2,Sheet1!R1C2:R8C2,DATE(9999,12,31))),IF(RC[-3]=""4

<p>
</p><p>Overview, basically calculating based on the Frequency (O4) the end date from whatever date is in column N4.&nbsp; If Frequency is 4 month or Modern English Quarter then it looks at columns A or B in Sheet 1 to calculate the date as that has the set end dates
 for each frequency.</p>

<h3> odin99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Confusing behavior with F6 used on a folder&#39;s messages</h2>
                    I often use F6 to read a message in the reading pane. I've found that even if there's intervening activity the focus will remain on the reading pane--but not always, even though the row of the F6'd message is still colored gray. And sometimes pressing
 Shift+F6 will change the focus, but again not always. What are the rules regarding the persistence of the F6 focus and the use of Shift+F6?

<p>Hi Odin99,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to reproduce your concern on my end then found out that <strong>F6</strong> and
<strong>Shift + F6</strong> works like <strong>Tab</strong> and <strong>Shift + Tab</strong>. I'd like to know if the issue wherein the focus changes happens when the intervening activity happens outside Outlook. If so, that is the normal behavior of the function.</p>

            Regile, I appreciate your interest but it's not practical for me to try to recall and reproduce now the various circumstances about which I'm inquiring--and even if I could, I don't know that they would cover all such circumstances that might arise. That's
 why I asked <em>you</em> for the rules governing the use of these shortcuts in such circumstances.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>By design, the focus when using F6 and Shift + F6 shouldn't change when the intervening activity is within Outlook; for example:
<strong>new mail</strong> or <strong>calendar reminder</strong>. However, if it's outside Outlook, that might affect the function. That's why it's important for us to identify when does the issue occur.</p>

<p>Hi Odin99,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main function of <strong>F6</strong> is to move between the <strong>Outlook</strong> window, the smaller panes in the
<strong>Folder</strong> pane,the <strong>Reading </strong>pane, and the sections in the
<strong>To-do</strong> bar, and show access keys in the <strong>Outlook </strong>
ribbon. If you are going to press<strong> Shift+F6</strong>, it will just alternate the process but it's almost the same function.</p>

            It's either a Microsoft or a Nokia Lumia phone and it would really help if you can actually provide also the exact model and OS version it is running on.

<h2>            Toolbar buttons working over fullscreen applications in windows 10 technical preview build 10130</h2>
                    In fullscreen applications like games, whenever the mouse is on top of the toolbar, the cursor changes to normal windows cursor and the button works (starts calender etc.). And the game exits fullscreen mode. This has been going on since I first installed
 windows 10.

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10 Technical Preview testing.<br />
<br />
1. Does the issue occur with any particular games or all the games?<br />
2. What will happen when you exit the game from full screen mode?<br />
<br />
The information is not sufficient to answer your question. Reply us with more information by answering the above questions.</span>

            I've only tried two games, and it happened with both. (GTA 5 and Sims 4), but with GTA I can just open the menu and move the mouse away from the toolbar. Since it's in first person I don't have to use a specific part of the screen.<br />
<br />
I didn't try the second one, do you mean playing the game in windowed mode? Since the game won't cover the toolbar, I won't have the same problem. When I click a place with a button, like the calender or start menu or the desktop preview button on the corner,
 the corresponding action happens.<br />
<br />
Also, I've tried it with media player classic in full screen. The button's don't work while the video is in fullscreen like it is expected.

            <p>lol, I don't remember anyone saying anything further about this from here. I think I later found out that windows update wasn't working, and I couldn't shut down wuaserv or something like that. After that, I contacted microsoft from the instant messaging
 platform that they have for windows support.<br />
<br />
I think what finally solved this problem was opening a new user account and then logging in from that. Windows update got fixed by that and the updates fixed the rest of the issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few months later I got another weird issue where some apps just wouldn't work, like the pictures or the calculator. For that I again contacted them from the chat and I ended up reinstalling Windows 10.</p>

    <title>How to add an email alias&#47;forwarding only email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thorned.rose  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to add an email alias&#47;forwarding only email</h2>
                    <p>I have been hammering away at this for several days now - it's seriously driving me nuts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am moving back to Outlook after using Postbox for several years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several forwarding emails that go to my main email mailbox. e.g. *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and *** Email address is removed for privacy *** both forward to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to be able to add one and two to Outlook so I can send emails with the from as those emails, not my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I know I can just add a From email address but if I do that, it results in a "on behalf of" hideousness.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Postbox this was super easy. Here's how you do it: <a href="http://support.postbox-inc.com/hc/en-us/articles/204403334-Identities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.postbox-inc.com/hc/en-us/articles/204403334-Identities</a></p>
<p>I can also set each of the forwarding emails to keep the sent emails in my main mailbox's Sent items (as well as drafts, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to follow this instructions here:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.arrowmail.co.uk/docs/fromaddsoutlook2013.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.arrowmail.co.uk/docs/fromaddsoutlook2013.pdf</a> to set up spoof POP accounts. However when
 I get to the part where I set the E-mail Delivery Location, my mail email only has the "Drafts (This computer only)" folder. There's no inbox showing for me to select. If I try to add an Inbox folder ("New Folder..."), it not surprisingly says the folder already
 exists.</p>
<p>Without being able to do this step, any emails sent from the forwarding/alias emails won't be saved to my main email's Sent folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e3442b5-74eb-4eb8-8231-af19deaa3355" /></p>
<p>As you can see from this picture. My main email is the top one (set up as IMAP) and the forwarding email is the bottom one set up as a 'spoof' POP email. None of the folders that exist in my main email are listed so I can't select "Inbox" as per page 7.<br />
</p>
<p>These are the folders that exist in my main email mailbox that aren't appearing.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fd14c46b-d1ff-4441-9b12-b4cde2707f79" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone either tell me how I can set up forwarding/alias emails properly in Outlook or help resolve the problem with the folders not showing up in the "New E-mail Delivery Location" box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>after 10 minutes of waiting for app manager to update, the only catalogues its updates are 4. maemo.org, 5. maemo extras and 6. maemo extras-testing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the other 5 wont update/refresh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the other all said "resolving host timed out" except for ovi 2, which sats 403 forbidden and an ip address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>can anyone tell me if my catalogue details are correct or if there is another problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i added a couple off catalgues today from this forum, ovi 2 and nokia system update 2, as they varied slightly to what i had already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>im not gonna bother with the second problem yet, will bring that up when this one is solved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>cheers!</p>

            i'm presuming you got it from them as well?<br />
is numbers 7 and 8 won't work and umbers 4 and 5 are the same not sure whats going on with 1, 2 and 3.<br />
<br />
i'd reccomend flashing your phone to the generic uk version (or the one to suit your region)<br />
it will void your vodafone warrenty but nokia's will still be valid.<br />
i flashed mine from vodafone and it works fine still

            You have some unnecessary duplicates.. you have the MR0 (global release) and 203 (UK Generic release) nokia update repositories.. that is bad..<br />
<br />
You also have the ovi repository for PR1.2..<br />
<br />
If you're using a vodafone handset (it'll be 2.2009.51-205.1 if you check the version in settings) many of the apps in the catalogues you've configured won't be usable on your phone..<br />
<br />
Vodafone haven't released PR1.2 (or PR1.1.1) for their handset so you're kind of stuck in the dark ages..<br />
<br />
That'll probably contribute more to the problems you're seeing than anything else.<br />

<p>the phone version ( settings/about product) 3.2010.02-8</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I entered all them catalogues as they all varied slightly so wanted to make sure i had everything covered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is&nbsp;there is a known problem with above software?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and yes, the phone was bought directly from vodafone ireland</p>

<p>your phone is running an older version of the firmware (pr1.1.1 i think). some of the repositories are locked to the newer firmware (pr1.2). to access them, you'll have to flash your device to generic uk pr1.2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@cpitchford - we should get a moderator to sticky one of your flashing guides, lol.</p>

            there's no problem as such but its outdated and vodafone won't get there fingers out and release pr1.2<br />
if you opt for the flashing option (i'd reccomend it) there are a few guides around and you'll get help here if you need it

<p>Last heads up from Vodafone was that they have approved PR1.2 and returned it to Nokia.</p>
<p>So, should be available via NSU within the next week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently it's a like for like of the generic 203 firmware, so God knows why they have p*ssed about with it for so long.</p>

<p>By no means do&nbsp;I know much about software and firmware, but what do yous think&nbsp;I should do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get the vodafone free software(flash phone) or stick to it and wait for their update?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Im assuming if&nbsp;I back the phone up before flashing its a waist of time as it will reinstal the vodafone software if&nbsp;I recover that backup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so&nbsp;I would need to backup things&nbsp;I want to keep like contacts, messages&nbsp;and pictures, while everything else isnt to much of a problem. Is it possible to back these up individually and recover them after the flash?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other problem&nbsp;I have with the phone which&nbsp;I didnt mention in the first post is that there is updates available for some of the apps&nbsp;I have already, but there is plugins missing and&nbsp;I cant get the updates.</p>
<p>Even some of the apps&nbsp;I dont have wont install as there is plugins missing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>cheers for all the input!!!</p>

<p>pictures and videos you can copy to a pc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>contacts you can go into the contacts section of the device, tap contacts at the top, export to file and just export it to a folder. then copy that folder to your pc. just reimport it after you flash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>messages - if you only flash the os.bin and leave the emmc data alone, you wont have to back this up.</p>
