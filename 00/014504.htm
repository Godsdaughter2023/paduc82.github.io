<p>Did a get-mailbox -publicfolder and found none</p>
<p>Tried Get-mailpublicfolder - nothing.</p>
<p>I tested by typing in a alias in another user and it was successful so if this address was a alias of some other person it would have found it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looked in Guest users and contacts found nothing.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I have a Word doc with a list of hyperlinks, such as:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)"><a href="https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/e/eagles/take_it_easy_tab.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 104, 207, 1)"><span>https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/e/eagles/take_it_easy_tab.htm</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; For off-line viewing, I'd like to see the contents of the links displayed in the same Word doc, just below where the actual links appear in the document. The result would look something like like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)"><a href="https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/e/eagles/take_it_easy_tab.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 104, 207, 1)"><span>https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/e/eagles/take_it_easy_tab.htm</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;

            If you use the template in which you created the styles as the basis for the document that you want to create by using File&gt;New and selecting that template, the document will inherit the styles that you created in the template so that they will be available

            <p>When you apply a style set, Word basically copies the styles into your document. Shortcut keys for styles are not included in the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have a template, add your styles to the template, assign shortcuts and then create your documents based on the template (as Doug suggested).</p>

<h2>            jpg image display problems in IE 10</h2>
                    IE 10 in both metro and standard views display some jpg images in web pages but not all jpg images. There is no red X box, just a blank space. The missing jpg images do show in firefox and IE 9.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi Daveneir,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the query in the Microsoft Community Forums and we are glad that you have chosen the Windows 8!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description, the Internet Explorer 10 does not display some JPG images in the websites and instead it shows a blank space with a Red X in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to have some additional information about this issue. I request you to reply with the answers to these questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>On which websites are you facing this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Have you made any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Did you install any third party security program on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue might be due to the security settings set in the Internet Explorer or it might be due&nbsp;to &nbsp;incompatibility issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Can't see pictures on websites in Internet Explorer</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 1: Reset Internet Explorer to its default security settings.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>A.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press “Windows Logo” + “R” and type “inetcpl.cpl” in the run command window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>B.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>In the “Internet Properties” window, click on the “Security” tab, click “Default Level”, and then click “OK”.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 2: Turn on Compatibility View</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a website doesn't display correctly in Internet Explorer for the desktop, using Compatibility View might help. If Internet Explorer recognizes a website that isn't compatible, you'll see the Compatibility View icon on the address bar. To turn on Compatibility
 View, click the “<b>Compatibility View</b>” button to the make the icon change from an outline to a solid color.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get the same problem when using IE 10 with windows 8 desktop/tablet mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One example is the website <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.google.com</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>only the search bar appears when I enter the website, the "google" image above the search bar is blank. No image showing at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another example is the website <a href="https://mobile.hkbea-cyberbanking.com/servlet/FRLogon?Lang=Eng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://mobile.hkbea-cyberbanking.com/servlet/FRLogon?Lang=Eng</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I would like to enter my ebanking system, the visual keyboard which suppose to be an image did not show up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have followed the instructions you have mentioned above e.g. deflaut security, clear history etc.. still does not work. My Java and flash player is installed, enabled and up-to-dated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help</p>

            <p>Well, as usual on this forum, help is usually found wanting. I have the same problem with a site. Some of the pictures show up and others do not.
</p>
<p>Firefox, Opera, Chrome all work flawlessly. IE10 does not only on this particular site, which is Foxnews.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Judging on the amount of time the last "please help" went forth on here, I'd expect help, but not really.

            <p>You can try editing the series formulas, the last number is the plot order.<br />
But if I were you, I'd just change the order in the Legend Entries window until you chart looks right.&nbsp; You should be able to see your chart change behind the Select Data Source window as you make changes.</p>
<p>Does that work?</p>

            Yep, somethings wrong here.<br />
<br />
Usually disconnecting from a fw update can be a risky operation and may cause your phone bricked. In this case, it looks like the install itself hasnt started yet.<br />
<br />
You will have to cancel it and disconnect the device. (On your own risk, but this can go on forever).<br />

            What you should do then is to make sure your computer is up to date.<br />
<br />
Restart you computer and download and install nokia software updater and try that one instead.<br />
Complete the install and reboot your pc once more.<br />
<br />
Turn now off firewall and antivirus and make sure there are no other running programs such as browser, Ovi suite etc.<br />
<br />
On your phone do this before connecting:<br />
Go to- menu-&gt;settings-&gt;connectivity-&gt;USB-&gt;usbconnection mode: set to Pc suite. and Ask on connection to no.<br />
<br />
Reboot your phone.<br />
<br />
open Nokia software updater on your pc and follow the steps (connect your phone etc...)<br />
<br />
Let me know if it works.

            Note: what you should try first before trying this is diall *#0000# on your phone and see if you can get it updated via fota (firmware over the air. Connect to wlan first).<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: There are no known absolute solution to this issue as I know about, so these steps might fix it or not.) I will do some more research...

<p>even&nbsp;I&nbsp;restored all original phone settings&nbsp;(factory settings)&nbsp;..&nbsp;&nbsp;,</p>
<p>still same :(&nbsp;.</p>

            Okey, I see. I wonder if this has something to to with the server it self or ovi suits/nsu's communication with the server.<br />
<br />
Try another pc, if not wait a day and try again. - And if not, a nokia care point would might be able to help you getting it updated.<br />
<br />
And you couldn't get it updated via FOTA?

            Is your antivirus NOD32? There is an issue with NOD32 that it causes the update to last forever.<br />

Would this apply to this issue if you have turned off the firewall or av?

            I am not sure on the NOD32 part, but for BitDefender, turning off the AV and firewall will not help, the NSU and Ovi Updater would still be stuck.

<p>That's nice to know. What about the downloading loop? - Cause I saw one posted here once on these boards who monitored the internet connection, and his pc was actually recieving data. - Not just looked like the download was stuck like Xbungle wrote...<br />
<br />
- If that user was right, he'd actually recieved about 2 gb of "something"...- I think this issue is wierd though.<br />
<br />
Nice finding if it's actually caused by some AV softwares.</p>

            Downloading loop? Isnt that what the OP in this thread was talking about? Not really sure. I've always used BitDefender, so I can vouch for it. Maybe when I need to get a new license for AV I start trying out trial versions of other brands LOL.<br />
<br />
Although it seems that when we encounter these problems we should ask what AV they are using and link them to the thread I posted earlier. What AV do you use anyway?

<h2>            I have two &#34;ThisPC&#34; icon on my desktop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I installed under VMware Workstation10. Went as a breeze from the 32-bit Eng ISO.</p>
<p>All my personal settings were correctly recreated upon launching.</p>
<p>My desktop felt naked so I right click and reached for the friendly "Personalize" option.</p>
<p>I clicked Change Desktop icons and, from the Desktop icon settings dialog, checked Computer, User's Files, Network. Recycle Bin is selected by default.</p>
<p>I clicked OK and the three corresponding icons were correctly summoned vertically to my desktop.</p>
<p>But, I got "two" ThisPC icon for the price of one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I'll just toss one of the two...</p>

            Only two? &nbsp;My PC generates another ThisPC icon about every five seconds. &nbsp;Refreshing the desktop gets rid of them but it just keeps on creating more and filling the desktop with them.

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your prompt reply, but I still haven't found the solution to my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Service status : everything ok</p>
<p>2) Have created a new alias.&nbsp; Thank you for telling me how to do so.&nbsp; Afterwards, on the first try the login with new alias/old password took me back to my microsoft account, but not to email access.&nbsp; Second try : same old error message I've been getting
 the last few days with my old alias.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes,</p>

            With this error you should use new alias for signing option.
<br />
<br />Check your signing using imprivate mode / incognito.
<br />
<br />Better to delete cache and cookies.

    <title>Internet Explorer security issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> no butter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet Explorer security issues</h2>
                    Apparently IE11 allows webpages to launch (clickonce?) applications with permissions to write to the appdata folder&nbsp;without user authorization. For example, the Chrome Canary install page (<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html</a>)&nbsp;(NOT
 the stable Chrome install page) pops up the installer when the "Accept and Install" button (on the webpage, not on any prompt)&nbsp;is clicked in IE11. This happens almost instantaneously, and no prompt is shown by ie11 throughout the entire process.&nbsp;(note that
 this does not happen in chrome or firefox). Note that the installer writes to the appdata folder. This can be a major security issue. Can anyone verify my findings? (I also tried this on a vm running the win10 tech preview, and the same thing happened)

            When you click to download it , it will be checked with SmartScreen filter and since it is safe, then it will run it but if you notice, in the next step , there is a security warning asking whether allow to run it or not, so it blocked the installer later
 on and ask you whether run it or not. It is good behavior because it protecting your security and it won't ask the same security question twice.

    <title>HOW TO AUTOPOPULATE A FIELD IN THE HEADER OF A WORD DOCUMENT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevengwilliams  say:</h3>
<h2>            HOW TO AUTOPOPULATE A FIELD IN THE HEADER OF A WORD DOCUMENT</h2>
                    <p>Several years ago, I figured out how to resolve a auto populate problem through this forum.&nbsp; I have since changed jobs and now need to figure it out again for Word documents.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Word form that is Protected with a password.&nbsp; We use the protected version so that those filling out this form cannot make any changes other than just filling in the blanks or checking the boxes.&nbsp; The form has a header in which the originator checks
 some boxes and fills in some text which indicates which incident number this document is for.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have instructed users to check the first box they need, push the Tab key to get to the next box or fillable field, they check that box or type in the appropriate text for the incident number, push the Tab key again to go to the next box, check the box,
 push Tab again, which takes them out of the Header and into the document body, then start filing out the rest of the form.&nbsp; They do not have to push the Tab key after leaving the Header on the first page.&nbsp; Each time the Tab key was pushed in the Header, it
 would auto populate the Header on the following pages with the same info as the Header on the first page of the document.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember having to make sure that the document was protected, for use but unprotected to design.&nbsp; I also remember having to use FormFields in the Header and writing a macro using Visual Basic so the info would auto populate in each Header.&nbsp; The problem
 is that I can't find those macros nor do I remember how to design the Header to accomplish what I want to do.&nbsp; Everything used to work great but now when I push Tab after typing in the incident number the information in the Headers on the follow-on pages has
 an error message that says, "Error! Reference source not found"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am willing to share the document that I have if someone is willing to look and see what we did before and how we might fix it. &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, </p>
<p>Steve</p>

            If you use formfields in the document body on the first page for the content you want replicated in the header, with each of those formfields given a unique Style name, you can use StyleRef fields in the header referencing those Style names to replicate
 the data. No code required.

<p>If you have a protected form (with legacy form fields), the last thing you want users to be doing is to enter the document header in order to fill fields, which requires the document to be unprotected - which I assume is what the macro is all about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly you would be better off with content controls. That way you could set a different first page header (which would be empty) and put your first page header content controls in the body of the first page and map them to the appropriate header of the
 subsequent pages. Then whatever you enter in any of the linked controls would be reproduced in the others and no macros are required.</p>

</p><p><a href="http://www.gmayor.com/BookmarkandVariableEditor.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/BookmarkandVariableEditor.htm</a> provides a simple means of mapping content controls, and if you want to get more adventurous with content
 controls, Greg Maxey has a more complex version linked from the top of that page.</p>

    <title>How to stop dialog boxes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> temporaryuser0101  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to stop dialog boxes</h2>
                    <p>o&nbsp; This is a direct message to the programmers of Office/Excel as a point of information on something that should be avoided at all costs when attempting to create new versions of Excel so that with those versions, no user will ever find themselves in the
 situation I am in at this very moment.&nbsp; Therefore I sincerely request that every person within Microsoft who will ever be charged with working on new versions of Excel read this.&nbsp; Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>o&nbsp; Then, I also request anyone who can come up with some method of me moving forward address this issue because I am now in a situation wherein I can do absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>My Present Situation:</strong></span></p>
<p>In Excel, apparently, a wise programmer decided that Excel should only handle "X" number of fonts over a range of open workbooks.&nbsp; IF one exceeds the limited amount, then one receives a dialog box that states:&nbsp; "<strong><em>No more fonts may be applied.&nbsp;
 Please close some other documents and try again.</em></strong>"&nbsp; However, at this point, a problem comes into play which is that one may not move from the offending workbook to another workbook, as suggested, in order to close some other workbook, other than
 the offending workbook.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally a person could then go to task manager and go to Excel and expand it and then close some workbooks, hopefully, which have been saved, so that finally the limit of fonts, is not exceeded, and thus, one could then go to the original offending workbook
 and resolve the issue.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if one is copying and then downloading material, and the attempt to download material is what causes the offense of exceeding this number of fonts, one then is basically screwed and this is because one may not go to another workbook either by using
 "<strong>Tab+Alt</strong>", nor by going to the <strong>Task</strong> <strong>Manager</strong>, selecting Excel, expand it to show all workbooks open, and then select workbooks one wishes to close as Excel, or Office or Windows or some other commands located
 some where will not allow this to happen and therefore one is left but with one option which is to continue hitting on "OK" in the pop up dialog box to close the dialog box but further, appareantly when attempting to download material, this box occurs every
 single word/character that exceeds the limits and thus one must sit here and somehow close this box every time it appears, 10,000 or more times before one can do anything to reduce the total number of fonts.&nbsp; It is one thing to create a limit on something.&nbsp;
 It is one thing to tell the user they have committed an error by exceeding this number.&nbsp; But, it is beyond all ethics to do all of this and tie the hands of the user so they cannot do anything whatsoever without sitting and hitting either of the two keys needed
 to close the dialog box enough times that one can then move on and do something to undo the action that exceeded this limit which is all honesty, at this point, has no apparent reason for existence to begin with.&nbsp; It also shows a complete lack of forward thinking
 if one is thrown into the situation of attempting to download a piece of material that seemingly exceeds the limit on total fonts by 10,386 times thus causing the user to have to sit and close this pop-up dialog box 10, 386 times.&nbsp; The task has become humongous
 when the material we are attempting to download is a very large page from on the net.&nbsp; Then apparently the only choice left is to close Excel.&nbsp; In my case at present, that means there are seventeen workbooks which I am working in and of the seventeen, only
 seven have been saved and the remaining ten have not because the material I am selecting on the web to be downloaded by pasted must go into one of these ten.&nbsp; Therefore, IF I close Excel at this point, I will lose roughly about six hours of work, which I choose
 not to do.&nbsp; That then means, I am completely lost, confused, in a state of total chaos as I have no idea of a rescue procedure for this point in time except perhaps sitting here, at my desk working on my desktop computer and hitting either "ENTER" or something
 else to move past the single message that will then disappear, but reappear immediately before I have a chance to do anything else whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, in reality, I am left asking the following:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; WHY does Microsoft, Office, Excel, either of one or all, give a big hoot how many fonts I have used in either one or all of the workbooks that are open?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; IF in fact, using too many fonts over a range of workbooks, creates far too many fonts for whatever reason, why is there not a method of telling us we are rapidly approaching said limit and if we reach that limit we will be locked until the total number
 of fonts is reduced?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; But more specifically, once we reach said limit as to the total number of fonts used over a range of open workbooks, why isn't there a rescue command or move that would allow us to, if nothing else, then go into the separate workbooks and reduce the
 number of fonts.&nbsp; Further, if we are in a situation in which our copying and downloading of material from the web causes us to exceed this limit, instead of locking us into shutting down each single one of 10,387 dialog boxes that apparently appear for each
 and every character made up of a fonts that then exceeds to the total number of fonts allowed over a range of all workbooks opened for which in reality, has not yet exceeded this (you don't want my real name for this limit on fonts) until the download has
 been completed and we then save the material when we are actually at the point of being in-process of downloading the material and it is at some point within the downloaded material that exceeds the limit.&nbsp; It is like punishing a child for violating a rule
 although the child is in the act of doing something but has not yet actually commited the offense. &nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; But in all honesty, I, without knowing the reason for the limited number of fonts, find it totally and completely ludicrous that once a person exceeds the total number of fonts allowed, we are at that point in time thrown into the position I find myself
 presently where I basically cannot do anything.&nbsp; There should be a mechanism for one to escape the situation they find themselves in because of an apparent punishment limit that in reality does not cause a problem of any kind for any software or person or
 anything else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, in other words, why on earth did the programmers of Excel throw a pair of handcuffs on me when I attempted to download a page that would then have throw me over a pretensious limit that apparently means nothing whatsover except to something somewhere
 but makes no sense for if I am attempting to download something that would thus cause me to exceed some ????Limit one the number of different fonts over a range of all my workbooks open at the time, why not stop the download and provide a different dialog
 box that says instead, "Your download will cause&nbsp; you to exceed the number of fonts we want at one time and therefore we have stopped the download until you close some workbooks thus reducing your total number of fonts at which point you may try to do your
 download again."&nbsp; Instead, you, the programmers of Excel have tied my hands to the extent I no longer can do anything therefore, you MUST be civil enough to tell me what on earth I can now do so I can once again perform tasks within Excel without that will
 at the least allow me to reduce the number of fonts being used at one time in the open workbooks in my system!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>PLEASE HELP!!!&nbsp; And for those who do help, thank you, very much!</strong></span></p>
<p>I <strong>VERY sincerely</strong> wish to apologize if I sound a bit, or a lot, as if I am being a real smart @ss in my choice of wording and terminology and so forth, for yes, I am at this point in time, EXTREMELY
 UPSET over this situation.&nbsp; I see no valid reason for any limits on the number of fonts used in one workbook or 10,000 workbooks or over a range of workbooks or whatever.&nbsp; Therefore I very much would like to understand why this limit does exist if you do not
 mind explaining it.&nbsp; However, secondly, if there is a valid reason for having said limit, then why not warn us as we approach this limit, say at having used say 75% and another warning again at 90% or 95% of the allowable amounts used to facilitate the user
 to take action to avoid exceeding this limit before finding themselves in a mess such as I am in at present.&nbsp; Further, if downloading material will causes us to exceed the limit, why not stop the download before it starts, provide a dialog box stating that
 doing the download will cause us at exceed the limit and thus allow us to do whatever we choose so we can prevent getting into this tied up situation I am in at present?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I admit that a part of this is, perhaps, my own fault for (1) not knowing there is a limit on the total number of fonts which can be used over the range of open workbooks, or (2) for not having an understanding for the limit for I can not realize through
 my own ignorance any reason whatsoever for creating such a limit to begin with because to me in my limited ignorance can see no logical reason to be concerned if I use 10 million different fonts, so what?&nbsp; But I do believe, since there is apparently a valid
 reason for this limit, that Microsoft should warn the user that they have used enough different fonts they may be close to exceeding the number of fonts that can be for</p>

<p>Well, apparently I am too long-winded for the world we live in today.&nbsp; I tried to post this into where you suggested by copying my originaly post and pasting it at the sight but was stopped by a message stating it was too long.&nbsp; So I revised it into what
 follows and again got the same message. IF you can take any of this and paste it over there without losing anything important, please do so because right now, my system is locked and I have spent at least six hours, probably more gathering what I have so far
 that I cannot save so I do not want to lose it and my system is completely locked unless someone finds a key so I can at the very least save teh files I have open that I have pasted ma terial into that I do not want to lose all because of this limit on the
 number of fonts in open workbooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP!</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS is what I ended up with that was also rejected:</p>
<div>I originally posted this in Microsoft Community and the moderator suggested I place it herein.&nbsp; Therefore, what follows is a description of a very bad situation that, at present, has my system LOCKED preventing me from doing anything so I ask for IMMEDIATE
 ATTENTION to this situation which is NOT a specific idea on how to improve anything but is placed here to make all aware of this problem that has my EXCEL system LOCKED and I cannot do anything as you will see as you read.&nbsp; This is what I posted:</div>
<div>•&nbsp;This is a direct message to the programmers of Office/Excel as a point of information on something that should be avoided at all costs when attempting to create new versions of Excel so that with those versions, no user will ever find themselves in the
 situation I am in at this very moment.&nbsp; Therefore, I sincerely request that every person within Microsoft who will ever be charged with working on new versions of Excel read this.&nbsp; Thank you!</div>
<div>Note:&nbsp; In attempting to post here, I once again ran into LIMITS with a dialog box stating the description is too long.&nbsp; What does that mean?&nbsp; By how much is it too long?&nbsp; For crying out loud?!&nbsp; So here then is my attempt to say the same thing in a much
 shorter version:</div>
<div>Apparently, there is a limit as to how many different fonts can be used over the range of open workbooks.&nbsp; I have exceeded that limit, but I do not know by how much and apparently further this happened during my attempt to download (paste) a long page
 from online.&nbsp; When this limit is reached, one can no longer proceed in Excel until they reduce the number of fonts.&nbsp; The dialog box states:&nbsp; "No more fonts may be applied.&nbsp; Please close some other documents and try again."&nbsp; Normally, one can go into the listing
 of open workbooks and close those which have been saved until the number of different fonts is reduced sufficiently to then allow you to go back into the offending workbook, or the one you were working in when the limit was exceeded.&nbsp; EXCEPT, as in my case,
 apparently, the limit was exceeded while trying to download a long page from online.&nbsp; Now, I cannot go into any other workbook and close it, nor can I go into Task Manager and close any workbooks.&nbsp; In fact, what is happening is that I continuously am getting
 this dialog box that states, “:&nbsp; "No more fonts may be applied.&nbsp; Please close some other documents and try again."&nbsp; Or in other words, as soon as I clicked on either “OK” or the “X” at the top right of the box to close it, the box disappears and instantly
 reappears.&nbsp; IF I go into Task Manager and expand it at Excel to show the titles of each open workbook, and then highlight a title of one of the open workbooks and then click on “END TASK”, nothing happens.&nbsp; IF I attempt to go to another workbook that is open
 in order to do something or even close it, nothing happens, in that I cannot go to another workbook.&nbsp;
<div>Therefore, apparently the ONLY thing I can do (I have no tried) is to close Excel.&nbsp; While it is true Excel will try to recover the material being closed, there are 10 workbooks open that I was downloading material into and I am afraid that if I close Excel,
 I will be thrown into a completely worse case of chaos than I presently am in.</div>
<div>On top of all of this, I have no idea why anyone within Microsoft, Excel or Office would create such a limit to begin with.&nbsp; So what difference does it make to anyone anywhere If I actually decide to use a different font for every character?&nbsp;
<div>I would LOVE for someone, who actually knows, to explain why this limit on the number of fonts used within the range of open workbooks exist.</div>
<div>Further, I would like to know why on earth there a warning to the user is not given when we have reached say, 75% of the allowable fonts used, and even again at say 90% or 95% so that we are prepared or can do something before the earth explodes.&nbsp; But
 then comes the situation I am in and that is I have not reached the limit but have highlighted a seemingly very long page online to be copied and pasted and gone so far as to have highlighted the material, given the CTRL+C command and the CTRL+V command and
 then the dialog box appeared telling me I have exceeded the number of allowable fonts and must do something.&nbsp; But, here is the kicker.&nbsp; Apparently this box appears FOR EVERY CHARACTER THAT IS IN EXCESS OF THE LIMIT and therefore with this page that may 10,387
 characters on it, and one of them at the beginning kicked me over the limit which means there are 10,386 characters in excess of the limit and thus the dialog box will appear 10,386 times so I must now sit here and click “OK” 10,386 times or click on the “X’”
 10,386 times BEFORE I can do anything to remedy the situation.&nbsp; This is HORRIBLE!&nbsp; Why isn’t there a rescue command?&nbsp; Why is there not a warning that a problem is coming along with a description.&nbsp; Once we get into this situation, we are locked.&nbsp; I cannot go
 to another workbook that is open and close it nor can I go into Task Manager and close any workbooks, nor can I do anything to stop the download.&nbsp; When a situation such as this is developing at the point where I click on CTRL+V, the system should stop me and
 say, “We cannot do this as it will exceed the maximum number of different fonts allowed.”&nbsp; But, very seriously, the most important question to start with is:&nbsp; why is there even a limit on the number of different fonts that can be used over the range of workbooks
 open?&nbsp; IF I decide at this point, just to throw it out, that is close Excel, I will lose the data I have already searched the web for and found and store within ten, that is (10) different workbooks or about now seven hours’ worth of work and I have even closed
 the webpages containing this information meaning I would completely have to go all through this again and I really do not wish to throw it out, start all over from scratch and attempt to regain the same data.&nbsp; Is it just me, or is this a ludicrous exercise
 in poor programming?</div>
<div>In the end I guess I have made a couple of suggestions for improvement to Excel while also PLEADING FOR IMMEDIATE HELP.&nbsp; I have spent most of my life doing “Failure/Cause Analysis and honestly for the life of me, I cannot understand why there is any limit
 as to the number of fonts that can be used over a range of open workbooks, so I very much would like to have that explained by someone who actually knows and not by someone who is taking a SWAG.</div>
<div>However, if the need to limit the number of fonts that can be used over a range of open workbooks really does exist,, then I VERY STRONGLY suggest that at the point where we have used 75% of the maximum amount of fonts possible over the range of open workbooks,
 a warning via dialog box be given to the user so the user does not end up in the situation I am current in.</div>
<div>Further, if the need for a limit on the number of fonts is real, then I also suggest that if the user has gone to a webpage or another file on their system and highlighted data and copied it using CTRL+C or any other method of copying material, and then
 also gives the CTRL+V or some other command to paste the data, the download be stopped before beginning and the user told that doing this would exceed the number of fonts that can be used and therefore the download has been stopped.&nbsp; This would then prevent
 a user from having their system locked, such as mine is at present, with conceivable no method of recovery and thus losing hours up on hours of work.</div>
<div>Lastly, if anyone knows of any means of recovery other than closing down Excel, would you please present herein to so I can get back to my work and continue on because I very sincerely have no clue as to what to do at present.&nbsp; I had thought of actually
 copying much of the data and pasting it into a Word file then later after making the necessary changes to the fonts, pasted the whole material back together again but within the restricted limits.&nbsp; However, Excel has tied me so well I can not do anything whatsoever
 I have thought of doing.</div>
<div>I am new to the User Voice site so if I have committed errors, stepped on toes or done anything wrong, please forgive me but please get me some help quickly and then we can handle my mistakes caused by ignorance of the system.&nbsp; IF, when I post this, I
 again receive a dialog box stating it is too long, I simple will grab the nearest firearm and blow my head off thus ending all my problems.&nbsp; Thank you sincerely to those who choose to help and further to vote for the changes I have suggested herein to make
 things better for all of us.</div>
<div>It is almost my hope and prayer that in the future when looking toward newere versions of Excel and Word, the programmers will begin by using the current versions so as not to lose existing capabilities which much of has been lost from XP that should not
 have been lost, PLEAS</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 Preview Build 10130 Wi-Fi Issues</h2>
                    <p>I installed the Windows 10 Build 10130 on my 2014 MacBook Air, and I encountered problems with my wifi. My computer cannot find any networks to join, and troubleshooting does not come up with anything. I know my wifi is functioning properly, as I have multiple
 other devices on it and my wifi works fine when I switch back to OS X Yosemite. I looked at already solved questions, suggesting I reboot Windows, but now I have done so five times. Any help with this problem is greatly appreciated. &nbsp;EDIT: I now know that
 my problem is happening because Windows could not find a driver for your network adapter. Can anyone help me install a network adapter?</p>

<p><span>To achieve your goal, you can refer to this article to do that:

</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can create an Excel template file(size is A4) then focus the section

<div>Hi James,</div>
<div><br />
<div>May I know whether you are referring to external email restriction for Distribution group? If so, Delivery management gives you option to handle how messages should be sent or received by the group.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can choose “<em>Only senders inside my organization</em>” further limit who can send messages to the group by allowing only specific senders to send messages to the group. By Adding selected one or more recipients. If you add senders to the list, they
 are the only ones who can send mail to the group. Mail sent by anyone not in the list will be rejected.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, you can also use Message approval to set options for moderating the group. Moderators approve or reject messages sent to the group before they reach the group members. For your reference:
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-distribution-groups/manage-distribution-groups" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create and manage distribution groups</a>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If the above information is not relevant to your query or I have misunderstood anything, please correct me and provide us with detailed information about the requirement including an example so that we can further assist you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Best regards,</div>

<h3> tonywongvt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot access the &#34;Draft&#34; folder</h2>
                    From a @hotmail.com email for over 10 years, I was brought to an @outlook.com email. &nbsp;But then Dan T of Microsoft Answers gave some advice to restore the @hotmail.com address. I did but it was not like before. &nbsp;In applying Dan T's same advice again, I
 got another email address, i.e. @live.hk. &nbsp;It is this one I am using now though emails to @outlook.com or @hotmail.com are still delivered to the @hotmail.com folder..&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, I am not able to access the "Draft" folder. Every time I clicked on the "Draft" folder, a message "<span>Outlook
 wasn't able to complete this request. Microsoft may contact you about any issues you report.</span><span>&nbsp;"
 appear at the top of the screen.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>Any way to resolve the problems?&nbsp;</span></div>

<p>Hi Martin,</p>
<p>I notice that “<em>Only information i have is the organization, domain, subscription and subscription ID</em>”, could you let him try to use these information to search for his account information in the mailbox which he uses when registering Office 365?
 Microsoft will send an email to&nbsp;his email account which he uses to register Office 365 after finishing the register, and the email contains his admin username. After getting his username, he can reset his password via the following method.<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Reset-my-administrator-password-for-Office-365-6ceb1998-57a8-461e-8c38-99d3d8133294?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reset my administrator password for Office 365</a></p>
<p>If he cannot find the related information, we would suggest you post the question in our
<a href="https://mspartner.microsoft.com/en/us/Pages/Support/get-support.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Partner forum</a> which is a specific support channel handle partner related questions for further assistance.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t print web pages. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonjog  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t print web pages.</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7, 64 bit on a Dell with an HP C4580 printer. I can't print web pages when I am logged in under my name.</p>
<p>I get either a script error report or "There was an internal error and IE is unable to print this document." The fault reported depends on whether I go straight to Print or view Print Preview first. These are the same problems reported by several others&nbsp;and
 Microsoft acknowledge the problem occurs.</p>
<p>For both faults the Microsoft response is that the document&nbsp;is still printed correctly&nbsp;- IT ISN'T.</p>
<p>The advice is to change printer driver amongst other things. There is some other advice about Encapsulated Postscript but I have no idea what this means.</p>
<p>(I can print files from the PC - just web pages that won't work.)</p>
<p><strong>However,</strong> I&nbsp;<strong>can</strong> print web pages if I log in&nbsp;with&nbsp;my wife's name. So the same PC with the same printer and same driver&nbsp;gives 2 very different results. I have compared settings under both users and can't find any differences.
 I am the administrator so shouldn't have any restrictions.</p>
<p>Because I can print under my wife's log-in I assume that the driver is&nbsp;NOT the problem and there isn't any point messing with&nbsp;alternative drivers.</p>
<p>Has anyone out there solved this one?? Help appreciated.</p>
