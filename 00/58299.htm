            <p>Hi Jason, </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Can you please explain a bit about the<strong> Loop hole </strong>that you refer when you try to use
<strong>Trust my PC </strong>option? </p>
<p>2. Do you get any error message? </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you try to view or edit sensitive information related to your Microsoft account—like your credit card details—we might ask you for a security code first, to make sure that only you can get in&nbsp; to your account. But you can designate a&nbsp;computer as a
<span>trusted device</span>.&nbsp; On trusted devices, you don't need to enter a security code each time you try to access sensitive information.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the link mentioned below to get an overview about setting a device as Trusted PC.

            <p><span>Hi Jasonlamb,<br />
<br />
A trusted PC is a computer that you've added to the password reset information for your Microsoft account. This information helps Microsoft verify the identity of the person using the trusted computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>If you ever forget your password, or if someone gains unauthorized access to your account, it's easier to reset your password from your trusted PC. When you request to have your password
 reset from a trusted PC, Microsoft trusts that you are who you say you are and doesn't require you to provide any additional information to verify your account.
</span></p>
<strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>You should only designate a computer as a trusted PC if you're using a private computer. If you share your computer with others, anyone who uses the computer
 can reset your password without your knowledge. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</span>

            I have also been in this insane loop for months! I have two computers... one I got added as trusted the other I have been unable to get recognized as trusted... I put in the code and click to add as trusted... it wants me to download an app to my phone...
 to log into a desktop??? That is dumb! Go open another window direct to MSN and I can get to my email.... next time I sign on I go through the same issue as before... I have been going through this loophole since I got this computer! Please Help!

                    <p>I've been trying to merge my Skype and Microsoft accounts in order to have a more streamlined Skype experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go to account.microsoft.com and log in with my Skype username and password, and it asks me to put in a Microsoft email since "Skype and Microsoft are now one", and the log-in page said doing this would merge the two accounts together. I put in my Microsoft
 email in, and it tells me "We can't look up your email right now. Try again later." I refresh, try again, clear my history/cookies/etc., try again, nothing. So I try the phone number associated with my Microsoft account and it tells me "We can't look up your
 phone number right now. Try again later." after multiple tries and quadruple checking my number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want these two accounts to be merged. That's all I ask.</p>

                    <p>Hello, I have a problem with my keyboard (I have Windows 8.1)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This started yesterday: when the Caps Lock key is&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">on,</span></strong> I cannot use the Shift Key in any way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, when the Caps Lock is activated, I cannot press alt+shift to change the language, or even if I press Shift + a letter, nothing will appear on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, when I type on&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Word</span></strong> and activate the Caps Lock, if I press
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>alt+shift</strong></span> to change the language, I get a bunch of wierd pictures on the top of the screen (see picture below)</p>

            The same happens here, but I don't use CapsLock to get uppercase characters. Maybe that is the route that you should take too..

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The first step is to identify the program that the icon represents and decide if it needs to be in the system tray (most aren't necessary). Hold the mouse
 cursor over the icon to see the name of the program the icon launches. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The best bet is to left-click on the icon to see if this opens the program's options box. If it does, hunt around for a selection similar to 'Remove from
 System Tray'.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also hide the icons in system tray.</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how you do it:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Right click on the taskbar and select 'Properties'</span></p>
<p><span>2. In the 'Notification area' click on 'Hide inactive icons' if it already not checked and then click on 'Customize' button.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click on the 'Behavior column next to each of your Current Items and choose one of three behaviors for each program icon that appears in the system
 tray: "Hide when inactive," "Always hide," or "always show."</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you hide an icon, but then see it again the next time you log on to Windows, you might have to uninstall the program to permanently remove the icon.
 Uninstalling the program also permanently removes the program from your computer. For more information, see
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uninstall or change a program</a>.</span></p>

            Hi Samten,
<br />
<br />You can retrieve your old computer name and try setting the name back to that name to see if that resolves this issue . . .
<br />
<br />Open the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Navigate to:
<br />
<br />HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SchedulingAgent\OldName
<br />
<br />You should find your old computer name there . . .

            No one here can tell you your activation key. Your Windows came installed on the computer, the key should be on it, if not try calling the computer manufacturer, they might have a record.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you bought a computer with Windows preinstalled there should be a Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker somewhere on your computer, on some laptops it’s in the battery bay. It will have a 25 character alphanumeric code on it - that is your product key.
 If it's not on your computer look in your paperwork or on any CD/DVD cases that were included with the computer.
<br />
<br />
If you bought a retail copy of Windows 7 the key should be included in the box. <br />
<br />
If you bought Windows 7 online and downloaded it the key should have been sent to you through email. If you bought from the MS Store you can log in to your account to view it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have a lost or unreadable product key for Microsoft software that came with your computer, please contact the manufacturer of your computer to obtain a replacement. Contact information for the manufacturer of your computer can be found here:
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/oemphone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/gp/oemphone/</a><br />
<br />
If you have lost a product key for software that you purchased separately from your computer, or if your product key is not working, please call 1-800-Microsoft (642-7676). A fee may apply for lost keys.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're trying to activate Office<br />
<br />
Are you using the Windows 7 key that's on your computer/DVD case to activate Office? That will not work - only an Office key will activate Office.
<br />
<br />
Some new computers come with Microsoft Office Starter, which is a free version of Office with reduced functions. If you want to add more features you can buy Office.<br />
<br />
Also, some new computers come with a trial of Office, but after X days or X uses it goes to reduced functionality mode unless you buy it. To continue using it beyond the trial period, you'll need to purchase a Microsoft Office license.
<br />
<br />

                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>My xbox one controller vibration stopped working today without any reason because the batteries is fully charged, vibration is turned on and tested and when i changed to my other unused controller it doesn`t vibrate either so the problem seems coming from
 the console?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not know what else i can do, will a factory reset help maybe?</p>

<p>Hey Borshajen thanks for taking the time to bring this issue to us!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue on the controller seems to be coming from the console itself so we suggest trying a reset since
<span>the problem might be on the actual OS of the console so we would suggest a
</span><a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Ctrl+Click to follow link https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults">Soft Factory
 Reset</a><span> (while keeping games and apps and hard wire the controller to the console)
</span><strong>IF AND ONLY IF THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA IS MET:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">There
 is a stable network connection.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">The
 information for all profiles is known (email and passwords)</span></li></ul>
<p><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 1, 24, 1)">We suggest doing this to make sure any updates needed on the console or controller will get pushed through.
<span>Once the setup is complete it will ask if we want to keep settings or manual setup lets do manual setup. Give it a shot and let us know of any changes!</span></span></span></strong></p>

    <title>Cant load windows after running Verifier.exe. Serious failure. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matttheguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cant load windows after running Verifier.exe.  Serious failure.</h2>
                    <p>I decided to try to troubleshoot what I thought might have been a driver problem, by running Windows' "Verifier.exe"&nbsp; This was a suggestion I found on one of the questions posted here regarding the error in my event viewer that says "The driver \Driver\WudfRd
 failed to load for the device USB\VID_040A&amp;PID_4027&amp;MI_02\6&amp;59e93bf&amp;2&amp;0002."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it needed to restart to run "Verifier.exe"&nbsp; But when it did, it gave me BSOD with the message that said something like VERIFIER DETECTED DRIVER VIOLATION.&nbsp; It kept restarting to that until I decided to boot with the repair options, and the first thing
 I tried was to boot up with the option to not run with strict drivers or something like that.&nbsp; That didn't work.&nbsp; So then I went ahead and did a System Refresh.&nbsp; That seemed to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then as I was reinstalling norton and redownloading firefox, the system began to run very slow, hang, and finally it restarted.&nbsp; But when it tried to restart it rebooted again.&nbsp; Again, i would keep getting a reboot unless I tried to run system repair.&nbsp;
 This time system repair only allowed me to check for errors and repair.&nbsp; The first time it ran it said it found problems with hard drive, and was attempting to repair them.&nbsp; It finished, restarted, but same problem.&nbsp; So it ran repair again, and it ran for
 a long time, and then it finally rebooted, but same problem, keeps rebooting.&nbsp; So now every time I try to run system repair it says it cant fix the problem.&nbsp; it lest me send data to Microsoft which I do but it doesn't offer a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I tried to boot from my installation disc to refresh again.&nbsp; Now it's telling me my hard drive is locked, and that I need to unlock it to run refresh...</p>
<p>
If I locked I have no idea how.&nbsp; This is quite a distressing problem.&nbsp; It doesn't seem like I'll be able to avoid formatting this HD but I really dont want to.&nbsp; I have business information on it.&nbsp; Can anyone give me any help?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Had you asked before you repair, run without strict drivers, refresh, install Norton &amp; firefox, the answer would have been oh so simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot into safe mode and turn off verifier by typing verifier /reset from an elevated command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DO you have a backup (of course not).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your options are really slim.&nbsp; You could download a live environment (like linux, or windows pe) and copy the data off to another HD, then format and re-install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>'If you do not have a second HD you could still download a live environment, then resize the OS partition, then create a new partition and copy the data from one to the other.</p>

            <p>Ok false alarm here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, after my pc rebooted itself, it was trying to boot from an old emachines hdd i had put in as a secondary for storage.&nbsp; I'm not sure how or why it started doing that, but I went into bios and fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I'm getting all the new updates.&nbsp; Norton looks like it will need an uninstall/reinstall.&nbsp; I'm stilling seeing "The driver \Driver\WudfRd failed to load for the device USB\VID_040A&amp;PID_4027&amp;MI_02\6&amp;59e93bf&amp;2&amp;0002." in the event viewer.&nbsp; Looks like
 it pops up every reboot.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
This had all started with me trying to troubleshoot an update that kept failing.&nbsp; KB3000850.&nbsp; Maybe it'll work now.&nbsp; I'll report back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for those last desperate solutions though.&nbsp; I would have been happy doing that to get my files back.</p>

<h2>            Chromebook killer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP chrome book with limited disc memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine came with Windows 10 and Office installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With a few basic programmes the disc was almost full up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I added a 32GB of micro SD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep getting a lack of space and recently</p>
<p>
</p><p>8GB Windows update will not download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get the download to SD card?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Microsoft trying to kill chromebooks?</p>

<p>I thought a Chromebook came pre-installed with Google Chrome. If HP supplied the device with Windows 10 installed and it has a small internal drive then perhaps you should ask them how to update.</p>

<p>You don't seem to understand</p>
<p>
</p><p>A chrome book is a cut down PC that rely's on the new for main functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They come with smaller solid state drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this is filled with windows 10 and Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Their is no room for an 8 GB windows 10 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And system give non install message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even with an extra space added the update will not complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are</p>
<p>
</p><p>why such a large update size?</p>
<p>
</p><p>how do I update using extra added drive space?</p>
<p>
</p><p>is this an attempt for Microsoft to leave Chromebook users out in the cold?</p>

<p>No I didn't misunderstand I just wondered why Windows 10 was on a Chromebook. I looked at HP's site after and it seems they have a Chrome operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The updates can be large and can require 20GB of free space to install. (depending on the update) So they are not designed for use on a device with a small amount of internal storage.</p>
<p>I wonder why manufacturers produce machines (if they are designed for Windows 10) with such a small amount of storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe there is an option for the large Feature updates to use extra USB storage but I've not heard of it using an SD card. Can you install the programs to the SD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn't imagine MS have any thoughts on Chromebook users as they are not designed for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did your Chromebook come with Windows 10 (from HP) or Chrome OS.?</p>

<h2>            how could I prioritise my network connections, &#40;without disabling the tether, as it&#39;s required&#41;, so that it will use the internet from my main network connection&#63;</h2>
                    <i>&nbsp;Prioritising Network Connections</i>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Ok, here's the situation.<br />
I have an ordinary ethernet connection which is providing me with a LAN and internet.<br />
I also have a tablet PC which I tether to my PC so I can use it as a controller. (Not that it's important, but it's for a DAW/Midi controller)<br />
<br />
My problem is that as soon as I tether my tablet, the PC starts ignoring my normal connection, and taking the internet from my tablet (even when it's not connected to the internet). As a result, My internet drops out as soon as I tether, if I'm not also running
 the wifi on my tablet.<br />
<br />
My question is, how could I prioritise my network connections, (without disabling the tether, as it's required), so that it will use the internet from my main network connection?<br />

            Thanks man. You gave another piece of information about things. But unfortunately i figured out that i have to disabled some start up programs, you know those things on the lower right corner. Yea, i disabled some of them and it's working fine now. No
 more freezing, through a virus scan, i figured out that Java is the one causing the problem (i believed). Now i'm uninstalling it and trying to reinstall. But thanks though, it shown that somebody care to help me! Once again thanks!

===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

    <title>Microsoft Support lying to customers. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> panda bay  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Support lying to customers.</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to contact Microsoft Customer Support about getting a refund for a fraudulent charge for about 2 weeks now. I have a service request number and I was told that if I refused delivery or returned the product I would get my purchase refunded.
 Every time I call support I am given a long story about why that support agent can not help me and then I am usually redirected to another support line. I feel as though enough time has passed that Microsoft will try to say that they do not have to honor my
 request for a refund but now that I have refused delivery of the product I'm afraid I won't even get that back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I contact the BBB or a lawyer? I know it seems excessive for a $30 refund but this feels like a fraudulent criminal activity and I just don't know what to do to protect myself and get back what I feel has been stolen from me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: Finally spoke to a "Floor Supervisor" at Microsoft Support. From my military experience, it felt like she was probing and asking questions that made the conversation feel like an interrogation. I started to feel as though she was looking for a reason
 to say they couldn't give a refund. I was very upset by this and due to my PTSD I began to get emotional. I told them they could keep the money, I just wanted someone to be honest with me. I don't think anyone at Microsoft cares that I was lied to or that
 Customer Support continues to lie and take advantage of people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I posted here because Xbox Support has told me that it is an Accounts and Billing issue not an Xbox issue. Flag it if you want, won't be the first time someone from Microsoft found an excuse not to help someone looking for answers.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>sorry to hear that. Something similar happened to me. I tried to purchase a surface and the website did not let me finalize the transaction (maybe due to high volume, it was black Friday). so I resorted to the assistance of customer service who was very
 eager to charge my credit card. 24 hours later, no receipt from Microsoft. after contacting the customer support I am told the sale never happened, the item was still in the cart&nbsp; and I was offered to purchase again. I say no thanks. I finally manage to get
 the darn machine purchased by myself on the website and pick it up. couple weeks later I discover in horror that I was billed twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the transaction happened with a credit card I suggest you dispute the charge with the credit card company. I am still in the process of doing that but I had some luck in the past with this sort of bad manners from big businesses</p>

<h2>            Explorer not working, RPC server not available. Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I attempted to remote connect to another computer using logmein and it was failing to authenticate. After several failures, I restarted my computer to see if that would fix the problem. Upon the computer turning on, it doesn't appear that Explorer
 loaded and I am unable to click on the start menu button. When attempting to open any file folder, I receive the error RPC server unavailable. I am able to run any software that has an icon on the desktop or pinned to the taskbar. This computer is not part
 of a network, it is a personal one in my home.</p>
<p>When starting the computer in Safe mode, everything is working as it normally would in Safe mode.</p>
<p>When I started researching the problem, I first looked to see if the RPC services were running and they were all set to start with windows and were running. There are no firewall issues that I could see, the internet connection is running fine, the registry
 entries for RPC are all properly configured, and I have already done a system restore to see if that would fix the issue.</p>
<p>Is there something else that I should attempt before I let Windows attempt to repair itself or just reinstall Windows 10.</p>

<p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue doesn't exist while in Safe Mode, it is most likely a driver issue. Try performing a clean boot and check if it helps. Here is an
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> for your reference. Afterwards, see the

<p>I am unable to restart the computer while not in safe mode but was able to perform a clean boot minus not being able to disable Norton Security. I did disable the Norton Security firewall, but short of uninstalling the program, there does not appear to be
 a way to disable it on startup. </p>
<p>The problem persists after disabling everything except Norton. Should I attempt this after uninstalling Norton?</p>

<p>Do you have an activated version of Norton? If you can reinstall the antivirus software, something that you can try is to temporarily uninstall the software, observe if the same issue persists, and then reinstall the software.</p>
