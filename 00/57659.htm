    <title>Black screen on boot, unsure what to do. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Black screen on boot, unsure what to do.</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello, and thanks in advance.&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>So, I've been having problems with my computer for a while. Unfortunately, my computer had been insanely slow during its windows 8.1 days despite its relatively strong hardware and my computer being bought in windows 8.1, and after sending it in the
 guy updated it to windows 10 and things got much worse from there.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My computer got even slower, I got constant blue screens of death, my computer took ages to boot up, and eventually I "sorta" figured out why. Turns out, my computer had 100% disk load despite having no real reason as to why. I tried various fixes
 without ever touching serious settings that affect my computer boot or what not directly, and not a single common or uncommon fix worked for me anywhere.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Eventually, I just decided I would live with it, since I was visiting Canada by that point and I couldn't have it resent in to the guy I mentioned earlier. And, eventually, after my computer straight up froze while playing dark souls, I was forced
 to power it down through the power button when it was unresponsive for a good 15-20 minutes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>since then, my computer after trying to boot it back up, it sometimes has a blue screen of death that states “unmountable boot volume” and then my PC will try and repair itself, or have a typical Lenovo text up for a bit, and then a pure black lit
 up screen will proceed to replace it and it won't go away.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have no cursor up on the screen, and I know it doesn't go away with time since I let it sit over night once and it stayed up for the duration. A good 10 hours, for the most part. Is there any way for me to fix this, or am I just screwed? My computer
 is a Lenovo ideapad y500, and the specs on it are the same as listed on the store. NVIDIA® GeForce® GT750M GDDR5 2GB,</span></p>
<p><span>Intel Icore7,</span></p>
<p><span>8gb ram…</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you need any other specifications I can give them In a reply, but I can't find anywhere to copy and paste the specs and it's very hard to type them all down on a phone. Thanks for taking the time to read my question, and I hope to hear from you
 soon.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 universal apps &#40;Radio Paradise, TuneIn Radio, Hyper for YouTube, etc&#41; will not stream</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned in the subject line, no universal apps installed through the store are able to stream. I can browse channels within YouTube or TuneIn for example, which shows the apps are able to access the internet, but when the video or radio station is selected
 it will not play.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently &nbsp;upgraded to Win 10 from 7 and everything else seems to be working fine other than the above. I have tried resetting the TCP/IP stack, a few netsh reset commands and reinstalling my video drivers to no avail. I am trying to avoid doing a clean
 install for the moment and some help getting this working would be great.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you get any error message when the radio station does not play?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perform the steps mentioned below and see if it helps. </p>
<p><span>1. Go to BIOS Setup by pressing F2, or whichever button is configured during the booting.<br />
2. In the Configuration menu <strong>disable the Graphics Switchable </strong>and make it to Discreet.<br />
3. After that Enable the virtual section below. Save and exit.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems
 resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.

</p><p>Unfortunately my BIOS has no such option. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I get no error message in TuneIn or Youtube etc. With Radio Paradise, it tells me it is unable to connect. I am inclined to believe the issue is with the streaming, not audio or video per se.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I&nbsp;have another Windows 10 computer on the same network currently running all of the apps in question with no problems so it's not the network.

<h2>            Profit Taking by Default&#33; There is nothing but GREED behind the XBOX Live Gold design flaws...</h2>
                    
<p>My 5 year old son recently made 2 XBOX live purchases using my account /credit card. (He was warned and educated the first time, and is now in trouble for the second time).</p>
<p>I think it is just terrible how<strong> easy by default</strong> it is for this to even take place. I don't enjoy or think it is fair to have to go through
<strong>SO</strong> much <strong>EFFORT</strong> to <strong>PREVENT</strong> this from happening - it's a<strong> very poor design</strong>. It is a greed/profit driven system that is fully intended to
<strong>take</strong> <strong>advantage of people</strong>. Sure! Make it easy to spend money - and people will do it more often, even if by mistake or by their children! - ("Cmon little Johnny - you know you want to buy this game - just grab your dad's credit
 card from his wallet and do it!"). Again - yea yea - you can take a <strong>full hour</strong> of your life and set up all the controls and what not to
<strong>prevent</strong>&nbsp;this - but shouldn't it be the other way around? Why is it so hard to do the right thing and keep the customer happy/safe first?</p>
<p>In this situation you would think there would be a mechanism to <strong>undo</strong> this obvious mistake and make things better. Upon calling XBOX LIVE Support (which apparently is also frowned upon - judging by the hefty amount of effort it took to even
 find the 1-800 number - that is not to be found on this site btw - at least not easily) the not-so-friendly agent bascically says - "sorry it's a licensing thing - so we have NO returns on digital purchases/downloads". Hmm - so brick and mortar seems to clearly
 have an advantage here (my son never played or "opened" it) ...<strong>guess who will NEVER buy another title digitally again!</strong> ;)</p>
<p>Thanks to the rude but "helpful" agent - my automatic renewal option, and my credit card on file have now been removed. (By the way I could not do this online - again the wonderfully built system made it hard to do anything that protects my hard earned money
 ;) - although as I mentioned <strong>it should be this way by default</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>In Summary: purchasing on XBOX live SUCKS ***</strong>. Unless you are an adult with either LOADS of time (or LOADS of money) - stay the hell away from signing up your credit card on this service - there is NO protection or gatekeeping by default.</p>
<p>Also - one more thing - why in the hell do you have to buy XBOX LIVE GOLD just to get
<strong>Netflix</strong>? Just about every damn device on the planet can get Netflix to play for free (with their subscription of course) - but yet you have to pay the extra
<strong>Microsoft Tax</strong> each month on top if you want to use it on your xbox -
<strong>HELLO!</strong>?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uhh - guess who will be buying a new Blu-Ray device with Netflix this weekend (Yea, that's right, the XBOX doesn't even offer you Blu-Ray) -&nbsp;I just wish I had the $50 my son spent without my permission to put towards buying it.</p>
<p>Ciao!</p>

<p>Greetings, anthonyrideout. I’m very sorry to hear about the issues you've been experiencing with digital purchases. Situations like this can be frustrating, and I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused. I do want to thank you for taking the time
 to share your feedback with us. Hearing directly from our community is one of the best ways we can learn and grow, and your voice is appreciated.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should be able to avoid further unauthorized purchases by using a pass code - essentially a button sequence on your controller - to control access to your account. By setting up a pass code anyone who wants to use your profile must first enter the pass
 code before signing in to Xbox LIVE. It should only take a few minutes at the most to get it set up and you can do it right from your Xbox 360 console. Here are the steps:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/xbox-live-pass-codes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../xbox-live-pass-codes</a>. As a side note, you can access and update your billing information as well as view your purchase history on
<a href="http://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://billing.microsoft.com</a> at any time.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed you had a question about Netflix as well. Netflix integrates with Xbox LIVE to provide a rich viewing experience that can be shared with your friends over LIVE, which is why it requires a Gold account. You can find out more about Netflix here:<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Live/Partners/Netflix/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.xbox.com/.../Home<br />
&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>Let me know if setting up the pass code helps. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any further questions.</p>

<p>As for bluray... sony owns the rights to that. And sony sharing something with microsoft? Not really going to happen.
</p>
<p>And the netflix thing was a decision between the two companies. So not just profiteering there.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">The <strong>only</strong>&nbsp;time you need to call to remove your credit/debit card is if there is an active subscription tied to it. Otherwise you can remove it at any time from your Account Management/Billing.microsoft.com.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">@OP-You could have avoided all of this by having a pass code set up on your profile, it literally only takes seconds to set one up, not hours. And if your son had his own child account, then you could have set up Parental Controls
 on the account and Family Settings on the console. So as you can see the tools to prevent unauthorized in-home access are there you just didn't take advantage of them. You have no one to blame but yourself for this.</span></p>

<p>It doesn't matter when the <strong>only</strong> time is. That subscription was paid for as a one off payment already debited from my account. Had I purchased the annual fee from a store, the card would not have been active on my account. There is no reason
 for my sensitive financial information to be inexorably linked to a product that has been paid for.</p>
<p>My account was compromised in the evening when the help lines were shut. I changed my password, deleted the intrusive email address that appeared in my Live settings and did as much as was humanly possible to ensure
<strong><em>my</em></strong> bank account was safe. What I could not do was delete my debit card from a compromised system.</p>
<p>What saddens me is that I have <em>never</em> had a problem with XBox or MS and the
<span><strong>only</strong></span> time I needed to do something to secure my identity and hard earned money, I was prevented from doing so by a system that is
<strong>not</strong> designed with the customer in mind.</p>
<p>Not only can I not secure my account, MS cannot either as the type of issue I had (granted different from the gentleman who started this thread), appears to be well known and yet their security department cannot even spot it happening after the event.</p>
<p>What saddens me even further is that in order to secure myself completely I feel I have to completely shut down my Live activity and that means getting rid of my xbox which I have had and used daily and upgraded and loved for getting on to six years solid.</p>
<p>I suppose leaving a community where legitimate complaint can be met with such miserable negativity as you have just displayed is about the only cold comfort I can gain from this entire sorry episode.</p>

<p>Xbox doesn't force you to add a credit card... that's your choice. They do also offer prepaid cards as a resolution. If you don't want your credit card information on there, use prepaid cards.</p>

<h2>            Black screen with just cursor</h2>
                    <p>Hey!</p>
<p>basically I uninstalled some sims 3 download custom content as its been affecting my game and after I finished I just kind of left my computer and I came back to it being off, I definitely don't think the custom content is the problem though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned it back on and it did the checking consistency in the disks and it turned off at stage two, then I did it again for it to just go to a black screen with a cursor, I assumed if I left it it will just load my computer and carry on as normal as in
 the past that's worked but now it keeps doing it and even without doing the disk checks it goes straight into the blank screen and white cursor, please help! I'm also using Windows ten.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            can&#180;t get AHCI to work after Windows 8 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I upgraded on&nbsp;26/10&nbsp;from XP SP3 to Windows 8 Pro</p>
<p>When I set AHCI for my SATA mode in BIOS, I can´t get it to work. All works fine in SATA mode</p>
<p>I checked in the registry that storahci key is on "0".</p>
<p>My SSD requires AHCI mode to work properly and also to get updated until I move windows 8 to it.</p>
<p>I need (detailed, I´m home user) help !</p>
<p>Thank You !</p>

            <p>Thank You for your answer. Here my answers:</p>
<p>1/ I &nbsp;have SSD OCZ-VERTEX4, firmware 1.3. </p>
<p>2/I used the OCZ&nbsp;utility from OCZ support site&nbsp;to upgrade to firmware&nbsp;1.4</p>
<p>3/&nbsp;although upgrade&nbsp;process seem all fine (progress bar, etc, no error message),&nbsp;apparently the utility won´t do it, firmware version stays 1.3, OCZ support&nbsp;site says AHCI must be&nbsp;on&nbsp;for the utility to work, does not specify which utility functions need
 AHCI.</p>
<p>Windows 8&nbsp;is installed on Western Digital WD10EADS-00L5B1, no firmware update is available for this specific HDD.</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>let the computer run in SATA mode</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a recovery media</li><li>Restart your computer</li><li>Set the AHCI SATA option in BIOS to AHCI</li><li>Now, boot from the recovery media and repair you PC.</li><li>Your drive will start working in AHCI mode</li></ul>
<p>To make the recovery media follow this guide :</p>
<p><a href="http://troubleshootwindows.com/windows-8/how-to-create-a-usb-cd-dvd-recovery-repair-media-in-windows-8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://troubleshootwindows.com/windows-8/how-to-create-a-usb-cd-dvd-recovery-repair-media-in-windows-8/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see you haven't installed windows 8 on the SSD. So repairing your computer to enable AHCI should work.</p>
<p>If you by chance, opt to install windows 8 ( fresh install ) on a SSD. make sure you secure erase your SSD and align in properly before installing windows 8 on it.</p>

            <p>Thank You Shantanu for your answer.</p>
<p>I did what you were advising, until I saw, booting on the USB stick,&nbsp;that the "repair your PC"-step would erase all apps I spent my last WE installing.</p>
<p>So I skipped this. I will not do a fresh install on the SSD, just use a migration tool. I wished Win 8 would have AHCI working and a windows upgrade assistant with option&nbsp;to choose another drive to install windows.. but the migration tool will do this job.</p>
<p>If you or&nbsp;anybody have a less dramatic solution than the repair + reinstall all apps... I have family and not much time, I prefer to run 100 years on SATA&nbsp;than&nbsp;spending another week-end on this.</p>

            <p>Good, it looked I found the solution. The steps I followed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Device Manager, under IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers:</p>
<p>For each ATA Channel where I had the HDD and the SDD:</p>
<p>- Double Click/Driver/Update Driver.../Browse my computer for driver software/let me choose in a list of device drivers on my computer/UNCHECK THE "SHOW COMPATIBLE HARDWARE"/Standard SARA AHCI Controller</p>
<p>- Restart computer</p>
<p>- Change in BIOS from SATA to AHCI</p>
<p>Results:</p>
<p>At start,&nbsp;if I recall well,&nbsp;the system prompted my if I want MBR or GPT for C:, I chose GPT since I don´t have only Win8 as OS.</p>
<p>- HDD (System Disk) worked, normal booting</p>
<p>- SSD changed to "unallocated" (no data)</p>
<p>With Control Panel/Administrative Tools/Computer Management/Disk Management I did a quick format of the SSD and chose W:</p>
<p>All seem to work fine.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, one more thing: I did a new restore point through ControlPanel/Recovery should anything go wrong.</p>
<p>Since I applied "random" solution ;-) and forced something identified by the system as incompatible, it could well be I messed this or that doing so; Should anyone identify a week spot in my fix, please&nbsp;say so, because internet is full of remedies recipes
 with no happy end, and I would not like to be contribute to these.</p>

            <p>All seems to be solved by the above solution, this thread can be marked as "solved".</p>
<p>After that I transferred Win8 OS to my SSD using the free AOMEI program (do not forget, if you do so, to unplug the source OS HDD connector upon restart and convert your SSD to MBR using the Windows 8 utility, otherwise you´ll have to restart from scratch)</p>

            <p>If your machine is a desktop type, your BIOS may allow some of the SATA ports to behave like IDE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mine has 5 ports, and #3 and 4 can be set for IDE. So I connect my SATA DVD drive to one of&nbsp;these two, leave AHCI set for #0 through 2.
</p>
<p>The above allows the DVD drive to read the and&nbsp;install the OS on the main drive&nbsp;(#0) in AHCI mode, after which I can go back into BIOS and set # 3 and 4 back to SATA.
</p>
<p>There is no impact on the OS and it doesn't have to sort itself out&nbsp;</p>

May be useful for other users, but in my case the answer is offset, since new OS was already installed and not from DVD (download).</p>
<p>As said, I fixed it already as explained above</p>

<p>=================================<br />
WAV files can be used to create an Audio CD which <br />
should play in any Standard CD Player. CDs are<br />
usually 70 or 80 minutes so it will take many for<br />
a whole book.</p>
<p>If you have a CD player that can play MP3 files...you<br />
could convert the WAV to MP3 and then you could <br />
create a Data CD which would hold a much longer<br />
file.</p>
<p>Audio/Music CDs are based on Duration and Data <br />
CDs are based on File Size.</p>
<p>An alternative would be to copy the file to a Flash <br />
Drive or Memory Card and the file could be played<br />
on most any computer. In that case...converting the <br />
WAV file to the WMA format might be a good idea <br />
because the file size would be smaller.</p>

<p>
Your answer doesn't even make sens with the information provided he told you the problem is the hotspot tool even if he connects on any other hotspot his computer wont host in 2.4ghz. I am running the same problem and I'm really trying to host a 2.4ghz hostpot
 for 2.4ghz devices. The hotspot utility should have a bandwidth option, I've tried looking in the drivers advanced option but nowhere can we choose 5ghz or 2.4</p>

            Ayyyy lmao so helpful, you know i have a 3 antenna wifi card that can use both 5ghz and 2.4 that's why one time hotspot bugged and actually hosted my hotspot in 2.4ghz without me changing anything ( I was plugging and unplugging an ethernet cable when
 it happened ) so the limitiation isn't my hardware but the software, no where can be found an option to put an antenna (not the 3) to 2.4ghz in my wifi card driver ( qualcomm atheros AR938x ) and yeah the question only leads to the reasonning that is : WINDOWS
 HOTSPOT SHOULD HAVE MORE FUNCTIONNALITIES, more buttons to set up all that **** like we really want because right now for anyone trying to setup something nice well it's **** thanks. The microsoft dev team can help us with our issue, no one else ( except if
 some standalone programmer decide to make an universal hotspot manager better than the one in windows wich doesn't happen because all the programs i can find right now that let me host are copy pasta of windows hotspot they just toggle th

            Is this reply from Microsoft or is it from the community. That date is in Feb and the question asked in March. I am not help and not impressed that Microsoft seems to drag their feet to make this available but everywhere I must hear how wonderful this
 windows 10 is.

<h2>            Skype changes my contacts names to weird stuff&#33; Worried&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this weird experience the last month. On three separate occasions, my Skype has changed the display name of three of my most contacted contacts to weird stuff. This may have been cause on Skype for Win 10, probably the new app, but maybe also
 the regular skype-software, or skype on android (samsung galaxy s7 edge).</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My 1st friend was changed to "Stian T********n" - a totally normal norwegian name. At first I thought I don't know anyone called that, but then I found out by searching my gmail (which my microsoft account is registered with), that this is a contact person
 in my bank that I probably mailed sometime. This changed itself back to his real nickname without my interference after a few days. I didnt interfere, because I thought that particular friend was making jokes with his display-name again (he does that sometimes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. My 2nd friend was changed to "Blizzard Entertainment". Seriously. Wtaf. This is when I caught on that something was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. My 3rd friend was today changed to "OUYA SUPPORT". Wtaf^2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm searching for explanations. It's just annoying as it is, but I'm afraid I've been hacked. Blizzard Entertainment and OUYA SUPPORT may very well be in my contacts list as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP!</p>

<p>UPDATE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after half a work day on support chat with Microsoft staff, including sharing access to my computer, we figured out the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background:</p>
<p>- I linked my Skype account to my Microsoft Live-account.</p>
<p>- I used my gmail account to create my Microsoft-account upon upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p>- I connected my accounts on a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. I don't remember which, but might be phone, gmail and skype contacts all where connected.</p>
<p>- Contacts where then cross-referenced between these sources.</p>
<p>- A lot of duplicates were created.</p>
<p>- In Outlook online, under the Peoples-tab (contacts), there is a function called "Clean up contacts". This is an automatic function which allows Outlook to search through your contacts and try to find similar entries and "Link" them in Outlook Peoples.
 It allows you too go through the list and uncheck mistakes before accepting.</p>
<p>- This "Clean up"-function worked fine to begin with, however the only thing I was told was that there was an error made in a patch server side about two-three weeks ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The server error led to wrongly "linked" contacts/people. I would guess in the vicinity of 100 contacts in my list got weird links to other entries, mostly from people or businesses I have emailed at some time in the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem:</p>
<p>- Skype has a Display name for each contact, which is editable and can be used as a nickname. Only you can see your display name for your contacts.</p>
<p>- Somehow Outlook People "push" a Display name to Skype for each of your contacts (if you have them connected, I guess). With this server error, Outlook would push a wrong name to many contacts. Even though they retainted all their original info, the wrongly
 added info sometimes took precedence, thus making my friends Display name e.g. "Blizzard Entertainment".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fix:</p>
<p>- Contact live chat for Outlook. Outlook has to see if the error has been fixed server side for your account, and there is nothing Skype can do about it.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;Go through all your contacts and remove wrong links. Has to be done 1 by 1. This might not be necessary, but there is no promise that Outlook will be able to revert all changes made.</p>

<p>Hello, I was just wondering will a 5400 rpm external drive be fast enough to run games on my Xbox One? &nbsp;Is it necessary to spend the extra money for a 7200 rpm speed?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The RAS PPPoE driver file “raspppoe.sys” found under c:/windows/system32/drivers folder seems to be the root cause of the problem. Fortunately, we can workaround the problem simply by renaming the original raspppoe.sys file to something like “raspppoe_orig.sys”
 and copying a working file from another Windows&nbsp;7 computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps !</p>

<h2>            Skype Crash</h2>
                    I have recently installed windows 10 and now have the skype app, and no way of downloading the previous version of skype apparently. The app crashes every time i get an IM and I don't receive IMs unless i close and open the app again. Is there a way to
 fix this? I have tried reinstalling it but haven't really found anything else to try via google.

<h2>            Folders always default to &#34;music&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I have a problem. I place sound files from tape recorders and&nbsp;IC recorders into a folder and for some reason the default goes to "MUSIC". With the "MUSIC" setting I have no access to "VIEW"/"DETAILS".&nbsp;To illustrate what I mean please create a new
 folder,&nbsp;open said folder and in the field right click and go to "PROPERTIES" and then left click the "CUSTOMIZE" tab and you will see "OPTIMIZE THIS FOLDER FOR:" and you will get a drop down menu that gives you a choice. Why do my folders always default to
 "MUSIC"? How can I make all future folders default to "GENERAL" and&nbsp;stay "GENERAL"????&nbsp; I don't subscribe to paid music download sites and none of my recordings have a shred of music in them. So why do my folders always default to "MUSIC"? Thank you.</p>

            <p>Sorry I'm so late with this reply. I tried your recommendation and it worked. I copied all my music CD to one of my three harddrives on my computer and I'm wondering if it set the default to "MUSIC". What happened was I began to search for a sound file that
 was created back in September&nbsp;on one of my IC Recorders and I could only identify said sound file by the date it was created so I needed to&nbsp;see the list in the folder when&nbsp;I opened it to see the date. Otherwise I had to right-click the area in the folder,
 go to "PROPERTIES" and then to the "CUSTOMIZE" tab to change the&nbsp;dropdown to&nbsp; "GENERAL ITEMS".&nbsp;Folders must be&nbsp;set to "GENERAL ITEMS" before the&nbsp;"VIEW" to each folder will list&nbsp;"DATE MODIFIED", "CREATED", "TYPE" and "SIZE" and I had to see those catagories
 in order to ascertain if the file was made before or after September. And I had created HUNDREDS of sound files from my IC Recorders and tape recorder. So thanks again. By the way, I was looking through a site a few days ago and I&nbsp;clicked on&nbsp;a link that opened
 a program that I thought was a Microsoft program but really wasn't and all three of my harddrives were wiped out. All files were gone and I had at least 20 gigabytes of important files between all three harddrives. In your opinion, is there a chance that&nbsp;I
 can&nbsp;recover those files? Amazingly, I feel very calm over my loss&nbsp;and I kick myself for storing important files on the computer I use for internet surfing. So now I'm transferring all new files to a compuetr that is in no way connected to the internet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Can you please try to reset your Xbox 360's Display settings by following the directions
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/image-on-your-tv-is-unclear" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>? Does this improve after doing so?<br />
<br />
Do you have another TV you can try this with and see if this is still blurry?</p>
        </p>
