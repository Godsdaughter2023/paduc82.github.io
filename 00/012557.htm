<h2>            setting up outlook on my LG Android</h2>
                    Setting up Outlook on my LG android cell I enter my email address .......@outlook.com; next my password; when I click "next" it comes to a box called Server address with the default s.outlook.com already entered.&nbsp; Is this the correct server address?&nbsp; I've
 checked old answers here and found m.outlook.com.&nbsp; It also asks for Domain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I leave that blank and either way I still can't connect.&nbsp; The message is "Cannot connect to server".&nbsp; I was able to connect for a year until I changed my outlook password.&nbsp;
 Now no such luck.

            Don't select the "Outlook.com" account type. Select the "Exchange" account type. You shouldn't need to enter a server but if you do, try eas.outlook.com. This is what I used.

            <p>This only works for Office 365.&nbsp; I'm running Office 2007 on my computer.&nbsp; The thing is, I was able to receive all my email on my android cell for the last year.&nbsp; Then I had to change my password in Outlook in December.&nbsp; I changed it on my computer, online
 and on my Android cell.&nbsp; The computer and online connection to Outlook works find but and haven't been able to connect to the server on my Android cell since.&nbsp; The password is correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of these fixes and solved my problem.</p>

<h3> nikki b_07  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t open .xls in excel online&#63;</h2>
                    Hi!&nbsp; I am having trouble opening an .xls spreadsheet in excel online.&nbsp; I downloaded it to my mac desktop (the only available format to download it from the software I'm using is .xls) and tried dragging it into my folder on my 365 dashboard. It saves in
 my folder, but every time I try to open it, I get an error message saying "There is something in your workbook that we don't understand. Try opening and saving the workbook in a newer version of Excel." Anyone know what's going on here?

            Hi Nikki,<br />
<br />
To check whether the issue only occurs to a specific file, please download the .xls file to the desktop, create a new workbook, copy the data in the affected file to the new workbook, upload the new workbook to your folder in the cloud, check whether the issue
 still occurs.<br />
<br />
If the issue remains, please provide the following information:<br />
1. A screenshot of the error "<em>There is something in your workbook that we don't understand. Try opening and saving the workbook in a newer version of Excel.</em>".<br />
2. In which version of Excel was that .xls file created? (click "Excel" &gt; "About Excel" to find the version.)<br />
3. Create a new workbook, save it as a .xls file, upload it to the cloud, can you open it in Excel Online?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
James&nbsp;

<p>I have a problem with PowerPoint on a Note 10.1 running Android 4.4.2</p>
<p>I switch to presentation mode and take out the S-pen. I select ink from the drop down menu at the top and start to write on the slide. I can write for a second before it stops inking and a red dot appears on the screen where my palm was (I believe this to
 be the laser pointer). The ink menu will no longer drop down from the top of the screen and I can't change the slide. All I can do is press the back button and exit presentation mode, then all the ink disappears and I have to start over. Is there a way to
 stop this happening as it's very frustrating. If I avoid touching my palm to the screen I can't write or draw as accurately and things can look a mess sometimes.</p>

            What you're seeing is PowerPoint's laser pointer option.
<p>
</p><p>In the desktop version, you turn this on/off by right-clicking the screen in slide show view and choosing Pointer Options | Laser Pointer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the iPhone, it seems to be the default pointer option.</p>
<p>You can swipe down and click the pencil icon to switch to an annotation pen or other pointer.</p>

</p><p>So if I open the presentation on a PC and turn the option off and save, it won't be an issue when I open the presentation in android?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll give it a try all the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find a way to do this in either version. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also discovered that the laser pointer appears on android when you tap and hold the screen, the problem is that it also does this when you palm is on the screen. Combine this with inking with an s pen and the whole thing comes to a grinding halt and
 nothing works except the back button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I'll have to drop PowerPoint and find an alternative that works properly.</p>

            It looks like it is signed / encrypted, possibly with IRM. The attachment (message.html) has the instructions for the recipient to use to view the message.  The user should turn off encryption.

    <title>Why do lengthy Word documents begin erratically scrolling out of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jane young  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do lengthy Word documents begin erratically scrolling out of control with my mouse scroll ball&#63;</h2>
                    Seems like whenever I have a lengthy Word document, as I maneuver the rolley ball on the top of my Mighty Mouse to activate the blue scroll button on my Word document, the document will stop scrolling, and the scrolling ball on my mouse does nothing to
 the document, in spite of it rolling properly on the mouse itself.&nbsp; The blue scroll button on the document stops responding to the mouse's rolley ball, and the scroll button will not slide up or down the document.&nbsp; The document remains on whatever page it
 stopped on with the blue scroll button fixed in position, until I click the mouse on the actual page of the document.&nbsp; Then all of a sudden the document starts scrolling wildly by itself up and down very quickly all over the place like it is possessed.&nbsp; It
 is making editing an absolute nightmare.<br />
<br />
I have deselected Fast Saves to be sure and get a Full Save each time, and no matter how many times I do a Command Save, it matters not.&nbsp; Once a document gets to be around 40 pages, using the scroll feature via the rolley ball on top of the mouse the document
 begins to act erratically.<br />
<br />
This does not happen in any other application with my mouse rolley ball.&nbsp; The Mighty Mouse is just fine with 200 page pdfs etc.&nbsp; I have no issues like this except when I am using Word, and even then the problem does not surface until the document exceeds 40
 pages or so.<br />
<br />
Note:&nbsp; If I scroll by clicking my mouse on the document's blue scroll button and drag it up or down the vertical bar on the Word document itself, I do not have quite the same issue.&nbsp; It will still misbehave at times, but nothing like with the scrolling ball
 on top of the mouse.<br />
<br />
In System Preferences the mouse scrolling speed is set to 5 bars toward the right, so it is not on the fastest setting, but it is higher than the middle setting.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?&nbsp; Thank you!<br />

            Thank you for your response Jim.&nbsp; I was told that Office 2004 is not compatible with 10.6.8 so I ended up having to buy Office 2011, since Excel also decided to misbehave along with Word.&nbsp; I installed the new Office 2011 last night.<br />
<br />
I experimented with a 175-page document, and am pleased to report that so far, the erratic scrolling issue seems to be resolved.&nbsp; No more possessed mouse!&nbsp; It appears that the 2004 application was&nbsp; not syncing well with my Mac OS.<br />

<h2>            Visio 2013 crashes during saving</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>my Visio 2013 is crashing randomly when I'm trying to save my work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Visio 2013 and save my work as "Visio 2003-2010-Drawing". The crashes are increasing. I can't find a solution or fix anywhere. Are there any suggestions for a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have got a Windows 10 and am using other products from Microsoft as a Office 365 (64 KB) version (but not Visio) as well.
</p>
<p>Visio is running in 64 Bit mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried:</p>
<p>- Repair Visio</p>
<p>- Uninstalling and installing new</p>

            <p>Hi Malte,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please confirm if the crashing issue only happens to specific Visio Drawing. We can create a new blank Visio drawing, then save it, confirm if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the issue occurred, please collect any event logs here for more information. Also try to use Visio safe mode:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click the Start button (lower-left corner) in Windows, and click <strong>
Run</strong>. In the <strong>Run</strong> box,&nbsp;&nbsp;type <strong>visio /safe</strong>, and click
<strong>OK</strong>. Confirm if the issue can be reproduced in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, </p>
<p>Winni Liang</p>

<h2>            My phone has LTE but my mom&#39;s ha.. 3g why&#63;</h2>
                    My mother and I both got the Windows 8 phone. &nbsp;We have the Nokia Lumia 822 and we live in the same house (if location matters for some reason). Anyway I noticed at the top left corner of my phone it says LTE, which I understand is the 4th edition. &nbsp;At
 the top left corner of my mom's phone it says 3g. &nbsp;Why does her phone have the older edition? &nbsp;Is there a way to upgrade her phone if that is what needs to be done?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on the forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you both have the same mobile operator? As this could be caused by the mobile network which is provided by the operator.</p>

<p>yes, we are on the same plan together. It was cheaper for me to be an add on phone on her Verizon plan so we just split the bill. I think I'm going to have to call them.</p>

            I received an email from Windows asking if I received an answer to this question. So here I am. I never got an answer to this question. We went on vacation recently so we were in the car together all day. I thought (depending on where we were) our phones
 would definitely show the same thing at the same time. What I mean is I expected when mine showed 4LTE or 3G so would her's. It was the same most of the time but not ALL the time. I don't know how that would happen but I have just accepted it. It hasn't made
 a difference in the way my service is or anything so I just don't worry about it.

</p><p>You have a location - probably a section of a Report, what will contain the printed label - that is smaller than the Subform or Textbox or some other control that you're trying to put into it. Check the sizes of the controls and of the area you're trying

<br />Why are the PST contacts not showing up as an address book even though checked?
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Hi CNealy
<br />
<br />There are a couple of possibilities to your question assuming that the contact folder in the PST file actually contain the "missing" contacts. For this response, am assuming that it does.
<br />
<br />#1 - When you state that the AB doesn't show the contacts, is the contact folder that's located in the PST file showing up in the AddressBook list of contact folders?
<br />If not sure, the verification process is as follows:
<br />
<br />a) Open The AddressBook from the Outlook ribbon
<br />b) click on the drop down list under &lt;Address Books&gt;
<br />c) does the contact folder show?
<br />OR
<br />d) with the AB open from step (a)  - click on Tools 
<br />e) check the list of folders under &lt;Custom&gt; (you'll need to check that option to scroll the entire list if it exceeds the size of the box
<br />
<br />#2 - If the contact folder is in the list (which it should be) then is it the one that opens by default? If not, change the AB setting to display it as the first folder by default (that setting is at the bottom of that window
<br />
<br />#3 - In order for a contact to be displayed in the AB, the contact item requires that a valid &lt;resolved&gt; email address or fax number exists. A &lt;resolved&gt; email address would be one where the email address in the detailed contact item is &lt;underlined&gt;. Contact items may have "unresolved" email addresses from an import that didn't do as planned as a for instance

<strong>No</strong><br />
<br />
#3 - In order for a contact to be displayed in the AB, the contact item requires that a valid &lt;resolved&gt; email address or fax number exists.
</p>
<p><strong>There are contacts displayed in the AB that do not have email addresses. Granted, this list is outdated and is not pulling from the PST. But, I just wanted to point out that there are names in the list where the contact record has no email address
 listed at all.</strong></p>

            Re: #1 - Contact folder not in AddressBook
<br />
<br />a) For the sake of completeness - where did the PST file come from if you only have IMAP accounts configured? And more specifically, how did the contact folder in the PST file get populated?
<br />
<br />b) How many contact folders are configured in this profile? You could just set the Outlook Nav Pane to show the &lt;People&gt; view but it would also be worthwhile to explicitly see which folder tree contains the contact folders. That would be done by pressing CTRL+6 to show the Outlook Nav Pane in full folder view
<br />
<br />Re: #3 - AB content
<br />
<br />Something not clear about some statements. Specifically
<br />
<br />a) From which contact folder are the contacts appearing if not from the folder in the PST file?
<br />b) As mentioned, no contact can appear in the AB unless it has &lt;either&gt; a resolved email address OR a fax number. If what you state is accurate and there are contacts in the AB that do not have either of those items then we're dealing with "corruption" somewhere along the line.
<br />c) Continuing item (b) - are you saying that there are contacts appearing the AB list that are completely blank under the DisplayName and Email address fields in the AB display? Can you provide a screenshot? Also to confirm, the AB has the &lt;Search Option&gt; set to &lt;Name Only&gt; versus &lt;More Columns&gt; - correct?

<p>Re: #1 - Contact folder not in AddressBook <br />
<br />
a) For the sake of completeness - where did the PST file come from if you only have IMAP accounts configured? And more specifically, how did the contact folder in the PST file get populated?
</p>
<p><strong>I just had my laptop rebuilt from scratch. The PST was backed up to the cloud and it was pulled down as part of the restore. The file is populated through iTunes whenever I sync my iPhone with it. Have been doing this in this manner for years, previously
 using Outlook 2013. The newly rebuilt laptop has Outlook 2016 installed.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>b) How many contact folders are configured in this profile? You could just set the Outlook Nav Pane to show the &lt;People&gt; view but it would also be worthwhile to explicitly see which folder tree contains the contact folders. That would be done by pressing
 CTRL+6 to show the Outlook Nav Pane in full folder view </p>
<p><strong>There are a little over 20 folders in the PST.&nbsp; The main folder is simply named "contacts." If I can just get that one to show up as an address book I would be good. The other folders are outliers like "Auto," "Dry Cleaners" etc.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Re: #3 - AB content <br />
<br />
Something not clear about some statements. Specifically <br />
<br />
a) From which contact folder are the contacts appearing if not from the folder in the PST file?
</p>
<p><strong>I have been unable to determine where the contacts that are in the AB are coming from. When I click on address book, I see a folder called "Contacts - myemailaddress." The data is outdated. It seems as if it was imported from an old file. When I
 click in "Search People," the search is pulling from the correct PST, which is currently set as the default data file.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>b) As mentioned, no contact can appear in the AB unless it has &lt;either&gt; a resolved email address OR a fax number. If what you state is accurate and there are contacts in the AB that do not have either of those items then we're dealing with "corruption" somewhere

<p>c) Continuing item (b) - are you saying that there are contacts appearing the AB list that are completely blank under the DisplayName and Email address fields in the AB display? Can you provide a screenshot? Also to confirm, the AB has the &lt;Search Option&gt;
 set to &lt;Name Only&gt; versus &lt;More Columns&gt; - correct? </p>
<p><strong>No, I'm saying that Name is populated, Display Name = NAME, and Email address = NULL for a few records.
</strong><strong>Since this list is outdated, I'm not sure that this is relevant. There are just a handful like this and it's because I only have a phone number for those people. And, yes the AB is set to search Name Only.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Attaching screenshots of Address Book (with example of a NULL email address), Data File account settings and email account settings. You can see that the PST is selected as the default data file. However, the AB is not displaying the Contacts from
 the PST.</strong></p>

            The 2nd screenshot you supplied shows that the contact folder being displayed is coming from the cnealy @ att.net email account. If your contacts are contained in the default contact folder (located in the default data file) - then what you need to do is set that contact folder as the default to appear when you open the AB (as described in the initial response under item #2.
<br />
<br />It's evident that (1) there are multiple contact folders in this Outlook profile or (2) you have a corrupt AB.
<br />
<br />Simple check - click on &lt;People&gt; in the Outlook Nav Pane - how many contact folders appear in that list? (asking only for confirmation purposes)
<br />
<br />The only thing that appears out of whack is the blank contact in the AB which indicates that the contacts in the &lt;cnealy @ att.net&gt; account are corrupt but that begs the question of how those contacts got populated to begin with since the contacts for an IMAP account are local only (located in a contact folder with the added words of "This Computer Only").. Am really starting to get lost in what all has transpired with all of this since this is clearly not a case of just configuring 4 IMAP accounts and adding the PST file etc. Something else went on in between.
<br />
<br />In any case, to keep this as simple as possible, the first step is to get the right contact folder to appear when the AB is opened as described in my initial reply under item #1.
<br />
<br />If this is in fact a situation where the AB is corrupted (and I'm not convinced yet that this is the case) then a simple test is to create a new profile, configure a single account and add the PST file to the profile. Set the PST file as the default, confirm again that the contacts exist there since the contact folder in the IMAP account will be completely empty at this point. Then open the AB - there would be a max of 2 contact folders in the AB drop down list and one of them will be the one from the PST file.

            I just created a new profile and set the default data file to the PST.&nbsp; The Contacts Folder is correct and is pulling from the PST. However, I'm seeing the same behavior where the PST Contacts folder is set to display in the Address book, but it does not.<br />
<br />
Also, something new that I'm seeing in this profile is that when I do a search in People, there is nothing there. It's completely empty. Creating a new profile is presenting me with the same outdated AB data that I had before. I see one folder listed in the
 AB and it's from ATT - not from the PST. So I have the same issue in which the PST Contacts will not show up in the AB. I have approximately 20 Contact Folders in my PST.<br />
<br />
Could the issue be that the original PST was created using Outlook 2010 and the data schema has changed? Grasping at straws now.<br />
<br />
Just to keep myself grounded, I'm restating the problem statement: Contacts in the PST (which is the default data file) will not appear in the AB. AB points to an outdated list associated with ATT.net account.

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Short answer to the question: No. However, it is possible that the PST file is corrupted so ignoring everything else, would strongly recommend running ScanPST on it to eliminate it as a possible issue. You may have to run ScanPST multiple times to eliminate all potential errors
<br />
<br />Now, just to make sure we're both on the same page - please allow me to restate your last post to ensure I'm understanding everything correctly
<br />
<br />#1 - You created a new profile
<br />#2 - You configured an IMAP account - was it the one from att.net?
<br />#3 - After you created the new did you set it as the default profile to be used when Outlook is opened again. If the answer is No - would explain why the problem still exists. Need to close Outlook, set the newly created profile as the 'default" and then check Outlook again
<br />#4 - The contact folder in the IMAP folder tree is empty or does it contains contacts? (Answer should be that it's empty otherwise there's another problem)
<br />
<br />Now, when you drop down the list of contact folders in the AB as shown in the screenshot - how many contact folders appear? (Answer should be two - one of those should be the contact folder in the PST file given that you've stated that the contact folder has the option set to "Show this email folder as an email addressbook).<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/79ce35f7-1eb9-4c8e-80a2-05b2e98f0623?upload=true" />

 Outlook again. <strong>I set it to ask me </strong><strong>which profile to use. When prompted, I'm using the new one for this testing. We're good there.</strong><br />

<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Just to clarify something, am not asking about what is pointing to anything. What I am asking is whether or not the contact folder in the IMAP folder tree is empty - no more no less.
<br />
<br />In this scenario, the contact folder in the IMAP folder tree should be empty so if there is data appearing in the AB for this contact folder then there is larger issue at play.
<br />
<br />At the risk of being repetitive, when you click on &lt;People&gt; - how many contact folders appear in the Nav Pane list? (Answer should be 2 for the newly created Outlook profile). Also, to ensure that the right Outlook profile is actually being used - there are two folder trees in the Outlook Nav Pane - correct? (One for the IMAP account and the other for the PST data file).
<br />
<br />Just to eliminate one other thing - would suggest doing a repair of Office (Control Panel --&gt; Programs --&gt; Click on Office 365 --&gt; Change --&gt; Select &lt;Online Repair&gt;
<br />
<br />Also, was ScanPST run on the PST file to eliminate any potential corruption issues?
<br />
<br />Will be here whenever you have time to respond :-)

<p>I can't reproduce that. When I add a comment in draft view, the document does flip back to the beginning of the document for a split second and then it returns to the location of the comment. That might take a little longer in a very large document or on
 a computer with a less capable video card, but it shouldn't take more than a second.</p>

</p><p>Make sure you have the latest updates of Office and your video driver. If that doesn't help,

<h2>            Android Word file&#58; How do I recover data &#40;text&#41; lost in such a file&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was using Android version of Word and blocks of text disappeared after I had done some keyword searches in the doc. (the cut/copy/paste functions seem to spring into gear during searches).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Android version of Word saves changes automatically without asking you, unlike the PC version. So how do I recover or undelete the text the app deleted? The file is closed and is saved in my phone's Documents folder (not in the Cloud)</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note: I noticed the data destruction when re-opening the file. The "history" option in the file's dropdown menu is gray-shaded).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Geoffux,<br />
<br />
Do you login to your Microsoft Account when using Word on your mobile device? If yes, saved documents are stored to your OneDrive folder.<br />
<br />
If not and your account has set to Autosave, there's no way you could recover the document as it overwrites the file automatically.<br />
<br />
If you have desired features in android, you can submit a feedback using the in-app. Simply go to Settings &gt; Send feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For any other concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

 left this option out?</p>

<p>My previous nokia's haven't had a light sensor but my current galaxy s has one and you have the option to turn the sensor off so the screen stays at a constant brightness......not altering everytime you expose it to different light conditions. I would welcome
 the addition of this option to the C7 if possible through a firmware update.........I could then start using it. At the moment the constant dimming/brightening of the screen drives me nuts so I wont use it :smileysad:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Same goes for me.</p>
<p>The display is amazing for itself, but when watching videos while not exactly sitting in the sun, the brightness goes down and the colors become somehow inconsistent, meaning the color tone shifts slightly to a blueish tint and the pixels seem to have varying
 brightness levels, which gives a grainy look to the picture. The grain is fixed while the picture moves, much like shifting a transparent picture over a piece of recycling paper.</p>
<p>If the brightness at least goes up to the maximum possible, the color shift vanishes and the grain becomes less visible, only in dark parts of the video.</p>
<p>Also, the most fascinating thing about OLEDs is image contrast - so why hide it? ;-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An option to disable the sensor or maybe set a fixed brightness level would enhance the quality of the display immensely! Saves me the effort to hold a keychain light in front of the sensor to boost brightness, too. But for everyday use, the sensor is still
 quite practical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks and regards,</p>
<p>ice</p>

<p>The C7 always uses it whether you set it to minimum or maximum brightness, just double-checked that. Only thing is, if you set it to minimum it never gets bright enough to be readable in bright daylight ;-)</p>

            You can find the part causing problem by simple trouble shooting.. <br />
<br />
like :<br />
<br />
1) There can not be a problem with desktop app as you have reinstalled it &amp; earlier it was workin&nbsp;&nbsp; fine.<br />
<br />
2) There might be a remote possibility ( hypothetical ) some other thing on ur desktop might be interfering with your app as you might have updated something... ( to ckeck this thing out restore to a previous point when app was working fine &amp; find out. keep
 it for last.)<br />
<br />
3) there might be a problem with cable, try to use a friend's cable with ur setup to see if really there is. In many cases even if the cable is damaged it will charge .( I SUSPECT THIS IS THE CULPRIT IN UR CASE )<br />
<br />
4) Some parts of your windows phone 8 os might have gone to a fun holiday ..... you can check it by using ur phone on a friends&nbsp; lap with similar workin setup ....<br />
<br />
trouble shoot it man !!! <br />

                    Excel 2010 Solver is ignoring constraints. I have a constraint for a range of cells &nbsp;"$E$13:$AE$13&gt;=.000001". When I run Solver, it always ends up with one of the cells in this range being 0 or negative. I'm using "GRG Nonlinear", and have tested changing
 all the parameters for this option to no avail. Is this a problem others have seen or did I find the bug?

            <p>To give a goo answer we would need to see the worksheet. Can you put a sample workbook on a fileshare site (OneDive, Dropbox...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best I can do without seeing you set up: have you looked in the Solver Options to we what you Constraint precision is set to?

            <p>I have adjusted the Constraint precision, and it makes no difference. The latest test had one of the values = -0.25350314825798, which is orders of magnitude greater than the constraint precision. I have clicked "Make Unconstrained Variables Non-Negative"
 on and off. I have clicked "Ignore Integer Constraints" on and off. I have clicked "Use Automatic Scaling" on and off. This problem has been repeated on several machines running Excel 2010.</p>

<h2>            Protected view</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just started to notice that protected view is interfering with Workbook_open routines and causing the macros to fail or not load the system add-in used within a tool set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just need to state, that this was never an issue before and on the 1000's of computers, I can't set the protected view options, I can't change the trusted settings or do anything which changes the install. The excel files run in a business environment
 which I do not control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have noticed through my tests, is after I click the "Allow Edit" option, the protected view takes a long time to close down, but the macros have started to run, which is causing the problem, because it blocks the functionality until the protected
 view has fully closed. But by the time the protected view has closed it is too late and the macros have failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The macro in the Workbook_open even loads an add-in from a network location. the add-in provides the functionality for a tool set and if it doesn't load the file exits. To the user base the process must be seamless (which is was) and the user can't install
 manually or update. The add-in is updated on a regular basis, so it can't load with excel. (please note this process was fully functioning and working for the 1000's of users without issue.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>the next time the file is run, the protected view doesn't kick in (because I have run the file so it is now trusted) and everything works correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A workaround captures the protected view and closes down the file, but this is cumbersome and will trigger a lot of help calls and email / reports because the users will think its a bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to pause macro execution until the protected view has actually closed?</p>
<p>Has something changed in excel 365?</p>
<p>how has others dealt with the protected view and macro execution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel 365 running on a PC</p>
<p>PC is up to date for all drivers (I checked because some searches have mentioned drivers)</p>
<p>I develop on multiple machines, but the issue was noticed in office 365 home edition currently. In process of testing in business environment.</p>
<p>Pc is Intel I7 with 24gb ram, excel is 32bit</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for the link, but it doesn't provide any information. On reviewing the add-in status, it has been changed to inactive after the protected view. The code to install the add-in is failing due to the time the protected view is taking to close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to pause the code, but this just pauses the protected view closing. I will give the ontime code another try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>I continued to do some research and a solution was found which means the startup code need to be deferred to workbook_activate if still in protected mode. Apparently it is a known problem.</p>

<p>An outlook.com or other exchange mail account is a copy of what is on the mail server and the data is on that mail server</p>
